         for other employment. Last session the number-reached forty or more, and it cost $70 a week

        <p>Mr FOULKE offered the following, under the benign influence of the spirit of reform:</p>
        <floatingText>
         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Resolved, That the Senate of Indiana is in full accord with the declarations contained
            in the late letter of Hon. Grover Cleveland to the President of the National Civil
            Service Reform League, pledging himself to the fair and honest enforcement of the civil
            service reform of 1883, and Blaring that a removal of the present incumbent from their
            Government positions, disconnect with the policy of the administration, shall not made
            during the terms for which they were appointed, for the purpose of putting in their
            places those who are in political accord with the appointing power, and declaring
            further that a due regard for the people's interest do not permit faithful party work to
            be always re warded by appointment to office, and that selections for office not
            embraced within the civil service law be based on sufficient regard as to fitness rather
            than upon persistent importunities and self-solicited recommendations. </p>
           <p>Resolved, That in the impartial and non-partisan enforcement of these principles the
            President-elect will have the earnest support of the body, and, as we believe, of those
            whom we represent without distinction of party. </p>

        <p>Pending the roll call-</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, in explanation of his vote, when he roll was called, said: I am in favor of a
         resolution of the character of the one before the Senate, or of he sentiments expressed in
         that resolution, but can not consent to vote for it as it now stands. I object somewhat to
         the language. And as this is simply a motion for a reference of the resolution to a
         committee to report thereon at some future time, I shall vote "aye." And I want to
         congratulate Republicans that they have finally - </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (interposing):</p>
        <p>That ain't exactly an explanation of your vote, Senator. [Laughter]</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Yes, it is. [Renewed laughter.]</p>

         expressed by the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke.]</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I wish to say of the
         sentiment of civil service reform that I favor it; and if this resolution went further and
         stated, as the letter of the President-elect referred to did, it would favor the putting
         out of office all those who used their offices for partisan purposes. I should probably
         vote for it. As it is, I vote for the motion to refer. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>
        <p>And so the resolutions were referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.</p>
        <p>A message from the House of Representatives announced the readiness of that body to

        <p>On motion of Mr. MAGEE, the Senate repaired to the hall of the House, to hear the
         Governor's biennial message in Joint Convention.</p>
        <p>When the Senators had returned to their chamber - </p>

         incident to the inauguration of Governor-elect Gray, reported that they would take place at

        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing the Doorkeeper to

            <p>Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Indiana, the House concurring, does hereby
             congratulate the soldiers of the State of Indiana upon the triumphant election of

         <p>Mr. FOULKE: If this resolution was worded so as to make it refer only to General Manson,
          there would probably be no objection to it. The only thing is that the wording of the
          resolution makes it an improper thing for the Republications of the Senate to congratulate
          themselves or any one else, on the election of a Democratic candidate. He moved to refer
          the resolution to a special committee of three, where it can be amended so as to make it
          pesonally complimentary to General Manson, and then Republican Senators can vote for
          it.</p>

         occupations, has not been rewarded with steady employment nor with adequate returns. When

        <p> The general fund, at the present rate of taxation, will not be sufficient, unless it

         that unless economics can he introduced which will relieve the deficit the rate of taxation
         will have to be somewhat increased or a sufficient sum borrowed to meet the exigency. In
         the event that a loan shall be made, provision should be simultaneously made for the
         creation a sinking fund for the discharge of the debt at an early day. But before imposing
         any additional tax or providing for any loan, every report should be made to avoid the

        <head rend="center">THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>The failure of the General Appropriation bill at the last session of the Legislature was
         not followed by the inconveniences which were by most persons anticipated and the propriety
         of my determination not to call an extra session, which would have put upon the State an
         expense, at least, of from $70 000 to $80 000, has been fully vindicated. It was found that
         laws were in force under which the State Government and all its machinery could be
         conducted, notwithstanding the failure of that bill. The General Appropriation bill, if it
         had become a law, would, indeed, have limited the expense for each object for which it made
         provision to the amount specifically appropriated therefor, whereas the laws above referred
         to did not, in most instances, contain any exact limitation upon expenditure. But the
         General Appropriation bill having passed both Houses and having been subsequently
         reconsidered for other reasons than that its provisions were not satisfactory, it was
         deemed to contain an expression of the sense of the Legislature. To guard, therefore,
         against expenditures greater than the Legislature would have sanctioned, a conference was
         held between the Treasure and auditor of State and myself, at which my determination not
         call an extra session was made known to them, and a decision was adopted, that the
         expenditures of the several objects specified in the General Appropriation bill should not
         in any instance be exceeded. The effect of this decision has been that, through an effort
         to keep down expenditures for the objects specified in that bill to the lowest practicable
         amount, the expenditures have been less than they would have been had the bill passed. An
         examination of the expenses of the executive department, especially, will show that no
         greater economy could possibly have been practiced.</p>
        <p>The failure of the General Appropriation bill, however, occasioned great inconvenience to
         two or three of the public institutions, from the fact that now law could be found under
         which sufficient provision could be made for them. The inconvenience will be doubtless be
         redressed by you by proper legislation. </p>

        <head rend="center">STATE PRINTING</head>
        <p> Your particular attention is invited to the remarks contained is the report of the
         Auditor of State, on the subject of the Stile's printing has, during the last few ears,
         increased very much in quantity, yet there has been no corresponding increase in the
         appropriation to pay for it. The law is also defective in no defining with precision what
         matter shall be printed since the law of March 13, 1875, was enacted, specifying the
         reports which shall be printed a considerable number of new offices have been created, the
         incumbents of which are required by law to make annual reports. It has been the practice to
         print these reports under a very vague and doubtful authority containing in the act
         creating the Bureau of Public Printing. The Legislature should clearly express its will
         with respect to what reports shall be printed. </p>
        <p>It is believed that some of these reports should be published but once in two years, in
         season to be printed and laid on the desks of members at the meetings of the Legislature in
         regular session. Other reports, allowed to be printed annually might properly be limited in
         length and restricted in topics, at least in the years following the regular session. In
         this way a very considerable and prudent saving of expense might be effected. </p>
        <p>The Legislature should require a paper of better quality to be used in printing most of
         the reports than the law now requires. The paper used is by no means equal to paper
         generally used in other States of like wealth and advancement.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the Legislature at its last session failed to make an appropriation for
         the Public Printer, the present contractor, Mr. W. B. Burford, has printed the reports of
         public officers, the acts of the Legislature and the House and Senate Journals, with the
         expectation that you would at the present session make a proper appropriation to pay him
         for such printing at the rates specified in the State's contract with him. The work has
         been done promptly and to the satisfaction of the officer required by law to inspect it. I
         recommend that the appropriation be made as soon as practicable.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE TREASURY.</head>
        <p>the act of 1859, "to provide a treasury system for this State" - which act is still in
         force - declared that the room then occupied, or which might thereafter be assigned to and
         occupied by the Treasurer of State, together with the sales, vaults and other necessary
         means for the security and safekeeping of the public money, should constitute the Treasury
         of the State: and that the Treasurer of the State should be required to use the Treasury so
         constituted as the sole place for the deposit and safekeeping of the State's moneys; and
         the Auditor and Treasurer were required, under the direction of the Governor to provide
         such additional locks, safes and vaults as might render the public funds absolutely secure
         against fire and burglars, and "appropriation" was thereby made "of such money as may be
         necessary to obtain the same" </p>
        <p>During the last summer many articles appeared in the public press charging that the
         Treasurer did not keep the public funds in the safe or vaults of the Treasury, and urging
         that if, as was alleged, the safe or vaults were insecure, the Governor should require the
         Auditor and Treasurer to provide such additional locks, safes, and vaults as were
         contemplated in the act above cited. If the appropriation to which I have referred was a
         continuing one, available whenever the safe or vaults were it secure, the duty of the
         Governor to require the Auditor and Treasurer to provide additional locks, sales, and
         vaults was clear. It had, however,for many years been notorious that the safe and vaults
         were insecure, yet no requirement of this sort had been made by any of my predecessors. It
         not appearing obvious, therefore, from the statue that the appropriation was a permanent
         one, I inferred that it had not so been regarded by my predecessors as being so, and might
         not be so regarded by the Courts. I decided, however, when the question was urged, to take
         the opinion of the Attorney General. After a careful examination, he advised me that the
         appropriation was still available. I then appointed two highly competent experts, belong to
         different political parties, to examine the sales and vaults and to report whether they
         were secure after a careful examination, they reported that they were not secure either
         against fire or burglars. I thereupon addressed a letter the Auditor and Treasurer,
         informing them of the result of the examination, and requiring them to provide such locks,
         safes, and vaults as would render the Treasury secure in both these respects.</p>
        <pb n="24" xml:id="VAA8558-22-024"/>
        <p>They, however, decided not to comply with the requirement. As the statue, with respect to
         the availability of the appropriation is not entirely clear; as a requirement similar to
         the one I made had not been made by any of my predecessors; and as a proceeding against
         these officers by mandate could not, in all likelihood, be prosecuted to a conclusion
         before the present meeting of the Legislature, I decided to abstain from legal proceedings,
         and to refer the matter to you for such action as you might deem appropriate.</p>
        <p>The safe and vaults are without doubt insecure. Their known insecurity has for many years
         furnished the excuse to Treasurers for depositing the State's moneys in banks, and for
         loaning them, it is believed, to individuals. No matter what political party has been in
         power, the public moneys have thus been disposed of. Repeatedly, when the Legislature has
         been in session, the fact of such misappropration has been publicly stated in debates in
         the two houses. That such a usage should be allowed is unjust to the taxpayers, and not
         creditable to the State. That if it is long tolerated a great loss of the State's money
         will sometime occur, can not be doubted. Yet that the public moneys, so long as they are
         deposited by prudent Treasurers in banks, or loaned in private individuals, are not less
         secure than they would be if kept to the safe and vault now provided for them, is
         undeniable. </p>
        <p>The Treasury law, as it now is, furnished no protection for the Treasury except in so far
         as it requires the Treasurer to give a bond with sureties for the safe keeping of the
         State's moneys. Yet though at certain seasons of each year he has nearly $2,000,000 of
         money in his hands, the bond given by him is in the sum of $150,000 only. </p>
        <p>The legal provision for an examination, under direction of the Governor, of the books,
         etc., of the Treasurer is predicated upon the supposition that a suitable vault and safe
         have been provided for the custody of the State's moneys. The means afforded for an
         examination, under the Governor's direction, are absurdly insufficient. The The statue
         provides that is shall be his duty, when ever the law, or, in his opinion, the public
         interest requires it to appoint some competent and trustworthy accountant "of the highest
         ability and skill" to make an examination of the assets and effects, books, claims,
         vouchers, etc., which are or should be in the Treasury, but it enjoins that the accountant
         shall not be paid more than $3 a day for his services. The services of no accountant of the
         highest skill and ability, nor indeed of any skill, could be procured for that sum. </p>
        <p>If you desire that the State"'s moneys shall be kept in its Treasury you should
         immediately provide for the purchase of a proper safe, and, if deemed needful, for the
         building of a vault in which the safe shall be placed; and you should greatly amend the
         requirements intended to secure their being kept in the Treasury. The expense of securing
         such a safe and constructing such a vault would be utterly trifling compared with the risk
         to which the taxpayers are exposed every year by the practice of lending the State"s
         moneys. </p>
        <p>If, however, you prefer - as I can not believe you do - that the State"s moneys shall be
         placed on general deposit in banks, or loaned to individuals, you should provide, under the
         most particular and rigorous requirements, that all interest or profit received for the use
         of them shall be into the State Treasury</p>
        <p>On account of the calamities that have recently befallen some leading banking
         institutions in Indianapolis, and the disturbance of credit, I recommend that an
         examination shall be made by persons of competent skill of the condition of the State
         Treasury. If two substantial businessmen, skill in accounts, were appointed and empowered
         to employ an experience book keeper at a competent salary, an investigation could be
         speedily made which would show whether the State"s moneys are certainly safe, and would
         tend to enlighten you respecting the legislation needed for future protection of the
         Treasury. No harm could ensue from such investigation. Much good might come from it. </p>

        <head rend="center">COMMON SCHOOLS</head>
        <p>The permanent fund for the support of th common schools of the State amounts now to
         $9,339,827.68. The increase of the furd during the last year from fines, forfeitures and
         other sources was $65,159,57. The accessions to the fund during the last ten years from the
         same sources have averaged $62 898.09 a year. The revenue derived from taxation for the
         support of schools and from interest on the school funds amounted last yeer $1,458,91.69.
         The outlay for the maitenance of schools-not including the cost of new school houses - was
         about $4,000,000. The number of public school houses in the State is 9,664. </p>
        <p>The number of children of school age, according to last year's enumeration, is 722,851.
         The number who actually attended school was 501,142. The number of children of school age
         who do not attend school, as indicated by these figures, shows the grave necessity for more
         energetic measures to secure a greater proportionate attendance A compulsory attendance
         should not exacted until all other means fail. Would not a law that would grant a
         reasonable bounty teachers who would secure the largest attendance within their districts,
         in proportion to schtool population, provide a means of judicious experiment.</p>
        <p> The condition of our public schools, except the respect above mentioned, is regarded by
         the Superintendent of Public Instruction as highly satisfactory. A uniform course of study
         and has been adopted under a recommendation made last year by a State meeting of County
         Superintendents, and no in pursuance of any requirement of law.</p>
        <p>A continual improvement is being made school architecture, including mode of heating and
         ventilation. The embellishment of school grounds by the cultivation of trees and flowers,
         through the efforts of teachers and pupils, without expense to the State, is also becoming
         general.</p>
        <p>Since the last meeting of the General Assembly, a serious calamity has befallen the State
         University by th destruction by fire of the newer of the two college buildings, and the
         valuable geological and ichthyological collections, museum and laboratory. </p>
        <p>The loss has been partially repaired by a payment made on an insurance policy, and by a
         very generous contribution by the citizens of Monroe County, But a large sum more would be
         required to replace the loss. </p>
        <p>The trustees of the University have done themselves much credit, and greatly increased
         the opportunity of the University for usefulness, by electing from within the State for its
         head Professor David S. Jordan a young man of fine natural abilities, whose attainments in
         the natural sciences have made his name favorably known to scientists of eminence in the
         United States and in Europe.</p>

        <head rend="center">STATE LIBRARY.</head>
        <p> The subject of the State Library is one that should be of special interest to the,
         Legislature. The books are provided with peculiar reference to the wants of the members and
         officers of that body and of the State officers. The selection of new books should not be
         confined to a single person, but to a competent number of persons, occupations indicate a
         possession of the knowledge which would enable them to make a judicious selection. A member
         of the Legislature needing information during the session to enlighten him with respect to
         his duties, or a State officer needing like information, should have the assistance, when
         practicable, of a librarian who can instantly refer to whatever has been written upon the
         subject which he desires to read or investigate. Librarians, in all the great libraries,
         are trained persons, chosen for the variety and freshness of their knowledge, and a faculty
         of finding, with instantaneous facility, whatever is contained in the books in their
         charge. The State Library should, in my opinion, be placed in charge of the State Board of
         Education, and that board should select the Librarian. The board was established in 1875,
         and is composed of Governor, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the President of the
         State University, the President of Purdue University, the President of the State Normal
         School, and the Superintendents of Common Schools of the three largest cities in the State.
         Its fitness for an intelligent performance of the duties will. I believe, be recognized by
         you and by the people of the State generally. </p>
        <p>The trustees of the Indiana Hospital for the Insane report the cost per capita for
         maintenance of the insane during the last fiscal year as $( )77.02 a patient, as against
         $194 a patient during the years 1882 and 1883 and as against $185 during the years 1881 and
         1882. Most of this reduction is ascribed to the reduced price of provisions during the year
         1884.</p>
        <p>At the last session of the Legislature I urged upon that body the importance of defining
         the elements that shall be regarded as making up the per capita expenses of the inmates of
         our benevolent and penal institutions, sometimes all repairs of a merely temporary
         character have been treated as a part of the per capita expenses; at other times they have
         not been so regarded; and no uniform rule of estimation has ever existed. </p>
        <p>In the Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children the salaries for officers and teachers, school
         books, medical stores and fuel and light, which are obviously a part of such expenses are
         omitted, as well as repairs of every kind. Until a fixed and intelligible rule shall have
         been prescribed by the Legislature the relative expenses per capita of maintaining the
         inmates of the several institutions can never be ascertained, and the reports will in most
         cases be misleading. I advise, on account of the difficulty in distinguishing between
         temporary and permanent repairs, that repairs shall not be taken into the account. </p>
        <p>I invite your particular attention to the gratifying statement that the experiment of the
         disuse of mecanical restraints in the treatment of the insane, begun a little more than a
         year since, has proved satisfactory, and that it is deemed to have been demonstrated that a
         Hospital for the insane can be managed without confining the inmates in cribs or tying them
         to stationary objects or using other of the milder mechanical restraints which until lately
         have been usual in American hospitals. In foreign hospitals, it is well known, the use of
         such restraints has been abandoned to a much greater extent than in the hospitals of the
         United States. Kind treatment, united with increased vigilance, has been found to be a more
         effective means for restoring the curable and governing the incurable than any of the
         severer methods.</p>
        <p>I also invite your attention to the experience of the Indiana Hospital during the last
         year in relation to the use of alcoholic liquors as a remedial agent among the insane. It
         is stated that spirituous liquors have been found detrimental to insane patients, except in
         cases of low vitality, and that even in such cases other remedies have been found to be
         preferable. At a time when facts are being diligently collected, in an impartial and
         scientific spirit, with reference to the effects of alcoholic stimulants in cases of mental
         disease, this contribution will be deemed of interest.</p>
        <p> The recommendation of the Trustees concerning the necessity of purchasing a small strip
         of ground adjacent to the northern line of the Hospital, to prevent houses in a village
         near the Hospital from being built inconveniently near to department for women, is
         commended to your earnest consideration.</p>
        <p>The extensive new building, constituting a part of the hospital, designed exclusively for
         women, was completed on the second day of June, 1884. At that time some claims for work
         done remained unsettled, and a slight question existed whether the act contemplated a
         dissolution of the Provisional Board appointed to construct the building until these claims
         were paid. But, believing that the expenses of keeping the board in existence should cease
         as soon as the building had been complete and that the trustees of the Indiana Hospital
         might properly adjust these claims board was, upon my request declared to be dissolved, in
         conformity to what I believed to be the requirement of the act by which it was created.</p>
        <p> Insanity among women is known to be largely owing to diseases peculiar to their sex. The
         delicacy which recoils from the necessary conditions of treatment is often heightened by
         the fact that reason is not at the helm to control emotion. Upon obvious grounds,
         therefore, I urged upon the Legislature at its last session the appointment in the Woman's
         Department of at least one woman physician. The Legislature neglected to consider the
         recommendation; but the good sense of the trustees made up for the neglect. A lady of
         execellent attainments in the medical profession has been appointed a physician in that,
         department, and the trustees and Superintendent unite in acknowledging the value of her
         services.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">THE ADDITIONAL HOSPITALS FOR THE INSANE.</head>
        <p> By the act passed at the last session of the General Assembly, providing for the
         building of three additional hospitals for the Insane, the Governor was required to appoint
         four commissioners (two from each of the principal political parties) who together with the
         Governor, were charged with the duty of selecting the locations of two of the hospitals,
         and of selecting the sites of the and of constructing the buildings. One of the hospitals
         was required by the terms of the act to be located in Vanderburg County. One hundred and
         sixty acres was the maximum quantity of land which the commissioners were authorized to
         purchase for the use of any one of the hospitals. The commissioners were, however,
         empowered to receive, on behalf of the State, donations of lands or other gifts. I
         appointed as commissioners, soon after the adjournment the Legislature, Messrs, John
         Robinson and DeFoe Skinner, Democrats, and Messrs. William Grose and Joseph R. Gray,
         Republicans, who accepted the appointments and immediately entered upon the discharge of
         their duties. In conducting hospitals under the system now approved, the insane are kept as
         much as possible in the open air <pb n="26" xml:id="VAA8558-22-026"/> and encouraged to
         perform manual labor. A hundred and sixty acres did not, therefore, seem as much as was
         desirable for a hospital, and to secure a larger number for each of the hospitals not
         located by the act, the commissioners give notice that in selecting a location, preferences
         would be given, other things being equal, to the county in which the most satisfactory gift
         of land was offered. Visits were made by the commissioners to the several counties in which
         a desire had been expressed for the location of a hospital, and, after careful
         consideration, locations were made in the counties of Cass and Wayne. Afterward eligible
         sites were selected on the lands chosen. In the county of Vanderburgh 160 acres of land was
         purchased. In the county of Wayne 160 acres was purchased, and 147 acres in addition was
         conveyed as a donation to the State. In the county of Cass 160 acres was purchased, and 122
         acres of adjoining land was conveyed to the State as a donation.</p>
        <p> In conformity to the requirement of the act, the commissioners, after they had selected
         the sites for the several institutions, proceeded to advertise promptly for bids for the
         construction of the buildings. For building the hospital hear Evansville the lowest bid was
         $286,585.20 for building the hospital near Richmond the lowest bid was $269,760.93; for
         building the hospital near Logansport the lowest bid was $362,802.29. These bids were
         accepted, but not until provision bad been made for considerable reduction of expense to
         the State by simplying the style of architecture, and contracts were entered into
         accordingly. To reconcile a differeace of views among the commissioners, the cottage plan
         of buildings was adopted at Richmend; a system of detached buildings connected by covered
         corridors was adopted for the hospital near Logansport, and the congregate plan of building
         was adopted for the hospital near Evansville. The foundations of the several buildings have
         been completed. A large amount of material has also been collected, and extensive
         preparations have been made for the prosecution of the work on these buildings during the
         next season.</p>
        <p>I can not too highly commend the interest taken by the commissioners in all that has been
         thus far done. But I deem it proper to add that the necessary cost of constructing
         hospitals of the capacity proposed proved to be so much larger than the commissioners had
         anticipated that, for the purpose of diminishing the cost, I personally advocated a a very
         considerable decrease of capacity. It seemed to me that it proper designs were adopted the
         capacity of the hospitals might be increased as exigencies might hereafter require. In this
         opinion the majority of the boars did not agree with me and the hospitals are being
         constructed on the large scale as at first proposed.</p>
        <p>This communication would be too much prolonged by a reference to further matters of
         interest connected with these asylums. I therefore refer you to the very clear and
         intelligent report of the commissioners, which has been printed and wil be promptly placed
         before you.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE PRISONS.</head>
        <p>The average number of prisoners at the State Prison North during the fiscal year was 547.
         At the State Prison South the average number was 570. The receipts of the Northern Prison
         from the labor of prisoners have exceeded by $7,202.71 the outly for current expenses. The
         receipts from the labor of prisoners at the Southern Prison have not equaled the outlay for
         these expenses. The deficiency in the receipts of the latter prison is ascribed to the
         inferior quality of the building used for manufacturing purposes, the want of land for
         raising garden products, and other disadvantages which do not apply to the more favored
         Northern Prison. In the State Prison South the use of the lash for the correction of
         prisoners has ceased. The enlightened and humane sentiment which requires that it shall
         cease in all our prisons should, be expressed in laws commanding its discontinuance.</p>
        <p>The reports of both prisons urge that a better provision shall be made for insane
         convicts. A suitable building should be erected at one of the prisons at which all these
         should be collected, and should receive the care and treatment required by their condition.
         To remove insane prison to the present hospitals for the insane would be injudiciouson two
         accounts; that the friends the reputable insane would not be willing to see their insane
         kindred to an institution used for the confinement of criminals, and that the proving
         prisoners insane, in order to remove them places where the opportunities for escape would
         be enhanced, would soon grow into a business.</p>
        <p>The report of the Southern Prison shows that 61 per cent. of the convicts are thirty
         years of age and under, and that 45 per cent. of the crimes of violence, for which were
         prisoners are there confined, were committed by persons not past the age twenty-five. These
         grave facts, should stimulate to even greater and more constant endeavors the efforts of
         the humane to reclaim erring children and youth, and to invade, with all good influences

        <p> In the exercise of the pardoning power I have taken great care to avoid turning loose
         upon society dangerous malefactors. I have endeavored also, to abstain from such frequency
         in exercising the power as would make the punishment of crime appear to be uncertain. With
         whatever care the power may be exercised, it is almost :ear. taip to be used, in many
         cases, with unjust, though unintended partiality. The Executive can seldom be familiar with
         all the merits of the case. He must rely, therefore, upon appearances, and pardons are too
         apt, in spite of all, the vigilance that can be exercised, to be unconscious concessions to
         the energy which has secured influential names to petitions, rather than to the actual
         merits of the applicant. To introduce a more just and impartial practice toward prisoners,
         I recommended to the Legislature, at its last session, the allowance of a much larger
         credit for good conduct upon the terms of sentences than had before been granted. The
         Legislature , adopted my recommendation, and the good effect of this legislation upon the
         discipline of the prisons has been so evident as to elicit from the wardens expressions of
         great satisfaction. The Trustees of the Northern Prison, say of this law that "it has
         proved to be a valuable moral force in the, administration of the prison," and that "the
         good effects of the law, through its encouragement to good behavior on the part of the
         convicts exceed the expectations of the most sanguine friends or the measure." The warden
         of the <pb n="27" xml:id="VAA8558-22-027"/> Southern Prison recommends that the law be
         amended so as to allow "lost time" to be restored to a prisoner where injustice seems to
         have been done him and in cases of extraordinary good behavior afterward. This
         recommendation is submitted to your careful consideration. </p>

         diminish, unjustly, the price of articles manufactured alike by free and convict labor, has
         naturally, produced complaints from free laborers injuriously affected. The two leading

         contract system, and the last Legislature having to agree upon any chance in the present
         system the Senate appointed a committee to present a suitable bill at the present session.
         Having felt interested the subject, I entered into correspondence with several persons who,
         I supposed had given it consideration, and shall transmit it to the Senate Committee, to
         whom was committed the preparation of a bill, the form of a bill prepared and sent to me by

        <p>A due regard for brevity will prevent my referring, with as particularity as I should
         desire, to the subject of the State Militia. For its efficiency and its increase in numbers
         during my administration I am greatly indebted to Adjutant General Carnahan, and to the
         members my military staff. I refer you to the Adjutant General's report with an earnest
         hope that you will give great weight to its valuable suggestions. The militia now consists
         of thirty-six companies of infantry, eight companies of artillery, ones platoon of Gatling
         guns, and one company, of cavalry. In case of a sudden outbreak of war they would be
         valuable, not only in active service, but in training raw troops for duties in the field.
         It is not creditable to the State, and is in great contrast to the course of States which
         surround us, that the State does not contribute properly toward the expenses of these
         organizations, whose help would be so useful in military emergencies.</p>
        <p> The Constitution of this State provides that "the militia shall consist of al1 able
         bodied white male persons between the ages of eighteen and forty fire years, except such as
         may be exempted by the laws of the United States or this State." Section 5,358 of the
         Revised Statutes. of 1881 also provides that "the militia shall consist of able bodied
         white male persons between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years." This retention the
         odious discrimination implied In the term "white" in the cases above cited, is a reproach

         time to express my very strong conviction that a change should be made in several
         particulars in the composition of the board. I ure especially that the professors
         agriculture and chemistry in Purdue University (our agricultural college), shall be made
         members, exofficio of the board, and required always to be present at Its annual January
         session. The freshness of their studies of subjects relating to agriculture would enliven
         and impart additional interest to the proceedings of the board, and the discussions and
         intimate association with their agricultural associates would tend to give a constantly
         practical character to their studies.</p>
        <p>As the success of the farmer depends quite as much upon a skillful adoption and use and
         care of the various kinds of agricultural machinery as it does upon on the study of soils
         and crops, and as the chief interest in the fairs centers in such machinery, a certain
         proportion of the members should be specially skilled in the mechanic arts: To prevent,
         also, a tendency of a board which elects its own members to too great a monotony of thought
         and methods, I believe it would be wise to provide that the Governor shall appoint as many
         at least as one-fourth of its members. The good which a board could accomplish, if composed
         in such a manner as to be constantly reinforced by an accession of fresh and vigorous <pb

         received. His report of the year previous, which will be laid before you, contains a
         recommendation of further amendments.</p>
        <p>The Inspector finds it impracticable to give an accurate statement of the annual coal
         production of the State, on account of the unwillingness of a number of mining companies to
         furnish prompt and reliable returns of the tonnage of their mines. The law should, in his
         opinion, make it compulsory on the owners of mines, and under a penalty, to furnish the
         Inspector the necessary statistics.</p>
        <p>Section 10 of the mining law enacts that no owner of a mine shall place in charge of any
         engine used for conveying employes into our out of a mine any but experiences, competent
         and sober engineers. Complaints are sometimes made by miners that their lives are
         jeopardized by the employment of engineers of a different character. The law does not
         define who shall be a judge of the fitness of the engineer when such objections are charged
         to exist. It is evident that the State Inspector should be me made the judge in every such
         instance. </p>
        <p>A requirement that mine "bosses" shall visit the miners at their several places of work
         at least every two days is urged by very forcible reasons.</p>
        <p>Other recommendations not less impressive are made, which I have not time here to repeat.
         I commend all suggestions of the Inspector, who is a practical miner of long experience, to
         your most careful consideration. </p>

        <p>The last Legislature, by an act approved February 15, 1883, appropriated $40,000 to be
         expended for the relief of the sufferers on the Ohio, Wabash and White Rivers in this State
         from the then recent and then prevailing floods in those streams. The Governor, Lieutenant
         Governor, Secretary of State and Auditor of State were constituted a board to disburse the
         fund. It was required that any part of the fund which might remain after affording the
         relief contemplated should be covered into the Treasury. While the officers appointed were
         engaged in distributing the sum thus appropriated, the Legislature, by an act approved
         February 27, 1863, appropriated a further sum of $60,000, "to be expended in relief from
         present and pressing needs" of persons residing along the same rivers who were destitute or
         suffering by reason of the overflow of those streams; but it was provided by this
         last-named act that none of the money appropriated by it should be used or expended except
         to furnish or purchase food, clothing, medicine, bedding and fuel with which to relieve
         present necessities, and any part of the sum remaining unexpended on the last day of April,
         1883, was required to be covered back into the Treasury. The same officers appointed to
         expend the first appropriation were direct to "to dispense and direct the application of"
         the second. The board was empowered to distribute the sum appropriated through the agency
         of any other person. The Governor was appointed President of the board, and was required,
         as far as the exigencies of the case would allow, to make a record of the expenditures, and
         to take vouchers from the persons to whom the money was paid for distribution or
         application. But it was provided that this last requirement might be disregarded if found
         in any degree to embarrass the prompt and immediate application of these fund to the relief
         of the persons to be benefited. </p>
        <p>Of the sum appropriated $36,269.29 were disbursed for relief, and $63,734.80 were covered
         back into the Treasury</p>
        <p>The limitation in the manner of relief in the last act was so specific that the needs
         specified it were regarded as having been fully provided for very soon after the act was
         passed by expenditures under the first appropriation and by private relief. A small part,
         therefore, only of the appropriation was expended. The first appropriation being broader in
         the relief allowed, a considerable part of it was applied toward the repair of houses of
         sufferers whose means were extremely limited and, to the supply in some extreme instances
         of farming implements. Great care was taken by the board in selecting persons to whom means
         were sent to be disbursed to sufferers, or to provide supplies for them, and, persons of
         sound reputation for integrity were selected. But notwithstanding diligent efforts to
         secure receipts through these persons, from the parties to whom relief was directly
         furnished. it was found practicable in only a few instances obtain them. The haste,
         confusion, and difficulties under which the application of relief was made rendered it
         impracticable in many instances to take receipts. I can not, without too much extending,
         this message give a more particular account of the disbursement of, the sums expended, and
         shall, therefore, furnish a more detailed account of it in a separate communication. In
         behalf of the board I ask now, while the transaction is recent, that some committee, in one

        <p> On the important subject of fees and salaries, I beg to repeat to you the words
         contained in my last biennial message:</p>
        <p>"For many years complaints have been made in the more populous counties that the fees
         and, salaries of officers were too large for the services performed. It has also been
         asserted that the means to which there are often strong temptations to resort, for
         obtaining nominations for officers so lucrative, and for securing, success at the polls,
         have a corrupting effect upon elections. Before the adoption of the constitutional
         amendments in 1881, the Legislature was deprived of the power of curing this supposed evil.
         In that year an amendment meet was passed which has removed the difficulty. This amendment
         was submitted to the electors of the State, and prevailed by a majority of more, than
         90,000 votes. A session of the Legislature <pb n="29" xml:id="VAA8558-22-029"/> has
         intervened )two have no intervened) since this amendment was adopted; but no act has been
         passed regulating the compensation of officers in the manner contemplated. Every officer
         should be adequately paid for his services, but it is due to the people that no greater sum
         sum shall be taken from them, in the way of fees and salaries, than is necessary to pay the
         officer a fair compensation. Officers, however, relinquish regular occupations to obtain
         these places, under an expectation that the rate of fees prevailing when they were elected
         will be substantially maintained. It might be just, therefore, to postpone the operation of
         the regulating act for a reasonable time after its passage. A bill properly regulating fees
         and salaries will require much thoughtful consideration, and should engage your attention
         at a very early peeion of the session."</p>

        <head rend="center"> SEWER FOR THE STATE REFORMATORY INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. </head>
        <p>When the last Legislature assembled a suit was pending, instituted by the United States,
         to enjoin passing of a sewage from the reformatory institution for women and girls through
         the bed of a small stream which flowed from the grounds of the reformatory along the
         southern border of the the grounds United States Arsenal. As no other means existed for
         disposing of the sewage, the granting of an injunction was known to imminent unless prompt
         and efficient measures were adopted for putting an end to the alleged nuisance, the
         Legislature passed an act placing at the disposal of the Governor $30,000, and directing to
         cause to be constructed with the least, possible delay, a good, substantial underground
         brick sewer, from a point at or near the reformatory, and to connect with sewer belonging
         to the city of Indianapolis on Washington, street, at New Jersey street: and it was
         provided that if the city should extend its sewer on Washington street to Noble or Pine
         street, the sewer for the Reformatory should terminate at the eastern end of such
         extension, and should then be connected therewith, and that the Governor should pay to the
         to aid in the extension of its said sewer, an amount equal to the cost of the construction
         of Reformatory sewer, had the latter been constructed for an equal distance on Washington
         street. Pursuant to the provisions of the act I appointed a competent civil engineer to
         superintend the work and avertised for bids for its construction. An award was made to the
         lowest bidders, who proceeded with diligence to construct the sewer from, the point of
         beginning, at the Reformatory, along the route prescribe by law to Noble street, to which
         street during the progress of the work, the city's sewer on Washington street bad been
         extended. Had the season been an ordinary one the sum appropriated would have been more
         than sufficient to pay for the work; but the excessive rains which had prevailed before the
         work was begun, and which prevailed during its progress, caused the water to filter through
         the sandy bottom of the ditch, so that pumps had to be used from the beginning to the end
         of the work, to enable the sewer to be made at all, and the lower surface of the sewer had
         to be laid on oak planks nearly its whole length. The consequence is that the expense of
         constructing the sewer has exceeded the appropriation in the sum of $3.184 69. The
         contractor have been paid in full, but there is due to the city of Indianapolis the sum
         last mentioned. So soon as I discovered that the appropriation was likely, to be exceeded,
         I should have stopped the work promptly until the Legislature could been consulted, but for
         the extreme exigency of the case, the fact that the Legislature had directed I should cause
         the sewer to be constructed with the least possible delay, and the likelihood that if the
         work were stopped the State be involved in a loss much above the excess of the cost of the
         work over the appropriation. The Legislature of 1881 had indeed appropriated $40,000 for
         the same purpose, but the work had not been done.</p>
        <p>I recommend that an appropriation be made in favor of the city of Indianapolis for the
         amount of this deficiency</p>

        <head rend="center">HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION.</head>
        <p>The exemption of a homestead of reasonable value from the demands of creditors has dot
         been found in practice in the States where such exemptions exist to interfere injuriously
         with trade. The maintenance of the home, with its endearing associations and its' promotion
         of private virtue favors the habits which promote honor and thrift in commercial
         transactions. The family established in its own homestead is one of the best supports of
         the State. In a large majority of the States homesteads of reasonable value are exempted
         from execution. I believe they should be exempted in Indiana, and I recommend the passage
         of a fair homestead bill.</p>

        <head rend="center">KANKAKEE MARSH.</head>
        <p>The last General Assembly failed to enact any law to facilitate and hasten the
         reclamation of the extensive region covered by the Kankakee marsh. The survey made under
         the direction, of the State by Professor John L. Campbell, and an able corps of assistants
         was completed so recently before that Legislature convened that no blame can attach to it
         for omitting to enact proper legislation. The large area of fertile lands now practically
         valueless by being covered or saturated with water: its convenience, by proximity and by
         extraordinary railroad facilities to the best markets, and the sanitary benefits which
         would ensue from its drainage, should be considerations of such momentous importance as to
         Induce you to spare no effort to adopt means, through wise legislation, for its early
         reclamation.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">SWAMP LANDS.</head>
        <p>By an act of Congress passed in 1850 the United States granted to the several States in
         which it then owned swamp and overflowed lands the whole of such lands as by reason of
         being swamp and overflowed were unfit for cultivation. Before a survey was made to
         determine specifically the lands included in the grant the Unite States in some, if not all
         of these States, sold to private purchasers a considerable body of these lands. Some of the
         States, by extraordinary diligence have ascertained what lands belonging to them have thus
         been sold and have recovered from the United States the price paid for them. I have strong
         reason to believe that a considerable quantity of swamp and overflowed lands in this State
         embraced in said grant have been sold by the United States. The proceeds of these sales
         properly belong to this State, and would be paid to it if the quantity were ascertained and
         a definite claim presented. The employment of an agent to attend to this business is
         confident by law to the Attorney General, who, I hope, will soon be able to recover for the
         state the sum thus justly owing. Every sum thus recovered augments the school fund and
         diminishes the burden upon taxpayers for the support of schools. </p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">RETURN OF DIRECT TAXES.</head>
        <p>Indiana paid the whole of the direct tax imposed by the Unite States upon lands of new
         inhabitants, to assist in defraying the expenses of the war for the suppression of the
         rebellion. The amount was $769,141.03. The insurrectionary States yet owe $2,725,104.61 on
         account of the direct tax levied fro the same purpose on those lands of their inhabitants.
         Non insurrectionary States and Territories also owe in the aggregate on direct taxes,
         $183,922.90. It can hardly be the policy of the Unite States, in the present overflowing
         condition of the Treasury to coerce payment of the direct taxes yet owing. Justice,
         however, to the States have paid their quota of these taxes, requires that if payment of
         the direct taxes thus owing shall no be enforced, the <pb n="30" xml:id="VAA8558-22-030"/>
         United States shall repay their quotas to the States which have paid them. I recommend
         therefore, the passage of a joint resolution by the two houses of the General Assembly,
         requesting our Representatives in Congress, and instructing our Senators to vote for a law
         releasing the inhabitants of the States in which these taxes been not been paid from all
         liability, and return to the States which paid these taxes, the full amount paid.</p>

       <p>On motion by Mr SEARS, the further reading of the journal was dispensed with.</p>
       <p>The SPEAKER: I ask the House to indulge me while I announce the standing committees of the
        House. Three of these, all of the highest importance, and upon which the character of our
        work wil largely depend - I speak of the Committees on Engrossing, on Enrolling and on
        Phraseology of Bills- It is my opinion, as well as the opinion of many others, that these
        committees should not be committees of the House,. but ,should be paid experts. However, for
        the present we are compelled to take members of the House. It is of the highest importance
        that bills should be correctly engrossed and be correctly enrolled. The phraseology of
        bills, should be in pure English, calculated to leave no doubt as to the intention of the
        legislator. You remember a few years back a bill passed requiring railroad companies to ring
        the bells and blow the whistles of locomotives on approaching railroad crossings; and, as it
        passed, in the hurry of enrolling and engrossing, you will remember it became a law that
        railroad engineers should whistle their locomotives continuously and ring the bell
        continuously within and until eighty rods past every crossing. The result was the people of
        the State were annoyed almost unbearingly, and in a sense the Legislature became the
        laughing stock of the State. That was not the fault of the Legislature, but it was the fault
        of the Committee on Engrossing. I desire that this body may be dignified, and that every
        measure may receive the respect of the people, and so I speak of this. The Speaker then

        <p>The SPEAKER said:: The Senate concurrent resolution adopted by the House this morning
         provides that the Senate and House shall proceed in a body to English's Opera House. It
         might be well enough for the House to appoint a committee to ascertain it the Senate is

         to-day upon these Thy servants just entering upon their official duties, to which the
         people bas called them. We pray the Divine blessings to rest upon the Governor and
         Lieutenant Governor, that they may be endowed with wisdom for the duties and
         responsibilities of their offices, We <pb n="34" xml:id="VAA8558-22-034"/> pray that
         prosperity so much desired may be secured to the entire people of the State. We invoke Thy
         blessing, oh God, upon the Legislative bodies. We pray for all the Senators and
         Representatives, that their actions may secure the Divine approbation and the approbation
         of the people as well. We pray for all the institutions of our State. Oh God, we invoke Thy
         blessing upon the benevolent institutions, that they, may be founded in wisdom. Let Thy
         blessings rest upon the school-houses of the State, to which are committed the training of
         the young and rising generation. We pray Thy by blessings may rest on all of the
         departments and the State institutions. We Invoke Thy blessings on the National Government.

         Oh Lord, our Strength and our Redeemer. We ask in Christ's name, amen. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said the oath of office will now be administered to Governor
         elect Gray, by Judge William E. Niblack, of the Supreme Court. </p>
        <p>Hon ISAAC P&gt; GRAY then took the following oath of office, as administered by Judge
         Niblack:</p>
        <p>"You do solemnly swear to support the Constitution, of the United States and the
         Constitution of the State of Indiana, and that you will honestly and faithfully discharge
         the duties of the office of Governor of the Stateo of lndiana, on which you are now about
         to enter. "</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor Hanna said the oath of office will now be administered to Lieutenant
         Governor-elect Manson.</p>
        <p>The oath was administered to Hon. Mahlon D. Manson by Judge Niblack in terms similar to
         that taken by Governor Gray.</p>
        <p> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HANNA said.: Gentlemen of the Convention - I now introduce to you
         your Governor, who will now deliver to you his inaugural address.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR GRAY then read his message.</p>
        <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY - To be chosen the Chief Magistrate of the State is an
         honor that impresses me deeply, and for which I am profoundly grateful. I approach the
         discharge of the labors of this high trust with a full sense of the responsibility
         involved, but with a determination to perform the duties of the office faithfully for the
         public good; and to that end I solicit your earnest co-operation and support. You are
         convened by virtue of the Constitution to enact such laws as will promote education,
         suppress vice and immorality, punish crime, protect the rights of person and property,
         advance the general welfare of the people, and the prosperity of the State, thus continuing
         to exalt the renown of this great Republic, of which Indiana is so conspicuous an integral
         part, ever mindful that a republican form of government can not endure longer than
         simplicity, integrity and economy characterize its administration and fidelity marks the
         conduct of its public servants.</p>
        <p> The political struggle, State and National through which we have recently passed stirred
         the ocean of our polities as a mighty storm, and like nature's provision for purifying her
         great bodies of water by agitation of the tempest, it is hoped will eliminate the impure
         elements from our political sea, purify the body politic, and record in the history of our
         Government once more commencement of an era of retrenchment and reform.</p>
        <p rend="center">THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT IS FOUNDED.</p>
        <p> and under which we have increased from thirteen to thirty-eight States, with large areas
         yet unorganized, create vast and varied interests which naturally divide public opinion as
         to the policy of the Government. The continuance of our national existence and prosperity,
         depending upon a wise, and honest administration of powers and duties of the Government,
         will always develop political dissensions and create party divisions, thus periodically
         arousing masses to pass judgment upon alleged evils of legislation and deviation from
         constitutional principles. A check is put upon maladministration reforms are peaceably
         brought about, the Government policy as to great political questions is directed and
         determined as a majority may demand.</p>
        <p> The present depressed condition of business and industrial interests of the country
         invites the careful attention and study of the legislator.</p>
        <p> The earth has yielded bountiful harvests, produce is abundant, all of the material for
         active business and increased prosperity seems to exist yet the last year has witnessed a
         succession of failures and disasters, among the commercial, industrial and financial
         institutions of the country that has shaken confidence and seriously disturbed the business
         interests of the whole land.</p>
        <p> The rapidity with which colossal fortunes have been accumulated in late years by private
         individuals the development and fostering of railway and other corporate bodies of vast
         wealth by Government aid ; the aggregation of the money of our country in various
         combinations of power, and the influence which they exercise in shaping legislation raises
         the inquiry whether legislation has not been too much in the interest of capital and
         wealth, and against the industrial masses of the country. </p>
        <p>The laboring classes constitute a great portion of our population, and to this element we
         largely indebted for our prosperity.</p>
        <p> They comprise in a great measure the honest, intelligent, thinking citizens, who, by
         their suffrages, seek</p>
        <p rend="center">GOOD GOVERNMENT.</p>
        <p>and rightfully demand recognition of the fact that labor is honorable, that employers
         shall not be discriminated in favor of as against the employed, and such protection under
         the law as will enable them to assert their rights when endangered by combinations of
         capital. The general welfare of the State is largely dependent upon the individual success
         of its citizens, and we should always bear in mind that the sure avenue to competence and
         wealth is not by the inflated bubble of speculation to which in the main our periodical
         disaster to trade and commerce attributable, but by honest toil, patient industry and a
         legitimate exchange of actual values and products. The passage of laws having in view the
         foregoing objects and conditions of capital and labor and the abolition of unnecessary
         taxation which eats up the fruits of labor, is in the interests of the many reforms
         demanded to give us substantial business prosperity. I am aware that these reforms can only
         be generally and successfully inaugurated through the exercise of the powers of the Federal
         Government, but do no deem it improper to refer to them upon this occasion.</p>
        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">LEGISLATION.</head>
         <p> The closing days of our biennial sessions of Legislature are invariably flooded with a
          mass of bills, all demanding immediate action. By reason of haste and confusion many of
          them become laws that are carelessly framed and not properly matured and considered. I
          sincerely hope you may be able to adopt some rule or regulation that will to some extent
          avoid the evils attending this recurring condition of legislative affairs.</p>
         <p>There is not much danger of erring on the side of too little law. The world is governed
          too much, <pb n="35" xml:id="VAA8558-22-035"/> and that was undoubtedly the principle that
          governed the framers of our Constitution in restricting the length of our legislative
          sessions. The fact that such provision has been so long sanctioned by the people without
          an effort change it, argues well its wisdom as a measure tending to serve the best
          interest of all the people of the State. Hence it becomes a matter of duty for each member
          to diligently and earnestly co-operate with his fellow members perfecting and advancing
          the most important measures, and among the most important are those needed for the support
          of the State and its Institutions. The passage of the general and specific appropriation
          bills should not be left to the uncertainties attending the closing days of the session.
          To provide for the public wants of the State is the paramount duty of legislation. To
          wisely and economically expend the means provided, is one of the most important trusts
          confided to those clothed with the management of the State affairs. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">CHANGE OF LAWS.</head>
         <p>Laws that by long existence have become familiar to the people, and the observance of
          which is established should not be changed without reasons that are cogent and
          unquestionable, as frequent alterations and amendments tend not to only confuse the public
          mind, but the learned one of attorneys, counselors and jurists are often at a loss to
          agree upon and determine what the law really is, and the practical application and
          observance of it fail by reason of its uncertainty.</p>
         <p>Changes in the law are frequently made at the solicitation of an inconsiderable portion
          of the people and in the interest of localities without being demanded by the general
          public or of general application, the principle of which is prohibited by our
          Constitution.</p>
         <p>It is to the repeal modification and judicial construction of this class of hasty and
          impracticable legislation that so much of the time and attention of our Legislature as
          well as our courts is given.</p>
         <p>The supposed necessity for a change in the law is often more imaginary than real, as
          exemplified by a comparison of the legislation of different States.</p>
         <p>In an adjoining sister State, the Constitution of which and the occupation, commence and
          business of its people being similar to our own, no stay of execution on judgment in a
          court of record is allowed. All property sold at judicial sale must bring two-thirds of
          the appraised value, and no redemption of real estate after judicial sale is permitted,
          while in Indiana we have a general provision for stay of execution on judgment of court, a
          law authorizing a provision in contracts waiving the benefit of valuation and appraisement
          laws, and a right of redemption of real estate sold on execution. Most of these laws have
          been in force for over of a century, and, notwithstanding so very different, seem to be
          well settled and accepted as satisfactory by the people of each State. To do away with the
          stay of execution and the right of redemption of our State would undoubtedly be regarded
          as oppressive by the debtor class, and the repeal of the act authorizing a waiver would be
          considered by the creditor as an impediment to the collection of debs. Upon the other hand
          the people of our sister State would undoubtedly consider a law authorizing the state of
          execution and the right redemption as unreasonably delaying the collection of debt and the
          sale of property without appraisement unjust to their debtor class. </p>
         <p>The biennial message contemplated by the Constitution, touching the condition of the
          State and recommending measures for yoru consideration, having been submitted to you at
          the opening of this session by my predecessor, it will not be expected of me to make
          specific recommendations in this address, but during the progress of your deliberations,
          whenever the occasion for such action arises, I shall communicate the same to by special
          message. </p>

        </div>
        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">ALIEN LAW.</head>
         <p>I would, however, invite your attention to the act of Legislature of 1881 giving aliens
          the right to acquire, hold and convey real estate. This is such an innovation upon the
          spirit of our institutions that the same is open to criticism, and, in my judgment,
          demands your consideration as to its necessity, and, if deemed necessary, whether the same
          is properly guarded in its provisions to prevent vast landed monopolies by aliens, which,
          by slow and insiduous growth, may become detrimental to the interests of the state.</p>

        </div>
        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">COURTS.</head>
         <p> Section 1 of. Article 7 or our State Constitution provides that "The Judicial power of
          the State shall be vested in a Supreme Court, in Circuit Courts and in such other courts
          as the General Assembly may establish." The amendment to this section adopted in 1881, by
          which its provisions were enlarged, was clearly the result of years of agitation brought
          about by the limited judicial power of the State and a demand for relief from the delays
          attending the constant increasing business of our Supreme Court.</p>
         <p>The act of the General Assembly of 1881 in creating offices of Supreme Court
          Commissioners and the re-enactment of 1882 extending their term for two years were both
          legislative expressions in response to the requirements of this amendment of the
          Constitution in 881, which was undoubtedly adopted to give the Legislature constitutional
          authority to establish other courts than the Circuit and Supreme. In order that the
          administration of justice might be facilitated and the business of the Supreme Court
          thereby lessened to such an extent as would enable it to promptly consider and decide, as
          contemplated by the Constitution, the questions appealed to it for judicial determination.
          In view of the fact that nearly 700 cases are now pending in the Supreme Court, after
          years assiduous aid of the Supreme Court Commissioners, I submit for your consideration
          the question of the expediency of continuing the commission as a means of accomplishing
          the judicial relief contemplated by the constitutional amendment, and earnestly invite
          your attention as to whether or not the practical working and effect of the commission is
          not in violation of the intendment of Sections 2 and 5 of Article 7 of the Constitution.
          It seems to me that litigants are entitled to have their matters in controversy decided by
          the court established by the Constitution. </p>
         <p>In many cases they do not get this right under the working of Rules 2 and 3 of the
          Supreme Court for the government of its commissioners. The Supreme Court under those rules
          decides causes referred by the commissioners upon the opinion rendered by the
          commissioners, and no upon the question arising in the record as required by the
          Constitution.</p>
         <p>I am aware that the Supreme Court is compelled to such a course in order to make the
          labors of the commissioners available, but it raises the query whether practically it does
          not make the Supreme Court to consist of ten judges when the Constitution says it shall
          not consist of more than five.</p>

         <head rend="center">INDIANA UNIVERSITY.</head>
         <p>The educational interests of the State are worthy of your careful consideration and
          generous support. In addition to the ordinary and necessary needs of our education
          institutions; it would not be improper for me to call your attention to the great loss
          sustained by the Indiana University since the last meeting of the Legislature. </p>
         <p>One of the main buildings, as well as the library and museum, have been destroyed by
          fire. The extent of the loss as well as the aims and hopes for the future of that
          institution is set forth in the report of the Trustees to the Governor. <pb n="36"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-036"/> The State can afford, by a reasonable appropriation, to second
          the efforts of the Trustees to build up a university as the head of our common school
          system of the State, whose position of usefulness will be extended and perpetuated. </p>

         <head rend="center">PLEURO PNEMONIA.</head>
         <p>Your attention is called to the alarming spread of pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of
          our sister States of Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky, and that our own State is threatened
          with the invasion of said disease which is said to be both con- contagious and infectious
          and has already caused disastrous results to the live stock interests of those States.
          Timely precautionary measures may to a large extent save the cattle interests of Indiana
          from the ravages of this disease. The consideration of the same is submitted for such

         <p> I am advised that several of the States which furnished regiments of volunteers in the
          Federal Army that participated in the battle of Gettysburg, have made appropriations for
          the purpose of erecting tablets to mark the position occupied by their troops in that
          great and decisive event. Indiana had five regiments of infantry Seventh, Fourteenth,
          Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twenty- seventh - and two companies of the First and sixth
          companies of the Third Cavalry that were engaged in that, perhaps the greatest battle
          fought by the Army of the Potomac, and it is eminently proper that our State should do as
          much as any other to commemorate the heroism displayed by persons in defense of the Union
          upon that memorable battlefield. I therefore invite your attention to this subject for
          such action as you may deem proper.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">WORLD'S EXPOSITION.</head>
         <p>I am informed that of the sum of 85,000 allotted to Indiana by the Commissioners of th
          World's Cotton and Industrial Exposition, now open at New Orleans, but a small portion
          remains for the further use of the Commissioners of our State. It can readily be conceived
          how inadequate this sum would be if a full representation was made of Indiana's material
          and industrial forces. It is not a display of fabrics and wealth to excite jealous rivalry
          for superiority in methods of production of resources, however varied or rich they may be
          it is a Nation's ambition, uniting the arts and sciences with a genius of advanced
          thinkers, of productions's of not only of our own country, but all nations, from which we
          as a people must be greatly benefited, for while the commerce, of older countries shall
          bring thither their troubles of handiwork, skill and products, the spirit of our
          development in agriculture, alone, will seize upon whatever may be distributed to our vast
          and almost limitless domain to the profit of American genius.</p>
         <p> While other States have deemed it wise to add to the sum thus allotted to them, if it
          shall be thought best to the further and complete showing of Indiana's productive growth,
          industrial and mineral wealth, to add to this sum in a measure sufficient only to make
          sure that we shall not fail in standing where we rightfully belong, second to no State,
          such appropriation will meet my approval.</p>
         <p>In this connection. I am gratified to address you upon a kindred subject, this mention
          of which, I feel is sufficient to commend to your approval. </p>
         <p>It is the purpose, I am informed, of the managers of this World's Exposition to invite
          the soldiers of the North and South to come together in a grand encampment in New
          Orleans.</p>
         <p> To this end, I understand, a large and sufficient, Sum has been set apart. What more
          propitious than this opportunity, the fist since the war of a national character, to
          reunite the men of a common country and ancestry, who, only a few years ago, stood arrayed
          against each other in battle? If such a meeting can be consummated in the fullness of the
          spirit that prompts the movement, our country will be closer knit.</p>
         <p>If the North shall send down her regiments of men, not as she did twenty years ago to
          the sound of martial drum beats but to the music of "piping times" of peace, nothing, I
          believe, could so firmly reunite the fellowship born of a common heritage, and which would
          give assurance, that when the soldiers of a Nation who have borne arms against each other
          can come together as brothers, strife can never again come between us as a people.</p>
         <p>If statesmen have failed to accomplish what the war assured, the duty of the hour would
          seem naturally to belong to the solders, who stood for their convictions at a cannon's
          mouth.</p>
         <p>I deem it therefore proper to call your attention to this contemplated encampment, that
          in your capacity as representatives of this State, made illustrious by the deeds of her
          soldiery, you may express such approval and take such action, as may seem to you to be
          proper, in reaffirming the pride of our people in the truth of history, that Indiana, as
          in war, so in peace and good-will to man, stands at the front.</p>
         <p>Humbly acknowledging our dependence upon the Divine Ruler of the Universe, our hearts
          should be filled with gratitude for</p>
         <p rend="center">THE BLESSING OF PEACE</p>
         <p>health and abundance. Among the great sisterhood of States the history and growth of
          Indianapolis affords an example of development and prosperity of which we may well be
          proud.</p>
         <p>In all things necessary to constitute a State, she stands to to-day one among the
          brightest in the grand galaxy of States that comprise our Federal Union. Occupying
          territory from the broad lakes of the north to the great natural thoroughness of water on
          the south, and intermediate in geographical position east and west, she will forever be
          within the pathway of commerce and travel between the oceans. Her fertile soil, varied and
          salubrious climate, great natural advantages, munificent fund and system of common schools
          and universities of learning, her liberal and elaborate system of benevolent, charitable
          and reformatory institutions, all keeping peace with the progress and demands of the age,
          offer inducements and invite the capital, enterprise and skill of other lands, and afford
          an asylum for the oppressed from abroad.</p>
         <p>Then let it be our highest ambition to further promote the prosperity and renown of the
          State, supporting unswervingly the Union and its Constitution, the wisest and best
          instrument for the government of man ever yet devised, demanding unflinchingly the
          constitutional rights and liberties of all citizens without regard to race or color;
          cultivating good will among the people of every section of our common country, so that we
          may be one people in feeling as well as in name, moving on harmoniously together to that
          destiny under God's providence awaiting us in the future - the grandest and mightiest
          Republic of free men and women upon which the sun of God has ever shone.</p>
         <p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HANNA said: I now have the pleasure to introduce to you Lieutenant
          Governor Manson.</p>
         <p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANSON said: </p>
         <p><hi rend="sc">GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE - </hi>In assuming the duties of this station, so
          generously assigned me by the people of Indiana, I am not unconscious of the grave
          responsibilities it imposes. It is easy to make mistakes - it is difficult to mend them. I
          shall greatly rely upon your fairness and complacency. They will render my yoke easy and
          my burdens light. Grave questions must occupy your attention. They will doubtless engender
          disagreements, but I believe they will be tempered with that lofty spirit of patriotic
          decorum the weight of public duty so certainly foresees and imperatively demands. You are
          the people's representatives, and I know how conscientiously and zealously you will bring
          into requisition every gift of mind and tongue to vindicate the public welfare and advance

       <p>The Senate met, Lieutenant Governor MAHLON D. MANSON in the Chair, who said the Senate
        will please come to order. [After a pause.] The session will be opened with prayer by Rev.
        Mr. Abbett.</p>
       <p>Prayers were offered by Rev. O.H.P. Abbett of this city.</p>
       <p>The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were read.</p>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">ADDITIONAL PAGES.</head>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD offered a resolution proposing the appointment of two additional pages. He
         said: This is a proposition for the creation of additional pages. The. Lieutenant Governor
         has exercised the prerogative in the appointment pages, and stated, to the Senate there
         were two, Democratic boys, if they can be so termed, were continued by him under the
         appointment of the previous President of the Senate pro tem. [Mr. Viche.] Being as strict a
         partisan as any Senator on the floor, he declared there is a limit to the question of
         patronage. There is neither Democracy or Republicanism in boys of such age. The boys named
         in the resolution were the pages of the last session of the Senate, are aware of the duties
         of the place, and know how to perform; and as a matter of justice and of precedent they
         should be continued. He felt more than ordinary interest in this matter, as his first
         service inside of legislative halls was in 1861, when the Republican party had carried the
         Union and the State of Indiana, and left the Democratic party as supinely upon its back as
         the Republican party stands to-day, yet the Hon. Cyrus M. Allen appointed him a page upon
         the floor of the House - the only Democratic page there was.</p>
        <p>Mr. MCULLOUGH raised the point of order that the proposition is not in order, because
         Section 4,981 of the Statutes provides who shall appoint the pages, and in the face of this
         law it is not in the power of the Senate to say who the pages shall be. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: It has always been the custom of the Senate, whenever it has found it
         necessary to have additional officers to employ them by resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD said he would insert the word "additional"s in the resolution. When he was
         making this amendment - </p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON said: while the Senator (Mr. Willard) is amending his
         resolution I will state that I have appointed the following pages, and in explanation I
         wish to say I was not aware of the custom as spoken of by the Senator. I would have gladly
         continued these boys in if I had not been committed to the boys I have appointed, who live
         a great way from here and they are here to take their places. Their are John T. Hanua, of
         Montgomery County; Harry Fritz, of Owen County, and Walter C. Taylor, of Crawford
         County.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD thought the precedent established two years ago by Lieutenant Governor Hanna
         one that we can well afford to continue. There is no partisanship among boys of this
         age.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, understanding the proposition is one to increase the number of pages to five,
         moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate the annual reports of the Auditor of
         State, the State Librarian and the State Statistician.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. McCULLOUGH the rules of the Senate were altered so that President of the
         Senate shall appoint the standing committees of the Senate, he having given notice thereof
         yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY offered a resolution authorizing an additional standing committee on labor, to
         consist of seven members.</p>
        <p>It was referred to the Committee on Rules.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE a committee of five were authorized upon the rules, viz., Messrs.

         prevail, shall not affect the several subjects to which said amendments are offered.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS offered a substitute for this amendment so that a motion to lay on the table
         an amendment shall not affect the original motion unless the motion to lay on the table
         shall extend to the original motion. He insisted that members may desire to lay an
         amendment on the table and not the original proposition, which can be done if his
         substitute be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY understood a motion to lay ont he table does not carry the original proposition
         if the amendment does not embody the original motion.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: In the absence of any rule, a motion to lay an amendment on the table
         carries the entire subject with it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: There was some difference of opinion in the committee as to the
         effect of laying on the table an amendment as to whether it carries the entire question on
         the table. In order to facilitate business it may be better to adopt the rule 66 of last
         session.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, signed the report of the Committee on Rules in order to make it
         unanimous. The majority usually endeavor to curtail the rights of the minority. We have to
         go back to England to obtain the best rules for the government of legislative bodes, which
         is an astounding fact. Whenever a proposition comes before a legislative body disliked by a
         member, he is most sure to try to hustle it off by moving it lay it on the table, and thus
         send it off without debate, and, in the majority of cases, without proper consideration.
         This is a mischievous motion, and as long as he represents a constituency he did not intend
         to move to lay any proposition on the table. He entered his protest against such a
         mischievous rule. These rules are not in accord with the grand common school system of
         Indiana. While indorsing their subject matter, he could not indorse the language as
         elegant.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON had found the rules to work vary during the last session.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE did not know long this rule had been in operation. It has been operation at
         least several sessions. There is a sufficient majority in the present House, under any
         conceivably condition of things, to carry out legislation in a manner satisfactory to the
         majority. Under parliamentary usage there is no occasion, with the insignificant minority
         that happens to be on this floor, to have such a rule. It is simply a gag rule, and does
         not expedite legislation. It merely cuts of debate, and keeps the minority from entering a
         protest by its votes against any legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING on this floor represented the people, and thought it very important the rule
         be made for this session. Otherwise a greater portion of the time might be spent in useless
         discussion. We came here to do business, and it is our business to legislate for the
         highest interests the State. The people expect us to pass pure laws and to attend strictly
         to business. If endless discussion is permitted an extra session will be necessitated.
         Minorities often try to render majorities odious to the people by useless discussions. He
         hoped we will not wait for the Constitution to adjourn the Legislature, but that we will do
         the business necessary before our constitution time shall expire, and that the people shall
         then say to us, "Well done, good and faithful servants.".</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE (interposing) again insisted that this rule would not expedite legislation;
         that the majority could cut off debate whenever in its opinion discussion became
         useless.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING thought it would expedite legislation. Minorities often propose amendments
         for the purpose of protracting debate, and discussions often became useless, protract the
         session and are expensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, (interposing) asked the gentleman from Hancock, (Mr. Gooding)
         who is an experienced legislator, having been in the General Assembly in 1868.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING (interrupting) No sir: in 1858. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH inquired whether parliamentary rules were made for the protection of majorities
         or minorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: They are made for the protection of both and are made more especially for
         the protection of the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: In what sense are they made for the protection of the people, if not for the
         protection of the people as represented by the minorities?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Parliamentary rules are made to aid in the enactment of good laws to promote
         the welfare and benefit of the whole people. It is unnecessary to permit useless amendments
         and endless discussion; and regarding this amendment as a very important one, he trusted it
         would be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON insisted the rule should be so that a motion to lay on the table an
         amendment should carry with it only the amendment. The amendment may be so objectionable
         the House may desire to lay it on the table and yet consider the subject matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected, and the amendment [Mr. McMullen's] agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved to strike out Rule 14, relating tot he custody of members, and whether
         such discharge shall be with or without paying fees. He denied the right of the House to
         refuse to admit a member to his seat. The majority might put the entire minority under
         arrest, and that would be a high-handed and arbitrary measure. He object to a rule that
         would place that power in the hands of a majority. It has a right to send for members and
         bring them into the House, but he denied the power of the House, under Constitution to
         prevent any country a representation on this floor. The member is admitted to his seat when
         he is sworn in, and he never loses his right ot his seat until his constitutional term
         expires or he is expelled.</p>
        <pb n="40" xml:id="VAA8558-22-040"/>
        <p>Mr. GORDON thought if the rule were stricken out it would deprive the use by the power to
         compel the attendance of members. If the gentleman's motion prevail it will not be in the
         power of the minority to compel the attendance of the majority this House. He moved to lay
         the motion on the table.</p>
        <p>Which was agreed to, on a division - affirmative 44; negative 40.</p>
        <p> Mr. KELLISON moved to strike from Rule 69 the closing words "without consent of the
         Speaker;" and insert these words: "if any member of the House makes objection to such
         admission"</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, this motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved to substitute Rule 57 of the last House for Rule 57 as reported by the
         committed. He was not willing to depart from old parliamentary rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR thought there was no reason in having bills read the second time before
         reference to committee. For the purpose of economizing time let them be referred on the
         first reading; they can then be returned to the House and read the second, third fourth and
         fifth time if necessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL did not think bills can be read too often before passing. The Constitution
         provides that bills shall be ready for the edificiation of members; that each bill shall be
         read by sections three several times etc.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING was as much in favor of that as any one. But the Constitution gives us the
         right to make rules for the government of the House. The Constitution also allows us to
         suspend that rule. It is necessary to economize time, and therefore he favored reference to
         committees after the first reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN thought it eminently just and proper to expedite business. We should have
         rules to shorten up this matter as much as possible. The committee rules would consume as
         little time as possible. Four hundred and sixty-six bills were introduced in this House two
         years ago, many on the same subject, many worthless bills, and a great many bills were upon
         local matters.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMullen: One-half the bills after reference to a committee can be consolidated with
         other bills or indefinitely postponed. If we can not do something to get rid of reading
         some of the bills, something else will have to be done, to economize time. If this rule
         prevails we can save a good deal of time. His recollection is that last session the House
         adopted some such rule.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under its
         operations - </p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>The report of the Committee on Rules, as amended, was then adopted.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I notice my name is upon the Committee of Railroads. I would like tos ay that
         I have been ever since 1875, an attorney of tow railroads in this State. Under these
         circumstances, I see that by acting upon that committee, having special reference to
         railroad legislation, I may be liable to misrepresentations, and my usefulness on such a
         committee might be somewhat impaired. Other Senators will appreciate my motives. I desire
         to take as little part in railroad legislation as I can, and I would rather not be placed
         in a position to be responsible for railroad legislatoin or its absence, and I ask the
         Senate to excuse me form serving on the committee.</p>
        <p>It was so ordered.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, stating this has name was on the Standing Committee on Temperance [as
         chairman] declared his viewers are not in accord with advanced views on the temperance
         question, and he therefore desired to be excused from service on that committee. Some
         Senator who possessed more advanced views on the question of temperance should be placed on
         the committee in his stead.</p>

        <p>Mr. MAGEE happened to know that President of the Senate had taken a great deal of time in
         arranging the Standing Committees and would have to go all over the list again if excuses
         are made and grant. Legislative experience has qualified the Senate from Marion [Mr.
         Thompson] to be at the head of that committee and he should be retained.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, also hoped the Senator would not be excused. If requests for excuses
         be come general and they be granted, we would soon have no committees. As an old adage runs
         "there is always bitter with the sweet.</p>

           <p>Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the portion of
            the Governor's message relating tot he loaning of the public funds by the State
            Treasurer to private parties and the deposit of the same in banks of this city be
            referred to a special committee of three from each House, appointed by the Chair; that
            said committee be empowered to count all moneys in the Treasury of State, to employ a
            competent expert to examine the amounts of the said Treasury, and to send for persons
            and papers generally; and that said committee report at the earliest practical moment to
            each House what disposition has been made of the public funds in the hands of the
            Treasurer, and upon what terms. </p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE said: In moving the adoption this resolution I do it, not as a mere partisan
         matter or for the purpose of clap-trap of any kind, but simply because it comes to our
         knowledge from the highest source from which we can obtain knowledge, that there has been
         an improper use of the public moneys. Speaking of a safe or vault for the keeping of the
         public funds, Governor Porter in his biennial message says : [Reads from the message,
         commencing with the words 'There can be no doubt the vaults provided for the safe keeping
         of the public moneys are insecure." etc. and continued the reading for several
         paragraphs.</p>
        <p>I make this motion in pursuance of a recommendation by the Executive, and the resolution
         is made concurrent, so that one investigation may be sufficient. If the matter be referred
         to a special Standing Committee of the Senate, and the House also refers the matter to a
         committee there, we must have two, which would not be so satisfactory as one. That members
         of this General Assembly will leave such a matter without any investigation, upon such
         information, I can not believe. I tis our paramount duty to see that the State moneys are
         safe the hands of the State Treasurer. When we receive information that they are not safe,
         and when we learn that State funds are loaned to private individuals and to banks, we know
         they are not safe. I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the statues which are
         made and provided for such cases - for the preservation of the public treasure. [Read
         Section 5,636 from the Revised Status of 1881; also Section 2,053 of the Criminal Law of
         this State; also Section 5,641, as to the authority to make this proposed investigation.]
         It appears from the language of the statue, that we not only have the authority to do it,
         but we are required to make that examination, whenever necessary. The message of the
         Governor informs us that the law has been violated. Two years ago a resolution was
         introduced here to make a similar investigation, but it was stated that there was not
         sufficient information for such a resolution, and it was disposed - probably laid on the
         table and never heard of afterward. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, interposing: The then Senator from Henry introduced a resolution two years
         ago, about two weeks after the present Treasurer of State took possession of his office,
         requiring him to account for interest if he had received any, and I moved to amend so as to
         include the outgoing Treasurer, and if I am not mistaken the gentleman from Wayne (Mr.
         Foulke), with his associates on this floor, allowed the matter to go upon the table. The
         investigation was not ordered because my amendment would have included a Republican as well
         as a Democratic Treasurer.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: My recollection differs from that of the Senator. At the last session such a
         resolution was introduced and it was not passed. As I have said, I do not introduce this
         resolution as a partisan merely: it is our duties as Senators - Democratic as well as
         Republican 0 to see to it that the moneys in the Treasury of the State are safe. If the law
         has been violated - if any sums of money have been received by the Treasurer for his own
         personal use, he should account for these funds. The proposed investigation is in the
         interest of public economy, and ought to be supported by every member of the General
         Assembly, because it is our sworn duty to see that the funds of the State are properly and
         safely kept; and it has come to our knowledge, by the highest authority, that the law in
         that respect is being violated.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR endorsed everything the Senator from Wayne [Mr. FOULKE] has said so far as
         favoring any necessary investigation of any State officer is concerned, and thought action
         should be taken on this subject: he therefore moved that it be referred to the Committee on
         Finance with instructions to report at an early day.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I object to the proposed reference to the Committee on Finance for two
         reasons. It would probably result in two separate investigations - one by the Senate and
         one by the House; and for the other reason that the Committee on Finance has not power to
         send for persons and papers nor has it the power to employ an expert to examine the
         accounts of the State Treasurer, no to count the moneys in the Treasury, and for the
         additional reason that the resolution should be a concurrent one, and the two Houses ought
         to join in the investigation.</p>
        <pb n="44" xml:id="VAA8558-22-044"/>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I think the State of Indiana, through its Representatives, can not be too
         careful in guarding the interests of the State; and I shall at the proper time favor the
         adoption of this resolution, or one of a similar character, in justice to the State
         Treasurer. I presume there is not a Senator on this floor, even the Senator who offered
         this resolution, who thinks for a moment there is any deficiency in the accounts of our
         State Treasurer. I undertake to say, Mr. President and follow Senators, there may be a
         two-fold object in this resolution. And I undertake to say further that the circumstance
         that surround the out-going Governor of the State of Indiana are not such as warned me in
         supporting this resolution at this time. For four years Mr. Porter has held the office of
         Governor, and for tow years of that time the present Treasurer of State has disbursed the
         State funds. No Senator will deny but that the statutes of the State of Indiana give the
         power to the Governor of the State, at any time, to institute an investigation of the
         condition of the Treasury of the State - in fact it is made his duty to do so. I will read
         the section of the statute bearing upon this question. [Reads Section 5,644 of the Revised
         Statues of 1881.]</p>
        <p>Now Mr. President, for tow years the Governor of the State of Indiana, with an adjoining
         office to that of the Treasurer of State, and with the knowledge he has conveyed to this
         General Assembly in his message concerning the dereliction of duty of the Treasurer of
         State, has quietly sat there and allowed this thing to go on without complying with the
         requirements of the statute. I am informed that he has had no business connection with the
         Treasurer of State; that he has not gone into the Treasurer's office to inquire into the
         condition of the Treasury, or for any other purpose except to draw his salary as Governor
         of the State of Indiana. In view of the statue and of the character of the language of the
         Governor in his message, I undertake to say it is no doing justice to the Treasurer of the
         State for the Governor to make such an allusion to the Treasurer of State has he did in his
         biennial message. And I undertake to say it is the duty of the General Assembly, if it
         believes there is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Treasurer of State, o
         investigate the matter; but, air, in view of the fact that the Governor of the State has
         quietly sat by for two years and has not complied with the language of the statue to make
         an investigation, as was his duty, I am opposed to the passage of the resolution and move
         it be indefinitely postponed, and on that motion demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR desired to withdraw his motion refer to the Committee on Finane, being of
         opinion, as this is a concurrent resolution, it should not be so referred. I move it be
         made a special order for next Monday at 2 o'clock p.m., and upon that motion I demand the
         previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This motion is out of order, inasmuch as the previous question was demanded
         by the Senator from Huntington (Mr. Hilligas) on his motion to indefinitely postpone.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I withdraw my motion and second the demand made by the Senator from Laport
         [Mr. Weir] for the previous question. </p>
        <p>The Lieutenant Governor sustained the point of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR renewed his motion.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operation - </p>
        <p>The motion to postpone the further consideration of the concurrent resolution till Monday
         at 2 o'clock p.m., was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">FUNERAL OF SCHUYLER COLFAX.</head>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD offered a concurrent resolution authorizing the appointment of two Senators
         and three Representatives to attend the funeral of Ex-Vice President Colfax. He did not
         desire to be appointed to that committee, but thought it due to a citizen of Indiana who
         had been so eminent that a resolution of this kind should pass as a mark of respect to the
         memory of one who has in former years served in both branches of this General Assembly. </p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH moved to amend the resolution so that the members going shall pay their
         own expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON suggested any member could go and pay his own expenses without such an
         amendment</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I would withdraw that.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I would dislike to see it go upon the record of the Senate that with regard
         to attending the funeral of Schuyler Colfax members of a Committee of the Senate shall pay
         their own expenses. That would be a most unseemly proceeding.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER did not see why the State should pay the expenses of a few when the expenses
         of all were paid. Let all be treated alike.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY took a different view of this matter, and did not think the amendment ought to
         prevail. To appoint a committee and say the members shall go at their own expense, would be
         taking from the action all the respect intended to be shown a distinguished citizen, rather
         than see the amendment adopted he would prefer to see us all stay here and do our duty to
         the State of Indiana. There ought to be such a committee appointed out of respect to the
         people of Indiana, who have in many ways honored Mr. Colfax, and who years ago was serving
         both in this body and in the other branch of the General Assembly. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE thought one of the customs that should be observed was the paying of respect to
         honorable citizens when they die. I especially desire to see this body pay respect to the
         memory of Mr. Colfax. I have been a resident of his district all my life. The first
         political speech I ever heard was made my him. It so happened afterward that I belonged to
         a party differingly widely from him. To-day he is a dead citizen of the State of Indiana,
         and it seems to me we can not pay too much respect to the memory of a man who by his
         talents has added renown and prominence to this commonwealth. Therefore, I am in favor of
         making such an appropriation and appointing such a committee as will testify to the respect
         we have for this dead statesmen.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH: It has been the custom for legislative bodies to send committees to
         attend the funeral of distinguished men. Probably hundreds of people will go to the funeral
         of Mr. Colfax who pay their own expenses. The people have sent members of the Legislature
         here not for the purpose of attending funerals and having committees travelling over the
         country at the State''s expense and with the people's money to show respect for the honored
         dead. The resolution will put the Senate upon the record if that is what Senators desire to
         do. If there are gentlemen in this body or in the other house who desire to attend that
         funeral, if they pay their own expenses they will do no more than hundreds of other
         citizens of the state will probably do. Whatever may be said of the custom of paying the
         expenses of committees to attend funerals, it is a custom that has grown into a great abuse
         of late years, and for that reason I insist upon my motion that if a committee of the
         Senate is appointed it must be upon condition that they pay their own expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY regretted to differ with the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCollough) but could not
         see why we should narrow this down to a question of paying the expenses of a committee to
         attend the funeral of a man who has been Vice President of the United States. It is purely
         a question whether the General Assembly of Indiana, by concurrent resolution, will pay that
         respect due a dead statesmen, regardless of political proclivities, and not a question who
         shall pay the expenses or how they shall be paid.</p>
        <pb n="45" xml:id="VAA8558-22-045"/>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I am certainly astounded at the manner in which this resolution has been
         received by some members on this floor. I am aware every Senator has the right to attend
         that funeral at his own expense. I am away further that this resolution is not offered as
         an individual resolution, but of this body acting as the Senate of Indiana desirous paying
         respect to a man who has far as official position is concerned has been the most honored
         citizen of the State. I regret that the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCOLLOUGH) has thought it
         proper to introduce this penny wise and pound foolish attempt at saving an expenditure in a
         matter of this kind. I think it would be a disgrace of this body to place that amendment to
         a resolution offered as a testimonial of respect. If a committee goes, it will go not as
         individual members, but they go as representing the Senate. H say sit is not the duty of
         Senators to go around the state attending funerals; that is not for what we are sent here.
         I say in reply I never have known of a funeral of an eminent citizen of Indiana that has
         not been attended by the State officers, and I have yet to learn that they have been
         charged with a neglect of duty for paying these respects.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH (interrupting): Did you ever know of the State officers getting their
         expenses paid out of the State Treasury for attending a funeral.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: No, I never did, because they did not represent any body. If the Senate
         sends a committee to the funeral of Schuyler Colfax out of respect to his memory, they
         should do it in accordances with the customs of parliamentary assemblages. I know of no
         exception to that custom, either in Congress or in the Senate of the United States, and
         have never known an exception attempted to be made until this amendment was offered by the
         gentleman from Gibson. I trust the amendment will be voted down the resolution in its
         original form may be sent to the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I know somewhat of the history of the life and character of the late
         distinguished citizen of Indiana, Schuyler Colfax. I remember him in that history as an
         orphan boy clerking in a dry goods store in the northern part of our State. He was
         appointed Deputy Auditor of his County, and while in that position took hold of the law and
         read the text-books of that profession. We next find him engaged in the newspaper business,
         and when a young man was sent by the Whigs of Indiana as a delegate to a National
         Convention. By reason of his ability he was honored by his party, and i might say by the
         people of Indiana, from the fact that he had carved out his own way in life and rose to
         eminence by reason of his own ability. I differed with him in the past upon political
         questions, but there is a time when that difference ceases, and that is at the grave. I
         presume there is nothing political in this proposition. It is only a question of propriety.
         I shall favor the resolution of the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Willard] because I believe
         it due to the memory of this distinguished citizen of our State.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH now sent up his amendment in writing, viz: "Provided that the members of
         the committee who attend such funeral shall do so at their own expense"</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas, 10; nays, 36.</p>
        <p>The resolution was adopted by yeas, 39; nays, 8.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH in explanation of his vote when his was called, was understood to say that
         he did not see any impropriety in a committee' goign to attend the funeral of Mr. Colfax,
         and as the Senate has decided a committee shall go he should vote aye.</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
        <p>And so the resolution was adopted as originally introduced.</p>

        <p>Mr. Foulke moved to amend by adding these words, "except the portion thereof relating to

        <p>Mr. FOULKE said this is a bill wholly of local application, as was the bill introduced

         section proposed to be amended provides that any person violating the provisions of the law
         may be prosecuted before a Justice of the Peace of the town. The amendment proposed by this
         bill is that if there be no such Justice in the town, the prosecution may be had before a
         Justice of the Peace residing in the county nearest to the town. There is a town in Wayne
         County that has no Justice of the Peace within its limits. He could not conceive any
         objection to the bill and moved that constitutional vote be dispensed with that the bill
         may read three times and finally passed by the Senate now.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: What is the emergency?</p>

         was lost.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Are you afraid it will be lost again?</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE was afraid it would be crowded out</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: While there may be no objection to the bill, it may be unnecessary. He
         thought thee is a decision by the Supreme Court, in which it is held that any Justice of
         the Peace of Township is Justice of the Peace of every town in the Township.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The attorney of the town referred says he has examined the law carefully and
         can not find authority to prosecute before any Justice, there being non in his town.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 26, nays 14 - two-thirds of all the Senators elect not
         voting the affirmative.</p>

         Indiana at the World's Industrial and Cotton Exhibition at New Orleans.</p>
        <p>By Mr. THOMPSON [S. 107] to amend Section 7 of Chapter 6,135 of the Revised Statutes,
         authorizing the appointment of female moral instructors in State Prisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said great many men and women think there is but little reformation among
         convicts in our penitentiaries. There is nothing in the world that induces them to be
         grateful for the treatment they receive while in prison. There is no such thing as a
         virtuous influence exercised among prisoners under present methods of instruction. A great
         many philanthropists insist there ought to be discarded entirely from prisons all physical
         torture, and that women are better calculated to draw out the finer <pb n="50"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-050"/> feelings and nature of prisoners and impress them with a sense
         of self-respect that the opposite sex. I have had before me several persons who have served
         in the penitentiary, among them some intelligent men, and they all assure me that prisoners
         come out of confinement worse than when committed. I submit that if women were elected as
         moral instructors in our prisons it would a better tendency than anything else in bringing
         out and developing the better feeling in the breasts of prisoners and thus make of them a
         better class of citizens after being freed from restraint. I move that this bill be
         referred to the Committee on Prisons. </p>

         <p>Mr. CORY moved to refer it to the Committee on Military Affairs.</p>
         <p>Mr. BROWNING saw no reason for postponing this matter at all. I can not think there is a

         <p>Mr. PATTEN heartily concurred with the gentleman from Brown and Monroe (Mr. Browning.)
          If we are going to do anything for the soldiers now, let us vote upon it now. Soldiers who

          it.</p>
         <p>Mr. CORY did not see why we should hesitate a moment to vote for this resolution. It is

          $1,200; Deputy Auditor of State, $1,500 to $1,200; two clerks of the Superintendent of
          Public Instruction, $900 to $750; State Librarian, $1,200 to $1,000; Assistant Librarian,
          $750 to $600. Instead of $1,200 the salary of Auditors in counties of 10,000 population
          shall be $1,000a year, $5 per 100 for an additional 30,000, and $8 per 100 for all in
          excess of 40,000. The County Treasurers, the bill provides, shall receive 1 per cent. on
          the first $50,000 of taxes collected, and one-half of 1 per cent. on all over that
          amount.</p>
         <p>Mr. Helm's bill [H. R. 34] provides for the purchasing of all stationery for the use of
          county officers by the County Commissioners on sealed bids, contracts to be let to the
          lowest responsible bidder.</p>
         <p>Mr. Helm's bill [H. R. 32] proposes to amend the fish law by prescribing heavy penalties
          for fishing with gig net or drags in any of the rivers or small streams of the State of
          Indiana; also, providing for the payment of those informing upon the violators, the
          rewards to be paid by the defendant addition to fine and all costs.</p>
         <p>Mr Linsday's bill [H. R. 40] provides that every head of a family shall be entitled to
          hold a homestead of an appraised value not to exceed $1, 500 which shall be exempt from
          sale on execution, and that the personal property of any householder, to the value of
          $1,000 shall not be liable to sale for rent or any execution upon suit. However, the
          payment of wages to servants or mechanics is required.</p>
         <p>Mr. William's bill [H. R. 46] provides that telephone companies in Indiana shall not
          charge more than $3.00 per month for a single instrument, or $2.50 per instrument where
          two are used in one place, and fixing the rate for use of telephones between various
          cities in the State at fifteen cents for the first five minutes, and not exceeding five
          centers for each five minutes thereafter.</p>
         <p>Mr. Wilson's bill [H. R&gt; 46] is to provide for the erection of a Soldier's Memorial
          Hall in the Governor's Circle and Indianapolis. It proposes that a Board of Commissioners
          shall be appointed by the Governor not later than next July, to consist of two persons who
          shall have United citizens during the War of Rebellion, one who shall have served as an
          officer and one as a private, and the entire commission to be composed equally from the
          two political parties. The amount to be expended in erecting the proposed hall is limited
          to $40,000, and that sum is to be raised by a two-cent tax,</p>
         <p>Mr. Jameson's bill [H. R. 50] is to prohibit married women from becoming sureties, but
          providing that they are still to have the power of joining with their husbands in
          mortgaging their property.</p>
         <p>Mr. Schley's bill [H. R. 53] prohibits the employment of any minor under the age of
          fourteen years in any factory, manufacturing establishment, mine or mill in the State of
          Indiana; prohibits the employment of women and minors of any age more than ten hours in
          each twenty-four; prohibits any woman or minor from cleaning or repairing any belting,
          pulleys, shafting, etc., of any factory, manufacturing establishment, mill or mine, run by
          stream, water, or other motive power, while running, and making the penalty not less than
          $50 no more than $200 for each and every such offense.</p>
         <p>Mr. Smith's, of Tippecanoe, bill [H. R. 84] proposes to give authority to County
          Commissioners to build homes for orphans and indigent females in counties where ten
          persons file articles of incorporation for assuming charge of the work. The cost of the
          building shall not exceed $10,000 in each county. Child4ren may be sent to these
          charitable institutions, it is provided, for maintenance at a cost of twenty-five cents a
          day.</p>
         <p>Mr. Townsend's bill [H. R. 99] to provide for a State civil rights law, provides that
          all distinctions of race and color made in any and all of the laws of the State are hereby
          repealed, and that whenever any right, privilege, capacity, office or appointment, is or
          may be granted to, or any duty or obligation is or may be imposed upon any class of
          citizens of this State, or any persons or individual therein, the same right, privilege,
          capacity, office or appointment, duty or obligation, shall be granted to or imposed upon
          the citizens and individuals of every other class, according to the same terms, without
          reference to race, color or previous condition of servitude.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE did not understand that this report was to come in this morning. </p>
        <p>There is a minority report declared to prepare, and would endeavor to have it ready
         today.</p>

        <p>A report from the Judiciary Committee recommended the passage of a bill [S. 4] concerning
         real estate and the alienation thereof, with amendments that aliens may inherit real
         estate, but most dispose of all interest therein within five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE moved that the constitutional role be suspended that the bill may be read the
         second and third times now, and finally passed the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, objecting.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE thought every Senator was well informed of the provisions of the bill. It is
         simply a bill to prevent aliens acquiring large tracts of real estate in Indiana. There is
         plank in the Democratic platform favoring just such class of legislation, and I think the
         Republican platform has one likewise. This bill simply takes us back to where the law was
         prior to the enactment of the statute of 1881. Senators have probably formed their judgment
         as to the merits of this bill. He made this motion to expedite the business of the
         Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS favored the bill if he understood its provisions aright.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The object of the bill is to prevent aliens - those who are not
         residents of the State of Indiana and who have no filed an intention of becoming citizens
         of the United States - from holding real estate in Indiana. That has always been the policy
         of this State from its organization to 1881, but by the act of 1881 that policy was changed
         non-resident alients, whether they resided in the United States or in a foreign county, are
         allowed to acquire and hold real estate in the State of Indiana the same as a citizen
         thereof. That is law is a bad law. Under its provisions thousands of acres of real estate
         have been purchased by non-resident aliens at tax sales and sheriff's sales, and all kinds
         of sales, until it is said that non-resident aliens, by means of capital they can not
         invest profitably in foreign land, have come into this State and purchased a belt of
         country of our land in extent from Ohio to Illinois seven miles in width. I do not know how
         much they have acquired, but it is true they have acquired a great deal.</p>
        <pb n="55" xml:id="VAA8558-22-055"/>
        <p>They have acquired this great possession against the provisions of the laws of this State
         which existed previous and up to 1881. How the law of 1881 was gotten through the
         Legislature, it is not necessary for me to state on this occasion. It is sufficient to know
         that non resident aliens have come into this State and will in time create a landed estate
         here similar to the one they now have in Ireland. In the States west of us, millions of
         acres of our best lands have been bought up by aliens, and they hold it now as
         landlords.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I am not opposed to this Senator's bill; I am opposed to the
         suspension of the rules to pass ab ill through this body without knowing that the
         provisions of the bill are.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I did not understand that my distinguished namesake was against
         the bill. It was my purpose to give him information of its provisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It seems to me, under our rules, this discussion as to the merits of
         the bill is out of order.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor Manson: I was waiting for some Senator, if the Senator from Jennings
         is out of order, to call him to order.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I don't know that I am out of order.</p>
        <p>The Lieutenant Governor: I don't know whether you are or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I shall not proceed unless by consent of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Jay: While I would consent to the bill being discussed under ordinary
         circumstances, I must insist upon my point of order.</p>
        <p>The Lieutenant Governor: The Senator from Jennings will please take his seat.</p>

        <head rend="center">JUDICIAL DISTRICTS.</head>

        <p>Mr. MACY offered a resolution for the appointment of a committee of three to ascertain
         from Clerks of the Circuit Courts in the several counties the whole number of civil,
         criminal and probate cases begun, the number of estates settled nd in process of
         settlement, the number of guardianships settled and pending in each of said Courts, from
         January 1, 1881, to January 1, 1885, inclusive.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on Organization of Courts.
         The resolution is too broad to be adopted as it is. The committee would have to employ
         clerks to get this information, or have the Clerks bring it here. From districts where a
         change is desired they always come with an abundance of evidence that they are overworked.
         The evidence obtained under this resolution would be as onesided as the other.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, opposed the resolution going to the Committee on Organization of
         Courts. The information sought for by this resolution should be had so that the committee
         can act intelligently upon bills that may come before it asking relief. The resolution
         ought to be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS opposed this adoption of the resolution. If the people who desire a change in
         their districts can not furnish the committee sufficient evidence upon which the
         Legislature can give them relief, it ought to report adversely upon their bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: This information can be had at a small expense and would be important to the
         Senate. If the circuits asking to be divided are indeed overburdened we should be informed
         of the facts in the case. The Judges are paid by the State at large, and unless one has
         more work to do than the average Judge he should not be relieved.</p>
        <p> Mr. CAMPBELL of St. Joseph, asked the Senator if he would not be willing to have the
         resolution amended so as to read that the information shall be obtained from those circuits
         petitioning for a change. As the resolution reads it would involve an amount of labor
         entirely unnecessary, for a large number of circuits are not asking for a change.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: the whole subject should be considered in making changes. Ten or $15 at the
         outside would pay the expense, and then committee would have information as to the whole
         amount of labor done by every Judge.</p>
        <p>M. McCULLOUGH: How will these statements be verified.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY did not think any clerk would certify to a lie in order to get a change
         made.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Fifteen years ago our circuit was created. It has since increased to
         80,000. We have a circuit that is worked to death, and yet there are persons advocating new
         circuits that have not half the work of our circuit. Every Legislature has seen persons
         coming here from different portions of the State, and obtaining new circuits created upon
         the ex parte evidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS opposed the resolution because it incurs an expense entirely for the benefit
         of those circuits that may be asking for changes. Another objection is that the information
         will be unreliable unless made under oath. Unless the clerks are paid for the service they
         will not faithfully report from every county. The argument of the Senator from Jay confirms
         me in the idea that this resolution is wrong and the information south for unnecessary. He
         says many districts have not as much work as his district. That would be a sufficient
         reason to report adversely upon a bill for a change of a circuit having less work to do
         that his. I will move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded, and under its operations - </p>
        <p>The motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on Organization of Courts, was agreed
         to.</p>

        <head rend="center">SOLDIER'S ORPHANS HOME.</head>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON offered a concurrent resolution for the appointment of a special committee to
         consist of two Senators and three Representatives to draft and report at an early day a
         bill providing for the separation of the Soldiers's Orphans' Home and the Asylum for Feeble
         Minded Children, and for the management thereof, separate and apart and as distinct
         institutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: I consider this a very important resolution, As state in the preamble, some
         years ago a few private citizens through patriotic motives, donated as um of money for the
         purpose of erecting a home for the orphan children of soldiers of this State. The
         Legislature, for some reasons satisfactory, saw proper to consolidate that institution with
         the one for feeble minded children. Whenever a soldier has had opportunity, either in a
         public meting or in private conversation, to express his disapproval of that consolidation
         it has been done. I therefore dream it but a simple act of justice to the patriotism of the
         citizens of this State that these institutions shall be separated, and that he Soldiers'
         Orphans' Home shall be re established in pursuance of the intention of the original donors
         I hope this resolution will meet with the unanimous approval I thin it is due to the
         soldiers who have laid down their lives on the battlefield; it is due to those who died in
         prison pens and hospitals; it is due to the survivors of those soldiers and due the dignity
         of the State of Indiana that those institutions should be separated. I therefore move the
         adoption of the resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I think this resolution should go with all other similar resolutions which
         have been introduced here, to the Committee on Rules, and I make that motion. In 1879 I had
         the honor of being a member of the House of Representatives, and I well remember that the
         bill for the consolidation of these two institutions was introduced by the gentleman from
         Henry Country, where the institution was located; that it was passed by that Legislature,
         and that the consolidation took place at that time. The only change made by the Legislature
         of 1883 was a change as to the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: The point I make is the necessity for separation.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: That may be. I have not examined the question, and I do not wish to speak on
         it at this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I can not understand what the Committee on Rules has to do
         with any of the institutions of the State. I supposed that committee was appointed so
         prepare rules for the government of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: And one of its duties is to say what the standing committees of the Senate
         shall be, and what shall constitute the joint committees of the House and Senate. Every
         resolution heretofore introduced to raise a committee has been so referred.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I can see a possible propriety in referring ti to the
         Committee on Benevolent Institutions, but can see no propriety in referring it to the
         Committee on Rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I hope this resolution will not be referred to any committee. To refer to one
         committee a resolution for the appointment of another committee would seem to be an
         extraordinary proceeding. Either the committee the resolution provides for should be
         appointed or it should not, and the proper place to determine that is in the House and not
         in another committee. I think this resolution ought to pass. The origin of these two
         institutions was entirely different and the character of the inmates are entirely
         different. Why should they have been consolidated.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE interrupting: Why can't this matter be accomplished by a bill?</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: But one of the most proper ways of introducing a bill is for a committee to
         take the matter inquired about into consideration and report to the House, if a bill is
         necessary, a proper bill. And a committee would be most likely to be entitled to the
         support of the Senate than a bill introduced by any member. This proposition is one that is
         entitled to the respectful consideration of this House. No Commonwealth or Republic can or
         ought to live that is not grateful to the men who bore its flag. Gratitude consists not
         simply in granting them liberal pensions, which has been done by our Government, but also
         in providing for those they leave behind them - their widows and orphans. I suppose the
         principal cause of the consolidation was economy, which is laudable but there are points
         beyond which economy should not pass. If the orphans of soldiers must be sent to a public
         institution, and must be sent to the same one provided for feeble minded children, the
         instincts of everyone revolt at that idea. The expense of a few dollars is nothing as
         weighed in the balance with the implied disgrace to the orphans of every soldier that has
         to go to an institution where feeble minded are instructed. Why should they be under the
         same roof any more than the insane and the convict? There is not reason for it. I think the
         resolution ought to be adopted unanimously by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: While I would go as far as the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] or any other
         Senator in providing for the orphans of soldiers, as to the merit of this matter I am not
         prepared to speak and for that reason I am in doubt as to how I shall vote on this
         resolution. I am opposed to making a record with yea and nay vote upon a proposition I
         don't understand, and for the purpose of getting it out of the way so we may at the proper
         time enact a proper <pb n="57" xml:id="VAA8558-22-057"/> provision. I move to amend by
         referring this matter to the Committee on Benevolent Institutions. I am in favor of giving
         this resolution a fair and proper consideration, regardless of partisanship. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: I suggest that this resolution only proposes that the Joint Committee shall
         draft a bill - there can be no harm done by that. The method of supervision of these
         institutions of course will be reopened in the bill, but Senators on the opposite have full
         control and can take ample time in discuss the methods when reopened. Therefor I am opposed
         to the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE was no ready to vote for the resolution, for that would seem to indicate a
         pledge to stand by the action of the committee. If abuses exist, it would seem that the
         Trustees, whose worn duty it is to make annual reports to the Governor, would say something
         about them in their report. He had read the reports of the penal and reformatory
         institutions of the State, and had found no oarge against the management of these
         institutions. If it was an error to consolidate the Soldiers' Orphan Home with the Home for
         the Feeble Minded, it is an error of the party to which the distinguished Senator belongs.
         It is only from experience that we learn whether a system applied is beneficial or not. It
         is not a party measure, and the proper committee to have charge of this matter is the one
         whose duty it is to oversee the condition of the unfortunate of the State.</p>
        <p>The motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on Benevolent Institutions of the
         State was agreed to by yeas, 23; nays, 17.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I was in the
         other end of the capitol when the bill for the consolidation of these two institutions
         originated, an old Mr. Hubbard, a Quaker gentleman, examined it thoroughly, and worked
         faithfully and honestly for it, and he thought he done his whole duty in regard to it. As
         far as soldiers' orphans are concerned, there is not a man in the great State of Indiana
         to-day that will do more, according to his worth, for their benefit I. I have done as much
         - the records will bear it out - for the soldiers' widows and orphans as any man in the
         State of Indiana, and I would do it again. If there is nothing wrong in regard to it, and
         it will elevate them any more, I will vote for it as cheerfully as any man on this floor.

        <p>Mr. LINDLEY, when his name was called, said: Before I vote on this question I want a

         If this is considered a political question by the Senate I will not vote. </p>
        <p>Several Senators: "No," "No" </p>

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE, when his name was called, said: I am paired on political queititions with the
         Senator from Vigo [Mr. Schloss], who is absent. It is said this is no political question,
         but the great criterian as to whether it is or not, s to see how it is voted for. I am at
         the end of the roll call and I see Democrats without exception have voted "aye."</p>
        <p>A Senator: Oh, no; I voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: Well then thee is one exception. If any Democrats have voted - </p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON [interposing]:I submitted this resolution to the Senator from Huntington,
         [Mr. Hilligass] with whom I am impaired, and stated my intention of introducing it, and
         that it was not for political effect, and asked whether I should do it in his absence, and
         he said could vote upon it. I believe he is considered pretty good Democratic

            <p>The General Assembly of Indiana has heard with regret of the death of Hon. Schuyler
             Colfax, by which has been terminated a career that has added lustre to the Commonwealth
             and impressed itself on the history of the Nation. From a humble lad, with no aid but
             his ability and indomitable industry, he rose to many of the most exalted stations in
             public life. In the numerous trusts confided to him by the people, as a member of the
             convention which framed our present State Constitution, as Representative in Congress.

             exhibited a marked fidelity to their interests and discharged them to the acceptance of

            <p>'Resolved, That when this House adjourn this afternoon, it be until 10 o'clock Monday

           </div>
          </body>
         </floatingText>
         <p>Mr. GOODING said: I wish to inquire where Mr. Colfax will be buried. (He is informed by
          the Chair that Mr. Colfax will be buried at South Bend.) I can see no reason why this
          House should adjourn. it costs this State a thousand dollars a day to run it. We have
          already adjourned in honor the death of Schuyler Colfax. I shall oppose the motion for the
          reason that it will not add anything to the honor of Schuyler Colfax, and it will cost the
          people of the State unnecessarily at least $500, and I move to amend the resolution by
          providing that when the House adjourns at 12 o'clock Monday.</p>
         <p>The SPEAKER: The House can not say to-day when the House shall adjourn to-morrow </p>
         <p>Mr. SAYRE: I have heard several times these statements how much it cost to run this
          House, as though it cost any more to run it when it was not in session that when it when
          it was not in session than when it was. It costs just as much whether this House is in
          session or not in session. The pay of members and employes goes on just the same. It seems
          to me that ought not to be regarded this House. I hear no objection when members want to
          be excused, and nine times out of ten it is to go home to attend to their own private
          business. Members have been excused and leave anyway, and it seems to me as an additional
          mark of respect to the memory of Schuyler Colfax this resolution ought to be adopted.</p>
         <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I shall certainly favor the motion. I think it would be quite appropriate
          for this House to adjourn in honor of Mr. Colfax's memory. The Congress of the United
          States has deemed it proper to adjourn. So far as personal feeling is concerned, it shoudl
          have nothing to do with it. I differed from him politically, but he is on of Indiana' most
          distinguished sons. There is nothing to be lost by paying this tribute to his memory. I
          differ from the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) when he says the memory of Schuyler
          Colfax will not be made more illustrions. I think we will do honor ourselves and to
          Schuyler Colfax by adjourning. As I said, he is one of our most distinguished citizens -
          or hs been. It is nothing more than right and proper that we adjourn in honor to his
          memory. in the event of the death of Hon Thomas A. Hendricks, whome I believe has been
          twice elected Vice President of the United States, would we doubt for a moment the
          propriety of adjourning? I think it is necessary to pay this tribute to his memory, and i
          hope we may pay the honor due to the distinguished dead.</p>
         <p>Mr. BROWNING: I think it is due to ourselves that we take the course suggested by our
          friend from Daviess [Mr Taylor]. I think it is proper as long as the Congress of the
          United States has adjourned that we shall adjourn in honor of the memory of Schuyler
          Colfax, and if it was simply a motion to adjourn over until 10 o'clock Monday I should
          favor the motion, and why? Because leaves of absence have been granted to ten or twelve
          members. And my experience in legislation is that when these members come back next Monday
          or Tuesday they will take up as much time asking for an explanation of what we have done
          in their absence as if we adjourned over until Tuesday.</p>
         <p>Mr. GOODING: I have not opposed paying due respect to Schuyler Colfax. As I remarked in
          the first place, this House has once adjourned in honor to Schuyler Colfax. I am actuated,
          sir, by no person motives. I was personally acquainted with Schuyler Colfax, and our
          relations were friendly and cordial. It is out of no personal matter that I am opposed to
          adjourning this House, but this House has been adjourned from time to time on different
          excuses, and now this is simply an excuse to adjourn over until Monday. It is said some
          members have been excused, but business will go on the same. That is no reason for
          adjourning. It is said the Congress of the United States has adjourned. It can <pb n="60"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-060"/> adjourn on almost any occasion. They have more than sixty days
          to transact business. They can adjourn over from time to time until the business is
          transacted. We are limited to sixy days time. Every day we are in session the sooner we
          can get through with the business and adjourn. I am going upon the theory that we will
          adjourn whether the sixty days are up or not as soon as we get through the business before
          us. </p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I move that it be ordered engrossed and passed to the third reading. In
         regard to that bill, which was introduced by the Senator from Jennings [Mr. Smith], who is
         absent, I think it is a bill that no two members of the Senate would disagree upon. At
         present aliens may hold real estate in Indiana, and very large tracts of real estate are
         being purchased in some counties of this State by persons beyond the sea, who are holding
         them for speculative purposes. I take it, that it will be conceded that the land of the
         State belongs to the people of the State, or at least to the people of this country, and
         that we don't desire to have a repetition here of the same policy which is now existing
         between England and Ireland, where the land in one belongs to the landlords in the other,
         and they drain the resources of one for the benefit of a foreign community. It was
         considered by the committees unanimously that the general provisions of the bill are such

          State. I had occasion to refer to the fact that two year ago a similar resolution was
          introduced, which for some reason failed to pass. The Senator from Cass said it occurred
          in this way: That the Senator from Henry at that time introduced a resolution for an
          investigation and that he proposed to amend it so as to include the retiring Treasurer,
          but as on as we found there was to be a Republican investigated the resolution was not
          pressed. I have been unable to find in the Senate Journal the resolution, but the Brevier
          Re <pb n="62" xml:id="VAA8558-22-062"/> ports state what occurred at that time. My own
          recollection is very distinct that not by any word or vote of mine was any proposed
          Investigation of any person connected with the State offices suppressed. [Reads from
          Brevier Reports to substantiate his statement.] The resolution of two years ago was
          opposed because it came in at the heels of the session ; but this one comes in at the
          commencement of the session. If the Senator considers there was any suppression of an
          investigation last Session, the burden must rest rather upon the Senator from Cass than on
          me. I voted to suspend the rules that the resolution might be adopted, while the Senator
          from Cass voted the other way. </p>
         <p>It seems to we that this is a question upon which there should be no shirking on account
          of party lines. The Senator from Huntington (Hilligass) stated the other day that he would
          favor the adoption of this resolution at the proper time, and yet he followed that with a
          motion to postpone the resolution indefinitely. It seems to me the position of the Senator
          is not consistent. It is true at the instance of another Senator he withdrew that motion.
          If it be true that Governor Porter had neglected his duty, is that any argument for us to
          neglect ours? It is our bounden duty that we should not shift this responsibility upon the
          shoulders of anybody else. The law has given us the right and imposed upon us the duty to
          make it. </p>
         <p> McCULLOUGH: I desire to offer the following amendment to the resolution:</p>
         <floatingText>
          <body>
           <div type="resolution">
            <p>Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the portion of
             ex Governor Porter's message relating to the State Treasury be referred to a special
             committee of five from each House, to be appointed by the respective chairman thereof,
             to report by bill or otherwise what legislation, if any, is necessary with reference to
             the State Treasury, and also to report whether an investigation into the affairs of the
             State Treasury by a legislative committee is at this time probably necessary or
             proper.</p>
           </div>
          </body>
         </floatingText>
         <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: A good deal has been said about the law upon the subject of the State
          Treasury and I think much more good will come to the people of the State by a thorough
          investigation of the law on the subject than by an examination into how the books of the
          State Treasurer have been kept. I thin it is improper to appoint a committee to make the
          proposed investigation unless more knowledge comes to this body than comes to it through
          Governor Porter's message. By a law of 1859 it was made the duty of the State to provide a
          safe in which the Treasurer could keep the moneys absolutely secure. Confessedly, the
          State has not done that. The State Treasurer, according a recent opinion of the Attorney
          Genral, is absolutely responsible for every dollar of the State's money that comes into
          his hands, and he receives, perhaps, $2,000,000 per year. If burglars take it form him, or
          iby fire it is destroyed, the Treasurer is bound to return that amount of money. The State
          has never provided a safe place to keep it, and the Treasurer is compelled to hunt some
          place which, in his judgment, would be a secure place in which to keep the money of the
          State. Sec 5,644 being a part of the act of 1859 which provides that the Legislature may
          appoint a committee to investigate - in more direct terms, if possible, requires the
          Governor of the State to investigate. Now why is it the Governor of the State has not
          investigated when he says the newspapers of the State have been bothering him about it
          since 1883 (Reads from page 8 of the Governor's printed message) The statue which empowers
          him to investigate he regards as binding upon him as Governor, because that statue has
          application in a case where the State has provided a safe place for keeping the public
          moneys, which he has not done confessedly by his own message. Then, under the provision of
          that statute, the Legislation certainly is excused, for its power is given in the same
          statute and in the same section. Whether the statute is in force or not is a question of
          importance. The Governor says, in effect, it is not. That is one reason why I suggest a
          committee of investigation. If that statute does not apply to the Governor, there may be
          some quest on as to whether it applies to the State Treasurer covering money into the
          State Treasury. </p>
         <p>It is in the same act and upon condition that the State furnish a place for the safe
          keeping of the public moneys that the Treasurer is required to pay back the money he may
          receive for interest. One other among many reasons why I think there ought to be an
          investigation is that the State Treasurer has to give a bond for $150,000 while the
          Treasurer of the United States is but $10,000 for the custody of a great deal more money,
          and yet, for some reason or other, gentlemen want to ascertain if the State Treasurer has
          not been loaning out money, and hold an inquest over it. This same statue that provides
          that the State Treasurer shall not loan the State's money provides that his salary shall
          be but $3,000 per year. He handles $2,000,000 of the people's money; he gives a bond that
          puts in jeopardy his all and probably the all of every friend that goes on his bond, and
          if fire or a burglar takes the money there is no excuse; the money must be returned. It
          has been a recognized fact that the State Treasurer must take care of the public's money
          wherever he best can, and if he receives interest upon it it is to pay him for the risk he
          assumes. If it be true that the Governor is excused from acting under the present state. I
          am in favor of passing a paw which will require him to act when it has come to his
          knowledge that there are irregularities in the conduct of the State Treasurer.</p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I stand upon this resolution as I stood the other day. If there is a
          necessity for this investigation I am for it. I don't understand that the Senator from
          Wayne [Mr. Foulke] desires this to be a party question; but I am sorry to see that it <pb
           n="63" xml:id="VAA8558-22-063"/> has assumed somewhat at a party character. I see a
          disposition creeping ont to make it partisan. He say says I am in favor of the law and
          against an enforcement law. If that statement be true certainly Governor Porter stands in
          the same attitude. Here is a law requiring him to make this investigation and yet he does
          not do so. He bases his reference to the State Treasurer upon news paper reports. Why did
          he not make an investigation as the law requires? He failed to do that, and I am justified
          in saying that when the present State Treasurer then and there not to withdraw money from
          the banks of the city of Indianapolis, but to follow the precedent set by his predecessor;
          and that if he did withdraw it it would ruin the business of Indianapolis. In view of this
          advice, which I may repeat in view of the fact of this assault in the message of Governor
          Porter, it ill becomes any Senator to impugn the honesty or integrity of the Treasurer of
          the State. Therefore, I say I am in favor of the amendment to the resolution. Let this
          question be investigated to the fullest extent, and if there is a necessity for any
          additional investigation let us have it. I would be in favor of going back over a period
          of years. Let witnesses be examined. Let ex Governor Porter be summoned as to his advice
          to the Treasurer of the State, and if the law has been violated has be connived at it by
          his advice to the Treasurer, and now at the close of his administration comes in and casts
          a reflection upon the Treasurer, when he himself was a conniver at the violation of the
          law by reason of his advice to the Treasurer at the inception of this matter. That is amy
          idea, and I shall support the amendment ot the resolution. </p>
         <p>Mr. MAY: I have thoroughly investigated this matter so far as alleged irregularities by
          the State Treasurer are referred to in the Governor's message, and I have made up my mind
          that a Governor of a commonwealth like the State of Indiana ought not to come to the
          General Assembly in a message and say that we ought to investigate the most important
          office in the State without making a specific charge against the officer. What does
          Governor Porter say about the State Treasurer? He simply says that the newspapers since
          1883 have been saying that there is something wrong. If the General Assembly proposes to
          act upon newspaper charges we can investigate almost every office and everything in
          Indiana. The resolution of the Senator from Wayne goes much farther than the Governor
          himself proposes. The resolution of the Senator from Gibson is in accord with the
          recommendation of the Governor. Upon the direct question of an investigation based upon
          the Governor's message, I should not hesitate to say I would vote against investigating
          the Treasurer upon such charges as the Governor alleges because there is no specific
          charge upon which to base an investigation. I am willing to go with the Governor in his
          message and vote for a proposition that will result in necessary legislation so that an
          investigation of the Treasurer can be had at any time. For that reason I shall support the
          amendment of the Senator from Gibson.</p>
         <p>Mr. ADKISON: I would not say a word except for an insinuation that has been thrown out
          by the Senator from Huntington (Mr. Hilligass) against the conduct of Governor Porter. If
          I had no other reason for supporting the resolution of the Senator from Wayne, the
          insinuation of the Senator from Huntington would be sufficient to induce me to cast my
          vote for that resolution. The Senator from Huntington said that Governor Porter at the
          commencement of the term of office of the State Treasurer advised him to place the State's
          money in banks, and the Governor has a right to appear before investigation committee and
          be allowed the privilege of explaining. It might be true at that time it was the best
          thing to be done under the circumstances, but the changed financial condition of the
          country and the failure of a bank in this city that for thirty years was considered
          solvent is sufficient to justify the Governor in changing his mind on the subject.
          Therefore, I am opposed to the amendment and favor the resolution as originally
          introduced.</p>
         <p>Mr. DRAKE: I am opposed to the amendment offered by the Senator from Gibson. It is too
          much like a motion for continuance in a criminal case. It is conceded here that the moneys
          of the State are scattered about the tow, and the argument upon both sides seems to
          concede the established custom of the loaning of the money of the State. The proposition
          from the Senator from Wayne is to examine as to where that money is - whether or not it is
          secure, and to make sufficient guards to keep it secure. The only argument that has been
          made against that resolution is that you must not cast suspicion on Mr. Copper, the
          Treasurer of the State. The proposed amendment will go as far to cast a stigma upon Mr.
          Cooper as the original resolution, but it will not go to the extent of making a full, fair
          and free investigation of this charge. The original resolution proposes to go to the
          bottom of the imputation, and furnishes the means of doing it successfully. I therefore am
          opposed to the amendment.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: It is not my purpose to take any part in this discussion. It seems by
          quotations from the Brevier Reports read by the Senator from Wayne that I once had my say
          about this question. As the Senator from Wayne has confronted me with the record I made
          here two years ago I feel it is just to explain that the Senator from Wayne suppressed
          part of this record. The lan <pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-22-064"/> guage of the resolution
          introduced by the Senator from Henry two years ago says in so many words that the outgoing
          Treasurer of State had in his hands $700,000, which he had deposited in banks, and instead
          of turning over the actual cash he turned over individual checks and drafts. So the
          precedent, if there has been one, as all other bad, vile precedents, is sat by
          representatives of your own party. I tak eit from the reading of this report that the
          voice of the Senator in favor of reform was not heard in that direction when this very
          important resolution was under consideration. Now, I want to quote from this report. I
          want to call my distinguished friend's recollection to something that took place. (Reading
          from Brevier Reports.) The Senator who assumed to be the leader on that side wanted to
          investigate an officer who had been in office but seven days and refused to investigate an
          officer, who, in the language of the resolution, had received interest on the public funds
          of the State. </p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE (interposing): I will ask whether the record does not state that you even
          objected to the reading of the resolution, nd refused to allow the rules to be suspended
          in order that it might be introduced.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: The Senator from Wayne has brought in part of the record and another part he
          has suppressed. I admit he is in earnest in this, but when he thinks there is any Democrat
          is opposed to a thorough investigation he is clearly mistaken. We are here not as
          Democrats nor as Republicans on this question. We have the interests of the people in our
          charge, and it is our duty as well as desire to see that their interests are subserved.
          Let us examine the good faith of the Governor of the State when he calls the attention of
          the General Assembly to the State Treasurer. He says he did not hear of it till 1883, when
          it came out in the public prints. This man, who has lived in the city of Indianapolis all
          his life, who knew years ago as well as to-day, being a director of a bank in which a part
          of the State funds were deposited and from which he drew a per cent. as a stock holder -
          knew they were so deposited, yet he said in the first line of this paragraph, in referring
          to the condition of the public Treasury, in effect, if not the exact words, that it came
          to his knowledge in 1883, and upon the next page he says it came to his knowledge
          repeatedly during sessions of the Legislature. This is a simple and pureminded Governor
          who gets his information from divers, various and sundry sources and is willing to make
          charges against a man upon such a flimsy base. In December 1884, the Treasurer of State
          presented the Governor, as the law requires, a report showing the condition of the
          Treasury at that date, and I read upon this report that it was examined by the Governor
          and filed in his office. The law requires the Governor to make an examination of the State
          Treasury and he signs his name stating that it was examined by him, and when Governor
          Porter called attention to the Treasurer in the insinuating manner in which he did, he did
          not do it because he believed the Treasurer of the State was unfaithful, but because was
          desirous of injecting into his message a little of that demagogical spirit he has never
          been able to suppress either as a Governor or as a private citizen. It seems to me that
          the present system adopted in the United States Treasury might be adopted in this State
          with profit of the people.</p>
         <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: It seems to me the only question we have to determine is
          which of the two resolutions should be adopted, or rather whether the amendment of the
          Senator from Gibson is preferable to the resolution offered by the Senator from Wayne. I
          have been desirous of information that I may vote intelligently, and I had hoped some
          Senator would read the original and the amendment, and point out the difference and show
          which is the better of the two. It has been insinuated that the Governor has unfairly case
          an imputation upon the Treasurer of State by certain language in his message. If so it was
          wrong. My idea about it is, the best way is to make an investigation into the condition of
          the Treasury, and refute the imputation, if it can be so done. I would investigate whether
          the funds of the State are sufficiently secure, and if found that they are not would adopt
          such legislation as would make them more secure. If the amendment would make a more
          thorough investigation than the original resolution, I am for the amendment. I think it is
          necessary, both for the credit of the State and of the State Treasury, that an
          investigation shall be had. If it is not made and made fairly, so it will show that
          everything is secure, it will be to the discredit both of the State and the State
          Treasurer. The only question is which resolution will give opportunity for the most
          thorough investigation. I don't believe we ought to act upon ordinary rumors, but having
          gone thus far we ought all to favor a full and complete investigation; and unless the
          amendment gives more power to the proposed committee than the resolution I am opposed to
          the amendment and in favor of the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr. WEIR: Inasmuch as consideration time has been consumed, understanding the question
          to be upon the adoption of the amendment of the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCullough), I
          now demand the previous question.</p>
         <p>Subsequently this demand was withdrawn.</p>
         <p>The amendment was adopted by yeas, 28; nays, 15.</p>
         <p>The resolution as amended was also adopted.</p>

        <p>Mr. Brooks's bill [H. R 3] to fix the bond of the Treasurer of State at $1,,000,000,
         being second time - </p>
        <p> KELLISON moved to amend by striking out the words "one million" and inserting the words
         "five hundred thousand" in lieu.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. CARTWRIGHT, the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> Mr. PATTEN moved to amend by striking out the words "one million" and inserting "two
         millions."</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. McMULLEN it was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. BUTZ moved to strike out the word "12" and insert the word "20" before the word
         sureties.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON moved to amend by making the bond one million five hundred thousand.</p>
        <p>On motion it was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved that the bill be ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: If the bond is to cover the amount of money in the treasury, it should be
         large enough to cover the amount of the public moneys at any time in his hands. I think we
         should have a committee to investigate this matter; and if it is necessary to have a bond
         to cover one dollar that we should have a bond to cover the whole amount. No one ought to
         be favored by us it is our duty to look at it in that light, so that the people will be
         protected. I don't see and understand how any member can serve his constituents in this
         matter by voting for a bond of one million when the Treasurer has a larger amount coming
         into and passing through his hands. I say this bill ought not now to be engrossed. I don't
         believe that it ought to be passed under the circumstances. I think we ought to give this
         matter a fair investigation and then we will be qualified to pass upon the merits of this
         bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON suggested that there has been an expression of the House on the desire to fix
         the amount of the bond, and thought further amendments unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: The gentleman seems to think that members are rather anxious to hurry this
         bill along. For one, I am anxious to hurry it along for the reason that within the next
         twenty days the Treasurer will file his bond. Under the old law he will only be required to
         file a bond of '150,000. I want to get the bill through before he files his bond.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I am not here for the purpose of obstructing the bill. The gentleman from
         Putnam says that the sentiments of this House have been thoroughly tested. I hope that this
         bill will not be engrossed in its present form. There are other considerations to be looked
         at in the fixing of the amount of the bond. There should be the consideration of the honor
         and integrity of the person whom we elect to this office. It seems to me that it will be
         impossible almost to secure a man to make a proper bond for the larger sum proposed. Also,
         it looks to me as if he would be obliged to put himself in the hands of his bondsmen, and
         the probability would be that the office would be run by persons outside. We have had a
         bond of $150,000 for many years, and it has always been ample security.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP moved to amend by striking out the words "one million" and inserting the words

        <p>Mr. Smith's, of Perry, bill [H. R. 67] supplemental to the drainage act was read the
         second time, with a committee recommendation for its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: I move that the consideration of this bill be postponed until Wednesday at 2
         o'clock. I have stated that this bill was the same bill that passed the House to years ago
         and was vetoed by the Governor. It is nothing more than right that we should have this bill
         as vetoed from the Secretary of State. It seems to be a very innocent bill, but in fact it
         is a bill that may remove all the mill dams in the state of Indiana. We have fifteen
         splendid water-mills in Tippecanoe County, and I would dislike ex <pb n="66"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-066"/> ceedingly to be a party to a bill that would remove them. </p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells, believed that the present drainage law covered everything except the
         part on private donation. This bill might be just as well engrossed at this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON did not think anything ought to be made a special order unless it be a matter
         of emergency. I can't see that this as a matter of ordinary legislation, should be made a
         special order. It disarranges all legislation both before and after.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYER: It embidies the same feature of a bill of two years ago. That bill was vetoed
         and should be returned tot he House. He moved that the bill be recommitted to the Committee
         on Dykes and Drains without instruction.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE's bill [H. R. 72] to amend Section 7 of the Supreme Court not being read second
         time, Mr. Sayer moved to amend by inserting in the proper place the following: "And the
         clerks shall not be entitled to receive any fee whatever from any person whatever for
         making any entries by this act."</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE said: This bill ought to become a law of the State of Indiana. it will afford
         information that has long been needed. It is well known that whenever any writing is it be
         done by a public officer, even if only a name, it involves a cost ten, fifteen or twenty
         cents. I think that the fees and emoluments already provided are quite sufficient.</p>
        <p>The amendment was adopted and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>

       <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: This being the day set apart by the laws of Congress to vote
        for United States to serve for six years from the 4th of March next, and this the hour set
        by this Senate therefor, the Senator from Vigo has the floor.</p>
       <p>Mr. SCHLOSS said:</p>
       <p><hi rend="sc">Mr. PRESIDENT - </hi> The smoke of battle has been arisen from the contest
        in which we were but lately engaged, and, in the clear and healthful atmosphere of the time,
        we can overlook the entire field and with party pride and satisfaction contemplate in all
        its fullness our decisive and glorious victory.</p>
       <p>We can now look down upon our prostrate foes with a more humane pleasure, I trust, than
        that which seizes the victorious hosts of an actual warfare, even though our feelings are no
        less triumphant than those of a conquering army whose General is valiantly sustained, and
        whose position is impregnably secured. </p>
       <p>Our principles are triumphantly established, and our leader is victorious by being elected
        to the highest position in the sight of the world. In every State of the Union the suffrage
        of the Democratic party loyally aided in securing us the great object of our contest, and
        every Democratic voter, wherever he may cast his ballot, is entitled to his share of praise
        for his zeal, his ardor, and his faith.</p>
       <p>But success depends, unquestionably, upon the great States of New York and Indiana. The
        Democratic representatives of Indiana came here to-day, convened in their General Assembly,
        congratulating each other and the entire country upon the united and untiring efforts that
        accomplished this glorious result. Indiana can be signally happy in the election of her very
        distinguished citizen and statesmen, Thomas A. Hendricks, to the second place in the gift of
        the people. That his name was an element of great strength to the ticket in Indiana and
        elsewhere is so well understood as to need no repetition here. But in addition to this great
        name, Indiana has many illustrious Democrats, around some of whom it is the delight of the
        party to rally on all occasions.</p>
       <p>It is my great pleasure to-day, to name as foremost of these, our distinguished
        fellow-citizen, Daniel W. Voorhees. The integrity of his principles, the fame of his
        statesmanship, the magnetism of his presence, the eloquence of his voice: all have made him
        a figure of pride to his followers, and to all citizens of the State. This pride is so
        sincere and so universal that it is not and can not be confined to party lines; and I
        therefore know with absolute certainty that the action the General Assembly will this day
        take with reference to this distinguished statesman and leader will meet the sincere
        approval of citizens in all professions, in every calling, and in all the walks of life. It
        must not be forgotten that in the contest carried to so successful and glorious a
        consummation, one of the great objects to be attained in Indiana was that this favorite
        representative of the people should be his own successor in the Senate of the United States.
        This being borne in mind, it must never be forgotten that the Democratic candidates for the
        Legislature of this State received a total majority over their Republican opponents of
        21,000 votes. I believe that no other Democrat in the State of Indiana could have gained so
        signal, so remarkable a triumph as this. </p>
       <p>Mr. President, I regard this as the crowning moment of my life, when I present, as I now
        do, the name of Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees as again the choice of the Democracy of this State
        for the position he has so long, so faithfully and so ably occupied as the representative of
        the State of Indiana in the Senate of the United States. I have one ambition remaining after
        this, and that is to be able to give this distinguished statesmen my enthusiastic support
        when he shall become the standard bearer of the entire Democracy of the Union in a national
        contest, which shall terminate in even greater glory than has that from which we have so
        recently emerged.</p>
       <p>Mr. WILLARD said:</p>
       <p><hi rend="sc">Mr. PRESIDENT</hi> I, rise to second the nomination made by the Senator from
        Vigo.</p>
       <p>I would not, if I could, pluck a single laurel from the brown of the able Republican
        statesman whose name will be presented by the Senator from Marion, but the people of Indiana
        demand that the next Senator from this State shall be a man <pb n="68"
         xml:id="VAA8558-22-068"/> whose political principles are in accord with the advanced
        sentiments of a majority of the citizens of the United States, and therefore they demand a
        Democratic Senator. </p>
       <p>When the time arrives for a people to reach a higher plane of political morality a
        mysterious and all-pervading sentiment seems to prepare the minds of men for the coming
        change. Against this great popular impulse, the well-laid plans of skillful political
        strategists can not avail, and even the most unwilling seem to impel the change as if in
        obedience to some overruling law of human nature. It is this irresistible force of popular
        sentiment acting upon a free people which as wrought the downfall of the Republican party,
        and enabled the Democracy to wash from the sands of opportunity the gold of success.</p>
       <p>We have triumphed because the principles of the Democratic party represent, in the highest
        measure, the hopes, the desires and aspirations of the manhood of America.</p>
       <p>To have done with the enmities of the war, to have done with the feelings of sectional
        strife, to raise on high a flag which shall not be the flag of the North alone, but the
        starry flag of a Union of freemen, to secure to every man his civil and political rights, to
        save the lands of the people from the grasp of alien corporations, to whiten the seas with
        the sails of American commerce, to protect American citizens at home and abroad to have a
        true and complete reformation of the civil service to give to the people a purer and better
        administration, and to strike from the limbs of labor the chains of monopoly - that is what
        it means to be Democratic. </p>
       <p>Upon issues like these the party of the people be triumphed, and be not deceived, my
        Republican friends, we have come to stay. To the youngest man within the sound of my voice I
        say, your hair will be white as silver, your gait lagging and infirm, and your limbs
        tottering on the brink of the grave when power shall again be wrested from the giant grasp
        of Democracy. Thus to retain the fruits of our victory we must deserve the confidence of the
        people, and that confidence may best be secured by confiding the interests of the party to
        leaders who have been tried in the past. The Democracy of Indiana is peculiarly fortunate in
        having three great leaders who have deserved and received the esteem of the people of this
        Union in their conduct of National affairs. One, that great statesman who has so steadily
        and unwaveringly adhered to this honest convictions, whose great legal mind has so strongly
        left its impress upon National legislation, that true friend and sound counselor,
        large-hearted, noble-minded Joseph E. McDonald.</p>
       <p>Another, a man under whose skillful guidance the Democracy has marched again and again to
        victory, whose character is esteemed and revered by men of all parties, whose name is a
        loved household word among all the people of the State, a man whom the citizens of the
        United States have twice elevated to the second place in the grandest Government on the
        planet - Thomas A. Hendricks.</p>
       <p>Lastly, that splendid representative of the andvanced ideas of the young Democracy, whose
        name has already been ably presented, who is the peer of any political leader in the Union,
        and who is the unanimous choice of the Democracy of Indiana, to succeed himself in the high
        position he now holds.</p>
       <p>What wonder that the Democratic masses rally round his standard, for where they could they
        find a more intrepid leader, a safer counselor, a more generous nature, a more indomitable
        heart?</p>
       <p>As we contemplate the fierce and desperate conflicts into which he has led our forces, we
        may say of him as the versatile English litterateur said of the Crusader Knight of St.
        John:</p>
       <p>" In the forefront of every battle was seen his burnished mail, and in the gloomy rear of
        every retreat was heard his voice of constancy and of courage "</p>
       <p>In his seven year career as Senator, he has been true to the interest of the State,
        careful to aid her industrial progress, alive to the needs of her people, and has most amply
        and completely deserved the encomium."Well done, good and faithful servant," and to-day we
        give him that indorsement as we tender to him a re-election by the largest majority ever
        given a Senator in the history the State. </p>
       <p>I desire to second his nomination, not for his spotless integrity and great abilities, nor
        on account of the zeal, energy and industry with which he has discharged his public duties,
        not on account of the persuasive eloquence with which he has trilled the hearts of the
        people of Indiana, although he deserves recognition on account of each and all of these
        qualities, but I second his nomination because, in the full and splendid stature, eh is the
        representative of the priciples of Jeffersonian Democracy. Mr. President, in behalf of a
        large majority of the people of this growing commonwealth, in the name of her countless sons
        of toil, with whose aims he is in such hearty sympathy, in the name of the mechanics who
        crowd our factors, in the of the farmers who till our fertile prairies, in the name of the
        artisans who throng our workshops, in the name of the soldier heroes whose advocate and
        champion he has ever been, and finally in the name of the gailant and united Democracy of
        the great Democratic State of the Northwest. I second the nomination of Daniel W.
        Voorhees.</p>
       <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It is fitting and proper at all times to recognize the valuable services
        and genuine worth of a faithful public servant.</p>
       <p>When men have been honest and trusted with office, and the responsibility and duty of that
        trust has been carefully and honestly discharged, it is then that the people's interests are
        best subserved.</p>
       <p>In the office of United States Senator once of the highest legislative trusts exist.</p>
       <p>The power for good or evil affecting the welfare of the whole people is proportionate with
        that trust.</p>
       <p>The man selected for the high responsible position should be a man not only possessing
        capacity, but with it the purest fidelity to principle.</p>
       <p>He should be a man with experience and conversant with the wants and diversified interests
        of 55,000,000 people.</p>
       <p>He should be a man of convictions and the courage to adhere to the right as embodied in
        the Jeffersonian idea of government.</p>
       <p>No higher standing could possibly be given the great State of Indiana in the sisterhood of
        States than to elect such a man to the United States Senate.</p>

       <p>We have that man, Mr. President, in the person of Daniel W. Voorhees.</p>
       <p>Wherever he has labored, in the halls of Congress, and, during the past six years as
        United States Senator, the people of this Nation heard and recognized his ability and
        devotion to their cause. </p>
       <p>Especially, sir, is this true of the soldiers of the country. In Senator Voorhees we have
        had a friend and earnest advocate of our claims in the eternal principle of Democracy:
        "Equal and exact justice to all men and exclusive privileges to none "</p>
       <p>Every soldier in the State of Indiana, <pb n="69" xml:id="VAA8558-22-069"/> whatever his
        party affiliations, conversant with the records of Congress, knows the truth of what I say. </p>
       <p>This being true, Mr. President and gentlemen of the Senate, it is with pride, and in the
        name of many thousands of my late comrads in arms, as well as in the name of the Democracy
        of the great State of Indiana, that I second the nomination of Senator Voorhees for a
        reelection to the high and responsible position of United States Senator.</p>
       <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have been with Senator Voorhees for the last six years. I have been his
        intimate friend, and I want to bear witness and tell you all to-day that there is no such a
        man in the halls of Congress to attend to the interests of his constituents as Senator
        Voorhees. And he does what no other Senator in that Senate does for soldiers. He gives
        strict instructions to never fail to refer to him soldiers' letters, and they come to him
        from Maine to California, and he attends to the business of the soldier, let him be black or
        white, no matter where he comes from. He has labored more and he has done more for the
        soldier than any other Senator in the United States of America. Go to my part of the State
        and I will show you where it is dotted all over with little cabins built by his hard word in
        getting pensions that have kept the wolf from the dorry of many a soldier's widow and
        children, and children are now in school that otherwise would have been in poor houses. I
        have got letters to him - nearly as many as a man can carry - returning thanks to him from
        nearly every State in the Union. I have saved them for somebody to read hereafter. One man
        writes that he has his picture hanging in his house to teach his children that is the man
        who saved their home. I second the nomination of Daniel W. Voorhees, and I have but one
        other thing I wish to live for - I have but one other ambition, and that is to see the day
        when I can vote for him for President of the United States. </p>
       <p>Mr. FOWLER: I can say what probably no other man in this Legislature can say, and that is
        that I voted for Mr. Voorhees every time he has been a candidate for Congressional honors.
        Six years ago, when he was elected to the United States Senate, I had the honor of a seat on
        this floor. I voted for him then, and I think if he could be candidate 1,000 times, and i
        had the opportunity, I should vote for him every time. I heartily second the nomination.</p>
       <p>Mr. SELLERS: The only reason urged by the Republicans of my district why I should be
        elected, was that if elected I should vote for Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees for United States
        Senator. I was elected, thus demonstrating the desire of my people that I should vote for
        him. I believe the State of Indiana are paying themselves the highest compliment by honering
        him by reelecting him to that position. As the representative of Northern Indiana. I desire
        to say, though she may change her people and change her politics, the people of Northern
        Indiana will never change their love of Daniel W. Voorhees. In behalf of the Democracy of
        Northern Indiana, who place him higher than any other Democrat in the Union, and do not
        change their regard for him I desire to second the nomination of Daniel W. Voorhees.</p>
       <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN: I wish to second the nomination of Hon. D. W. Voorhees to be his own
        successor for the exalted position of United States Senator, and to express not only the
        personal esteem in which I hold the distinguished statesmen, but a just expression of the
        will and wishes of the people of the counties of Marshall and Fulton, whom I have the honor
        to represent on this floor. In particular, however, in seconding the nomination of him who
        has so ably and faithfully represented the people of Indiana in the United States Senate for
        the past six years, I am conscious, Mr. President, that I voice the true sentiment of the
        German-American citizens of this great commonwealth. Among the public men in Congress and
        without D. W. Voorhees is nearest to their hearts. In him they recognize a true and reliable
        friend, and a stern defender of their rights and privileges as adopted citizens of a great
        and common country. That the valuable services of D. W. Voorhees be continued on the floors
        of Congress during the next six years is the decided wish of the German-American population,
        no only of Indiana, but throughout the Republic. Therefore, it is with profound respect and
        high regard for the candidacy of Hon. D. W. Voorhees for the United States Senate that I
        second the nomination.</p>
       <p>Mr. WINTER: It is more becoming in the bold warrior to boast upon putting of his armor
        rather than when putting it on. This sentiment I command to the eloquent Senator from
        Lawrence (Mr. Willard). A great party can not die simply because it failed of success in a
        Presidential election by a paltry plurality of 1,100 in an aggregate of a population vote of
        over 10,000,000. The Republican party looks forward with assured confidence to the not
        distant future, when freed from temporary dissension, and united in the support of its
        distinctive features, it will again appeal to the administration of affairs of the National.
        The Republicans of Indiana have no lack of gallant leaders from whom they may select without
        difficulty or danger of mistake a man worthy in every respect to represent the State in the
        Senate of the United States. Taylor and Calkins, Browne and Thompson. Cumback and Butler,
        may be mentioned without invidious distinction as men endeared to the Republicans of Indiana
        by reason of distinguished services to the people at large, as well as their party. Any of
        them would worthily occupy the chair of Lane and Morton; nor would they suffer by comparison
        with the distinguished gentle <pb n="70" xml:id="VAA8558-22-070"/> man who occupies that
        chair, and from whose just fame I would not in the least detract. But the Republicans of
        Indiana are indeed fortunate in that passing by all the distinguished men, whose names I
        have mentioned there yet remains one who, although not more worthy, is yet equally worthy of
        the highest honors that it is in the power of any party to bestow. He was a bold and earnest
        defender and advocate of the war for the Union and liberty to all men. He was a friend to
        the soldier when the soldier had enemies and needed friends. He is a man of ripe scholarship
        an able lawyer, a thoroughly trained and equipped statesman, equal to the discharge of any
        trust the people may devolve upon him. His public career has extended over a period of many
        years - a period in which partisanship has been bitter, and aspersions of the private and
        official character of men in public life all too common and often of the cruelest kind. It
        is with pride that his party associates can truly say he has passed through this ordeal
        without a suspicion having ever been uttered against the purity of his personal and private
        life. Than this no higher praise can be spoken of any man public or private. The man of whom
        I have just spoken is Albert G. Porter, of Marion County, who has just laid down the high
        office of Governor of the State to which he was elected by the people, whose voice, when
        directly appealed to has never failed in his support. I now have the honor of placing him in
        nomination as the Republican candidate for Senator, and in so doing I feel that I speak the
        united sentiments of the Republicans of Indiana. </p>
       <p>Mr. HUSTON: I rise for the purpose of seconding the nomination made by the Senator from
        Marion [Mr. Winter] I do this most heartily because I recognize in the honorable gentleman
        he has named one especially deserving the honor, and eminently fitted for the position, one
        who has been entrusted with many official responsibilities, the satisfactory execution of
        which has ever been rewarded at the hands of his party by additional favors. A man who is
        strictly in accord with his party and who has always vigorously advocated its principles,
        and under whose leadership the party attained the signal victory of 1880. A man thoroughly
        equipped, well versed in the law, and conversant with the wants of the people' admitted to
        be the peer of any man in our State; whose public and private character is without reproach.
        One who has been Governor of the State for four years immediate preceeding the inauguration
        of the present incumbent, and whose every official act will bear the closest scrutiny. His
        administration was marked for its honesty, wisdom and prudence, upon his return to private
        life he retains the respect, confidence and admiration of his friends throughout the entire
        state.</p>
       <p>There are doubtless some men in public life whom to retire to their constituents. On the
        other hand, there are those whose conduct and character and achievements have been such as
        whom to reinvest with the with the habiliments of public office is to honor both officer and
        constituents. My intelligent constituents in the large and industrial county of Elkhart
        depute me, ans their humble Representative in this General Assembly, to voice their
        unanimous desire to his distinguished excellency Albert G. Porter, go up higher. And in thus
        assuming to speak for those who have honored me by making me their Representative, I presume
        to speak for a large majority in this Commonwealth of both the young and old members of that
        party, grand in her mighty and proud achievements, and old in the wisdom and experience of
        her counsellors. </p>
       <p>The modest gentleman, whose names has last been mentioned for the high office United
        States Senator, represents no clan. He is neither the center nor in the circumference of any
        political ring nor is the smell of the fire of human wrath, or of abloquy upon his garments;
        a man in those days that tried men's souls whose missions where to strengthen and build up,
        and not to weaken and tear down; the earnest, constant friend and defender of the brave and
        gallant boys blue in times of war and in times of peace also; a man who has an earnest
        advocate of a sound national currency, pledged upon the life and integrity of a bleeding
        Nation, and who had the faith to believe, and whose life of a kind Providence spared to see

       <p>Mr. Speaker JEWETT announced the order for this hour to be a vote for a United States
        Senator to succeed Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees; and declaring nominations to be in order,
        granted the privilege of the floor first to the majority side of the House.</p>
       <p>Mr. DEBS said: </p>
       <p><hi rend="sc">Mr. SPEAKER -</hi> A privilege in connection with my duties as a member of
        this House, which I esteem an honor of high consequence, has fallen to my lot, and I shall
        ask the generous indulgence of the Chair and of my fellow Representatives while to the best
        of my ability I respond to a request well calculated to embarrass men of more years and
        experience than I can boast, I need not state to thise House, as a matter of information,
        that the important duty of electing a United States Senator to be the successor of Hon.
        Daniel W. Voorhees devolves upon the General Assembly, I could not hope, did the agreeable
        task I have assumed require it at my hands, to enlighten this House in regard to the
        superior abilities necessary to enable a Senator of the United States to meet <pb n="71"
         xml:id="VAA8558-22-071"/> all the high requirements of his office and worthily discharged
        its serious duties. The merest reference to such subjects is suggestive of qualities of head
        and heart which should command the reverence of the people. I am aware that there have been,
        in the common acceptance of the terms, good men who were not great and great men who were
        not good but I have learned from the lessons of history notwithstanding the frailties of
        human nature and the imperfections of the methods of government, that in the lottery of
        politics do very often become the favorites of fortune, and in taking the chances secure for
        their servants the right men and in all matters pertaining to the welfare of the State such
        men may be properly designated as the highest prizes, since there can nothing better,
        nothing of greater value in government than the right man in the right place. It can not be
        expected that the people, however intelligent and sincere, will always secure for places of
        great responsibility men distinguished for talent and energy, courage and virtue, but such
        great and good fortune is often bestowed, and when obtained the people, if qualified to
        appreciate the blessing, will unite in a patriotic determination to perpetuate it. </p>
       <p>The man who in public life has been proved and tested, who again and again has passed
        through the ordeal of temptation without scar or blemish, becomes a public benefactor,
        defying the ordinary methods of computation whereby to estimate his value to the State; and
        wisdom and patriotism win universal applause when the people retain such men in official
        positions.</p>
       <p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not detain this House by an extended reference to the lives, the
        characters and the deeds of the distinguished men who have represented Indiana in the Senate
        of the United States. We frequently hear men who, in speaking of the past, deplore, in
        comparison, the degeneracy of the present. I shall stop no longer to say I am not in
        sympathy with their vagaries. In the month of November, 1877, James D. Williams, then
        Governor of Indiana, appointed Daniel W. Voorhees as the successor of Oliver P. Morton,
        deceased, to represent Indiana in the United States Senate. The name and fame of Morton had
        filled the land. His great abilities had made him the leader of his party in the Senate. It
        was thought to be no ordinary responsibility to occupy the place made vacant by the death of
        Morton. It was deemed a herculean task to maintain the advanced position of the State which
        the admirers of Mr. Morton claimed was due to his masterly powers, but, sir, I do but repeat
        the truth of history when I say that as soon as opportunity offered mr. Voorhees came to the
        front in a speech which triumphantly vindicated the prescience of Governor Williams, a
        speech which electrified the Nation by the profundity of its statesmanship, the majesty of
        the grasp and the overwhelming power of its arguments and eloquence, and whatever else may
        be said of the sad event, the fame of indiana did not wane by the death of Morton. Voorhees
        caught the standard as it fell from Morton's hands, and the whole country, as he bore it
        aloft in the fierce contest between monopolists and the people with a united voice gave him
        an ovation of gratitude. In 1878 a Democratic Legislature ratified the wisdom of Governor
        Williams' appointment by electing Daniel W. Voorhees to a seat in the United States Senate,
        and for nearly six years he has, in a manner worthy of the highest commendation, maintained
        his own and Indiana' renown in that august body. His term expires on the 4th day of March
        next, and now, Mr. Speaker, I nominate Daniel W. Voorhees to be his own successor in the
        Senate of the United States for the ensuing term. </p>
       <p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that I am one of the Representatives of Vigo County, the home of Mr.
        Voorhees, is doubtless the reason why the honor has been given me to nominate him for
        Senator, and, though I am among the youngest members of this House, with legislative
        experience as limited as that of any other member, I am neither so juvenile or unschooled as
        not to be familiar with the scholastic attainments, the erudition, the statesmanship and
        patriotic devotion to the welfare of Indiana, and the whole country, which have pre
        eminently distinguished the official career of the citizen and Senator whom I have the honor
        to place in nomination to-day. Coming here as a working man, with whatever duties attach to
        my position as the representative of workmen. I feel just pride in placing nomination for
        the exalted office a man who has availed himself of every opportunity to champion the cause
        of tolling people of the State and Nation, in every emergency Mr. Voorhees has been the
        friend of labor, and the foe of monopoly, and the defender of the eternal right. And fully
        appreciating the patriotism, the privations and heroic services of his fellow-citizens, who
        went forth at the call of their country to battle for the Union and preserve it "one and
        indivisible," he has on all occasions demonstrated by prompt action and eloquent works, his
        unerring devotion to the interest of the Union solder. In the campaign just closed, which
        has placed the Democratic party of the Republic in power, a splendid aray of great men has
        been in the van of the Democratic hosts, and of them all not has rendered more effective
        service than the eloquent orator and distinguished statesman whom I now nominate to be his
        own successor in the United States, and whom the people of Indiana delight to honor - Daniel
        W. Voorhees.</p>
       <p>Mr. GOODING: Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure in seconding the nomination of Daniel W.
        Voorhees for re-election to the Unite States Senate for the next six years. Personally, the
        relations between Senator Voorhees and myself are most cordial and of the most friendly
        character. But my pleasure in voting for him arises more particularly from the fact that his
        sympathies and his public acts and votes are ever on the side of the masses of the people
        whom he as faithfully served. "</p>
       <p>Mr. GORDON: I should feel I had hardly fulfilled my duties as the representative of Putnam
        County if I failed to second this nomination. It was in Putnam County that perhaps the best
        days of the distinguished citizen were spent. It was here that the people knew him in his
        early boyhood. It was at Asbury University that he acquired his education. It was here that
        he gave evidence of those splendid abilities which have given him such renown. It was here
        that he found the companion of his life whom I believe has been a joy and solace to him in
        his last days. It was here that his early years were spent and his son, now a delegate in
        Congress, was born. The people of Putnman County knew him not only as a college student, but
        they have delighted to listen to his oratory. It is but fitting, therefore that I should
        second his nomination. All of the powers of this distinguished citizen are of a senatorial
        type. He is one of the few men fitted for this exalted position. Mr. Speaker, I second the
        nomination of Daniel W. Voorhees.</p>
       <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I don't desire to engage the attention of the House for any length of time.
        Mr. Voorhees was distinguished more perhaps at an early age for a speech he de <pb n="72"
         xml:id="VAA8558-22-072"/> livered in Virginia, in behalf of a person named Cook, than any
        speech he ever delivered of a non-partisan character. When I cast my vote for Mr. Voorhees
        it will be the third time I have cast my vote for him. And I have never regretted the act.
        My first efforts were in behalf of that gallant old man who sits to the left of Mr. Jewett
        (mr. McDonald). Mr. McDonald at that time defeated Mr. Voorhees. I never regretted that vote
        and I never will. Mr Voorhees then was young. It was right, proper, and fitting that he
        should abide his time. But I have voted for him since then and I will vote for him now. I
        have no doubt that that vote has never been misplaced. Mr. Voorhees may have made some
        mistakes, but in the essential principles of Democracy he was always stood for the right
        against wrong and oppression. I therefore say that Indiana and her sons will never have
        cause for regret for any action which he may take in behalf of his State or in behalf of his
        country. I more than second the nomination of Mr. Daniel W. Voorhees. </p>
       <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: I had the distinguished honor to cast my vote for the gentleman sitting at
        the Speaker's side, and I have never regretted coasting that vote; and I hope to see him as
        a counsellor in the council of the incoming administration. I heartily second the nomination
        of Daniel W. Voorhees to-day, and I do but voice the opinion of the Democratic constituency,
        as well as that of many Republicans who cast their vote for me, that I should cast my vote
        for him. </p>
       <p>I have the honor on behalf of the Republicans of Indiana to place in nomination as their
        candidate for United States Senator, Governor Albert G. Porter. Indiana has been honored by
        many illustrious eons, some of whom she has crowned with her choicest honors, but it is to
        the splendid achievements of the genius of her own sons, born on her own soil, educated in
        her own institutions and clothed with the panoply of citizenship within her historic borders
        that she turns with keenest pride. Her thousands of soldiers, living and dead by their
        matchless heroism, have made imperishable her fame for dauntless courage and sterling
        patriotism. The intelligence and energy of her citizens have made her one of the brightest
        jewels in the great galaxy of States that constitutes the mightiest freest nation on the
        face of the globe. In the name of the Republicans of Indiana and reflecting their united
        voice, I nominate a man who needs no eulogy to endear him to the hearts of the people of
        this his native State. I nominate a man of the rarest talent and most commanding character;
        a man whose moral qualities are as faultless as is intellectual constitution is vigorous and
        brilliant; a man to whose acknowledged fitness for great public trusts and responsibilities
        there is no limit but the Constitution of his country. </p>
       <p>Mr. ADAMS: It gives me pleasure to second the nomination of the gentleman just named - a
        man that first entered the political arena int he famous Congressional contest against the
        gallant leader of opposition, Martin M. Ray. And in that contest, when the standard of
        Martin M. Ray went down the standard of Albert G. Porter went up. The party of the minority
        in the House, after following on to defeat under the leadership of the gallant Thomas M.
        Browne, then united in following General Ben Harrison, and then the Hon. Albert G. Porter
        was called from a lucrative position in Washington to be the standard-bearer of the
        Republican party in Indiana. Under his leadership the Republican party assumed control of
        Indiana, and it has had Albert G. Porter at its helm ever since. I believe that more credit
        belongs to him for the Republican victory which resulted in the election of the martyred
        Garfield that to any other one man in Indiana. It is but proper that we should give our
        votes for that gentleman, so well known for his integrity and intellectuality; and it is but
        fitting that we should in this way send a greeting to the State of New York, which to-day
        elects the Hon. William M. Evarts to the United States Senate. Give us Evarts and give us
        Porter, and you give us two among the giant intellects of the age. In behalf of the
        Republicans of Morgan County, I heartily second the nomination of Albert G. Porter. </p>
       <p>Mr. SEARS: Coming here, as I do, from the western part of the State, and representing a
        constituency that has always been loyal to the Republican party, I deem it my duty on behalf
        of those people, to cordially second the nomination of the Hon. Albert G. Porter. A man in
        whose hands, four years ago, the Republican party of Indiana placed their standard, and
        said, "Carry it to victory in this campaign." which he did, and was triumphantly elected.
        And in the last campaign, when he was in the act laying aside his official career, the
        people, from one end of the State tot he other, rose up and greeted him with the plaudit of,
        "Well done, good and faithful servant" On behalf of the people of the State, as well as the
        people of the entire country, we propose, as a representative man of this country, where any
        one coming to this land whether he be a serf from Russia or a slave from Brazil, the moment
        his foot touches our soul, that soil hallowed as the resting places of a Washington, a
        Lincoln, and a Garfield, that moment the shackles fall from his limbs and he becomes a free
        man. On behalf of these people, on behalf of that party which I have the honor in part to
        represent, I cordially and enthusiastically second the nomination of Hon. Albert G. Porter. </p>
       <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: In the flush of partisanism we are always liable to forget the
        dignity of the occasion that calls forth our action and the significance of the work we have
        to do. I wish to say that it gives me profound gratification to indorse the nomination of
        Albert G. Porter, a man eminently qualified to fill the position of <pb n="73"
         xml:id="VAA8558-22-073"/> United States Senator. But I am equally glad and rejoice that,
        though my choice may not be the choice of this General Assembly, the fame of Indiana is
        secure in the brilliancy of talent in the Senate Chamber of the United States. While we are
        Republicans and Democrats here to-day, we are all Indianians. The mighty resources of this
        State should call forth our united effort. In the Senate of the United States the fervid
        eloquence, like that of Patrick Henry, the splendid endowments, the brilliant intellects,
        all these has marked almost continually the high character of Indiana's representatives in
        the Senate of the United States. No deliberative body is so like the ancient Roman Senate as
        the Senate of the United States. In Rome the forum has been made splendid with the diction
        of Cicero; and the forum of the United States Senate has been made splendid with the
        achievements of Indiana's favorite sons. The men placed in nomination to-day have long been
        friends. They were members of the same secret fraternity in college. They stand side by
        side, the representatives of the two great bodies which battle for supremacy in the State.
        In this General Assembly to day we must remember that we are Indianian's;that Indiana is one
        of the confederacy, eternally cemented together; that this one great State to-day justifies
        the high citizenship of the people. Each of the candidates is my personal friends and each
        worthy of my confidence and friendship, and Indiana should rejoice in the election of either
        of them. </p>
       <p>The ballot resulted - for Mr. Voorhees, 64 votes; for Mr. Porter, 35 votes.</p>

        <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced the unfinished business of last evening, being an
         amendment to the report of the Committee on Rules that a motion to lay on the table an
         amendment, if agreed to, shall not carry, the original proposition - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH opposed it. If debate be allowed on the original proposition, debate
         should also be allowed on the amendment. The long established rule ought not to be
         changed.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD offered an amendment giving the author of a bill the right to vote in any
         committee during the consideration of his bill, and the right to submit a minority
         report.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: At present every Senator introducing a measure is a member of a committee,
         except to vote, while his proposition is being considered. The amendment would simply add
         to the committee reports, and add to the already cumbersome journal which has to be printed
         at the expense of the State, while as at present the author can oppose an adverse report in
         open Senate, and there seems no necessity of adding to the bulkiness of the journals of the
         Senate.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>

        <p>The bill was read the second time on motion of Mr. Foulke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fowler and Mr. Weir thought this a very important bill. It appropriated a very large
         amount of money. It ought to be printed, with the amendments. </p>
        <p>It was so ordered.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE There is no disposition on the part of the friends of this bill to suppress any
         information or close up any source of information in reference to these institutions. The
         committee last night carefully considered the bill, and cut out a proposed appropriation
         for $162,000 for the fiscal year ending in 1887. It is necessary that legislation action be
         taken at once, so those who have made contracts with the State may know whether the
         Legislature will carry them out in good faith. I move that this bill be made a special

        prayed:</p>
       <pb n="76" xml:id="VAA8558-22-076"/>
       <p>Our Father and our God, we come before Thee within these halls and lift up our voiced with
        our hearts's warmest affections unto Thee for the blessings of the past. We realize, our
        Heavenly Father, that it is in Thee we live and move and have our being. We thank Thee for
        this opportunity of meeting in a legislative capacity; we invoke They blessing upon us, and
        pray Thee to so guide us that we may wisely legislate. Bless us, our Heavenly Father, in all
        our deliberations, and may nothing be done with the spirit of strife. May we each emulate
        each other in our desires to legislate for the good of the people. Will the Lord bless not
        only this Assembly, but the Senate of the United States, the rulers of this State and all
        the rules of the Nation. And direct us, our Heavenly Father, in the way we should go through
        the coming life; prepare each and every one of us for the dark and trying hour when we shall
        step down into the cold river of death. These mercies and blessings we ask in Jesus' name.
        Amen. </p>
       <p>The journal reading was dispensed with.</p>
       <p>Mr. BROWNING called up the resolution of Mr. Mock, of Wells, proposing to amend the rules
        so that the Speaker may designate Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, for the second reading
        of bills. He regarded it a very valuable rule for the furtherance of the House, and moved
        its adoption.</p>
       <p>The resolution was agreed to.</p>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">STOCK AT LARGE.</head>
        <p>The Committee on Agriculture returned Mr. McHenry's bill [H R&gt; 212] to amend the act
         concerning the running at large of, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
         postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on County and Township Business.
         He said: I want to call the attention of the House to this bill. The law as it now stands
         makes it the duty of any person to take up any animal running large, and the result is, as
         no one likes to make an enemy of his neighbor, that almost all kinds of animals are running
         at large indiscriminately. It appears to me that if them with level heads give a fair
         consideration to the provisions of this bill, which provides for Supervisors, and fixes a
         penalty for allowing animals to run at large, that they will not sustain the report of the
         committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING preferred the law as it is to this bill, which proposes the constitute the
         Supervisor as a sort of smelling committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe did not wish to see the bill strangled, but it is an important
         measure, and should be carefully considered.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I hope the report of the committee will not be concurred in by the House. If
         the House refuses to concur in the report of the committee, then the bill will remain on
         the Speaker's table, and be taken up any time and its merits discussed. If the report of
         the committee is concurred in, then this bill is killed, and in all human probability it
         will be the end of all legislation on this question. The present law seems to be fair and
         satisfactory. The Board of County Commissioners may by order, provide what kind, if any,
         stock may run at large, but when they make an order restraining stock from running at large
         the order is usually of little effect, for the reason there is no law making it the duty of
         any person to enforce the law. This bill provides that it shall be the duty of Township
         Supervisors to take up all stock fond running at large. Now what could be more proper than
         to clothe these gentlemen, whose duty it is to look after the highways with authority to
         take up all stock roaming about, and thereby carry out the law as intended. I trust the
         report of the committee will not be concurred in.</p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was laid on the table and the House refused to concur in the
         report of the committee.</p>

       <dateline rend="right">
        <date>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.</date>
       </dateline>
       <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: The hour for the special order having arrived, the Senate will
        proceed to the consideration of bill [S. 26] to provide for the calling of a Constitutional
        Convention.</p>
       <p>Mr. FOULKE: I move that the Senate substitute the minority for the majority report and
        concur in the report of the minority of the Committee on the Judiciary. It was adopted as a
        rule by the Judiciary Committee for the facilitation of its business that before the details
        of a bill should be considered the committee would pass upon the question as to whether it
        would favor the general principle or idea embraced in the measure. If it decided adversely,
        the recommendation to the Senate should be that the bill lie on the table or be indefinitely
        postponed without further discussion of the bill.</p>
       <p>That was the course which was taken in regard to this bill.</p>
       <p>The advisability as to the general provisions or separate details of the bill were not
        discussed; and, as for as the questions of details is concerned, I think there would be
        little difficult about them, and I venture to say they could be arranged satisfactorily to
        all, provided the principle of the bill was satisfactory. I have no special desire that the
        bill shall be passed as it stands, provided the principle be accepted. The present
        Constitution was adopted under the provisions of a law of 1841 which required that the
        question as to whether a Constitutional Convention should be called or not must first be
        submitted to a vote of the people. That was done, the people so decided, and the convention
        was called. This bill provides for calling the convention at once. It is substantially the
        same as the one introduced on this floor four years ago by the then Senator from Jackson
        [Jason B. Brown] and the same in terms as the one brought into the Senate in pursuance of
        the recommendation of the present Governor of Indiana [Isaac P. Gray] And the reasons why I
        insist that this Generall Assembly shall a Constitutional Convention are in many instances
        the same as his. In Governor Gray's message to the General Assembly he says: "It is nearly
        thirty years since the present Constitution of the State was adopted, etc.". [See Brevier
        Reports, vol. xix page 15] This bill provides that the convention shall consist of 100
        members That was a provision in the bill as originally introduced by the Senator from
        Jackson four years ago [Mr. Brown] but it was amended so that the number should be but fifty
        - one member from each of the Senatorial Districts of the State. If this Assembly should
        desire that amendment to this bill, as far as the details are concerned there will be no
        question. </p>
       <p>But, sir, the time has come for a new Constitution, and it is upon that principle that
        these committee reports are presented ot the Senate. And I would like to call the attention
        of the Senate to one of the highest authorities on the question of constitutional law, at
        least to gentlemen ont he other side of the House, that we have in American history - to the
        words of Thomas Jefferson, in a latter to Samuel Kerchival, dated July 12, 1816, in relation
        to a Constitution for the State of Virginia. Mr. Jefferson says - [Reads.] Now, sir, the
        State of Indiana has far outgrown the present Constitution, which was established more than
        thirty years ago. During that time the prosperity of the State has been something almost
        unrivalled. As the Senator from Jackson remarked, in presenting his Constitutional
        Convention bill four years ago - [Reads, commencing at the top of page 126, vol. xix,
        Brevier Reports.] I <pb n="079" xml:id="VAA8558-22-079"/> call the attention of Senate to
        the words of Senator Brown at the time he presented this bill, in which he says: "The
        present Constitution was adopted at a time when.;" etc [See Brevier Reports, vol., p. 125] </p>
       <p>The provision in our Constitution in regard to legislative machinery is one which should
        be radically amended. We have every two year a meeting of the General Assembly, and so great
        is the dissatisfaction of the people that the convening of the General Assembly is looked
        upon with regret, and its adjournment is treated as a matter of congratulation. So great is
        the dread that unwholesome laws may be created at the biennial sessions of our Legislature
        that the people are glad when they see us go home It was that general fear the Legislature
        would unsettle the laws which led to the introduction in the present Constitution of the
        provision that we should meet only once in two years, and shall only remain in session but
        sixty days. The framers of the Constitution were afraid to let us sit as long as wished or
        thought it necessary, but required we should go home at the end of sixty days whether we
        passed the legislation necessary or not. It was thought the danger of enacting bad laws was
        so much greater it was decided we must meet but once in two years, and then only sit sixty
        days. The possibilities of evils by the General Assembly ought to be granted without
        unnecessarily crippling their possibilities of evils by the General Assembly ought to be
        granted without unnecessarily crippling their possibilities for good. If a court of justice
        could not be relied upon for equitable decisions, would we say it would be a proper remedy
        to limit its sittings to once very two years and provide it shall only sit for sixty days?
        Could not as much evil be done in sixty days as in two years? The true way is to pass such
        regulations as will enable us to properly consider the bills presented to us, rather than
        that we should adjourn and go home with out properly considering th measures presented. It
        is utterly impossible in the time prescribed. The Judiciary Committee has been in session
        four or more evenings until midnight, and its members know it is not possible to foresee
        expenses likely to arise, or to provide against necessary evils of proposed laws, as well to
        protect the evils which demand relief from legislation. There are bills before the Senate
        now, of which we do not know whether they would be productive of more harm than good. We
        vote for bills pushed hurriedly through sometimes tenfold worse than the evil we hoped to
        remedy. This is a sad commentary upon our mode of legislation, but how can it be otherwise
        when hundreds of bills are introduced, some of them over 400 pages long. How under the sun
        can we compare in the sixy days' limit each one of these bills with preceding legislation
        and compare each clause therein with existing statutes. Under the circumstances how can we
        pass bills which shall give satisfaction to the people at large? A good part of this session
        will be devoted tot he repeal of laws which previous Legislatures have passed. There ought
        to be some means of correcting this. The way is not to limit the sessions of the
        Legislature. Biennial session may be frequent enough. There should be a provision in the
        organic law that now law can be passed or even proposed for our consideration, until it is
        so published, that any and every one who has rights to protect against it, or is interested
        therein, can in some manner be heard by members of the General Assembly. As new, when it
        comes to legislation, it is all ex parte. The promoter of a bill shows his side, but the
        other side is not presented. We do the best we can. We pass the bill, and in a year or two
        we repeal it. Our legislation should not fluctuate backwards and forwards like a pendulum.
        We should act right int he first place; but we can't get right in the first place until
        everybody is heard. There is a provision in the Constitution which requires that bills shall
        be read three several times on three several days. No one can know the contents of a bill on
        the first reading except the author, or whoever may have seen it previously. On the second
        reading of a bill but little more attention, if any, is paid it. If the bill is printed,
        that is some security, and we are apt then to know something about it before it comes to a
        final vote. There ought to be some way of publishing tot he people all proposed legislation
        before its enactment. Just that thing is done today in the Parliament of Great Britain. NO
        one bill can be introduced affecting the financial interests of the country before it is
        published in what is called "public orders." There weeks before the session of Parliament
        such bills must there be presented. And any person having an interest in these bills is
        entitled to be heard. The result is, after hearing both sides, members can judge of the
        merits which is best. Every one knows we can not do our work properly sixty days, and it is
        not right to limit our capacity for usefulness by prescribing a sixty days' session.
        Sometimes a bill effecting important interests will be introduced, read three times on one
        day, and passed under a suspension of the rules, and no one having any interest adverse to
        the bill knows anything about it until it becomes a law of the State. There ought to be more
        careful deliberation in the first place. </p>
       <p>Under the provisions of our present Constitution every idiot and every insane man, and men
        that are neither able to read, nor write, and and men who can not reason intelligently upon
        any subject, can be brought in wagons to the polls and voted at any general election in this
        State for any office whtaver. If we limit the right of suffrage to sex we ought to limit it,
        at least to some extent, as to intelligence. If we do not open the franchise doors and allow
        women to vote, the Constitution at least <pb n="080" xml:id="VAA8558-22-080"/> ought to
        provide that the idiot and the insane can not vote. But I do not desire to the discuss the
        matter of woman suffrage - </p>
       <p>Mr. MAGEE (interrupting): Did I understand you to say that you favor a constitutional
        limit as to suffrage?</p>
       <p>Mr. FOULKE: Personally, I do not. I do not there is any danger in throwing the doors as
        wide open as possible, except as to a person who is idiotic or who is wholly irresponsible
        for his own acts. I do not believe such an one ought to vote.</p>
       <p>Mr. MAGEE: Neither do I.</p>
       <p>Mr. FOULKE: I believe that even ignorance has the right to protect itself against
        intelligence, and not in leaving the rights of one in the hands of another, but that each
        class, white, black, male, female, should have the God-given right of saying what is best
        for itself. But that, sir, is a matter of personal preference. It may be said: If the
        Constitution is to be amended, why can not that be done by offering specific amendments? I
        answer, for the reason that it involves the remodeling of the whole Constitution. You can't
        go over a single article without seeing a point that is radically defective. It needs to be
        gone over from beginning to end, and the only body competent to do that is a constitutional
        convention.</p>
       <p>[Before he concluded the Senate took a recess for dinner.]</p>
       <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It seems to me the very principle underlying the argument of the Senator
        from Wayne why we should have a Constitutional Convention is sufficient within itself as an
        argument against the calling of a Constitutional Convention. We have seen cropping out a
        disposition for the concentration of power in the administration of public affairs - a
        disposition to concentrate the power of the Government in the hands of a few men; and the
        ideas advanced by the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] remind me of the old Hamiltonian
        doctrine advanced at the time of the foundation of our Government - a departure from the
        Jeffersonian idea of government, with which he saw proper to twit the Democratic side of
        this Chamber. The forms of government across the water, to which he alluded, are what the
        American people combatted when they formed this Government. I can not agree with the Senator
        that there is any power delegated to the Legislature to call a Constitutional Convention. I
        don't often quote from Republican authority and accept it as good doctrine to act upon, but
        in this case I will read from the message of Governor Porter to the same General Assembly to
        which Governor Gray's message was delivered, from which the Senator saw fit to refer, and
        upon this same question. Governor Porter says - [Reads from Brevier Reports, vol. xix., page
        30.] I shall have to adopt this language, and will adopt it as part of my argument as an
        objecting to calling a Constitutional Convention. Four years ago every Republican on the
        floor of the Senate voted against a proposition for the calling of a Constitutional
        Coentional Let me read - [Reads the vote on page 169 of the Brevier Reports, vol. xix.]
        Senator Grubbs, at that time one of the leading lights on the Republican side of the
        Chamber, who was afterward nominated for Congress and ingloriously defeated in the late
        avalanche that broke over the country, said upon this question [Reads from the Brevier
        Reports, Vol. xix., page 128.] Now, sir, I am opposed to this bill, and I believe with
        Senator Grubbs that amendments should be made under the provisions of the Constitution; and
        I believe that the people of this State, after thirty odd years of success and advancement
        in the grand march of civilization, have a right to know what amendments are proposed to the
        Constitution of their State, under which they have made such signal progress. </p>
       <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: Under existing circumstances, it is the duty of every Democrat who aspires
        to represent the will of the majority to vote against this Constitutional Convention bill. I
        was opposed to a Constitutional Convention because the party to which I belonged declared
        itself against it. There is a great deal of fallacy in the arguments put forth in calling a
        Constitutional Convention. There are some things which grow better by being old. The
        argument that because the State of Indiana has grown large under this Constitution, the
        argument that we ought to have a new Constitution because the present one is thirty years
        old, to my mind is an argument against a new one, unless there can be some other good reason
        shown. As well might a man say who had bought his forty or eighty acres of land at a small
        price, and after cities or towns are built upon his land, because there has been such a
        growth of wealth, he ought to have a new title to the land. One of the arguments made by the
        Senator from Wayne is that our present Constitution, upon the question of suffrage, is a
        disgrace; that insane persons idiots and ought not to be permitted to vote; and if they are,
        that the opposite sex ought to be permitted to vote. I desire to call attention to the fact
        that the Constitution on that question is not thirty years old. It is but four year sold.
        Within the last six years, aye, within last four years, a constitutional amendment has been
        adopted in this State fixing the qualification of voters. That article went through two
        Legislatures and was ratified by the people, so that provision is not thirty, but four years
        old, which the Senator is so dissatisfied with. Another provision to which the Senator
        referred is the one with reference to the Judges of the Supreme Court. I take it that the
        people of the State, as well as the General Assembly, have passed upon that very question
        within the last six years, for, in 1877, there was an amendment proposed to the Constitution
        involving that question; <pb n="081" xml:id="VAA8558-22-081"/> and the people declared
        themselves to be against the Senator from Wayne on that question. And there is no necessity
        of putting anything in the Constitution for the protection of railroads. </p>
       <p>Mr. FOULKE (interrupting): Does not the Senator think something is necessary to protect
        the people against extravagant charges of railroads?</p>
       <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I think a Constitutional Convention would be plied against the railroad
        magnates just as the Legislature is, and the necessity of being put in a more favorable
        attitude would open the Constitution up to give them another grab and take away what
        protection there now is for the people as against these corporations. Until some
        constitutional amendments are matured in the minds of the people I see no necessity for
        calling a Constitutional Convention and setting the old Constitution and aside. Until that
        is done there ought to be no convention to put this clause in to suit one member and another
        to suit another, and by a log-rolling process to force a Constitution upon the people that
        is not in accordance with the opinion of even a majority of the people of the State. When he
        concluded</p>
       <p>The Senate adjourned</p>

        <head rend="center">THE GRAND JURY SYSTEM</head>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, the Committee on the Judiciary returned Mr. Patten's bill [H. R. 187] to
         abolish Grand Juries, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed </p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I don't particularly care about a bill of that kind myself, but I have
         drafted that bill in the interests of economy. I know that the Grand Jury system is a very
         expensive one, and I undertake to say, and I believe everybody will agree with me, that is
         a system of barbarism and inquisition. The Grand Jury is of service to nobody. It is not
         effective. It has retarded justice. This bill provides that the prosecution shall be by any
         one. It gives to the officers of the State of Indiana full power to file an information
         against his informant, or to compel parties to go up before the court of jurisdiction and
         file the affidavit. There is a great deal of expense in bringing people before the Grand
         Jury. To illustrate, Governor Hubbard, of Texas, said upon several occasions that, when a
         young man, he was Prosecuting Attorney, and there was an old man drawn who was deaf in one
         ear and said he could not her well. "You are just the kind of man expected to sit on a
         Grand Jury; you are not expected to hear out of one ear " It is only a one-sided
         examination. I undertake to say that after the examination has once been gone through with
         before the Grand Jury, the whole matter has to be gone through with, and the whole expense
         and cost incurred again the Court. I don't purpose to go into the details of the merits of
         this bill, but to say that it ought to have a fair hearing before his body. I had hoped
         that the wisdom of the Judiciary Committee would prepare a more perfect bill and present it
         to the House. The Grand Jury defeats the very object for which it was instituted, therefore
         I ask that the report of the committee be laid upon the table, and bill recommitted to the
         Committee on the Judiciary. I asked to be informed when the bill came before the committee
         that I might appear before them, but I was not informed. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: I don't remember of his request to be heard before the committee. I assure him
         that no disrespect was intended him.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the bill was recommitted.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">WOMAN'S RIGHTS.</head>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, from the Judiciary Committee, returned Mr. Jameson's Woman's Rights bill [H.
         R. 59] with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. JAMESON: This is a bill to amend the section of the Married Woman's act, 1881, which
         provides that a married woman shall not enter into any contract of suretyship. The courts,
         by construction have extended the effect of this section to prohibit married women, their
         husbands as tenants by entirety. If the present law is to stand some of our best lawyers
         think the same reasoning by which the courts have arrived at the construction of the law
         now placed upon it would inevitably lead to the conclusion that a mortgage of a man and his
         wife on real estate owned by the husband would be void as to the wife's interest in real
         estate of her husband, mortgaged by husband and wife to secure the husband's debt, is
         security only for the husband's debt, is security only for the husband's debt, is security
         only for the husband's debt. The bad effect of this needs no comment. While the opinion of
         the Judiciary Committee on purely legal matters is entitled to weight, on a matter of the
         character of the one in question the opinion of a lawyer is entitled to no more weight than
         that of any other man of equal intelligence. The question is not a legal one; it is one of
         justice of expediency law is no real protection, is productive of no good, but is a harmful
         law. It imposes disabilities known to no former law. In cases where its provisions should
         afford some protection it is continually avoided by indirection it is continually avoided
         by indirection. Dishonest husbands and wives collude to use the law as an instrument to
         commit fraud on honest creditors, and intelligent women are prevented from a free and
         proper use of their property to which in justice they are entitled and are often forced to
         sacrifice their property by sale because they have not the power to mortgage it. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: This bill has been very thoroughly discussed by our committee.</p>
        <pb n="082" xml:id="VAA8558-22-082"/>
        <p>Laws are not made so much for the enjoyment of the rich as they are for restricting the
         vicious and protecting the weak. This bill seems to have been conceived for the purpose of
         making easy the power and influence of the husband over the property of a wife. I think,
         sir, the law as it is now exists is a very proper one. It has not been placed there by a
         sudden gush of feeling, but in the wisdom of the Legislature, the members have seen proper
         to put such laws upon the statue books. The law is well settle din Indiana that no woman
         can become the surety of her husband. The point is, whether such as is proposed by the
         gentleman of Marion, shall become a law in the State of Indiana, and thereby repeal the
         safeguard thrown around the home of married women. Sometimes a man uses his power over his
         wife to make her sign a mortgage. A mortgage generally means a deed, and it means that the
         property may be taken from the wife if he is improvident. The Legislature of this State
         would be doing a violence to its conscience to take away any safeguard they have thrown
         around the married woman. I am perfectly willing to have this matter discussed before the
         House. I don't believe the sentiment of the House would be for repealing this law. </p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: This is a question in which we are all interested and it seems to me that
         under our rules this is not the proper time to discuss the merits of this bill. It seems to
         me it would be right to recommit this bill so that we all might have the right to discuss
         it. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK, of Wells: I am opposed to recommitting the bill. The present law is that a
         mortgage executed by a married woman to property belonging to her husband is valid. Our
         Supreme Court has decided that a married woman can convey her property. It is simply a
         humane provision of our law to protect married women from being induced by their husbands
         to convey away their property. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: It has long been the tendency of this Legislature for years to question the
         rights and privileges of married woman. It has been held that she may carry on her separate
         business, and that she may make contracts of her own. If this is the sentiment of the
         people they certainly have come to recognize the fact that women within themselves have
         some inherent sense; that they are not a lot of dummies to be led by their husbands into
         all sorts of foolishness. I say this law is not imposing any hardship upon the women. A
         great deal of gush has been expended on this subject. It seems to me that gentlemen seem to
         think that the interest of the husband is antagonistic to the interest of the wife, that
         the husband wants to invade and take away the domicile of the wife. I had always supposed
         that the husband's and wife's interest were common. I don't it has come to be regarded that
         the husband is the natural foe of his wife. These amendments to the law simply give them
         rights where necessity seems to demand them. I am not in favor of concurring in the report
         of the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Ten years ago the Legislature saw it fit to take the first important step in
         enlarging the rights of married women. It was then enacted that when real estate was held
         conjointly the wife had the right of partition. The Legislature realized the hardship of
         that matter, and they passed a law allowing her to enjoy her part of the real estate. In
         1879 they were rights to contract. The gentleman from Bartholomew [Mr. Reeves] has said
         that t was a step recognizing the ability of married women to contract for themselves. Let
         us not forget that while they were enlarging their rights by contract they were diminishing
         their rights by mortgage. If a married woman to day desires to mortgage her property to
         carry on her own business, she can do that under the law as it now stands. The report of
         the committee ought to be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I am in favor of concurring in the report of the committee for two reasons,
         the first of which is that we have too much change of law; we have too much legislation on
         many subjects and this is one of them. And it has come to be the rule that one Legislature
         passes a law, and in about four years the people learn what it is, and then the next
         Legislature will change it. Second - I venture to say that you can't find a memorial
         praying for such a measure, with five names of women attached to it, in this Legislature.
         It is the improvident husbands who want this change. That is the strongest point.</p>
        <p>Mr. G. ADAMS: This is a bill of great importance for the reason that a good many estates
         that have been held in entirety have been mortgaged or will be mortgaged soon. While I may
         not indorse a good deal of the sentiment just expressed, yet I think this bill should pass
         to a second or third reading. I therefore move you Mr. Speaker, to amend the report by
         striking out the recommendation therein read, and that the bill pass to the second reading. </p>
        <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON demanded the previous question, and under its operation the report of the
         committee was concurred in by yeas, 54; nays, 30.</p>

         <head rend="center">THE STATE'S FUNDS.</head>
         <p>Mr. Patton's concurrent resolution concerning the funds in the hands of the State
          Treasurer came up as the special order.</p>
         <p>Mr. Gooding said that as there was a resolution in the Senate to the same import he
          moved that the matter be postponed till to-day at 2 o'clock. Mr. Patton said that he <pb
           n="83" xml:id="VAA8558-22-083"/> thought the matter ought to be treated with decent
          respect; the matter had been postponed twice already and he thought the question should be
          disposed of; he came to serve his constituency, and he believed the matter should be
          considered. He did not think the House should wait for any action upon the part of the
          Senate. As for him he was willing to take the responsibility, and he thought it was
          encumbent upon the party to go into the investigation. Mr. Gooding said that the gentleman
          from Sullivan misunderstood the purport of his motion. He was not here to screen any man,
          and an imputation that he was acting in the interest of any but the people did him
          injustice. It was his purpose to move to take up the Senate resolution as soon as the
          House resolution was postponed. He did not believe that there is any necessity for an
          investigation, but he was willing that it should be made, because if it was not done, the
          Republicans would herald it over the country that the Democrats were not willing to such
          an investigation. Mr. Adams said that he did not understand that the Senate resolution was
          one to investigate, but to appoint a committee to see if an investigation is necessary. To
          adopt this course is to postpone the matter still further, and he was opposed to putting
          the matter off from day to day and from week to week. Mr. French was in favor of going
          into an investigation under the resolution of the House. The roll was then called and the
          House decided to postpone the question. As soon as the vote was announced, Mr. Gordon
          moved that the resolution be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. Reeves
          thought that this was but another way of strangling the resolution; he believed the
          measure should be voted on directly, and the members should be willing to take the
          responsibility. He therefore moved to lay Mr. Gordon's motion on the table, and this was
          done by a vote of 49 to 34. </p>
         <p>Mr. McMullen here introduced the following:</p>
         <floatingText>
          <body>
           <div type="resolution">
            <p>Whereas, There as been an intimation made by Governor Porter, in his biennial message
             to the General Assembly, touching the affairs of the Treasurer of State - that certain
             irregularities exist in that office which call for investigation and inspection; and, </p>
            <p>Whereas, The said Governor making such intimation or charge has been the Executive of
             the State during the entire term of the present incumbent in the office of Treasurer;
             and,</p>
            <p>Whereas, it is by law made the duty of the Governor, whenever the public acts require
             it, to cause an examination of the Treasurer's office to be made; and,</p>
            <p>Whereas, It is the duty of such Governor under the law of the State whenever he has
             information of any irregularities in the Treasurer's office to cause immediate
             investigation to be made and if it is found that the law has been violated, to at once
             cause the arrest of the State Treasurer; therefore be it</p>
            <p>Resolved, By the House (the Senate concurring) that a committee of there on the part
             of the House and two on the part of the Senate be appointed to inquire into the matter
             in sad message touching said intimations of irregularities, and ascertain when the
             Governor received the information touching the same, and also to inquire into the cause
             of the Governor's failure to cause investigation to be made of said office nd official
             conduct of said officer. </p>

         </floatingText>
         <p>The matter was introduced in the form of an amendment, but the Speaker said he thought
          it was more in the nature of a substitute, but he had no objection to the Hourse treating
          it as an amendment. Mr. Sears moved to lay the amendment on the table and the yeas and
          nays were demanded. The motion was lost by a vote of 42 to 41. The amendment was then
          adopted by a vote of 45 to 34.</p>
         <p>The following motion was then offered by Mr. Twineham:</p>
         <p>And such committee shall have authority to send for persons and papers, administer oaths
          to witnesses, have access to all books, papers, vouchers and documents in the possession
          of the Treasurer of State that pertain to said office, and shall make full and thorough
          investigation of the condition of the State Treasury; what persons, banks or corporations.
          if any, has or have recently had any of the State's money on deposit or by way of loan,
          and what interest, bonus or gratuity the Treasury of State has received, or by any
          contract or understanding with any person or persons is entitled to receive for such
          deposit or loans, and that said committee make report as soon as may be to this General
          Assembly.</p>
         <p>The amendment was voted down.</p>
         <p>At this point the Speaker said that he had decided that Mr. McMullen's resolution was a
          substitute, taking the place of the original resolution, and that it should be adopted by
          the House as such and not as an amendment. The question of adopting the substitute was
          then put and carried.</p>
         <p>The Senate concurrent resolution for the appointment of a committee to see if an
          investigation into the affairs of the State Treasurer is necessary was then called up, and
          Mr. Taylor moved that it lie on the table, including in the motion an amendment offered by
          another member that the committee have power to send for persons and papers. The motion
          was lost by a vote of 43 to 41. A motion to table the amendment prevailed, and the House
          concurred in the Senate resolution by a vote 81 to 1. </p>

        <head rend="center">CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.</head>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor Manson said: The Senator from Perry has the floor on the special
         order.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I think the question of calling a Constitutional Convention has been settled in
         a way binding upon a majority of the members of the General Assembly. In a country of this
         kind, where all our State and National Governments are dissilimar in many respects to the
         Government of England, I should regret to see our country retrograde by adopting the
         institutions of England. For instance, I hope it will never come to pass in this country
         that representatives shall be elected from districts out of which they reside as members of
         Parliament are elected. While the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] in many of his arguments
         is in advance of the times, in other propositions he is behind the times. For instance, he
         is in advance of the times when he urges that there ought to be a provision in the
         Constitution for woman suffrage. His model Government of England has never attempted to go
         so far as that.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE (interrupting): Is the Senator not aware that in England women are entitled to
         vote in all municipal elections?</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: Women in this State are allowed to vote in district school meetings, but not in
         matters of National importance. And I am opposed to following the civil service system of
         the English Government. The intention of American institutions is that the people are
         sovereigns - that they shall chose their officers from time to time, and their tenure of
         office is not to be perpetual. I can see but two or three arguments urged by the Senator
         from Wayne in favor of his bill for a Constitutional Convention. You might engraft into a
         new Constitution a prohibitory amendment, but unless the people elect Legislatures in
         accord with that provision, not such legislation would be enacted. Can you show me when the
         General Assembly has acted under the new provisions of the Constitution in regard to fees
         and salaries? The same thing may be said of woman's suffrage were a Constitutional
         provisions enacted. On these propositions the Senator is in advance of the times. The
         question of calling a Constitutional Convention has been settled by the people at the
         polls, and i think the people's voice paramount to the Legislature. I don't care how
         plausible the arguments are in favor of it, if the people are against it we ought to stand
         by the people who have voted against it. It is the duty of every Democratic Senator, who
         reprents a Democratic constituency, or who is identified with the party, to vote against
         the bill calling this Constitutional Convention. The only question is what is the sentiment
         of the people of Indiana, and having that out, it is our duty to abide by it. For that
         reason I propose to vote against this bill. I know my people are opposed this bill. I know
         my people are opposed to it, and that is about the only reason I have for saying what I
         have said. I believe it is the duty of Senators to place themselves on record on this
         proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The position the two political parties find themselves in shows with what
         facility we can change our opinions upon important questions. Four years ago Democratic
         members favored the calling of a Constitutional Convention, but the Republican members, and
         they were in the majority, opposed it. Two years ago, with that facility which as always
         characterized that party for changing its front, it favored the calling of a Constitutional
         Convention and the Democrats opposed it. In the last campaign it was a direct issue made
         with the people, and upon that there has been a judgment. This argument for a convention is
         like the argument of an attorney who, after judgment, insists there has been some error in
         the judgment and wants to reopen it. On this side we are assured we have the commendation
         of the people. The people of Indiana, by over 21,000 majority in a vote of nearly 500,000
         have declared they do not want a Constitutional Convention. While I agree with the Senator
         from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) in a great many propositions he state yesterday, there are a great
         many in which I disagree. I never thought we needed a Constitutional Convention. The
         framers of that instrument wisely put upon it a provision that will meet every demand the
         progress or development of the State may require.</p>
        <p>If the material progress and development of the State should make a new demand upon the
         people, and if the Constitution don't quite cover these new interests, we can propose by
         action here in the General Assembly such amendments as we will meet the immediate and
         necessary want. This Constitution was made two generations ago. At that time there was no
         corporation wealth scarcely in the State, and as yet no one has complained that the
         provisions of this instrument are not equal to any emergency in relation to the care of
         those great interests.</p>
        <p>I don't see any good result that can come from calling a Constitutional Convention. The
         people are familiar with our present Constitution, and the practice and forms under it
         which have been maintained for the past thirty-three years, and if we wipe out this old
         instrument under which we have progressed from a people of less than 100,000 to over
         700,000, we might enter upon radical reforms which would take another generation to
         settle.</p>
        <p>Now I wish to call the attention of the senate to a question of dollars and cents. I had
         a statement prepared for me by the Auditor of State, and while I would not base the calling
         of a Constitutional Convention upon a mere money consideration, yet I think that ought to
         have some weight with members of this General Assembly. The comparative cost of a
         Constitutional Convention, which I do not believe is one of the demands of the hour, is
         $162,750. We have already torn out some of the barbarisms of the present Constitution, and
         i hope it will be left to a Democratic Legislature to strike out the world 'black' where it
         occurs in the Constitution, as the crowning act of the Democratic part. I think I am as
         liberal in my political views as any Republican I ever met. I believe in the broadest
         liberty to every man. I believe every man in this country ought to have the protection of
         the law, no matter what his social condition or what the color of his skin. The senior
         Senator from Marion has introduced a bill to abolish all those old landmarks of Bourbonism,
         if that is what you please to call it. The people have decided that old things are passed
         away and all things are to become new. [Laughter] </p>
        <p>I don't want to see a centralized Government, such as is advocated by the Republican
         party. That party wants to make a stronger Government; it insists that wealth ought to
         represented in the legislative halls of this country, and for years men have taken their
         merchandise into the halls of Congress. Not so in the State of Indiana; our Constitution
         forbids that.</p>
        <p>It was a Democratic Convention that framed our present Constitution; and one of the
         brightest men that ever lived in the State drew that portion which gave us our matchless
         school system providing for the education of the children of the State. To Mr. Owen, one of
         the advanced thinkers, as he was termed, is due the credit for that act; and all subsequent
         legislation has been owing to the intelligence and morality of the Democratic party.</p>
        <p>The Senator from Wayne desires to apply some of the precedents established in England to
         our own forms of government. While I believe some of them are valuable, yet, nevertheless,
         some of them could not be applied here with the same good results they have there. Our
         financial, social and political conditions are entirely different from those of England,
         and we can't transplant their political ideas here and expect them to grow and flourish.
         England has no written law. She has a law that has grown up by custom. It is different with
         us. Our laws are written, and those laws are a guide for our people in their social,
         political and other conditions. I don't want to see new and strange methods introduced into
         the common polity of this State. I don't want to learn too fast. I believe in holding as
         much power in my hand as I possibly can, when I give back to the State a party of my
         personal liberty and right for the protection she gives to me.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It seems to me it would only be fair, where an attack has been made on the
         Republican party and where reference has been made to my position personally, that I should
         be allowed, say five or ten minutes to answer.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: I am glad he has withdrawn it. </p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I would like to see the opposition given a chance to present themselves as
         favorably as they can reference to this matter. you may have noticed that <pb n="86"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-086"/> most of the Senators who have jumped on my friend from Wayne
         have been Democrats and I want him and our Republican brethren in favor of a Constitutional
         Convention to have a chance to present themselves as favorably as they can before the
         Senate and the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: As to the argument in favor of calling a Constitutional Convention, the
         Senator from Huntington [Mr. Hilligass] said yesterday that there were only three or four
         points in which the Constitution needed amendment in accordance with my argument. There are
         no less than eighteen, and not one of them has been answered by any Senator upon this
         floor. Not in one instance in which I have shown the Constitution needs revision has there
         been any argument in denial of that fact. We are told that Indiana has grown splendidly
         under the present Constitution, therefore we should leave it be as it is. That argument is
         like attributing the prosperity of the United States to the coinage of silver, to the
         tariff, or to a free trade policy, or to things of that kind. The growth of Indiana has
         been not in consequence of the Constitution, but in spite of it. These things reach beyond
         the law. It is in spite of restrictions imposed by the Constitution that we have grown up
         and will continue to grow whether we call a Constitutional Convention or whether we don't.
         We may do something to accelerate this progress, or we may do something to retard it. We
         should give the people more power.</p>
        <p>The Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCullough), said that some of the provisions I have pointed
         out as needing amendment or revision have been established since the adoption of the
         Constitution, Does that show that they are proper, or that they should not be abrogated? He
         says we don't a new Constitution to aid the railway interests, and that railroad men are
         demanding a new Constitution in furtherance of their interests. That is hardly a fair
         argument. Nobody has said it is to further railroad interests that a new Constitution is
         demanded. On the contrary, it is because the railroads and other corporations; it is
         because wealth has been consolidated in few hands, and because it wields a mighty power,
         that there is need protect the people against that power. That is why a new Constitution is
         desirable.</p>
        <p>It is said that I desire to see a Constitution in which prohibition and woman's suffrage
         may be maintained. Whatever may be my personal views on either of these questions, my
         desire is that the people of the State shall have opportunity to determine whether the
         right of suffrage shall be as broad as the world and as free as the air we breathe, and
         that the people shall have the right to determine upon regulations for the liquor traffic
         in their respective towns and townships. And the best way to do that is to submit these
         propositions to the people in separate provisions by a Constitutional Convention.</p>
        <p>It is said that I am bringing my models from England; that sometimes I am in advance of
         the times, and at other times behind. I recognize that there are institutions in England
         which would be a curse to transplant in this country, but whenever I find anything that is
         good, whether it be in Hindoo, Chinda, or Japan, I am willing to adopt it. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I now renew the demand for the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operation the motion to substitute the
         minority for the majority report was rejected by yeas 16, nays, 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD, explaining his negative vote, said: For twelve years, with varied experience
         in both branches of the Legislature I have always favored the calling of a Constitutional
         Convention. I believe, personally, that the interests of the State require it. I believe
         that Section - in Article 1 of the Constitution will prohibit, as long as it stands, the
         enactment of a proper fee and salary law in this State. I concede the necessity, at no
         distant day, for a new Constitution, but the last State Republican Convention saw fit to
         throw a sop to the prohibitions by declaring in favor of a Constitutional Convention if it
         came into Republican hands, would let the people have the question of prohibition submitted
         to them. Upon that point by 21,000 majority, the people have decided, and, therefore, I
         yield my personal views to the idea of a party policy, believing that no minority of a
         party is as wise as the majority. I vote "No"</p>
        <p>The majority report, recommending indefinite postponement of the bill, was concurred in
         without a division.</p>

        <div type="section">
         <head rend="center">THE STATE TREASURY.</head>
         <p>The House concurrent resolution for an investigation into the cause of the Governor's
          failure to make an examination of the State Treasurer's office, coming up by direction of
          the presiding officer [Mr. Magee in the chair.]</p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS said: I move the adoption of the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr. YOUCHE: We should not permit political bias to influence our judgment upon a
          resolution of this kind. I think we do not fully discharge our duty to our constituents
          when we let a matter of this kind rest without investigation. The public prints of this
          and other States are full of insinuations to the effect that is something wrong in the
          Treasury of the State of Indiana. I am surprised that the majority in this chamber and the
          other chamber will rest under an insinuation of this kind. I am always in favor of
          investigation, and I believe it is the duty of a political party, when it wants to
          strengthen it <pb n="087" xml:id="VAA8558-22-087"/> self to be in favor of an honest and
          faithful investigation of public officers, although elected by such party. For one I am
          going to vote in favor of this resolution. It has been put in this shape for the purpose
          of putting an end the proposed investigation, but I hope there may yet be given shape to
          this matter, so that the State Treasurer may be investigated, and if he has done nothing
          wrong, that he may be vindicated I can't see how any Senator can go to his constituency,
          and when the question is asked: "Why didn't you vote in favor of investigating the
          Treasurer of State?" only answer: " It was suspicioned; the Treasurer happened to be a
          member of my political party, and it was feared there might be disclosures out of which
          political capital might be made." We are naturally in favor of supporting the members of
          our own party, but when it comes to a question concerning the finances of the State I
          think we should rise above party and be in favor of that which will bring about security
          of the State's money and not try to smother an investigation which the highest authority
          in the State has indicated in a message to the General Assembly ought to be made. </p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am very glad to know that the Senator has found, coming from Democratic
          source, a resolution which he can support; but sir, the insinuations he speaks of as
          coming from the public press of the country, are just such insinuations as we have had any
          may expect to have as ong as the Republican party exists; because it is a party of
          insinuations it is a party of charges, and when charges of such a character have come from
          Republican sources it ill becomes the Governor of the State Indiana - </p>
         <p>Mr. ADKISON (interrupting): I will ask the Senator if the Sentinel, the acknowledged
          organ of the Democratic party; has not demanded an investigation of the State
          Treasurer.</p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am not able to say whether it has or has not. My time has been so taken
          up that I have not been reading the Sentinel editorials, but I will undertake to say this
          in behalf of the Sentinel, that it has made no charge of corruption, or fraud, or
          mismanagement of the public funds against Treasurer Cooper. But, the Senate for Lake [Mr.
          Youche] has seen proper to insinuate that it is the purpose of the Democratic side of this
          chamber to smother an investigation - that we desire to evade an investigation. We don't
          think an investigation necessary in his matter, which rests solely upon a charge made in
          the public press of the country, and that pubic press the Republican press. I want to say
          to the Senator that it has proven too unreliable in the past, and I don't take it as such
          authority upon which the General Assembly of the State should act in this matter. I want
          to say, further, as I said the other day, that for two years Govornor Porter, has Governor
          of the State, was vested by the statute with authority to make this investigation at any
          time, and having failed to make that investigation it illy becomes any Senator upon this
          floor to hold him up as authority why his investigation should be made. And I will repeat
          that at the time Treasurer Cooper came into possession of this office, the authority upon
          which the Senator from Lake professes to make this investigation had an advisory talk with
          the State Treasurer and urged him to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors in
          reference to the State funds and not to withdraw them from the banks of the city. And in
          addition I will say now that Governor Porter at that time was a director of one of the
          banks, and in that bank the Treasurer had kept part of the funds of the State of Indiana;
          hence the Governor was interested in having these funds kept there. He said it would
          destroy the credit nd cripple the business interests of the city to have the State's money
          withdrawn from the banks of the city.</p>
         <p>We have sought to avoid an exposure of this conversation between Governor Porter and the
          Treasurer of State, but in view of the insinuations that have come to us from the
          Republican side of this chamber that we are wishing to smother the investigation of this
          office, we have felt called upon to show our position by revealing this conversation and I
          feel that I betray no confidence in thus relieving the pressure upon the Democratic side
          of the house form the insinuations made by the Senator from Lake. I advocate as much care
          over the people of the State, her funds and finances as any Senator upon this floor, and I
          don't wish any Republican Senator to impugn my motives in moving that this resolution be
          passed. I stand upon the Democratic side of this chamber, and I believe we are more
          interested in this matter than the Republicans are. If there is any dereliction of duty on
          the part of the Treasurer of State we want to know it. We want to wash our hands and leave
          our skirts clear form screening that officer for neglect of duty. When the opposite side
          seek to impugn our motives we have a right to resent that imputation. As the Republican
          side, through the Senator from Lake, has had its say and I have spoken in behalf of the
          Democratic side, I hope, of this Chamber, I demand the previous question.</p>
         <p>SEVERAL SENATORS: I hope you will not do that.</p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I will withdraw it.</p>
         <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I shall vote in favor of this resolution. When a resolution
          was before the Senate a few days ago providing for an investigation into the office of
          State Treasurer, I doubted the propriety of such resolution. I doubt the right of any
          Senator to inquire into the action of any public officer of State, because I re <pb n="88"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-088"/> garded it in this light: that an officer in any other
          department of the Government, who takes an oath of office, understands his position, his
          oath and his duty, about as well as a member of the Senate, and is as much entitled to act
          within the scope of his authority as we are to act independently of any other department
          of the State Government. But I found upon the statute book this proviso [Reads], and the
          Governor having stated in a message to the General Assembly that he considered the funds
          of the State not sufficiently secure, I regard it that the time has when it is proper for
          the General Assembly to adopt a resolution to investigate that question: that we might
          inquire into it and know whether other legislation is necessary and proper. For that
          reason I voted for the resolution, and should have voted for it just as promptly, whether
          the State Treasurer had been of one political party or the other. I don't regard it as a
          political question. Now, sir, we have no law with which I am familiar which authorizes the
          Senate to investigate the action of the Governor of the State, upon that or any other
          question, and especially after his term of office has expired. But we have a precedent on
          that subject, and that precedent is to the effect that the Legislature may authorize such
          an investigation. I recollect in the session of 1867, after Governor Morton had
          practically retired from the office which he held for six years a Democratic member from
          the County of Allen introduced a resolution authorizing an investigation into the
          management of the contingent fund of the State by Governor Morton. Although the resolution
          had to be written for the member it was introduced by him. I am glad to say the Republican
          Legislature, having a large majority, adopted that resolution and caused the investigation
          to be made. With that precedent before me I shall vote again to investigate the action of
          the Governor where it relates to the charge concerning the State Treasurer. The
          investigation into the case of Governor Morton had two good results, one of which I know,
          and that is the examination resulted in showing that the accounts had been correctly kept,
          every dollar was accounted for, and it put a quietus upon the clamor made upon that
          subject. It had another good result and that is, it was found that the system of keeping
          accounts was so perfect that it has been adopted and followed by the State officers ever
          since. </p>
         <p>Believing an investigation if carried out in good faith according to the terms of this
          resolution, will bring before this Senate and Legislature information we desire, and that
          it will report to us the condition of the Treasury, and the manner in which the funds have
          been kept; and having the utmost faith in the management of the State's funds by the
          officers in charge, I shall vote for this resolution, and hope every member of the Senate
          will do likewise. Let us have an investigation wherever the law authorizes it. Let us know
          what is done with the people's moeny as far as the law enables us to inquire into it.</p>
         <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Tipton, moved to amend the House concurent resolution by adding thereto
          the following:</p>
         <p>"And such committee shall have the authority to send for persons and papers, administer
          oaths to witnesses, have access to all books, papers, vouchers and documents in posession
          of the Treasurer of State that pertain to the business of said officer and shall make full
          and thorough investigation of the condition of the State Treasury"</p>
         <p>It was agreed to without a division.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAY moved to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
         <p>This motion was rejected by yeas, 12; nays, 30</p>
         <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE said: I believe the law is very defective relating to the office of Treasurer
          of State. I can see no harm to come from an investigation, therefore I shall vote against
          the motion to reconsider the amendment of the Senator from Tipton. I vote no.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, when his name was called, said: I don't believe it is right to
          investigate any public officer unless sufficient charges have been preferred against him
          by a properly constituted tribunal. I don't believe it is right then to investigate the
          conduct of any public officer upon mere rumor. The resolution first introduced in the
          Senate was vague in its character; it had not the merits of a bill of discovery, because
          in that kind of an instrument you have to set out the character of the evidence you intend
          to discover, and for that reason I voted against the resolution of the Senator from Wayne
          (Mr. Foulke).</p>
         <p>I am willing to vote for an investigation of the Treasurer of State, or any other
          officer of State, when the investigation is placed upon foot by proper machinery and
          contain specific charges, such as an intelligent man may base an investigation upon. This
          whole matter is predicated upon a message of a Governor of the State, wherein he by
          implication, charges that there is something wrong in the office of Treasurer of State. We
          have heard that message read, and we heave read it since it was delivered, and I am
          willing to say that the facts stated by the Governor of Indiana upon the occasion do not
          justify the conclusion that he drew in his message. I would not investigate anybody upon
          such a charge. The charge, it seems to me, grew out of something existing behind it -
          something that had malice in it; something of the character that plainly shows the people
          of Indiana that Albert G. Porter and John J. Cooper have had a personal difficulty, and in
          order to assail him in a message to th General Assembly he did it under cover of a claim
          that he was doing justice to the people of Indiana by calling their attention to an
          existing fact; and then to make it appear that he was fair and not charging an officer
          with something that did not exist, and that were was no other motive behind, he casts over
          another officer of State a great lot of taffy and dresses <pb n="89"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-089"/> up the Auditor of State in a kind of a Mother Hubbard sort of a
          dress. [Laughter] I don't want anything thrown in the way of the wheels of an
          investigation: I want it to come speedy and prompt and made by the proper persons.
          Therefore I say this amendment ought not to pass, because if it does the resolution is in
          effect killed, for it will have to go back to the House of Representatives, and the House
          has placed itself on record against that very kind of an amendment. I know there is
          nothing wrong in the office of John J. Cooper. I know John J. Cooper stands as fair as
          Albert G. Porter, and his record for financial honestly is as good. </p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, when his name was called, said: The Governor says to the General
          Assembly that there should be an investigation of the State finances. Whether that
          statement is founded upon mere suspicion or upon actual knowledge I do not know. If the
          Governor had said there in fact did exist some trouble I would vote for this resolution
          and amendment; but as he simply casts a suspicion I don't intend to vote for the
          amendment, and I vote "aye."</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD, when his name was called, said: The resolution, as it comes from the House,
          provides for an investigation as to whether Governor Porter was correct in the charge he
          made against Mr. Cooper. In order to have an investigation that amounts to anything, that
          committee must have power to send for persons and papers to investigate both. I don't
          believe in dodging. I believe in saying, in plain language, that it is necessary to
          investigate Governor Porter at the same time. I believe in going to the bottom of it. I
          don't propose to have it go out to the people of the State I was afraid to have a
          Democratic officer of State investigated. [Applause.] The Senator from Jennings says the
          result of adopting this amendment will be that the House of Representatives will kill the
          resolution. I say, if there is to be any responsibility for killing this investigation let
          it rest with the House; the Senate will be cleared of it. Therefore, I vote "no."</p>
         <p>Mr. MAY: I was in the chair when my name was called, and I want to say that I made this
          motion to reconsider from the fact that there seemed to be some disposition to, and in
          order that there might be a free expression of sentiment upon this subject. I believe if
          we are going to investigate, it ought to be a full and a fair investigation. While I am of
          opinion that the Governor in his message has said nothing sufficient to warrant an
          investigation, yet, as the two branches of the General Assembly have determined to have an
          investigation, I want a full, free and fair investigation. For that reason I am in favor
          of the resolution.</p>
         <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded, so the motion to reconsider was
          rejected.</p>
         <p>On motion by Mr. FOULKE the House concurrent resolution as amended was adopted by yeas
          41, nays 2. He also moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that motion on the
          table.</p>
         <p>The latter motion was agreed to, and then Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, from the Committee On Rights and Privileges, returned Mr. Townsend's bill (H.
         R. 99) to abolish all distinctions of race and color with a recommendation that it be
         indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved that it be recommitted to the Committee on Judiciary.</p>
        <p> Mr. TOWNSEND I am decidedly interested in that bill. I am interested in it all, the more
         because it does not affect only the 42,000 colored people in this State, but it affects a
         large class of white citizens as well, and before the recommitment of that bill I should be
         very glad to be favored with the opportunity of making some remarks in reference to the
         bill, and I think I would be able to show most conclusively that the colored people of this
         state are discriminated against. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I can not see any reason why this bill should be recommitted. The only
         right the colored people do not, possess is the right to be members of the State Militia.
         That is a constitutional provision which can not be reached by a bill of this character.
         The only right which is not already guaranteed is the right of amalgamation, and I am
         opposed to giving them that right.</p>
        <p> Mr. TOWNSEND: That is just the a attitude I assume upon this question. I take the
         position that the law as it now stands, does discriminate, both against the white and
         black.</p>
        <p> The motion to recommit was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. McHENRY'S bill [H. R. 51 to provide for the election of County School Superintendents
         at the general election of 1886, and that they first secure a teacher' license from the
         State Board of Education, was reported back with an amendment that the time of the first
         election be in 1887.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, offered an amendment requiring the County Superintendents to
         hold special professional license, instead of teacher's license. He said: There is a great
         demand for an elevation in the standard of County Superintendents, and with this demand I
         believe the license proposed would be one of the highest incentives that was ever offered
         to any young man to press forward and secure it. We would find in every county in the State
         ten, fifteen or twenty young men applying for this license.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTON: I think the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tippecanoe is nothing
         more than fair, and should be adopted.</p>
        <pb n="90" xml:id="VAA8558-22-090"/>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH offered a substitute striking out all referring to the qualifications of the
         County Superintendents. He said: I have had some experience as a County Superintendent, and
         I have had the pleasure of knowing a good many County Superintendents of this State. The
         gentleman [Mr. Smith] seems to think we need a bill requiring County Superintendents to
         have particular qualifications. I think the County Superintendents now are of a high
         standard, and that they are constantly raising the standard of education. The amendment
         means to knock it out of politics. I have heard no clamor from the people on this subject;
         I have seen no memorials requesting that the County Superintendents be specially qualified,
         and I don't think the people are demanding it. </p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I have the good fortune to represent a county that has always been competent
         under the existing laws to select her own County Superintendents. I belong to a county that
         ranks among the first counties of the State in education interests. Our County
         Superintendents have been taken from among the teachers of the county. They have given
         satisfaction, and we have always been equal to the emergency and have elected good ones.
         Therefore I shall oppose any class of legislation that will put a restraint upon the people
         of any county. They have given satisfaction, and we have always been equal to the emergancy
         and have elected good ones. Therefore I shall oppose any class of legislation that will put
         a restraint upon the people of any county telling them what kind of a superintendent they
         shall have Under our present laws, Indiana has advanced to the position as foremost State
         in the Union in education. Therefore our system is and must be a wise one and I shall
         always oppose any bill which shall compel a County Superintendent to have special
         professional license. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I hope the substitute of the gentleman from Posey [Mr. French] will not pass
         While much has been said on the common school system, t does seem to me a little strange
         that teacher sin the common schools who are now compelled by law to be examined before
         entering the school, are compelled to be examined by men who are not fitted for that
         position by education.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I think it is a recognized fact that the different professions are always
         reaching out for more power. We find the doctors, the lawyers and the school teachers
         continually reaching out for more power and taking away from the people. We never hear of a
         court of limited jurisdiction; doctors and school teachers are similar in that respect. I
         am opposed to delegating the rights of the people to a few men. The people have a right to
         say who shall be their Superintendent as much as any other body has to appoint their own
         officers. Our school Superintendents rank with the school Superintendents of any other
         State. The people are not going to elect anybody who don't know anything the duties or is
         not fitted for the office County School Superintendent. I am in favor of the
         substitute.</p>
        <p>The substitute was adopted, and the bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

         <head rend="center">PAUPER CHILDREN.</head>
         <p>Mr. Deem's bill [H. R. 39] to authorize County Commissioners to make provisions for
          pauper children, comping up on the second reading with a favorable report thereon - </p>
         <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved that the Superintendent of County Asylums be required to send the
          pauper children to school.</p>
         <p>Mr. ADAMS: I don't think this is a wise motion. If the Superintendent of County Asylums
          would do this he would overflow all the public schools in that vicinity. It would be an
          unjust burden on the schools.</p>
         <p>Mr. HARRELL: There is a law upon the statute book which requires the Board of
          Commissioners of each county to see that all the children in these poor asylums, of sound
          mind, be put in the charge of a matron and be provided with a house and lot,a nd that she
          has to see that they are properly sent to the county schools of the county. The law as it
          now stands on the statute book fixes a home for the pauper children. I think the amendment
          to the law is unnecessary, therefore I am opposed to it. </p>
         <p>I find this trouble the county where I live: That we have not a sufficient number of
          pauper children to require the employment of a matron. I expect this is the condition of
          half the counties in the State. Therefore I am in favor of the amendment.</p>
         <p>Mr. TAYLOR: This amendment was instigated simply by what I was informed to be the
          condition of things in my own county. I have prepared my amendment to cover those wants.
          As the gentleman from Owen has said, we know that Superintendants of the county poor have
          only two or three or four children under their charge, and a county does not care to go
          expense of building asylums for so few children. The children are only there for a few
          months, and where is the necessity of making the county build asylums for taking care of
          only two or three or four children? This amendment is to require the Board of
          Commissioners to compel these Superintendants of County Asylums to do their duty. In our
          county it is a growing shame that has not been done. It has been remarked that the
          children have school privileges. That is true when they have guardians or parents who are
          human. But this amendment is for the protection of children who have no parents or
          guardians or protectors.</p>
         <p>Mr. DEEM: Gentleman are laboring under a misapprehension as to what this bill means. The
          object of the bill is to relieve the school districts where these children are in asylums,
          whether in the Poor House or under the care of a matron. Thew hole object is to authorize
          the Boards of Commissioners when in their judgment it is necessary, to make provision for
          the education of pauper children.</p>
         <p>The amendment was agreed to, and the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

        <p>Mr. Williams 7 per cent. interest bill [H. R. 146] being read the second time - </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING moved to strike out "seven" and insert "eight" in lieu.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: That would be folly That is the statute as it now stands. My bill proposes
         to reduce the contract rate of interest from 8 per cent to 7. There is room for only two
         opinions: Either the rate ought to be reduced, or it ought to remain as it is. In fairness
         to that class of people who are demanding a reduction in the rate of interest the bill
         ought to pass. I move to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS moved to strike out the word "seven" and insert in lieu thereof the word
         "six"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe: This begins to look not like a bill to regulate the price of
         money, but to drive all the money out of the State. There are a few men on this floor whose
         districts are absolutely flooded with money; and where there are men going around crying
         money to loan at 6 per cent., and find no takers. But I have never been in those districts.
         TO-day I have been looking over a schedule of the rate of interest in several States, and
         we have just as low as any other State.</p>
        <p>Mr. CARTWRIGHT made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I am sorry amendments have been offered to this bill; either to complicate
         it, or to make an occasion for members put themselves on record in favor of a lower rate of
         interest. Six per cent. is too much of a reduction. I am certain this clamor for a
         reduction of interest will be satisfied with a 7 per cent. rate. The fact that these
         galleries are filled from time to time with laboring men is not because there is a
         financial depression in our cities. It is known there is depression in every class of
         trade; in all manufacturing establishments, and in every city throughout the length and
         breadth of the land. It has been said that this bill ought to be entitled a bill to drive
         capital out of the State. Gentleman, that is the same cry made when the bill was introduced
         to reduce the contract rate of interests from 10 to 8 per cent. It was said no money would
         remain in Indiana. These objectors were false prophets. No money-lender in the State of
         Indiana took <pb n="92" xml:id="VAA8558-22-092"/> down his shingle after that reduction was
         made. I will make the prophecy if we reduce the legal rate of interest to 6 per cent. there
         will be as much money in the State of Indiana as there is now. I do hope that this
         amendment will be defeated. </p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: I offered the amendment to reduce the contract rate of interest from 7 to
         6 per cent in perfect good faith. I believe the time has come when interest can very well
         be reduced to 6 per cent. I know a large amount of money lying idle, and if the rate is
         reduced to 6 per cent, there would be much more money borrowed.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I hope this amendment will not prevail. A very strong reason against it is
         that there are places where money will command more than 6 per cent. Then we have a large
         school fund loaned 7 per cent., and this bill would reduce the rate on the school fund. If
         money from outside of the State can be had at 6 per cent, the income from the school fund
         should not be reduced by the passage of such a bill as the one under consideration. The
         worst thing we can do for the laboring man would be to reduce the rate of interest to 6 per
         cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippacanoe: Will the fixing of the rate of interest at 6 or 7 per cent.
         bring back prosperity to the country? Do manufacturers turn men out of employment because
         it is a question of 6 or 7 per cent.? The cry is not for a reduction of the rate of
         interests to 6 per cent. I am willing to leave the rate as it stands upon the statute. Two
         years ago, when I made a motion to make the rate of interest 7 per cent., the gentleman
         from Knox (Mr. Williams) was the first man to move to lay it on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: It seems to me that the gentlemen in the discussion of this question lose
         sight of one material fact, th supply and demand. An amendment to fix the contract rate
         rate of interest at 6 per cent. would kill the bill, and it seems to me now is a good time
         to test the sense of the House on this question as ny other time. It seems to me the law on
         the subject of interest in this Sate is one of the very best that could be enacted, which
         provides for a contract rate of 8 per cent. Of course if there is plenty of money to be had
         it can be borrowed at 6 per cent. But just as sure as a 6 per cent. law is passed money
         would leave our State, and instead of such a measure assisting the poor man he would be
         unable to borrow money at all. I am opposed to the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I am in favor of getting as low a rate as can be had, but I don't believe it
         would be best to pass a law reducing the rate of interest in this State to 6 per cent. To
         say the least, 6 per cent is a very low rate of interest. It is claimed that such a
         reduction would be for the benefit of the poor man. That may be true in one sense, b that
         class of men are much more interested in general business prosperity of the country than in
         borrowing a small amount of money at a low rate of interest. A reduction of the rate from 8
         to 6 per cent. would disturb the business of the State. A great deal of the business of our
         State is done on borrowed capital. If I thought business interests would not be shaken by I
         would be in favor of the amendment. I do not fear a reduction to 7 per cent., but I do fear
         a reduction to 6 per cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I am not in favor of the amendment. It would be an injury to the business
         interests of the State. There are thousands of mortgages falling due soon and it would be
         absolutely impossible to renew their loans unless the lenders could get more than 6 per
         cent. To the borrowing class it would be a positive injury. And while I would be in favor
         of reducing the rate to 6 per cent. if it would not drive money away from the State to
         places more favorable, yet I believe at this time it would be a bad step to take. I am not
         quite sure but that am in favor of letting the interest law remain as it is at the present,
         until a higher authority than the Legislature of Indiana has regulated this difficulty and
         brought ust he remedy - until the $400 000 000 of money now rusting in the United States
         Treasury is set free and sent into the business channels of this country</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: I am in favor of this amendment. The fact is at the rate of 8 per cent. at
         the present time is not giving employment to the workingmen of this country. There is a
         desire to give them employment. There is money not loaned because the business men of the
         coutnry can not afford to pay 8 per cent., why not reduce the rate to 6 per cent.? There is
         some remedy for the present business stagnation, and that remedy is to reduce the rate to 6
         per cent. Farms can't afford to pay 8 per cent, and therefore for these, among other
         reasons, I am in favor of reducing the rate. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: My recollection is that when the law was changed from 10 to 8 per cent. the
         same arguments were used by the gentlemen who opposed the reduction that are now being
         used. I desire in my humble capacity to stand for the people of this State, and I am in
         favor of the reduction of the rate of interest. I do not believe a reduction will drive
         from our State money so we can not secure it. I believe the price of our products and the
         price of our labor have been reduced fully 2 per cent. within the past four years, so that
         6 per cent. fully represents 8 per cent. four years ago. The cry from the opposition to the
         reduction is what we can not borrow on the on the proposed reduction, but I undertake to
         say money holders do not loan money unless they obtain good collateral. They require first
         mortgages on real estate. In just to the laboring men of Indiana I insist the rate of
         interest ought to be reduced. Labor and capital are represented as joint partners. The rate
         of interest has <pb n="93" xml:id="VAA8558-22-093"/> much to do with the amount of money
         laborers receive. The farmer generally depends as has been said, upon borrowed capital. If
         they have to pay a high rate of interest, they have to pay a correspondingly low rate to
         their help. If they borrow at a correspondingly low rate of interest, they can afford to
         pay more to their laborers. The result of a reduction will prove beneficial to the
         interests of the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: It seems to me we ought to reduce the rate of interest on moneys
         to 6 per cent. TO do justice to the mass of the people, let us make the reduction. I am
         decidedly in favor of the amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: Just at this time I think we can reduce the rate 1 per cent., because Eastern
         capitalists are only asking 7 per cent. for their money here in Indiana. I think we can
         safely enact a law reducing the rate to 7 per cent., but it would be fully to reduce it to
         6 per cent. I would favor voting down this amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under
         its operations the amendment was agreed to by yeas, 39; nays 33.</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading by yeas, 60; nays, 12.</p>

        <head rend="center">NEW INSANE ASYLUMS.</head>
        <p>The President pro tem. [Mr. Magee] announced the special order being his New Insane
         Asylum Equipment bill [S. 65], and called the Senator from Jay [Mr. Smith] to the
         chair.</p>
        <p>The amendments reported by the Committee on Public Buildings [see page - of the Brevier
         Reports] being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE repeated the history of the legislation which resulted in the passage of the
         bill last session providing for the erection of three new insane asylums, designed to take
         care of about 1,200 persons and expected to be ready for occupancy between the months of
         September and December, 1886. According to the census of 1880 thee are 3,542 insane persons
         int he State. One thousand four hundred twenty are now at the main hospital near
         Indianapolis and the others are not subject to any hospital treatment. From 1850 to 1880
         the population increased two to one, while the insane ratio increased six to one. Indiana
         has a less ratio of hospital treatment than any State in the Union, and spends less money
         for the care and treatment of the insane than any other State in the Union. it has been
         uniform rule that at insane asylums the cost is about $1,000 per patient. It will cost in
         this State something less than $900 for each patient to be taken care of. Indiana is a
         wealthy State and able to make this expenditure. The State debt does not exceed the debt of
         Marion County very much, and her valuation is 100 per cent more than that of this county.
         Two years ago no man thought to object that it was ill advised. We went before the people
         last year, and not a single newspaper or citizen raised his voice in condemnation of the
         General Assembly for making the appropriation for this purpose. If this bill be opposed on
         the ground that we ought not to expend the money under the present condition of business
         affairs, that objection can be met with the statement that we have more taxables than ever,
         as the next assessment will show and the increased revenue at the present rate of taxation
         will complete these buildings for the care of the most pitiable and sorrowful condition of
         human helplessness. If the completion of these buildings is postponed over two, three or
         four years, all the work that has been done will all be lost. The brick, lumber and tile on
         the grounds are perishable property. The contractors have entered on their work, and it is
         not to be considered for a moment that this General Assembly will break the faith of form
         General Assemblies.</p>
        <p>One reason why these buildings were located in different parts of the State was that if
         fire should overtake one there would be another asylum which could afford protection. Only
         the other day an insane asylum at Kankakee, Ill, was destroyed by fire. [Reads a letter
         from the Superintendent of the Indiana Insane Asylum, stating that institution to be
         without protection from fire and urging legislative remedy.] These buildings ought to be
         completed as rapidly as possible. If the insane increase as rapidly in the future as they
         have the past twenty years we will have to build one or two more.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the bill so as to appropriate a sufficient sum to complet5e but
         one of these insane asylums ready <pb n="95" xml:id="VAA8558-22-095"/> for occupancy, the
         present Board of Commissioners to determine which one. He said: The Senate will not be
         called upon to act on a more important bill than this. It proposes to appropriate a very
         large sum of money, and before we vote this vast sum of money out of the Treasury we should
         know what is absolutely required. There is no Senator upon this floor who would go farther
         to provide for the unfortunate, the indigent or the feeble-minded, or that other class of
         people on whom God has laid the heavy hand of affliction, the insane, than he. But unless
         it is absolutely necessary to appropriate this large sum of money we ought not do it; we
         ought not to lay this additional burden upon a people already heavily burdened with
         taxation, unless it is absolutely necessary. Let us see if there is not some way to carry
         out the letter and the spirit of the contract, between the State and the contractors, who
         have agreed to erect these buildings, without appropriating nearly a million of dollars -
         $800,000 - as called for in this bill. </p>
        <p>The sum total that these three institutions shall cost is put down at $1,213,785 09.
         Twelve hundred thousand dollars and over is proposed to be appropriated now in the short
         space of year for the erection of these three Insane Asylum. A detailed estimate of
         essentials not yet contracted for is put down at $263,500. That is the amount not
         contracted for, and nobody will be injured if this Legislature fails to make an
         appropriation for that sum of money, because nobody has taken a contract for any part of
         it. IT is shown by the report of the Commissioners that the amount of liabilities for which
         contracts have been entered into and no appropriations made amounts to $324,386.34;
         $418,386.34 will enable the Commissioners to carry out the contracts already entered into
         and complete one of these institutions ready for occupancy by the time the next General
         Assembly well meet, and leave the session to provide for the reception of inmates and
         finish the other two.</p>
        <p>This will make a difference between the amount asked to be appropriated by this bill -
         $683 800, and the amount appropriated, $418,386 34 - $265,413 61 - a difference of nearly
         one half.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, can we do more than this; can we appropriate this immense sum of money
         without raising the taxes eighteen or twenty cents on the $100, or borrowing the money to
         complete these buildings, or to carry on the State Government or maintain the existing
         charities of he State? Many other appropriations must be made, ought to be made, they must
         be made. The State Government must be provided for. The insane under treatment must be
         provided for. The deaf, the blind, the soldiers' orphans and feeble-minded are asking and
         must have aid for their support and education. The penal and reformatory institutions must
         be looked to, and their needs provided for. Our colleges and universities are knocking at
         the door of this General Assembly, asking aid and a generous support. This Legislation will
         be required to appropriate money for other necessities and charities - can we make all
         these vast appropriations and be just and faithful to those who bear the heat and burden of
         the day; who eat their bread in the sweat of their brow, and toll on, day after day, with
         the promise and a hope that these burdens, which are growing heavier as the years roll on,
         will soon begin to lighten? But each year they see the accumulation of taxes, promises
         broken, and additional privations of the necessaries of life, and beggary, poverty and
         wretchedness are found just around the corner, while we sit here unmindful of destitution
         everywhere, and vote away fabulous sums of money with a cruel and unsparing hand to be
         unjustly and oppressively swung from the taxpayers of the State to gratify the desires and
         ambitions of these sections or localities. Can we vote this appropriation without being
         unfaithful to a confiding cinstituency, without adding sorrow and oppression to the cup
         which is already full to overflowing.</p>
        <p>If you make this appropriation how do you propose to get the money? If you get it by
         taxation you must raise the tax levy to 18 or 20 cents on the $100 Nobody believes that
         ought to be done. But if you don't do that you must borrow the money. And it is not the
         thing to borrow the money. And it is not the thing to borrow money to build houses with,
         unless they are absolutely necessary. it would be reckless extravagance,a nd would be
         unfaithfulness to the people of Indiana to levy another mill of tax upon the already heavy
         burden of taxation they now pay.</p>
        <p>[The Senate took a recess of twenty minutes to hear United States. Senator Voorhees
         address the House of Representatives.]</p>
        <p>In conversation yesterday with Judge Robinson, one of the Insane Asylum Commissioners, he
         said it was his deliberative judgment that the Legislature ought to provide for the
         completion of these institutions; that there ought to be an appropriation made sufficient
         to carry on the work so the buildings would not damage, but there should be an
         appropriation made for the completion of one only. No Senator would vote more cheerfully
         for the appropriation asked for if necessary and the Treasury was in a condition to bear
         it, but the three asylums are unnecessary, and the necessity will not warrant raising the
         money, either by taxation or by borrowing. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to refer the bill to the Committee on Finance.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I believe it will be conceded that the bill for the creation of three new
         insane asylums had no firmer friend than myself, nor do I feel disposed to stop their
         erection by failing to vote appropriations: but I desire to call attention to the fact that
         the committee reporting this bill may perhaps feel a lively interest in secur <pb n="96"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-096"/> ing so large an appropriation. Among others the committee
         includes the Senators from Vanderburg, Cass and Wayne, in each of which counties is located
         one of these institutions. While I would not reflect unwarrantably upon the committee, it
         does seem to they may be prejudiced to some extent by the locality from which they come.
         And they come to the Senate asking an appropriation of over a million of dollars - an
         appropriation which will create a deficiency in the Treasury, without showing where or how
         they money is to be raised. If there was any way pointed by which this money might be
         appropriated without creating a deficit, I would feel more inclined to vote for the
         engrossment of this bill. I wish it to be understood, if it can be shown that any amount of
         money, no matter how large, is absolutely necessary to provide for the helpless insane of
         the State, I stand ready to vite it; but I do not stand ready to vote it until I know how
         the money is to be raised, and until I know it is the least possible amount of money that
         will do the work. I therefore support the motion made by the Senator from Allen and Whitley
         [Mr. Brown]. </p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It will be remembered that I heartily supported the measure to erect one
         insane asylum, but when there was coupled with that a proposition to erect two additional
         asylums; my vote stands recorded against. We are in the attitude of a man crossing a
         stream, we have got in the middle and can not now recede. In the light of the statistics of
         the State of Indiana, as shown in the census report of 1880, it is necessary that we
         complete these asylums. I stand ready to support the measure now to support the measure now
         to continue this work to its completion. I don't believe, in view of the authority granted
         by the last Legislature, that we can honorably recede from these contracts. In view of the
         statement that there is now some 2,000 insane people in the county asylums, and provided
         for by their friends, and the necessity of better provision being made this class of
         people, I will favor this bill going to the engrossment, with the understanding that there
         is to be some provision made, and made at once, by which these funds can be secured, either
         by a loan at not to exceed 3 per cent., or else provide in a bill for a benevolent
         fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't know why this bill should to the Committee on Finance. The Committee
         on Public Buildings simply reported this bill back, changing nothing except to cut down the
         appropriation for the maintenance of these asylums. The Finance Committee has no
         information outside of general information. That committee can shed no new light upon this
         question. I do not want this bill to become law if it will bankrupt the State or interfere
         with the business interests of the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I live in a county that has no direct interest in this matter. I voted two
         years ago in favor of building three additional insane asylums and I shall now support the
         bill that has been brought forward and recommended by the Committee on Public Buildings. I
         don't think it is right that this matter should be referred to another committee. It is a
         most singular proceeding.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: This bill was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings simply to find out
         whether it was right and proper we should report in favor of making these appropriations;
         whether the money was needed and whether the buildings were in such condition that they
         ought to completed or not. We looked over the matter; there were eight Senators on that
         committee, and everyone of those eight have signed the report recommending that the bill do
         pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON (interposing): My name was signed to the report, but I was mistaken in the
         bill and the amount of money appropriated.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: Only seven members were present, and after all signed it I went to Senator
         Thompson and he objected to the bill. I told him we had cut down the sum for maintenance
         $160,000 and under the circumstances he signed the bill. Of course if he was mistaken he
         can withdraw his name.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I did not look at the bill. I signed the report under a
         misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: We have taken an oath to support the Constitution of the State as Senators, and
         it is our duty to provide for these unfortunate people. We know there are 2,000 insane
         persons unprovided for in the State. We can complete these asylums now as well as at any
         other time. The foundations are begun and there are millions of brick on the grounds,
         beside lumber and other materials. It is true the State can stop the buildings by refusing
         to make appropriations, but the contractors were led to believe the work would go ahead,
         and if it is stopped it will bankrupt every one of them, I think we can go before our
         constitutions and defend our action in voting for this bill. I venture to say there is not
         a single man on this floor in the other House, who is instructed to oppose the finishing or
         the building of these asylums. We need them, and they should be finished without delay. If
         we can't do it by taxation in ore two years, let us borrow the money, and if we can't get
         it at 3 1/2 percent., I don't care if we pay more. it is our duty to build them now. It is
         not right to recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance. We want to decide first whether
         we will build them, and then it is the duty of the Committee on Ways and Means to make the
         necessary provisions for the money. There is no use to delay the matter; let us have a fair
         and square vote upon it. </p>
        <p>The motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Finance was rejected by yeas, 11; nays,

        <p>The following message was received by the Senate from Governor Gray:</p>
        <floatingText>

            <salute>Gentleman of the Senate:</salute>
           </opener>
           <p>The lot on which the Indiana State Normal School building is situated was formerly the
            Vigo County Seminary lot, and was on July 30, 1853, under and pursuant to an act of the
            General Assembly, approved June 12, 1858, sold by the Auditor and Treasurer of Vigo
            County to the Common School Corporation of the city of Terre Haute, the purchase money
            to be payable in ten annual installments, as provided by the statute.</p>
           <p>On March 22, 1867, the city of Terre Haute executed its note for the balance of the
            principal and interest of the purchase money owing for said lot by the school
            corporation of the city of Terre Haute, to the county of Vigo for the use of the school
            fund.</p>
           <p>Th County Auditor, on the order of the Commissioners of Vigo County, executed a deed
            to the city of Terre Haute for said lot, and the city conveyed the lot to the Trustees
            of the State normal School as a part of the donation to secure the location of Normal
            School at that city, and in which donation the School Trustees of the city of Terre
            Haute joined. </p>
           <p>In 188[] the State, on the relation of the Attorney General, for the use of the school
            fund, instituted a suit on the nete against the city of Terre Haute in the Vigo Superior
            Court. The city demurred to the complaint, and the demurrer was sustained. The case was
            then appealed to the Supreme Court, by which the judgement of the Court below was
            affirmed. The Court above held that the city of Terre Haute had no power to make the
            alleged purchase of the seminary lot, nor did it have the power to bind itself by the
            promissory notes given.</p>
           <p>Therefore, the city had no title to the seminary lot when it made a deed for the same
            to the Trustees of the Normal School, nor the power to make such donation if it did have
            the title.</p>
           <p>It seems to be well settled that municipal corporations have no power to make
            donations of corporate property, and certainly that School Trustees have no no power to
            make a donation of property held by them in trust for school purposes.</p>
           <p>The equitable title to the lot is in the common school corporation of the city of
            Terre Haute, and the State has no title to the ground on which the Indiana State Normal
            School Building stands. </p>
           <p>The matter is submitted to you for such examination and action as your judgment may
            demand. A communication similar to this has been transmitted to the House of

        <p><hi rend="sc">GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF INDIANA, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN</hi>
         - It was with no purpose to interrupt your proceedings except for a few moments that I have
         called this afternoon to pay my respects to you. I did so earnestly desire to look upon
         this Legislature that I could not withstand the temptation to cross the mountains and see
         you together as I saw most of you singly during the recent canvass of the State.</p>
        <p>I desire to renew my acquaintance so pleasantly made at that time, and to embrace the
         opportunity to express, as far as in the feeble power of words to express, the gratitude of
         my heart for your generous confidence in your recent action. I have been now for a number
         of years one of the representatives of the State of Indiana in the highest representative
         position she has to give. I can claim but one merit, and that, I believe, the people have
         granted, and that is that i have aimed under all circumstances, earnestly, and without
         evasion or reservation, to stand by the interests of the people of Indiana as I understood
         them. And in saying this I can speak without partisanship or lines of thought, for I can
         appeal to the searcher of our hearts that no man, woman or child of any party or of any
         complexion of politics or religion, or even race and color, has ever applied to me for
         anything within my power to grant in the way of assistance that I have failed to respond to
         the best of my ability. </p>
        <p>To my political friends on this occasion I tender my sincere heartfelt thanks; to my
         political opponents I have non but the best wishes and the utmost kinds to express.</p>
        <p>The public man who expects to be successful must at least be faithful to the people. I
         think we are prone to underrate the perception or intelligence of the people: and how
         quickly they understand whether a man is in earnest upon their aide or not. When this
         Government was founded the great question prevailing in the minds of thousands of men was
         whether a government of the people could stand; whether a government could be based upon
         the intelligence and the virtue of the people unrestrained by kingly authority of power. It
         was a question yet unsolved in this history of men but it has been solved in favor of the
         theories of our great Revolutionary ancestors. We have reached a period when it behooves us
         to look closely to the issues which will begin appearing; issues which involve the power
         and right to the power on the one hand, and the pretentions of corporate powers,
         monopolists, upon the other. In contests like these I shall stand as i have heretofore, to
         the best of my knowledge and ability, on the side of the laboring masses of the country, in
         the fields labor all the prosperity of this Nation is involved. The laboring interests of
         the country are to be cared for, and when I speak of these I speak with not the sligtest
         design of arraying, even in thought, the interests of labor and wealth, because in the
         business interests of this country lies the prosperity of the laboring man. The business
         interests of this country in the broadest sense embracing finance, revenue, and all kindred
         interests are connected intimately with the prosperity of the laboring man; and the wise
         man, the faithful man in public position, is truest to his trust when he does not make
         hostile issues between different classes of industry and wealth but tries to harmonize them
         and consequently increase the prosperity of the country. I will not proceed into any
         extended remarks that I might make upon this and kindred thoughts. One word, however, for
         our great and glorious State. You have in keeping here the interests of the greatest State,
         according to area and population, that lies under the American flag. Indiana is not of the
         large States in territory, not one of the large States in acreage or in square miles, but
         she ranks alongside of those who the largest in the American Union. In point of diversified
         interests, agricultural products, manufacture resources and products, as well as
         educational advantages, Indiana is second to no State.</p>
        <p>In the last thirty years she has made more progress in educating her people, spent more
         money per capita, according the number of men, women and children in her territory, than
         any other State in the Union or any other Commonwealth on the globe. </p>
        <p>I am not a States-right man in the sense of those who once believed that a State has
         right to break its relations with its Union. I never held such a thought in my breast; but
         at the same time, I have the keenest possible State pride in the State that I represent in
         the Senate of the United States, and I appreciate the continued compliment which this great
         State has bestowed upon me. You are the law-makers you legislate for future wealth and
         future prosperity and happiness, and you have wanted me to work with you in the seat of the
         General Government in doing my duty there. I can only say that I renew the vows that I took
         upon myself, when something more than seven years ago I took the oath of office to serve
         these people faithfully and well. Here in your presence now I renew these vows, that if
         life and health are granted me by the beneficient Providence for the next six years, I
         shall serve the interests of this State faithfully and well to the best of my ability.</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of Senator Voorhees' remarks loud calls were made for McDonald, and he
         responded as follows:</p>
        <p>
         <hi rend="sc">GENTLEMEN OF THE LEGISLATURE OF INDIANA - </hi> came here to join with you in
         paying our respects to our distinguished Senator-elect, and not to undertake to address
         you.l But, gentlemen, when Senator Vorhees referred to Indiana I knew it would be cold day
         when Daniel W. Vorhees could not speak a good word for Indiana, and it would be cold day
         that I would not willing listen to him, not for a brief time, but for any length of time,
         in discussing that subject. I am glad, fellow-citizens, that my fortunes have been cast in
         this State, where I have lived now for over fifty-five years, and hope to live the balance
         my days. One word I may say in addition to while Indiana is one of the most prosperous
         States in the Union, she has within her limits the largest proportion of homesteads and
         family homes of any State in the Union. We do not have large domains held by single
         persons; but farms or homes of honest industry, of independent American industry, ar found
         all over our State. When we have a political contest, it is no boy's play. Our political
         adversaries are worthy of our steel, and sometimes they are able to vanquish us and take
         away the prize, but when the battle is over we are friends together and citizens of the
         State of Indiana. Let me make one suggestion to you, that, perhaps, has not come into your
         minds with reference to the late political contest that has secured for my distinguished
         friend the seat in the United States Senate, and that is that proportion to its voting
         population than any State in the Union. [Applause.] I am speaking by the book, for
         according to the statistics, well authenticated, of the entire possible vote in Indiana of
         every man who is qualified under the constitution and laws of our State to vote, we voted
         within 7 per cent. of that whole voting population. While no other State came anywhere near
         to us. Ohio was next; she lacked but 12 per cent. West Virgina followed her and many States
         did not cast but half their votes. The returns show that while we were busy our adversaries
         were busy also, and every bush in the State of Indiana was shaken for <pb n="99"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-099"/> the vote that might be behind it. My friends, for our party to
         have triumphed under such circumstances is certainly a glorious victory, and I hope our
         Republican adversaries will never have any cause to complain. I think we will take good
         care of them. They are our fellow-citizens; they are not alien enemies that by some strange
         choice settled among us. We can't freeze ourselves without freezing them. </p>
        <p>Now, my friends, I have spoken longer than I intended to do, so I thank you kindly.</p>
        <p>Hon. William H. English was then called for. He said it was not his wish to make a
         speech. That he had attended only for the purpose of hearing our big-hearted and
         big-brained Senator, Daniel W. Voorhees. H said that in attributing these characteristics
         to his friend Voorhees, he did not wish to be understood as speaking disparagingly of our
         other Senator, as he considered Senator Harrison a gentleman of ability and thought that
         Indiana, as a whole, could afford to be proud of the ability of her representatives in the
         Unite States Senate.</p>

        <head rend="center">SOLDIER'S PENSIONS</head>
        <p>Mr FAULKNER, from the Committee on Federal Relations, returned Mr. May's resolution
         instructing and requesting Indiana Congressman to use their influence in favor of
         legislation amply providing for soldiers of the Mexican War [see page 31 of the Brevier
         Reports] with a recommendation that it be amended so as to insert the words "except
         Jefferson Davis," etc, etc</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: I am sorry the Committee on Federal Relations has honored
         Jefferson Davis by mentioning his name at all in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: That is my resolution. The amendment was proposed by Republican members of the
         committee, as I understand it, and without objection on my part.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend by adding these words: "Provided, however, hits shall not
         apply to Jefferson Davis in case he shall vote the Republican ticket for the balance of his
         life" [Laughter]</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: The Democratic members of the committee were satisfied to report that
         amendment to accommodate the Republican members.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: The amendment to the amendment is plainly out of order. Since the question as
         to Jefferson Davis has come up, it might not be inappropriate to say here that I have taken
         this view of that matter: While, of course, I should regret to see Mr. Davis pensioned,
         whose motives, I think, in attacking the American Union were not those of principle, but of
         ambition, that it was for personal purposes, and not because he believed in its principles,
         for he was a false, I think, to the principles of the so-called Confederacy as he was to
         those of the Union he sought to destroy - at the same time I feel unwilling that the
         insertion of his name in this resolution shall in any affect the claims of those who really
         are entitled to pensions. Since the matter has come before the Senate I would like to
         propose as a substitute for the amendment the following: [Reads] My motive in offering that
         amendment is this: If pensions to Mexican soldiers can be granted without the name of
         Jefferson Davis I think they should be so granted; and if the exclusion of his name is
         going to take away the right of any man that has performed his duty and is entitled to
         grateful recognition of the country, then I am in favor of throwing the door wide open. It
         seems to me my substitute expresses the matter as both parties desire. We don't want
         Jefferson Davis placed on the pension list if we can help it. He is a man whose crimes are
         a subject of detestation, but we don't want anybody else to suffer vicariously; therefore,
         I am in favor of leaving it to our Representatives in Congress, who can best judge whether
         the bringing up of his name or its exclusion is going to jeopardize the claims of those who
         are justly entitled to pensions.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: If the Senate would indulge me, I would like to say a word or
         two. ["Consent, consent."] I have had considerable to do with this subject for the last
         twelve years. I have been President of the Indiana Association of Veterans of the Mexican
         War, as well as Vice President of the National Association. I know Jefferson Davis is
         anxious to have his name mentioned in a pension bill as being excluded from its provisions.
         He has been entitled to draw a pension from the <pb n="101" xml:id="VAA8558-22-101"/>
         Government ever since the Battle of Buena Vista. He was wounded there, and never has and
         never will draw his pension. He has asked the committee to exclude him from the bill, but
         it never would honor him that much as to use his name; but it was fixed in the last bill
         that any man not a citizen of the United States, and laboring under the disabilities
         prescribed in the Fourteenth Amendment, could not get a pension. That will cut out Mr.
         Davis without naming him. I don't think I would honor him by mentioning his name in
         connection with this concurrent resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I hope the substitute will not prevail; not upon any question in relation to
         Jefferson Davis, because it was not my intention to bring that matter up in the original
         resolution, but because the original resolution goes further than the substitute, and that
         arrearage act of 1879 be repealed, and it also includes widows and orphans of soldiers in
         the late rebellion. If the substitute covered the whole ground I should have no
         objection.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I think the whole thing ought to be recommitted to the Committee on
         Federal Relations, therefore I move to recommit the original resolution, the report of the
         committee, the amendment and the substitute, with instructions to leave out the name of
         Jefferson Davis.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">INSANE ASYLUM FIRE.</head>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I rise to a question of privilege, I desire to refer to the calamity that
         overtook the department for women in the Hopital for the Insane last night. I suppose every
         Senator has heard of it. I received a letter this morning before I was up from the
         Superintendent of the institution (Dr. W. B. Fletcher) which I desire to read. [Reads: "We
         have burned out. Loss $75,000 I am too cold and blistered on my hands to write more than
         this. The State should make us an appropriation to day. Let us have a committee with
         experts and an architect at once. We have no means of cooking except by gas and no means of
         keeping warm except by blankets."I think this calls for immediate action on the part of the
         Senate and the House. It seems to me the Committee on Benevolent Institutions of both
         Houses ought to go out at once to the asylum and ascertain what is necessary. It is
         properly in their charge. I understand no action has been taken by the committee at all. I
         think the Senate ought to make some provision to meet this emergency. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAY offered a concurrent resolution that the Committee of both Senate and House on
         Benevolent Institutions be requested to visit the asylum immediately and report the amount
         of damage done and the necessary steps to be taken to repair the same.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I was not aware of that fire until this session commenced. I do not know
         that these committees can determine what is best to be done, but shall ask leave of absence
         for the Senate Committee on Benevolent and Reformatory Institutions to visit the Insane
         Asylum after dinner, or sooner if we can get off. </p>
        <p>It was so ordered without objection.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS moved up to amend so that said committees be authorized to inquire into the
         expediency of providing the necessary protection by water supply, and call to their aid
         suck experts as may be necessary to secure such information.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, desired to avoid devolving upon these committees any work
         that would embarrass the Trustees of the Insane Asylum.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: It is possible the trustees have ample power to make any necessary repairs,
         and to protect the buildings and inmates from fire by providing a complete water works
         system; but if the board do that, and come to the Legislature two years form now with a
         deficit and ask the Legislature to make an appropriation to pay for that expenditure some
         member of the Senate or the House will rise in his place and want to know what all this
         means; his constituency sent him there as an economist, and these bills come in age in
         session after session until they are paid. It is the history of this Legislature form the
         time I have known anything about it, that there is always objection to making a fair and
         square payment for these kind of claims. The parsimony of the General Assembly in not
         making an appropriation for fire protection in this case has cost the State over $75,000.
         Here is an institution containing 1,400 persons, situated a mile and a half or two miles
         from a water supply, and without a dollar's insurance. The Legislature ought to overhaul
         this matter, and possibly this very fire may be the means of causing a reformation in these
         things.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I agree with the Senator that the State should employ some means of
         protection, and it will be held responsible by the people of the State if it does not make
         provision for the insurance of the vast property and the protection of the lives of the
         people therein.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: As the mover of the resolution, I am willing to accept the amendment, for I
         think these committees ought to be granted the power as fully intended. I don't want to
         take up time in discussing this matter, for we might act a good deal like Nero of old did -
         we might fiddle away our time while the institution burns up.</p>
        <p>Mr. WIER moved the committee be directed to report progress to-morrow morning and show
         what is necessary to be done at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I consent to that amendment. </p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to and the resolution as mended was adopted.</p>

         <p>Mr. WIER, for various reasons unnecessary to mention, among others that might be

          difference of opinion, moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill and make it
          a special order for Monday next at 2 o'clock p.m.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE opposed the motion.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD: The objection I make is that this bill does not specify as to what the
          appropriation is for.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE: Does not the Senator think the Commissioners are better qualified to direct
          where the appropriation shall be applied? Is the Senator not willing to trust these
          Commissioners.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD: I am willing to trust these gentlemen as far as we ought to trust them; but
          they were limited to $600,000 for the building of these institutions, and they have made
          contracts for $440,00 more and before I am willing to vote any more I want to limit it. I
          don't care whether this motion to postpone is carried or not.</p>
         <p>Mr. WIER withdrew his motion.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD moved that he bill be referred back to the Public Buildings Committee with
          instructions to report what these appropriations are specifically.</p>

        <p>Mr. McHenry introduced a bill [H. R. 272] to provide for the adoption of a uniform system
         of text books in the common schools. Which was read the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to reject it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: This bill may stir up the depths of more than one heart. I expected that it
         would. But the passage of this bill would save the good people of Indiana $200,000 for text
         books, and it would give them better text books.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: With the kindest wishes to the gentleman from Putnam {Mr. Gordon) I see no
         reason why this bill should be treated in the manner suggested. In my opinion there is not
         subject that has come before this General Assembly that is more desired by the people of
         the State of Indiana. Legislation upon the subject of a uniform system of text books is
         earnestly desired by the people of this State. </p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: It seems to me that this is not a fair way to dispose of this bill, which
         has been presented in goo faith. If there is any one thing in which the people of Indiana
         are more interested in than another it is the common schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I hope members will compose themselves. NO outrage was intended upon
         anybody's rights by my motion to reject this bill. I desire to call attention of members to
         rule 57, which states that the first reading of the bill is for information and for
         commitment, and if there is opposition the question is whether it shall pass to the second
         readng. I wish to say that gave some attention to the reading of that bill, and there are
         some provisions to which I am opposed. I can see no reason why the adoption of text books
         should be put in the hands of the State Board of Education, but <pb n="103"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-103"/> I can see many reasons why we should not give them so much
         power. I think if we put this power in the State Board of Education, the throwing out of
         the schools the books that are allready in use, would not only cost $200,00 but $2 000 000.
         I think the people of this State would righteously rise up in indignation at the passage of
         this bill. There is no reason why this bill should be rejected now. If the gentlemen have
         given attention to this bill I see no reason why they should not reject the bill now by
         adopting this motion. I am opposed to placing the selection of our school text-books in the
         hands of the State Board of Education, not because I doubt the ability or integrity of the
         board but the fact is, they are not close enough to the people to know their needs and
         demands as they should in order to select the proper textbooks. I think it would be giving
         the board a power too great. They are not responsible to any one, and no matter how
         honorable and honest they may be, all humanity has its weaknesses, and they would be
         fearfully tempted by the those who would profit by the change of the text-books." </p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I believe it is just as proper a time now as any other time to consider
         this bill There has been a continued effort, it seems to me, since the opening of this
         session to give this State Board of Education unlimited power, and we have had some three
         or four tests of that matter in this House, and I think we are as ready to vote upon it now
         as at any other time. It would certainly save some time to take definite action on this
         bill it would save the second reading and engrossing. I think a majority of the members of
         this House think that the State Board of Education have powers enough. The other day we
         spent the whole afternoon talking about the State Board of Education and their powers. I
         think the majority of this House have faithfully listened to the this bill, and I don't
         know why they can't vote upon it just now. I am opposed to giving any more power to the
         State Board than it has now, and I think the House has concluded that the State Board of
         Education has just as much authority as it ought to have.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I don't I don't know but I have already expressed my views on such a bill as
         this. This is not the first time that a bill has come in here to give a monopoly to the
         State Board of Education. This bill would certainly make it a perfect monopoly. These
         repeated attempts coming into this Assembly to create a monopolist power shall meet my
         opposition every time, whether it is rejected at this point or not. I stand opposed to this
         bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: There seems to me a crying demand of remedy this evil of the change of school
         books. It seems to me that to treat this bill fairly it should be allowed to the committee.
         If it is a good bill it ought to go to the committee and the committee have the right to
         amend the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: Inasumuch as the motion now pending, if it prevails, will be the death of
         the bill, and insamuch as it has been assailed by the gentlemen of the House as an improper
         measure, it devolves upon me, as the introducer of the bill, to say something in its
         defense. I introduced that bill in good faith. It was not produced on the spur of the
         moment, but after many years consideration. Gentlemen on this floor know very well that the
         respective County Boards and Township Trustees will vote for the adoption of text books
         without ever looking into them. They would be unable to tell anything about the text books.
         You know very well that Township Trustees are chosen in a great many instances on account,
         not of their fitness, but on account of most anything else than their knowledge of text
         books. When it comes to pass upon school matters they are no better fitted for it than the
         average citizen. The object is not to put more power in the State Board of Education, but
         to put the selection of school books in the hands of men fitted to select them, and so they
         can't be changed at the whim of the County Boards. The imputations made here against the
         honor and integrity of the members of the State Board of Education are entirely
         unwarranted. I have the highest regard for the abilities of the State Board of Education.
         We require a uniform system of text-books. People passing from one county to another leave
         one class of text books and meet with another class, and they are obliged to buy a new set
         of books to send their children to school with. I have given in short the reasons why I
         have introduced this bill. I have introduced it with the best considerations of all
         parties, and not with a view to increase the power of the State Board of Education.</p>

        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I had concluded to vote against that motion until I heard the author of the
         bill speak. Now I am opposed to the bill. I can not agree with him when he says that the
         County Boards and Township Trustees are ignoramuses. I am willing to stand by the Township
         Trustees. What might be right and proper for one county in regard to text books might not
         be right and proper for another. We have grown to our exalted position in education under
         and by virtue of County Boards selecting the text books. I am opposed to the centralization
         of power in the State Board of Education. I think we had better conclude to let well enough
         alone. We have to at the head of the heap, and why do we desire to get up farther?</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: I am satisfied that the mem <pb n="104" xml:id="VAA8558-22-104"/> bers on the
         floor of this House are not acquainted with the provisions of this bill introduced here;
         and further, I am satisfied that they have not investigated and do not know what the law is
         on this subject. I think it is but fair to the gentleman who introduced this bill to send
         it to a committee to investigate it. I hope the motion will not prevail. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I am strongly opposed to the passage of this bill; still I shall take great
         pleasure in voting against the motion to reject it. Every member ought to have a right to
         go before a committee and try to satisfy the members of the committee that it is just and
         fair bill. I think that courtesy ought to be shown to every member.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: If there is any subject more than another, in my opinion, that commends itself
         to this body it is this very subject of text books in the common schools. If there is one
         evil prevailing among the people of the State that commends itself for remedy to this body
         more than another it is the evil that is creeping into the system of common schools in the
         way of text books. And whether this bill passes or not, in my opinion this House ought to
         delegate some power to some committee that will investigate and bring up a bill requiring a
         uniform system of text books in the in the State of Indiana. When it comes to this that he
         poor people of this State are compelled to make an investment of $8 or $10 a year for text
         books, and when they move to another county they have to buy another class of books, when
         this evil creeps in, it is a subject worthy of our consideration. The bill under
         consideration, if not in proper form or shape, should be considered by the members of the
         House and amended so that the people of Indiana will have a uniform system of text books.
         Therefore I hope that this bill will not be summarily cast aside, but that the members of
         the House will give it their attention before rejecting it. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I will suggest to members whose ideas of propriety have been outraged that
         they repeal rule 57. To my mind a motion to strike out the enacting clause is equally as
         summary as a motion to reject It is said that members don't understand the law as it
         exists; if it is desired a little information can be given on this subject. Now the text
         books are adopted by the County Board of Education, and they are provided to continue in
         use six years. Except by unanimous consent of that board no change can be made in that
         time. I will also state that in most cases the County Board of Education are guided by the
         advice of the County Superintendent. If the County Board vote unanimously to make a change
         of text-books they can do so. For what reason do we desire to that the power of selecting
         text books shall be put in the hands of the State Board of Education? Is it proposed that
         the text books they select shall be perpetual? If there is an adoption to be made that
         can't be revoked or changed, and an evil book gets into schools it can't be dropped or
         changed for a better one. Do you prefer that the County Board shall make changes for you -
         they are in your reach and you can control them - or do you prefer that the State Board of
         Education shall make the selection of text-books? They are out of the reach of the people.
         This is one of the pet theories of this State Board that has found its way into the
         Legislature in the shape of bills. </p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: I desire to explain my vote upon this question. I am unalterably opposed
         to the provisions of that bill, but I desire to give every member the same privileges that
         I would like shown to myself on my bills. Under the present law textbooks can't be changed
         oftener than once in six years except by unanimous consent of the County Board. Cities are
         not compelled to comply with the action of the board. Communities differ. Text-books that
         might be considered good in one portion of the county might not be considered good in one
         portion of the county might not be considered good in another portion. I am opposed to the
         bill, but I am in favor of giving it a fair hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. GARRISON: I am opposed to the bill but in favor of giving it a futher consideration. </p>
        <p>The motion to reject the bill failed by yeas, 9; nays, 79; and it was referred to the
         Committee on Education.</p>

           <p>Hon. Samuel Williams, Chairman House Committee on Benevolent Institutions:</p>
           <floatingText>
            <body>
             <div>
              <p><hi rend="sc">DEAR SIR</hi> - Referring to the conversation between us, to-day, and
               your suggestion that I resign my office of Trustee of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home and
               Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, and that if I would do so your committee would
               report and have adopted a resolution of compliments to myself, I have this to say: I
               am either unfit to hold the office, or the charges to which you allude are false. If
               they are true, the great Democratic party of this State can not afford to allow me to
               resign my trust with a complimentary resolution testifying that I have well and
               faithfully performed my duties. If I am under serious charges before your committee,
               as you assert, it is your duty to make the most searching inquiry as to the truth.
               This duty you owe to your oaths, to the whole people of the State, to the soldiers'
               orphans, and to myself and family.</p>
              <p>Knowing that you have received your inspiration from Superintendent White, deem it
               proper to inform you that for months past I have demanded his dismissal upon what I
               deemed more than sufficient reasons - reasons which I can pre- <pb n="105"
                xml:id="VAA8558-22-105"/> sent to your committee whenever they are prepared to go
               into the matter. I desired to pen these questions last fall in connection with the
               charges against myself, and would have forced that issue then had not an intimate and
               earnest personal friend of Senator Voorhees asked that the step be not taken in the
               midst of the canvass. But I did demand an investigation in my own case, by the post
               of the Grand Army, of which I was a member, and, though the post did not act in the
               matter.I went before that body and presented by denial, and a part of my defense. </p>
              <p>I think much good can come from such an investigation. First, it will determine
               whether I am guilty or not. Second, it will disclose the most brutal and immoral
               practices upon the soldiers' orphans and the unfortunate feeble-minded children, of
               which Mr. White has had full knowledge, and in certain cases has been a party to; and
               also the immoral practices of his two sons - debaucheries and cruelties which the
               people of Indiana are entitled to know all about. I ask, however, that I may be
               notified in regard to the action, or intended action, of the committee, that I may be
               present to not only present my own case, but also such evidence as I have to offer
               regarding the general conduct of the two institutions. I have no concealments in this
               matter, and there should be none, nor do I ask anything but justice at the hands of
               your committee. </p>

            has not acted, and now I appeal to the House to take some definite act upon the letter
            which I sent to the Chairman of the committee. I can not afford to dance attendance upon
            the Chairman of the committee simply because he desires me to resign an office rather
            than make an investigation which he assumes would result in harm to my reputation. I
            therefore ask you to present this communication to the House, as I have no other means
            of officially communication with that body. For the reasons which are given above I ask

        <p>Mr. MOODY offered a concurrent resolution for the appointment of a committee, to be
         composed of two Senators and three Representatives, to investigate the charges against the
         Trustees and employes of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home and the Asylum for Feeble-minded
         Children, and that the committee have power to send for persons and papers.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON offered an amendment to confine the investigation to charges against Mr.
         Goar.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. BROWNLEE the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN moved to amend so that the committee shall consist of members of the House
         only. </p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING opposed the amendment and favored the original resolution.</p>
        <p>On his motion the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: When Mr. Goar comes before this House and attempts to blacken the reputation
         of the members of the committee, and to assail not only the Superintendent of that Asylum,
         but the whole family of orphans, and implies that such gross immoralities are being carried
         on, it behooves us that we rigidly investigate the man making the charges. This
         communication, take as a whole, is simply an insult and an outrage to this House. It is a
         courtesy to allow it to be read. I see no reason why John M. Goar should ask for the
         investigation of all members of the board. A good reason why we should not pay any
         attention to the investigation of the other members is because he asks it. We should see
         whether the charges against John M. Goar are cleared up before we pass to the investigation
         of the other members.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I never had the honor of receiving any communication from John M. Goar,
         either upon this or any other subject. I hope that a special committee will be appointed to
         investigate the charges made against Mr. Goar. A charge coming from this source ought to
         have considerable weight. I think the investigation should be pointed directly at Mr. John
         M. Goar while Trustee.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I think the resolution of the gentleman from DeKalb [Mr. Moody] covers the
         whole ground. I understand no charge has been made directly against John M. Goar. John M.
         Goar comes here and tells this House that certain charges have been made against himself.
         He demands that they be investigated. He also makes charges against another man by the name
         of White. We can't say that we will investigate one man and not investigate the rest. Since
         Mr. Goar demands an investigation he ought to have it. The resolution of the gentleman from
         DeKalb doe snot say we shall investigate Mr. Goar singly, but investigate all of them; let
         them all suffer for their infamy and wrong.</p>

        <p>Mr. Magee's bill [S. 65] for the completion and equipment of the three new Insane Asylums
         [See Brevier Reports, pages 75, 94, 95, 96] coming up on its third reading nd being read
         the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I was absent yesterday when the Senate had this bill under consideration.
         Whenever there is a bill of this importance before the Senate, upon which we are called
         upon to give our votes. I have generally been in the habit in a very few words of giving
         the reasons that govern me in casting my vote. It is not because I have not the proper
         sympathy for the afflicted who will become inmates of these institutions that I shall vote
         against this bill. Two years ago at the last session of this Senate. I was one of eight
         that voted against the bill for erection of three new Insane Asylums When the bill was
         first presented, providing for but one institution of the kind in the State. I was in favor
         of it. I was willing to cast my vote for one institution should be located centrally, and
         not at one side of the State, thought if located at Evansville or any other place, I was
         willing to give my vote for that one But when Senators began to multiply these institutions
         - when they began to pool their issues; or in other words, adopt a log-rolling system for
         the purpose of the passage of a bill of that kind, I determined to cast by vote against it.
         I thought one institution sufficient to meet the emergency, and I thought the holding out
         the different localities of the State the probability of getting one of these institutions
         was not a fair way in which to legislate. I consequently gave my vote against that
         combination - that log-rolling system - for the purpose of establishing more institutions
         than the exigences of the surrounding circumstances demanded or required. And now I am
         perfectly willing to vote for the completion of one institution, let that one be the one at
         Evansville, Richmond or Logansport, because I sincerely believe that one institution is
         completed, as fast as the emergencies or requirements of that class of unfortunates are
         presented, why, then complete and equip another one of these institutions, or both of them,
         if they are required. I think it is safe to vote against all bills that hold up inducements
         to obtain votes for an appropriation more extensive than present requirements demand. I
         shall vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>The bill then finally passed the Senate by yeas 44, nays 3.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Probably the amendment to this bill I offered a day or two ago would be a
         sufficient explanation of the vote I am going to cast. As I then said: The opposition I
         then made to the bill was no factious opposition. I thought it unwise to appropriate this
         large amount of money to carry to completion these institutions at this time. But the
         temper of the Senate has been otherwise; yet I do not believe it would be prudent to
         appropriate no money at all; and while I would very much prefer to vote for the bill with
         the amendment, yet I do not feel called upon to vote against the bill, and I shall
         therefore vote aye.</p>
        <pb n="107" xml:id="VAA8558-22-107"/>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: I voted against the engrossment of this
         bill because a number of my constituents, in whome I have the utmost confidence as to
         financial capacity, have requested me not to vote for this bill. I made my opposition to
         it, but the Senate did not agree with the sentiments I expressed. The Senator from Cass
         [Mr. Magee] has been a kindly man in the Senate, and as I would like to favor him - as a
         compliment to him and out of any respect to the bill. I will vote for the bill. [Laughter.]
         I vote aye.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I am distinctly in favor of continuing the work on these asylums. Had this
         bill shown how the money was to appropriated, and had its object been simply the completion
         of the asylums, I would be happy to vote for it. But as it mingles the construction and
         maintenance of all three into one general appropriation so that it will allow these
         buildings to cost a million and a half dollars, for all we know; and as the appropriation a
         large amount of money, without saying to whom it is to go, I will, at present, although I
         know the demands of the State, vote no.</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above recorded, and so the bill finally passed the Senate.</p>

        <head rend="center">COUNTY ORPHANS' HOUSES.</head>
        <p>On motion of Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, his bill [S. 22] to provide for the
         establishment of an orphans' home by two or more contiguous counties, was read the second
         time. He explained the provisions of the bill and said: We have situated in Mishawaka, a
         town about four miles east of South Bend, one of these homes that has been doing some very
         fine work, and has been successful in making a start in the right direction toward taking
         care of the orphans of the State. The report shows that in the last two years it has had
         108 orphans its care, and it has secured permanent homes for seventy-five of its wards. The
         great object of this work is to take children from county alms houses and other places
         where they can not be properly cared for, and furnished them with comfortable surroundings
         until permanent homes can be found for them. This home has charge of orphan children from
         the counties of St. Joseph, Elkhart, Laporte, Marshall and Kosciusko. The first question
         will be on the amendment to the bill proposed by the committee that all the Commisioners of
         every county in the association shall unite before an order for the sale of the association
         property can be made. The bill provides that two-thirds of the counties may order a
         sale.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The proposed amendment would place too much power in the hands of one man.
         The most stubborn men - bullheaded men is an expression that reaches it - are sometimes
         selected for County Commissioners. Under this bill a half dozen counties might join in an
         association and one stubborn County Commissioner to prevent a sale of associated property
         at a time when it ought to e disposed of.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: As a member of the committee I will say the committee recommended that
         amendment because we thought there was a time in life when stubborn man might do a great
         deal of good.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: There is a difference between a Board of Commissioners
         governing a county and the Commissioners of a county. I should object to passing any bill
         authorizing County Commissioners as individuals to do anything in any in any capacity. Let
         it be the Board of Commissioners in every case. If that wording is used the action becomes
         the act of the Board of Commissioners - the action of a corporation. It would be unwise to
         allow the bill to pass into an act without amending it in that respect. I believe it right
         that contiguous counties should be permitted to join in the erection of orphan asylums, for
         in many cases one could not or would not build an orphans' home, where several counties
         could and would. I am opposed to the provision which requires all the Boards of County
         Commissioners to act together in order to order a sale of the property of the
         association.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This is a meritorious bill; but the word "all" should be stricken out- it
         would enlarge the powers of County Commissioners, which would be viscious legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE, as a member of the Committee on Benevolent Institutions, did not know that the
         bill was before the committee, but called attention to what he feared is a defect in the
         bill. It provides that two or more counties may join in building an orphans' home, but
         before a sale of the joint property can be made two-thirds shall order it. Usually the
         joint organization will be by but two counties. <pb n="108" xml:id="VAA8558-22-108"/> The
         committee amendment was rejected. </p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend the bill by inserting before the word "commissioners" wherever
         it occurs the words "board of" and by striking out the words "two-thirds." so it will
         require unanimous action of all the counties to order a sale of the home.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I don't think that part of the amendment proposing to strike out two-thirds
         should be adopted. The counties should be unanimous in ordering a sale. It seems to me
         there should always be a veto interposed by the county in which the property is located, if
         that county is opposed to the proposed sale.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, demanded a division of the question.</p>
        <p>The first portion of the amendment (Mr. Youche's) was agreed to, but the latter portion
         (to strike out "two-thirds") was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DAVIS Section 1 was amended by inserting the word "regular" before
         "sessions" (of the Boards of Commissioners)</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DRAKE the bill was further amended in Section 1 by authorizing each
         county in the association to appropriate $5,000 for the purpose of erecting a Home.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, moved to amend Section 1 so that where an Orphans' Home
         Association is formed the County Board of Commissioners "shall" purchase suitable grounds
         and buildings.</p>
        <p>Messrs. Foulke, Magee, and Campbell of St. Joseph, opposed the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am utterly opposed to the principles of the bill. I believe it is the
         worst kind of legislation; not because I am opposed to having orphan children and other
         poor persons provided for. The law now provides that these voluntary associations may be
         formed in every county in the State. Were counties allowed to operate under the provisions
         of this bill, in one, two or three years they would be in a worse altercation that the
         Senate has been in all afternoon on this bill. Were a proposition made for the State of
         Indiana and the State of Ohio to go into partnership in building hospitals or asylums,
         every member would say the proposition would be foolish. In my judgment it is just as
         objectionable to have two or more counties go into such partnership. That any individual
         who is the owner of an undivided interest in real estate can force a separation has always
         been the law of the land, yet you propose that County Boards shall buy real estate and
         become owners, and yet there is no provision made by which one county can draw out of that
         partnership.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate and under its operations and amendment was rejected

          report.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings said: It is one of the objects of this bill that the right of
          redemption shall be remitted to those who have lost their property in the in the past and
          those who may in the future lose their property by means of a sale made by order of court
          under proceedings to foreclose a tax lien. The right of redemption should be granted the
          owner of the land within one year from date of sale. In all other sales the right of
          redemption is reserved to the owner of the land by statue. But as the law now stands there
          is no redemption from a sale granted under an order of court on a tax deed. Another change

        <p>The special order being Mr. Moody's resolution introduced yesterday for an investigation
         of certain charges against trustees officers and employes of the Soldier's Orphans's Home
         was announced, the question being on Mr. Cory's substitute that the investigation be of
         John M. Goar only. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I am not aware that any charges have been preferred by an person against John
         M. Goar, although the substitute seems to speak of it as though charges have been preferred
         against him, I know by public rumor that charges have been preferred against him.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: The letter written by Mr. Goar to the House acknowledged that charges have been
         made against him. He acknowledged in his letter that he had made a partial defense of his
         conduct.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: That communication does not come from an irresponsible party, but it comes
         from of the trustees of this asylum - an officer of the State of Indiana, chosen as the
         Democratic General Assembly of 1880 and in this General Assembly I believe there are
         thirty-eight persons of Democratic faith who voted for him for that office. Therefore, I
         think it is not proper for the members of this House to ignore his communication. There are
         questions presented in the communication that this House dare not <pb n="109"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-109"/> and can not ignore. One is that the Superintendent of that
         asylum and members of his family have been guilty of the grosses wrongs and cruelties
         against the orphans of the soldiers of Indiana. He also charges that a great political
         party has been willing, for present purposes and for political advantage, to say they will
         conceal outrages of the kind charged in this communication. It is also charged that an
         honored member of this House proposed to him that if he would resign his office he would be
         given a whitewashing report and certificate of character. It is but fair that we have a
         thorough investigation, so that member (Mr. Williams) will be wholly exonerated. Therefore,
         it seems to me that the communication of Mr. Goar should be made the subject of the
         investigation. The letter comes from the proper authority and makes astounding charges. I
         hope the substitute will not be adopted and that this amendment will be adopted so that we
         can say to the people of Indiana that we are in favor of making a complete exposure,
         concealing nothing in regard to the affairs of the asylum. </p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: I have said, nd I presume no member on this floor will deny, that charges are
         preferred against John M. Goar. He acknowledges the fact in the communication he makes to
         this House. He declares further, that the Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, of which
         he is a member, has had these charges under consideration, he has appeared before the post
         and presented a partial defense. Why partial? Why does this man appear before an honorable
         body and make a partial and incomplete defense against charges so dishonorable? </p>
        <p>Now, we should remember that no one but John M. Goar is at the present time under
         charges. John M. Goar, criminally charged, throws out insinuations here against honest and
         honorable men, and I regret to say that some of my Republican friends would have us
         investigate these honorable men whose character is smirched or attempted to be smirched by
         this man who rests under criminal charges. John M. Goar I don't know. I do know that the
         charges of criminal conduct stand against him. For the sake of humanity I hope they may
         prove to be untrue. I am in favor of the fullest investigation of the charges preferred. I
         am not in favor for the sake of pleasing some Republican members, of traveling out of the
         way to attack Voorhees, the Chairman of the committee on Benevolent Institutions, or any
         one else. It is our plain duty to investigate the charges preferred against Goar first. If
         other charges should be preferred against other parties, then, and not till then, should we
         take cognizance of them. The substitute I have offered for the original resolution and
         amendments ought to be adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: I am not here to take the part of John M. Goar or anybody else that is
         connected with that institution. I know John M. Goar personally. He comes here and says
         that rumors have been set afloat against him. Who makes them? We do not know. John M. Goar,
         one of the Trustees of that institution, in a written communication says and prefers grave
         charges against the other members of that institution. The substitute only wants to
         investigate John M. Goar, yet John M. Goar comes in here and makes charges against some
         other members of that institution. Are you going to stifle him and say he has no right to
         demand an investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I am not disposed to talk about Democrats and Republicans. These are charges
         made by one who occupies an official position. I know the parties personally. I don't know
         whether there is any guilt or not. But the charges are here. They are here in proper form,
         and this Legislature can't afford to ignore them. There ought to be the most thorough
         sifting and investigation of all the parties charged. There is but one course for this
         Legislature to take, and that is to appoint a committee and give the whole master an
         investigation. If none are guilty and none and all are innocent, I will be most glad.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: An officer of our State has come into our Assembly and voluntarily said to the
         General Assembly that certain improprieties are being indulged in in one of our public
         institutions. I am inclined to accept the proposition of a man's guilt or innocency in
         accordance with the general theory to recognize every man as innocent until the contrary is
         proven. This man comes to our Assembly clothed with the authority of an officer of State
         and tells us that certain rumors have been circulated against him, and he also states that
         these rumors are false, and that other parties are the guilty ones. He says an
         investigation of this institution and the officers will disclose the most brutal practices.
         Are you take it for granted that a trustee is coming into this House and General Assembly
         as a scoundrel and liar, and that you will investigate only him? It would be a shame and
         disgrace not to investigate all of them. I never saw Mr. Goar, or any of the officers of
         this institution, but it is due to all concerned that the guilty ones be punished. I am in
         favor of a fair and just investigation of all members of that institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: This subject is a very grave one. The references to political matters that
         have been injected into this discussion I think are entirely uncalled for. We have been
         told by an officer of this State, and one who holds a high position of trust, that there
         have been gross cruelties practices in this institution. We should purge ourselves of these
         men who infest these public institutions. We can't do justice to ourselves unless we do so.
         It is due to all of us that the fullest, the fairest, and the freest investigation shall
         take place, and let no guilty man escape. If there is dirt there, throw it out, and cast it
         where it <pb n="110" xml:id="VAA8558-22-110"/> longs. I care nothing for Mr. Goar of Mr.
         White; if they are innocent, let us give them a fair investigation, and discharge them. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: This communication comes before the House in the regular way. It was
         presented to the Speaker in the regular way, and, therefore, demands our attention. John M.
         Goar, in his communication, says rumors were preferred against him. In that same
         communication he makes charges against the officers of that institution. Let us go to work
         and prove whether they are guilt or innocent.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH I am somewhat astonished at the range the discussion has taken. As has been
         said, I don't know whether there is anybody down there guilty or not, but I think this
         whole thing ought to be investigated. I never knew than an investigation of the part
         included an investigation of the whole. There is no use starting out to investigate but one
         individual. I am opposed to the amendment and substitute that have been offered. I think we
         ought to have a committee to investigate everything down there. I think we ought to give
         this investigation a broad gauge.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: It seems to me that everybody in this Houss is in favor or an
         investigation. Mr. Goar is an officer of the State of Indiana elected by the General
         Assembly, and he makes charges, and that is sufficient for an investigation. The purport of
         the original resolution was to embrace every officer connected with that institution.</p>
        <p>I move the substitute lie on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. McMULLEN the amendment [Mr. Sayres' directing the investigation to the
         management] was laid on the table by yeas 60; nays 37.</p>

        <p>Mr. Pendleton's bill [H. R. 56] for the relief of ten Trustees of Marion County who lost
         public monies by the failure of banks, coming up in regular order it was read the second
         time.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES moved that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I hope that a bill of his character will not be indefinitely
         postponed at this stage. An immense amount of suffering has been entailed upon the people
         of this county by the failure of these banks. These men deposited just where I would have
         deposited my money, with institutions that have stood for years, firm and fast and had the
         confidence of the people. I don't think it would be right to make them suffer for an
         unavoidable calamity.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I desire to enter my protest against this passage of this bill. I believe
         it would be a precedent that ought not to be set by this General Assembly. The people of
         this State and of the several townships have a right to look to the bond of these Trustees
         for the money, and to prosecute to the full extent of the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON. This is not a question of whether the State shall provide the money lost
         by Trustees. There is not a dollar lost. The bill does not require the funding of a single
         dollar. The people of this county ask not for the funding of money. They ask for the
         privilege or taxing themselves to make good the loss. A majority of the people, more than
         75 per cent. of the whole number of taxpayers, have petitioned that this bill pass. Does
         this carry no force with it. I believe this bill ought to have a further consideration.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK of Wayne: The old adage is that great men differ. I have not a great deal to
         say, but I rise in favor of this bill. We are men, and have done things of like character
         as these Trustees in good faith: and we would not like to have the iron heat set down on
         these men for an unavoidable calamity I am willing to pay my share rather than make paupers
         of good, deserving men.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: If this bill were to pass a general law to provide that whenever a Trustee'
         funds were lost, he should be reimbursed, it would appeal with much more force to this
         General Assembly than a bill proposing relief to a particular man under like circumstances.
         When a County Trustee or State Treasurer loans out the funds that are in his hands he is
         entitled to receive the interest thereon, and for this reason he ought to be held to a
         strict account for any money that is lost. Even though there is a petition from 75 per
         cent. of the people of this township, yet we have no right to make the strong arm of the
         law reach down into the pockets of even 1 per cent. and turn their money over into the
         pockets of private individuals for private purposes. I am opposed to the principle at this
         bill. While I regret the loss of these men I would gladly respond to my share in repaying
         the loss. I don't believe this General Assembly can afford to establish such a precedent.
         Let the Trustees bear the loss, and let their neighbors help to reimburse them.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I desire to say that this bill came before the committee accompanied by a long
         and strong memorial. To this memorial were attached the names of the majority of the
         taxpayers of Marion County and the owners of a majority of the taxable property. No
         Representative of Marion County is on this floor opposing this bill. Numerous bills of a
         like character have passed; this bill, if it passes, will affect no other county except
         Marion. According to a recent decision of the Supreme Court a Trustee is not liable for
         such a loss. [Then came a recess for dinner.]</p>
        <p>Mr. JAMESON: This bill seeks to make a contribution of money from the taxpayers of the
         several townships to their Trustees. If the contribution be voluntary, I have no objection.
         If, however, the taxpayers in <pb n="111" xml:id="VAA8558-22-111"/> these townships do not
         desire to join in making such donations, then we have no right to levy an involuntary
         contribution upon them for this purpose. Minorities have rights which are bound to protect,
         however great may be our sympathy with the Trustees. What the facts in each of these chases
         are I am not sufficiently advised as to what course my duty will require me to take. My
         inclination is to vote for the engrossment of the bill, but I shall hold myself free to
         vote as I may deem my duty on the final passage of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I think whenever a measure is attempted to be put upon this House which
         involves matters opposed to the sentiments of this House then is the time to dispose of it.
         If it be true, as has beed said, that the Supreme Court has decided that a Trustee can be
         reimbursed for money thus lost, then what is the use of this Legislature making any more
         laws for it? I don't think the question of locality cuts nay figure here. As to the
         memorial, I would ask why can't these men make donations instead of coming before this
         Legislature asking for a tax?</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: I am opposed to this way of disposing of this bill. I would rather vote on its
         merits. He argued against the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING also opposed postponement.</p>
        <p>He did not think Trustees should be held accountable for things that unaccountably
         happen.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operation the motion to indefinitely
         postpone was rejected and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>

        <p>Mr. MAGEE, by consent, introduced a bill [S. 196] to authorize the Governor, Treasurer
         and Auditor of State to make a temporary loan of $600,000 to run five or ten years at 4 per
         cent. interest; and to authorize the funding of the State debt at a lower rate of interest

        <p>Mr. MAGEE said: During discussions of the bill for completing the three new insane
         asylums, this question of making a loan was also discussed as a collateral branch of the
         insane asylum completion question. I understand from the State officers that it is possible
         to make a loan at 3 5/2 per cent., including commission and all expenses of making the
         loan. This bill also authorizes the refunding of the State debt it can be done at a lower
         rate of interest that at present paid. It is carefully drawn and guards the interests of

        <head rend="center">STREET RAILWAY TAX.</head>
        <p>Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 38] to authorize a tax on street railroad cars, being read the second
          <pb n="113" xml:id="VAA8558-22-113"/> time, with a favorable committee report thereon - </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The object of this bill is to raise revenue in cities where they have exceeded
         the limit of the law for taxation. The men who have helped build up cities should be
         protected by the Legislature form paying this extraordinary rate of taxation. This bill
         proposes that a tax of $25 may be levied on each and every street car, in additional to
         what the owners pay on the same for State, county and other purposes. The State don't need
         revenue to be raised in that way. There has also been a bill introduced here, called the
         omnibus bill, which proposes to tax everything under heaven except the air we breathe and
         the water we drink. Like of these devil fishes, it attacks everything in sigh. This species
         of legislation is wrong. Last session a committee of the Senate reported unanimously
         against this species of legislation, and no member of the Senate raised his voice in favor
         of such vicious legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: This is simply a bill to protect cities by providing that certain corporations
         shall pay a share of the burden of city taxes. In Evansville a street railway company has a
         charter which runs forty years and it uses any of the streets of that city without paying a
         cent of damages. We tax every poor drayman who owns a dray and horse and in additional he
         has to pay a tax, whatever the assessment may be on his dray and horse. This bill provides
         that there shall be a tax not to exceed $25 on each street railway car. The City Council
         will be just and fair - they may tax each car only $1, $2, or $3 per annum. If Senators
         think $25 is too much, let the bill be amended so the tax shall not exceed $5 or $10 per
         car.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Did the Senator ever know a City Council to levy a tax any less than the
         limit? I understand there are 300 saloons in Vanderburg County taxed only $25 Would it not
         be as well to raise the tax on saloons, and lower the tax on the poor man's dray?</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: That might be the case where they have mean whisky; but where they have good
         beer, like in Evansville, that is not the case. [Laughter] I don't want to charge anybody
         with fighting for then, but it seems like every time it is proposed to touch corporations
         there is objection, because it is special legislation on. There is no reason why railway
         corporations in cities should be allowed to cut up the streets in front of the nicest
         properties, and not pay a cent of tax for that privilege. This bill does not propose
         special legislation, and ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: Our street railway has been of vast benefit to this city. It has absolutely
         developed the c ty. The present proprietor of oru street railway has had great trouble in
         the past five years in keeping up his railway. He has 150 or 200 mules and 120 men
         employed, and I understood last year, be scarcely made receipts meet expenses. He has 100
         cars and perhaps more. He has attempted to accommodate the street car system to the wants
         of the community, so a man can hardly go in any direction to a given point and have to walk
         more a few squares. A great many gentlemen who used to keep carriages and buggies have laid
         them aside as a matter of economy, and now take the street cars. I don't know of any
         greater calamity that would occur to Indianapolis than that the system of street cars
         should be legislation out of existence. The city is full of praises for Mr. Johnson, the
         owner of our street railway. He has sacrificed a great deal of capital in order to extend
         street railway facilities to the residents of our city. It is the poor man's carriage. I
         hope the bill will not pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I am a member of the Committee on Corporations, which
         reported in favor of the passage of this bill, and I want to explain that I was not present
         when it was considered or I should have opposed that favorable report. I am opposed to the
         bill on principle.</p>
        <p>Mr. WIER: There is one reason which should be a sufficient one why this bill should not
         pass. In the State of Indiana we have no large cities where the rights granted to street
         railways are of any particular value. If we had within our borders a New York, a
         Cincinnati, or a Chicago, there might be occasion for a proposition to tax street railways
         in this manner. This bill provides that every street railway car may be taxed as high as
         $25, whether in a large city or a small one of only 25,000 inhabitants, where the citizens
         may have seen fit to build a street railroad. When you compare the cities of this State
         with the large cities of other States where street railway franchises are of great value,
         it seems to me a sufficient reason is to be seen why this bill ought not to pass. I am
         opposed to it, not on the plea of special legislation, but simply because it would cripple
         every enterprise of the kind referred to in the State, the one in the city of Indianapolis
         included which is the largest city in the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: This identical bill, as I now remember, was before a Senate cemmittre
         last session, and I joined in a report against its passage. Finding the bill here again,
         and knowing it can apply but to few cities in the State, mine no being of them; and having
         no personal interest either now or prospective, I joined this time in a report recommending
         its passage. I did this upon the supposition that cities in the State having street
         railroads desired the passage of such a bill. If they did, for one, I was not in favor of
         preventing them from having it. I would not be in favor of imposing it upon a single city
         that would oppose it. I did not know but that the time had come when street railroads in
         cities were looked upon as nuisances like saloons. I signed this report merely for the
         purpose of ascertaining whether it was the uniform wish of all cities having street
         railways to <pb n="114" xml:id="VAA8558-22-114"/> have such a law, but finding it is not, I
         shall vote against the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of St. Joseph: We have in South Bend a fine street railroad (on paper) but
         we have the projectors under bond of $1,000, and forfeit if they fail to build it. In our
         experience we have found that companies are not anxious to take a franchise of that kind in
         an enterprising city like South Bend. For a long time we had prospects of a street railroad
         being built, and from our experience I conclude the profits are not enormous.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I have always regarded this kind of legislation ad vicious. It is said that
         hacks and carriages are taxed, and that City Councils have authority to tax a special class
         of properties. That may be true, but I have no argument to offer in favor of that kind of
         legislation. This bill would make a dangerous precedent to follow. If this bill should pass
         at the next session of the Legislature some Senator would probably introduce and insist on
         the passage of a bill taxing every steam engine or cart or wagon.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: A bill of that kind is here now.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I am not astonished. The theory of law is that everything should be taxed in
         proportion to tis worth. Street car mules and every other species of property is taxed as
         other property is taxed. Why can it be necessary that we should pass a law authorizing an
         additional tax of $25 on every street car I can't imagine. As the Senator from Marion has
         suggested, it would drive out of existence the poor man's carriage I am opposed to such
         legislation. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE the report was laid on the table and the bill indefinitely
         postponed by yeas 34, nays 10</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER, explaining his affirmative vote, said: In the last canvass the candidates of
         both parties for the Legislature in this city made pledges that they would not in any shape
         favor an increase of taxation. We have a law which limits city Councils to ninety cents on
         th e$100 of taxables. I regard this whole thing has nothing but an effort to evade the
         provisions of existing laws. The bill is but an entering wdge for the omnibus bill referred
         to, which attempts to tax every milk wagon, brick wagon, carriage and every vehicle; and to
         tax every business man, every doctor, lawyer, merchant, and every person engaged in every
         business in this city and every other city the State - the very men that make and build up
         our towns and cities. The principle of the bill I regard as utterly wrong and an attempt to
         evade the law. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>

         <head rend="center">TAX SALES.</head>
         <p>Mr. SMITH'S (of Jennings) Delinquent Tax Sales Redemption bill [S. 143], on its second
          reading, came up as a special order, with a majority report from a committee recommending
          that it lie on the table and a minority report that the bill do pass.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH continued his speech cut off by last night's adjournment. What good reason is
          there why a man who invests his money in the purchase of delinquent tax titles should have
          any more interest upon that investment than the man who loans his money? It is against the
          policy of laws that there should be class legislation upon any subject. But the greatest
          evil under our present tax law is that it cuts off the right of redemption. This bill
          seeks to raise the black flag the law has placed over the poor man's home - the protection
          of the Nation in time of war and the glory of the State in time of peace. But it may be
          said that it is doubtful whether the Legislature can make a law which is retroactive in
          its character. In answer of that desire to say that these tax laws in most every feature
          are remedial. The Supreme Court has held that where an act is remedial the Legislature
          following the one which made the law may change or alter that remedy, or destroy it,
          indeed, if it desires. I undertake to say it is lawful for this Legislature to make an act
          retroactive in its character, so that these people who have lost their lands may redeem
          them by the payment of a 10 per cent. penalty And it may be said it will not do the to
          change the rate of interest, because the people will refuse to bid at these sales. During
          the time the law of 1881 was in force, which reduced the per cent. from 25 to 8, there
          were as many tax sales as since the act of 1883 which increased the per cent from 8 and 10
          to 20. But rather than have the bill defeated because the per cent. is too low, I would
          consent to increasing it in order that we may grant the people the right to redeem their
          homes from such sales. I insist that the minority report on this bill ought to be adopted
          and I insist that it was misguided official conduct that the Judiciary Committee decided
          against reporting in favor of this bill in the first place, and upon a question so
          important I felt it my duty not to abide their judgment, but to bring this bill by a
          minority report, to the consideration of every Senator upon this floor. I insist upon a
          fair full, deliberate and honest consideration of the report.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE: It was from no spirit of antagonism to the poor man whose land is sold for
          taxes that the Judiciary Committee reported against this bill, nor from a spirit of
          friendliness to the man who might purchase for a nominal consideration land worth
          infinitely more than the price bide. This bill provides that an additional year shall be
          allowed to perosn whose lands have been foreclosed under tax deeds, and the author desires
          to make provision retroactive. Under the Constitution of this State if we pass such a law,
          it will not do the Senator nor those the represents any good. There is a policy we can not
          ignore, <pb n="115" xml:id="VAA8558-22-115"/> and that is that every man must pay his
          taxes. Every man who does not pay his taxes, imposes an additional burden upon his
          neighbor. Taxes must be collected. The law now allows considerable time to elapse after
          delinquency before a sale, and two years after that before a deed if three, four or five
          years were allowed, there would be still some who would not pay. As long as money can be
          invested so as to bring a return of something near ten per cen., men are not going to buy
          titles and take the risk of litigation. Bidders will not attend the tax sales, and taxes
          will be returned delinquent year after year. We passed the Senator's bill declaring that
          the land of this country should belong to the people of the United States and not to
          people beyond the sea, but we ought not to pass this bill into a law. </p>
         <p>The minority report was rejected by yeas, 23; nays, 24.</p>
         <p>Mr. SELLERS explaining his negative vote: With the assurance that the bill will be
          referred to another committee so its defects may be correct, I vote "no"</p>
         <p>The majority report was also rejected by yeas, 22; nays, 25</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD: I move that the bill be recommitted to the Judiciary Committee, that it may
          be perfected. There have been several defects in it discovered. I take it as the sense of
          the House that a bill of this character ought to pass. </p>

        <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY APPROPRIATION.</head>

        <p>Mr. Staley's bill [H. R. 15] to appropriate $40,000 to Purdue University bing read the
         third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: The trustees of this institution were short of money and they borrowed enough
         to carry on the institution until the present time, and they ask that the money that ought
         to have been appropriated then be appropriated now. The State is bound, first by the acts
         of Congress, and secondly by the acts of the State, to maintain this institution. Should
         the State at any time fail to comply with the provisions of the grant this donation of land
         and every thing pertaining to this institution would at once pass to the United States. The
         State stands as the guardian of this trust. Unless this appropriation is made I don't see
         how the institution can be carried on for another day. It will have to close. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I am fully satisfied in my mind that Purdue is not a State University. The
         statute provides that the Trustees shall not borrow money. Is it necessary for them to
         ineur this indebtedness? They got the interest on their loan, and that ought to be
         sufficient. There were only 160 pupils there. It is the business of the State of Indiana to
         give a good common school education to its people; not to make lawyers, doctors, moulders,
         etc. This institution has cost too much money already. There has been no showing to me of
         what has become of the money. I represent an agricultural constituency, and I believe
         agricultural colleges are a failure, and I hope this appropriation will be defeated</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: It would seem that an agricultural college in this State was an innovation,
         and something that ought to be watched with the utmost scrutiny. We should not expect too
         much Purdue University. As yet it is young - scarce ten years old. Give it time and chance,
         and I venture to say that it will give results that will satisfy the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. DALE: I speak in behalf of Purdue University. I am astonished at the assertion that a
         common school education is the foundation of a good farmer. The educated farmer is the
         foundation of all prosperity in this country. I ask that the appropriation which failed at
         the last Legislature be made now. Intelligent labor is the only sure foundation for further
         prosperity, and I do hope and pray that we perpetuate that institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This institution was not established to teach Latin and Greek
         or higher mathematics, but it is an institution that will develop the handiwork of the man
         who engages his skill with the educated brain to make the earth yield more bountifully.
         Experience shows that agricultural colleges have been of inestimable value to every
         country. It is essentially a State University. In the case of an emergency th State of
         Indiana took $340,000 of the funds of this University and gav a non-negotiable bond bearing
         5 per cent. interest. So you have borrowed her endowment fund at 5 per cent. interest and
         now will say you will give her no more. That noble citizen, John Purdue, gave $150,000 to
         aid this institution, and the county of Tippecanoe gave $50,000 more, and the citizens of
         Tippecanoe County gave 150 acres of land. When he had concluded -</p>

        <p>Mr. Moody's Inkeepers' Protection bill [H. R. 21] being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I am opposed to the bill for the reason that it is legislation for a class.
         It provides that whenever a guest comes into a hotel that the hotel has a lien upon his
         baggage for the payment of the bill. It also provides that any person who shall obtain food
         or lodging or other accommodation with an intent to defraud the owner shall be guilty of a
         misdemeanor, and the proof shall be his failure to pay the bill on demand. i don't believe
         in putting any <pb n="116" xml:id="VAA8558-22-116"/> such statutes on the books. Perhaps
         there may be a dispute as to the amount of the indebtedness, and it is not a good law to
         say that proof of his refusal is sufficient to convict of a misdemeanor. It is bad policy.
         Civil procedure in this case is objectionable and criminal is worse. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBERTSON: I am opposed to the passage of the bill. It makes provision for a special
         class, which I think wrong. I think a hotel or inn-keeper ought to be guilty of a
         misdemeanor if he fails to pay any of his own debts.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCk, of Wells: Our committee examined this bill very carefully, and were of the
         opinion this bill ought to pass. The charge that this bill creates a monopoly is mistake
         There has been a law allowing hotel keepers a lien on the baggage of his guest ever since I
         can remember. This is no new law There has always been a distinction between those who are
         traveling and regular boarders The hotel-keepers have had a lien ever since I can remember
         on the baggage of the guest They are compelled to take in every person who calls for
         lodging, and unless they are protected by a lien, such persons can gather up their baggage
         and leave the hotel, and the proprietor has no remedy. No honest man will object to paying
         the bill and will not have a lien put upon his baggage. The intent of this bill is all
         right, There are persons who go to a hotel with the intent of beating the landlord There is
         no landlord in the State who would undertake maliciously or willfully to, prosecute any one </p>

        <head rend="center">COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS.</head>
        <p>Mr. McHenry's bill [H. R. 5] to make County School Superintendents elected by popular
         vote, being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I don't believe the people the State are demanding a change of the law. Out
         of the ninety-two Superintendents in the State there may be some of them that are not
         qualified, yet I don't believe that any law that we could pass would bring about the
         millennium in any of the institutions of our State It is the fault of those who execute the
         law, and not the fault of the law itself. I undertake to say that Indiana has efficient
         corps of County Superintendents as any State in the Union. Feeling as I do that the laws as
         it now stands gives an average efficient corps of County Superintendents; that the people
         do not demand the change, and that under the present law we are accomplishing all that we
         can accomplish any way, I am in favor of letting the law remain as it is. I think we ought
         to keep the subject of politics and our public schools apart. What would this change do? It
         would require every person desiring to become County Superintendent to go through the
         political wire-pulling necessary to get the situation. It brings politics right into the
         school-room. All the County Superintendents will go out in June. Unless there are grave and
         potent reasons for bringing about this new order, we had better leave the law as it is. If
         there is anything Indiana has to be proud of, it is her system of public schools. No class
         of persons in the State has done more to accomplish this than the present corps of County
         Superintendents, For the sake of keeping politics out of the public schools, and on the
         principle that we should legislation stand if it fulfills its purposes. I am opposed to
         this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I maintain that the gentleman on this floor who best represents his
         constituents prevents vicious legislation rather than adds simply tot he volume of its
         statues. I don't know that there are any people sending petitions here asking for the
         passage of this bill under discussion I am a friend of public education. My candid judgment
         and belief is that there is no necessity for a change of this law. The further removed you
         have common schools from the cesspool of politics the better for the educational interests
         of the State. For this reason I will vote against the bill. I don't think that the people
         are crying out for a change through any petition or any memorial, and I don't think any
         change should be made.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: My objection to this bill is that it makes our County Superintendent an
         elective officer. I believe it would be a bad plan to take this matter of the hands of the
         trustees. My constituents are not demanding that the law be changed, and for this reason
         alone I shall vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I don't think there ought to be a distinction between the County
         Superintendents and the selection of Judges of the Courts and other officers. We want to
         bring our officers down as near to the people as possible. The gentlemen arguing against
         this bill say it would put the selection in politics. So far as politics are concerned, I
         think affairs are just as much agitated on the election of the Trustees as they would be in
         the election of the County Superintendents. It is much more easy to corrupt one or two
         Trustees than to corrupt the whole county. Why do you elect the Superintendent of Public
         Instruction and not elect the County Superintendent? The people demand a change in this
         matter. It should be brought down directly to the people I am in favor of the election of
         County Superintendents by the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: Under the present system of electing our County Superintendents it occurs to
         me it is easier to set up a job than it would be under the proposed change. The only
         argument used against this measure is that it is dangerous to trust the people with their
         own interest. I take it that the people are the source of all power. The people said to us
         s representatives you may pass any measure or law that you choose to pass, and we have no
         way to circumscribe your powers in this matter. It is said by the opposition that if we
         take this election out <pb n="117" xml:id="VAA8558-22-117"/> of the hands of County
         Trustees we place it in partisan politics. It is not in partisan politics now? I am
         decidedly in favor of the passage of this bill and letting the County Superintendent be
         amenable to the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I favor the bill for the reason that I believe in the wisdom of the people in
         all matters in which their government is concerned. I suppose that no member would say that
         the people were not wise when they selected him to represent them If there is such a thing
         as a cesspool of politics this affair is already plunged into it.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: I am in favor of this bill for two reasons; first, I believe it is right, and
         second, my constituents demand it. We want to make these men come direct from the people
         and let them be responsible to the people for the careful conduct of their offices.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I certainly am opposed to any change in reference ot the manner of selecting
         our school officers. I believe that the County Trustees will select the best men, and they
         will select them at a time when the question of politics is not at a fever heat. Why should
         we experiment? The people are satisfied. We are the petitions asking for the passage of
         this bill?</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I think this a very important matter. It has been said by gentlemen on the
         floor several times already that it is the custom of Indiana Legislatures to be continually
         hampered with laws. I think it one of the distinguishing marks of the prudence, wisdom and
         erudition of the English Parliament that they are inclined to let well established laws
         alone. We should go slowly when making radical changes. It has been said that one of the
         reasons why we should elect a County Superintendent by the people is because we elect a
         State Superintendent of Public Instruction. There is a wide difference in these two
         officers One is removed far above the scandal of public politics; he has no close relations
         with the people; yet petty dislikes may defeat a good man for the office of County
         Superintendent. This bill would make room for incompetent men. By their peculiar ways of
         manipulating the machine of politics they would be able to triumph over men of influence
         and ability. I shall heartily oppose this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBERTSON: There have been two well defined theories: One is that it is unsafe to
         trust the people; the other is that it is safe. I change to be one of those who think that
         the people can be trusted. I have confidence in the intelligence of my people, and I
         believe that they can be fully trusted for the selection of public servants. I an in favor
         of giving to people the power rightly belongs to them. </p>

        <head rend="center">NEW INSANE ASYLUM</head>
        <p>Mr. Magee's bill [S. 65] for the completion of three new insane asylums with a pending
         amendment to complete bu tone, was under discussion - the question being on a motion to
         recommit the bill to the Committee on Public Buildings [See page 102 of these Brevier
         Reports.]</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE said: I don't know how Senators can ascertain anything new about this question
         by a recommitment of this bill. There is a printe report of the commissioners for the
         construction of these new hospitals, in which is a specific statement of the items which
         are estimated expenditures. This pamphlets has been on the desk of every Senator since the
         opening of this session. The State has spent half a million of dollars upon these buildings
         already. No man has questioned the proposition that they are absolutely required. Nobody
         has questioned, or dares to question, the integrity of the commission that is to have
         charge of this fund. No man can sit down and specify each item, and fix a limit upon it.
         You must appropriate a sum in gross for the purposes named. But in order to give the Senate
         and House of Representatives as full information as the commission itself has, each item is
         specified in the printed report. I can see no good come from a postponement of this
         matter.</p>
        <p>I am aware some Senators say they would like to know what provision is to be made to
         obtain the money with which to complete these buildings. In a few days a bill will be
         introduced providing a way to raise this fund. It can't originate in the Senate, but will
         be presented in the other branch of the Legislature. It is competent for the State to make
         provision in two ways; one by a loan,a nd the other by a tax levy. I am informed that it is
         possible for the State to borrow money at 3 1/2 per cent., and it will cost 1/8 per cent.
         to place the loan, making the total interest 3 5/8 per cent., which, in my judgment, is
         better than to levy a tax. I know of no community suffering in the State to-day. The
         business interests of the country are depressed, the farmer is not now getting a very large
         return for his product; but everybody hopes and everybody knows that in the next year or
         eighteen months we will be on the same plane of prosperity as in 1871 and 1872. The State
         is in a better financial condition relatively than any town or county in the State. It has
         proportionately less debt and more wealth than any city or county in this Union We are
         amply able to do this work now. We will have upon the present levy money enough to meet the
         additional appropriation required in 1885 to construct these buildings. The tax levy won't
         have to be changed one iota. We will be able to pay the appropriation made herein for the
         completion of these buildings without borrowing money, unless it a temporary loan until we
         realize upon the tax. Next year we will have a mew assessment. The Senator from Owen (Mr.
         Fowler) says the assessment will be reduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER (in his seat): I get my information from the Auditor of State.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't believe the Auditor of State knows any better than you or I, or any
         other man. The money to be realized from the present levy will cover every contingency
         under that appropriation. If this <pb n="119" xml:id="VAA8558-22-119"/> bill becomes a law
         there will be no necessity for any additional levy or the borrowing of any funds. When we
         examine the financial condition of the State, there can be found no reasonable objection to
         making this appropriation. If that same prudence and sagacity conduct the management of our
         State affairs that has been given in times past, there will be no re4ason either to raise
         the levy of increase taxation I think the motion to recommit will be defeated </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I do not think a better illustration could be given in favor of having this
         bill recommitted than the very table in this report of the commissioners appointed to erect
         these buildings. [Reads from the report.] Two years ago there was appropriated $600,000 for
         construction, and now they come in with a bill to appropriate $338,000 for one year and
         $225,000 for another year, which added to the $600 000 makes $1,163,000 for this purpose
         when the report of the commission, to which attention has been called, showed they ought to
         cost $834,000</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: What was the estimated cost?</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: $1,200,000. The $600,000 appropriation was to carry them through the first
         two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I am informed it was understood at the time the bill passed that $600,000 was
         appropriated, and it was supposed that sum would build these asylums, although there were
         no estimates made at the time. It was impossible to have estimates, because various plans
         of construction were discussed, both the cottage and detached, but there were no
         architects' plans made and no estimates submitted. They only asked for the construction of
         these buildings $834,000, and yet they propose now to appropriate in a lump without
         specifying what it is for, the sum - together with the $600 000 already appropriated - the
         sum of $1,163,000; $163,000 over a million of dollars If this bill will show specifically
         what this large appropriation is for, what parties are to carry out the contracts, and how
         the money is to be applied, I will support it; but I don't propose to be pu in a false
         position by the remarks of the Senator from Cass (Mr. Magee). I don't propose it is to be
         said that Senators what want this bill to specifically state what the money is appropriated
         for, that they are in favor of stopping this work. </p>
        <p>I am here to vote every dollar necessary for the completion of these buildings. I am here
         to see their construction goes on as cheaply as possible for the State of Indiana. I don't
         want one-half million of dollars thrown after $600,000 already appropriated, without
         knowing what the money is to go for, who is to get it, or how it is to be applied. I think
         the Committee on Public Buildings ought to state what proportion of this money is to go in
         one direction and what in another. The report of the Commissioners has a good many "extras"
         in the estimates, yet we are asked to appropriate in a lump a very large sum of money,
         which may all go as extras to these contractors, unless some limit is placed upon these
         appropriations I believe it to be the duty of the committee when they reported this bill
         here to show the estimates upon which they based it. The bases of the committee does not
         correspond with the basis of the commissioners for the erection of these asylums at all.
         There is a difference of over $300,000 between the estimates of the commissioners and the
         committee which report this bill. When they come with this bill in a proper form, I believe
         that there will not be a single opposing voice.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of St. Joseph: I had the pleasure of being on the committee two years ago
         which had under consideration the bill providing for the erection of these buildings, and,
         as far as my recollection goes, there was no such idea that the cost of these buildings
         should be limited to $600,000. Section 1 of that bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The then Senator from Allen County (Mr. Bell): told me last night that it was
         the general sense of Senators, who supported that bill, that it would cost only $600,000 to
         complete these buildings. I give it to the Senate just as Senator Bell gave it to me. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: I was going to call attention tot he act [Reads.] It was not expected they
         would be completed in two years, but at the expiration of that time other commissioners
         would be appointed to carry on the work. I believe the work will be better done if we pass
         this bill appropriating the aggregate amount, leaving specific amounts to be fixed by the
         commissioners as we did two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I want to refer to a matter the Senator has just spoken of, and I want to
         state what I know. I was in the Senate all the time that bill was considered in open
         Senate, and, as it happened, I heard the committee discussing the question some. I t was
         plain and easy understood, and every Senator ought to know that the $600 000 was to build
         those hospitals I urged upon the Senator from Vanderburg (Mr. Rahm), when the bill provided
         for but one hospital, not to allow any other hospital to be added to it. I told him I
         wanted to vote for his bill, but he told that Senator Bell insisted he must have one at
         Fort Wayne; and they got the bill amended so as to build three. On the floor of the Senate
         no one estimated what they would cost. But the tenth section of the bill implies, and the
         understanding was that $600,000 was all that would be asked for. That is the way I
         understood it, although I voted against the bill. Here is where they got away with those
         who had an implied understanding that $600,000 would build these institutions [Reads] <pb
          n="120" xml:id="VAA8558-22-120"/> Section 15 fixes a sliding scale for the capacity of
         these institutions - not less than 200 nor more than 700. At the central hospital the
         management say that it costs about $1,000 a bed. If the capacity of each of these three
         hospitals was fixed at 200, the presumption is fair that $200,000 for each would have been
         enough. And Senators talked upon the floor here that probably they would want to build
         cottage hospitals, and did't want them so large. That was not the implied understanding,
         but it was talked. It was my understanding, and, I believe, that of the Senate, that
         $200,000 would build each of the three small hospitals, although the shape thing was in I
         voted against the bill. I promised my people after I was elected (there was nothing said
         about it before) that I would use my influence and give my vote to build an additional
         hospital for the insane, but the way that bill was amended I was opposed to it, and I am
         opposed to it to-day. If we can get at what is proper as just to the people I am in favor
         of building an additional asylum for the insane. Superintendent Fletcher, of the Central
         Hospital, and many of these, under the law, are not entitled to be admitted to the State
         Hospital. Five hundred and eight is the number in the report he makes [Reads.] Where are
         the 2 020 the Senate from Cass (Mr. Magee) talks about? </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: In 1880 seventy-five counties reported 658 persons in the alms-houses,
         incurable insane, but it was estimated that there are about 2 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH (resuming): Superintendent Fletcher says there is some error in gathering
         the statistics of 1880, and there was a false impression made. As he has made this a
         business and a study, I rely more upon what he says than anything I could gather myself.
         Two years ago, I confess, I was under the impression that there was a larger number; but I
         have changed my mind about that. There is another singular thing about this: Eight hundred
         and thirty-four thousand four hundred and forty one dollars, they claim, is the contract
         price for building the three institutions, so they ask, with the appropriation contained in
         this bill, $228,358 more than the printed price of all three buildings It is the duty of
         this Senate and of the General Assembly to take care of the interests of the tax-payer and
         I for one expect to stand here advocating their cause until the close of the session.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It is a very excellent thing, and highly gratifying to the tax-payers to know
         that there are men on the floor of the Senate so ready and willing to champion their cause.
         The Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) said among other objections to this bill there are other
         claims before us that we should consider. I ask every Senator upon this floor if there is
         any other claim in this wide world which is paramount to the claim of the insane? I ask if
         there is any class of beings under the sun so utterly under your power for protection as
         that class who it has pleased Divine Providence to deprive of their reason?</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Has the Senator from Wayne any reason to suppose there is any Senator on this
         floor not in favor of doing all that can be done for that unfortunate class of people?</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The Senator must have forgotten that there has been within twenty-four hours
         a proposition made here to cut off two of these asylums; that the contracts should be
         carried out, but only one should be furnished for the space of the next two years. It is
         said by the Senator from Greene (Mr. McIntosh) that Superintendent Fletcher reports that
         there are only 508 outside of the asylums unprovided for. I sumbit if he had red a line or
         two farther the paper shows no such thing. [reads] Now what are the fact - in the County
         Poor houses alone there are more than 508 persons who require treatment. The only question
         to consider is how many insane are there in this State unprovided for, and what means
         should be taken to provide for them. The aggregate capacity of the three institutions will
         be nearly 1 034; the act provides the minimum shall be 600 and the maximum 2,100. I
         remember it was stated committee two years ago that $600,000 would carry us two years. My
         recollection is that statement was made by the Senator from Allen (Mr. Bell), who now says
         he understood the entire appropriation was to be $600 000</p>
        <p>Something has been said s to the manner in which this law was put through. That act upon
         the part of the last General Assembly was as proper as anything of the kind could possibly
         be. It was the opinion of every Senator who express himself that three small hospitals
         would be better than one large one, and we acted upon that principle. The last General
         Assembly did right in providing for three. The ratio all over the world shows that the
         opportunity for cures is largest in asylums erected on the cottage plan The Senator from
         Greene is not aware that the asylum at Richmond is to be built on the cottage plan. We have
         in view the restoration of the insane, and it is not proper for the General Assembly to
         look at a few dollars and a few cents The duty is imposed upon us by the Constitution,
         which every one of us, when we came here, lifted his right had and swore he would support.
         That does not mean inadequate provision; it does not mean that we should keep 300 or 400,
         and let 4,000 or 5,000 go wandering about th State. We should not allow a single insane
         wanderer in the State A few dollars and a few cents are not be weighed in the balance
         against them The Senator from Allen (Mr Bell) made an elegant speech upon this subject two
         years ago, in which he urged by every impulse that can actuate hu <pb n="121"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-121"/> not to leave these people unprotected. I am surprised to find,
         since one of these hospitals was not located in his town, he does all he can to prevent the
         completion of two of them. We are told that Judge Robinson (one of the Commissioners) does
         not believe in the completion of but one of these asylums, yet we have over his official
         signature the request that this identical bill shall be passed by this General Assembly.
         There must have been some misunderstanding in this matter. The Senator (Mr. Fowler) must
         have misunderstood him, for I am sure Judge Robinson would not stultify his official act by
         saying he did not mean that to which his official signature is subscribed. Would it not be
         much better for the State House to be allowed to lie over for two years rather than the
         insane of the State should suffer and remain in the condition they are in to-day? </p>
        <p>An objection by the Senator form Lawrence (Mr. WILLARD) and one other Senator (Mr.
         McIntosh) is that this bill calls for a great deal more money than the contract price; that
         the contract price is $800 000, and the bill calls for $1,100,000. Including the $600,000
         appropriated already. The Commissioners come to us with a statement of things absolutely
         essential. The Senator from Lawrence asks what the objection is to specifying how much
         shall go to make every window and door, and how much for heating apparatus and so on. My
         objection is this: You never can erect a building of any size in which you can tell
         beforehand to a dollar and a cent how much will be needed for this and for that.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Can''t you say how much will be needed for the hospital at Evansville, how
         much for the one at Richmond, and how much for the one at Logansport?</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: We can't say that intelligently. It may be that the price of materials in a
         year or so will so change that it may cost a little more to build in one place or a little
         less in another. What I object to is the putting of these Commissioners under a cast iron
         rule. If in their discretion they can do better by putting $800 in a heating apparatus at
         Evansville, or taking off $500 at Richmond, they ought to have the right to do so; or if
         they can give additional facilities in the matter of water works at Richmond or Evansville
         or Logansport, I believe they can tell better than we whether it is necessary or not. I
         don't suppose any Senator can tell us whether any of these estimates cover the exact
         amount. We have left it to four of the best men, with the Governor, of the State, believing
         their only purpose will be to perform the duty which the law imposes upon them. I believe
         in leaving it tot hem, and not with us, who know nothing about such things, to determine
         what this money can be best expended for.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: Certainly the Senator who has just taken his seat does not think for a
         moment that there is any member of the Senate opposed to taking care of the insane of the
         State. Our State is not able to raise the means this bill proproses to appropriate.
         Senators may talk about the ability of the people, but for the last three, four or five
         years this State has been losing in population. If there was a question in the last canvass
         that was brought forward with determination, it was by the Democrats reflecting upon the
         Republican administration of the affairs of this State. We came into power, as I understand
         it, on the promise of the economy and opposition to increased taxation in this State. That
         was the procuring cause of my presence in this Senate. I am opposed to any more taxation;
         and now you get up a scheme - for it is a scheme - it was prompted by some three gentlemen
         in this Senate Chamber - one couldn't agree that the other should take the building; and
         finally they agreed they would take one building apiece. It will afford me the greatest
         pleasure to vote for the taking care of the insane and the oppressed whenever we have the
         ability to do it; but we are going to shipwreck ourselves if we go back upon the promises
         made by the party of which I am a member, and go into an avalanche of speculation on an
         avalanche of speculation on insane asylums or anything else, I am decidedly opposed to it.
         The State now is owing debts to her citizens who are not knocking at our doors, and she is
         refusing to pay. I regard a refusal to pay on the part of the State as a very great
         reflection upon the honor of the State. We have the ability to build one asylum and finish
         it, I think, entirely, and we have the ability to protect the other two against injury; and
         in two or three years we may be able to finish these also. </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have long since learned that two wrongs never made one right. I think it
         was wrong to build three, thought so before, and never changed my mind about the State
         undertaking to build these three asylums at once. My judgment was we ought to build one,
         for we needed it. When they got three together I voted against it. But we are now in for
         it. We have spent some $600,000, and for the only way I see out of it, with any honor to
         the State, is to build three institutions. I think my friend from Lawrence (Mr. Willard) Is
         right about it; we ought to know where this money is going. We ought to have some
         specifications. The idea of voting that much money without knowing any thing about it,
         would be wrong. I will vote as liberally to take care of these unfortunates as any Senator
         on the floor. I have been called, and it has been thrown up to me that I am the watch dog
         of the Treasury. That is not the case; we have but one watch dog in Indiana. I have tried
         to vote the best I could for all concerned. If we can't get this bill in a better shape I
         shall vote for it as it is, but I shall first try to get it in better shape. I am sorry to
         hear <pb n="122" xml:id="VAA8558-22-122"/> talk about the State going all to pieces. In my
         county we consider real estate worth more than it was several years ago I think when the
         next assessment is made, with the same per cent. of taxation we have now, we will raise
         money enough to build these hospitals by being economical. That is my idea about it.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: I had the honor to introduce a bill two years ago for the erection of one
         asylum. It was amended so as to provide for three. The original bill was to appropriate
         $200,000. The Senator from Allen (Mr. Bell) increased that amount to $600 000. That
         appropriation did not mean to build all three, but that it two years we could appropriate
         the necessary amount. I venture the assertion that there was hardly a single Senator but
         knew we would have to make additional appropriations I don't want the impression to go out
         that we intended it would only require $600,000 to build the three asylums. The law
         provides for the accommodation in these asylums of not less than 200 nor more than 700
         each. The idea was to provide for 1 500 in the three. The reason 200 was put in there is
         that there was an old college building at Logansport which Dr. Fletcher, now Superintendent
         of the Central Asylum, thought we could fix up in a couple of months so as to hold from 200
         to 300 patients. That was the one for the 200 patients, and the others were to be on a
         larger plan. Now here we are, having authorized three by law; and they are in process of
         construction, each one; and the contractors are on the ground; and if you hold back an
         appropriation it will bankrupt them. The Senate from Lawrence (Mr. Willard) asks why the
         committee didn't specify what we need that money for. The bill went before a committee and
         was investigated thoroughly, and came to the conclusion that the money asked to be
         appropriated was proper. We have confidence the commissioners with the Governor. I don't
         see how they can make any more detailed statement than they have in their report.
         Certainly, whatever money is not required the commissioners will not draw, and when the
         buildings are completed the money, of course, reverts back to the Treasury. I stand ready
         to vote for the bill, even if we have to raise the money by direct taxation. </p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I stated when I was up before that I had understood $600,000 would be all
         the money required to build these institutions. Some Senator who followed me tried to make
         sport of that declaration. The only trouble two years ago about building an additional
         asylum for the insane was the place it should be located; that was all the trouble I want
         to read from Senator Van Voorhis' speech on page 227. [Reads from vol. xxi of the Brevier
         Reports.] Now if they had built six according to that idea (at $100,000 each) the cost
         would have been only $600,000 [Reads.] Nobody ever doubted this conclusions. There is a
         little amusing thing occurred along here. For the edification of the Senator from Cass (Mr.
         Magee) I wish to read a little speech he made [Reads.] He was against building them, if
         that was all the reason.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I don't believe the people of this county are proposed to the appropriation
         this bill calls for. The appropriation is large; there is no question about that at all;
         but the subject for which the appropriation is made is much larger than the appropriation.
         I am very much rejoiced that there has not been a single Senator that has for one moment
         questioned the obligation that rests upon members of the Senate, and, indeed, upon the
         people of the State to make full and adequate provision for the care the insane. The
         feelings common to all humanity appeal to us in the strongest possible way to make such
         provision. And in additional we have the positive mandate of the Constitution which imposes
         the duty upon us. The only question is whether it is judicious or proper at this to make
         the appropriation of the general propriety of these appropriations I am heartily in accord
         with the bill and opposed to the amendment offered by the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler).
         It is a conceded fact that the State of Indiana has commenced the building of three asylums
         and has actually paid out about half a million of dollars, and to that extent we have got
         into the enterprise, and there is not retrograding out of it. by the amendment we would
         have had one asylum completed; which one we don't know. That would give rise to a struggle
         as between Evansville, Richmond and Logansport, which would induce lobbying in the
         interests of each one of these three points as to which one would be favored by the
         Commissioners. That would be a spectacle for the edification of the people of Indiana! That
         would the be first result to follow the passage of the bill were this amendment adopted.
         Then it provides that two are not to be completed. They are to be left standing uncompleted
         for at least two years from this time, and we don't know how much longer, because when once
         stopped the force of inertia has to be overcome to get started again. It strikes me that
         will not commend itself to the wisdom of this body as a very business-like proposition,
         losing sigh of the welfare of a great number of insane who will not be provided for. If
         this bill is passed it will furnish accommodation for every man, woman and child in the
         State, and that will satisfy the demand made on us by the Constitution of our State, a
         demand that has been neglected very much to the discredit of the State, to make full,
         complete and adequate provision for the insane of the State. It has been said that this
         bill does not specify for what purpose this money is to be appropriated. It has not
         occurred to my mind that there is any <pb n="123" xml:id="VAA8558-22-123"/> doubt or
         uncertainty on that subject. I think the report of the commissioners furnishes adequate
         information as to what is be done with the money. [Reads from the report] We might as well
         have done with this subject now as at some future time. It is a duty that rests upon this
         Legislature, and has ever since the adoption of the Constitution in 1851, and I am not
         prepared to vote to postpone the discharge of a duty which has been already much too long
         postponed. </p>
        <p>The motion to recommit and the amendment were both rejected. THe bill was ordered
         engrossed. [See page 102.]</p>

        <p>Mr. FOWLER called up his proposed amendment to the rules, so that when a committee report
         favorably on a bill but seventy-five copies shall be printed if the committee so recommend.
         He said it will cost $10,000 this session to print bills under the rule as it now
         stands.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE opposed the amendment. The present rule is an improvement on the practice
         session, and there would be less expense under the present rule than was incurred during
         the past one or two Legislatures. Unless bills are printed but few members on which they
         will be called upon to vote. It is an easy matter when bill is of small importance for some
         Senator to move that it be not printed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: Many bills are of a dangerous character of legislation. The Alien bill of
         several years ago was not printed, and it passed both houses easily. If it had been printed
         it would not have passed, and that bill has been of great damage to the people of the
         State. Every Senator should have a fair chance to understand the provisions of every bill -
         especially those reported favorably from committees.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH was of opinion there was already been more printing this session than during
         the whole of last session. He spoke of the stringing out of the printed matter
         unnecessarily, which increases the cost. When a bill is read some member can determine if
         there are vicious principles in it, and if so, it can be ordered printed. He hoped the
         amendment would be passed in the interest of the economy. </p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS thought it for the information of every Senator to have bills printed. Enough
         time has been spent in discussing this question to pay for the printing of probably fifty
         bills. He demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operations the
         proposed amendment to the rules was rejected by yeas 12, nays 30.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOWLER called up from the files his notice for an amendment of the rules so that the
         daily sessions shall commence at 9 o'clock a.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH opposed the amendment. He desired the Senate should be as industrious as
         possible, but as we all know the work of this body now is being done in the committee
         rooms. With a little more attention, the business is this Chamber can be done in four hours
         per day. Committee members should not be compeiled to sit in committee rooms till 11 and 12
         o'clock at night, when so much time is idled away in open Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: SO far as the amendment would be economy in time, it would have the contrary
         effect. An early hour for meetings would show no quorum present, and possibly force and
         early adjournment on that account. it is well enough later in the session when all the
         committee work is in, to meet earlier, but now it would prove an absolute loss of time.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER desired a change so that members might have a chance to blow off their gas
         between 9 and 10 o'clock and so be able to get down to business by 10 o'clock. He believed
         as many members would be here at 9 as at 10 o'clock. It is the general <pb n="125"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-125"/> desire that there shall be no extra session, and let us work
         with that view. He insisted the amendment should prevail. </p>
        <p>The amendment to the rule was rejected by yea 17, nays 28.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE'S TREASURE INVESTIGATION.</head>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I rise to a question of privilege. A few days since you did me the honor, Mr.
         President, to appoint me as a member of a committee to whom was referred that portion of
         the Governor's message in regard to the State Treasury, which committee was required to
         report whether an investigation was proper and necessary. A state of facts has occurred
         since that time which, in my humble opinion, renders it impossible for any man who respects
         himself to continue longer a member of a committee whose only purpose, as he believes is to
         stifle an investigation in regard to which it was authorized to inquire. I wish to lay this
         matter before the Senate and ascertain whether the Senate desires, under the circumstances
         that I should longer remain a member of the committee. The committee met on the afternoon
         of day before yesterday at the Bates House - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH (interrupting): I rise to a point of order I don't think there is any
         question of privilege about this. The Senator proposes to state what has occurred in the
         Committee room. I don't think he has nay right to make that sort of a statement under the
         claim of a question of privilege.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I should be very glad to refer to Senate as to what are questions of
         privilege under parliamentary law. They are questions relating to the conduct of the
         members, and the complaint of one member against another. These have been decided and
         questions of privileges - as to the conduct of a member, and as to whether or not it is
         proper that I shall continue longer a member of a committee -</p>
        <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH (interposing): I insist on my point of order.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I will refer this question or order to th Senator from Lawrence
         (Mr. Willard) and the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) to decide whether this a question of
         privilege or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: When would you like to have a report from this committee.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENTANT GOVERNOR: At once - immediately.</p>
        <p>While this committee was in consultation - </p>
        <p>Mr. Duncan, of Brown, introduced a bill [S. 201] for the relief Joel L. Davis, and
         authorizing the refunding to him of certain damages paid into the treasury of Bartholomew
         County, which was read the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The committee agrees that this matter introduced by the Senator from Wayne
         (Mr. Foulke) is not a question of privilege, and bases the opinion upon the following
         authority: [Reads] The Senator from Wayne seems to think it is a question of privilege to
         ask to be excused from service on a committee. It is decided otherwise. [Reads.] </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I will ask, sir, not as a question of privilege, to be excused from serving
         on that committee, and desire to state the reasons why I ask. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: That is not in order, under our regular order of business We should have to
         suspend the regular order of business.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) will take his seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I move that the regular order of business be suspended that the Senator may
         state why he does not wish to act further with the Investigation Committee.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I hope there will be objection. </p>
        <p>Several Senators - "Consent," "consent," "regular order"</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: On the occasion of the first meeting of the Investigation Committee the State
         Treasurer was invited by some members of the majority to be present, and no objection was
         made whatever by any member of the committee. The committee, after attending to some
         preliminary business - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I have no objection to everything that has been done before that
         committee being told: but if the Senator is to have the floor to make a speech we should
         the right to reply.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I requested the Senator from Wayne to take his seat until the
         motion should be decided by the Senator from Lawrence and the Senator from Marion, and they
         have decided against him.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I object to the Senator taking the floor in this manner for the purpose
         of delivering a political speech. He does not seem to understand that he is returned with
         the minority here, and that the majority have the responsibility upon them; that same
         spirit which caused the minority four years ago to dictate what the legislation should be
         and what not be has shown itself in this case, and the minority on that committee are
         determined to have their own way about it or refuse to act. The committee will in due time
         make a report, when the minority can also make report. I object to him making insinuations
         against the members of the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It is unfortunate in the extreme - </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD (interrupting): I rise a point of order. The Senator from Wayne has no right
         to come upon this floor and impugn the motives of any other member of a committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I impugn the motives of no one.</p>
        <pb n="126" xml:id="VAA8558-22-126"/>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: You are doing it. If he is not satisfied with the action of the committee he
         has a regular parliamentary remedy. He can make a minority report in such language as he
         sees fit to use, and if the language is not proper he is amenable to the rules of the
         Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I have had, as I understand it, consent of the Senate to state the facts upon
         which I am asking to be excused from serving on the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIARD: You have not stated the facts.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I was proceeding to do so when interrupted by the Senator from Gibson (Mr.
         McCollough)</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I intended to call your attention to the fact that objection was
         made.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: If the majority of this Senate feel that they can afford not only to stifle
         the treasury investigation in their committee, but also to stifle an account of the
         transactions of their committee upon the floor of the Senate, I am content. [Calls of
         "order" and raps of the gavel caused the Senator to raise his voice to a high pitch.]</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR [rapping with his gavel]: The Senator will take his seat. Bills
         on the second reading was the order at the adjournment, and under the rules, I suppose,
         that order shall be continued.</p>

        <p>Mt. Hilligass't Sheep Husbandy Encouragement bill [S. 79] coming up in regular order, it
         was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill provides that a registry of sheep killed shall be kept, and the
         sheep paid for in the order in which they are registered. That is fair and just. It makes
         it impossible for the Township Trustee to give preference to his neighbors in the payment
         of losses The bill also provides that the surplus funds shall be apportioned pro rata
         between cities and towns. It is well known a great portion of the tax levied upon dogs
         comes from cities and towns, and it is proper that cities and towns should have their pro
         rata share of the surplus.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: It seems to me there would be a decided propriety in
         recommitting this bill to the Committee on Agriculture for this reason: There are two if
         not three other bills on this same subject now before the Committee on Agriculture, a
         report on which has been delayed because some Senators want to lay these bills before a
         convention of sheep raisers to meet in this city some time soon.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: Out of courtesy to the Senator from St. Joseph I consent that the bill may
         be referred to the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
        <p>It was so referred with an amendment proposed by the Senator from Elkhart (Mr. Davis),
         which was not read.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOWLER's bill [S. 112] to cut off fraudulent sales of personal property was read the
         second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to amend so the Recorder shall receive the same fee for
         recording sale notes as for recording chatall mortgages.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: These bills of sales might cover many pages, and it might be injustice to
         require an officer to record them at the same price as chattel mortgages. It seems to me
         the bill ought to pass just as it is. It proposes t give the officer compensation for what
         he does and nothing more.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to amend so the Recorder's fee shall in no case be less than fifty
         cents.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to strike from the amendment the word "less" and insert in lieu of the
         word "more"</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I don't think the amendment would be just to the Recorder. There are
         instances where such instruments cover eight or ten pages, and it would not be fair to say
         the fee for recording shall not be more than fifty cents.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The Recorder is the lowest paid officer in the county. He is not paid
         sufficiently in some counties to support himself and pay necessary clerk hire. I think the
         motion of the Senator from Jay was right. I am opposed to the amendment to amendment.</p>
        <p>It was rejected and the amendment [Mr. Winter's] was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. Smith's of Jennings bill [S. 73] to provide that a female attendant shall accompany

         Superintendent shall have $2000 per month set aside as a fund for contingent expenses what
         remains at the end of each month to be returned to the Treasury, coming up in regular order
         - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: This bill is for the convenience of the Superintendent who now has to pay
         current expenses out of his own picket, and then depend on making out of a bill and
         collecting it when the next monthly meeting of the Board of Trustees takes place. It adds
         no more to the expense.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This bill should be amended so as to apply to all the other Insane
         Hospitals.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The part relative to female patients could not be made to apply
         to the other hospitals, but the setting aside a contingent fund might He moved to suspend
         the constitutional rule that the bill might be passed to the final vote now.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I think this way of suspending the constitutional provision is all wrong.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas, 24; nays, <pb n="127" xml:id="VAA8558-22-127"/> 18 - the
         required two thirds not voting in the affirmative. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, explaining his negative vote: Section 1 of this bill seems
         to contemplate that whatever has heretofore gone to the Sherrif for mileage in the
         transportation of female patients to and from the Insane Asylum shall go to the
         Superintendent of the institution. It seems to me the aggregate profits would be very
         large. And I apprehend there are no other features in this bill which the Senate should
         carefully consider. Therefore I vote "no"</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. Smith, of Jennings, the bill was read the second time.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE it was referred to a select committee of three [Messrs. Magee,
         Smith of Jennings, and Foulke] with instructions to amend so it shall apply to all the
         insane hospitals, which committee soon returned the bill to the Senate with said
         amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: This bill is intended to provide a humane way of transporting
         female patients to and from the Hospital for the Insane. There is such an inhumane practice
         now in vogue which we can not endure any longer. I move to adopt the report of the
         committee to which the bill was originally referred, and also the amendments reported by
         this special committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: In my opinion this bill proposes to take from the Sheriffs of the various
         counties a duty which is devolved upon them by the statutes, and give it to the
         Superintendents of the Hospitals for the Insane. For that reason I don't think it should be
         passed. I believe the fees and emoluments of the Superintendents of the Hospitals from this
         source would amount to thousands of dollars. I move to make this bill a special order for
         Thursday at 2 o'clock p.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: There are several things in this bill which should receive much more careful
         consideration. The law which now regulates the transportation of patients to the Insane
         Hospital makes ample provision for female attendants; it does not use the word "female,"
         but it covers the case. There is ample provision made to send not only a female assistant
         tot he Sheriff, but some female relative of the patient. The Superintendents of hospitals,
         according to the provisions of this bill, are to have the compensations now allowed
         assistants. Section 2,871, R.S. of 1881, allows eight cents per mile to every assistant
         both ways, which, by this bill, is to go into the pockets of the Superintendents of these
         asylums. I don't for one moment imagine it was intended anything of that kind should be
         done under this bill. Again, I do not understand why $2,000 a month for contingent expenses
         should be put in the hands of the Superintendent of the central hospital and $1,000 a month
         in the hands of each of the Superintendents of the other hospitals. Twenty-four thousand
         dollars and $36,000 makes $60,000, which is a large sum of money to be disposed of in that
         way. Therefore I think the motion to postpone the consideration of this bill should
         prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: That section is not properly guarded in relation tot he compensation for
         bringing patients to the asylums.</p>
        <p>The motion to postpone was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. Robinson's bill [H. R&gt; 13] to repeal an act authorizing aliens to hold titles to
         real estate, coming up in regular order was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I am convinced that this bill in its present condition ought not to pass, for
         the reason that it is simply a repealing law. It will require further legislation declaring
         that aliens shall not hold real estate. The Senate bill contains these provisions, and that
         bill has already gone through the Senate. I think it would be better to postpone the
         consideration of this bill. Besides, the title of this bill is not correctly stated here. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I desire to say that the title is correctly stated. I believe that the
         consideration of this bill ought not to be postponed. I think the bill ought to pass. It
         may be that by the passage of a bill of this character some further legislation may be
         needed, and if that is true I will vote for the Senate bill. This bill comes here in the
         regular order. Out of the considerable number of bills this bill was selected for passage.
         It has received the indorsements of the Judiciary Committee, and I can see no reason why
         this bill should be postponed. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: I am not in favor of postponing this bill. Two years ago I had the pleasure
         to introduce a bill of the same purport, and while it was the intention of that House to
         pass that bill, it was defeated by postponing, and never reached a vote. The title of this
         is copied from the original bill. If there is any defect, it was in the title of the
         original bill. Ever if there is a Senate bill already passed that body, I see no
         impropriety in passing upon this bill. It gives an impetus to the idea. If the Senate bill
         reaches farther up, I see no reason why the passage of this bill should obstruct the
         passage of the Senate bill. It has been asked whether, if this passes and becomes a law, it
         will prevent aliens from possessing real estate to morrow. Probably not. There is not
         emergency clause in it. I am not in favor of passing unfavorably upon this bill, so as to
         obstruct legislation upon that subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: This is a very important measure, and it is expedient on the part of the House
         to use discretion in passing it. I am opposed to this bill and in favor of the Senate bill,
         which i think is full and complete. The bill before the House repeals the law that gives
         aliens the right to hold real estate in the State of Indiana. I apprehend <pb n="128"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-128"/> that the passage of this bill would give rise to different
         questions of doubt, and possibly involve men who have acquired rights under our laws in
         long and continued legislation. The Senate bill makes some provisions for men who have
         purchased real estate under the existing law. The bill before the House doe snot do this. I
         approve the sentiment of the bill as far as it goes, bu I think we should be too hasty and
         enact legislation that will require additions to it. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I am in favor of the provisions of this bill, but while that is true I
         don't think it right and proper for this House to proceed and pass the bill while the
         Senate bill, which contains all the provisions of the present bill, is before our
         committee. We don't need these two bills. The title is not good because it has been copied
         from the old bill. It is defective. I move that the further consideration of this bill be
         postponed until next Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: The motion to postpone this bill until next Thursday is a wise motion. We all
         agree as to the merits and the ideas of this bill. I don't believe this bill will reach the
         ends that we all want to reach. The bill that comes from the Senate gives aliens five years
         in which to dispose of their property.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I favor the postponement of this because it can't hurt the
         bill. A few days' delay will not affect the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: It has been stated that if this bill is passed in its present form we would
         be without law upon this subject. In other worse, that aliens could not take my descent.
         There is a law upon this subject. That law is still in force and was not repealed by the
         act of 1881. So the effect of repealing this act leave the law in force that is already in
         force authorizing real estate to pass to aliens by descent. In the absence of all statutory
         law I undertake so say that no alien has a right to hold real estate in the State of
         Indiana. I hope the bill will not be postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operation the motion to make this bill a
         special order for Thursday next was agreed to by yeas 55, nays 36.</p>

        <p>Mr. Helms' bill [H. R. 32] to provide for the purchase of all stationery for county
         officers by the County Commissioners, coming up in regular order, was read the third
         time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: Our county has tried the plan of purchasing stationery after the plan
         suggested in the bill, and found it worked admirable. At the close of 1884 our county
         learned that by purchasing stationery themselves they made a saving of $900. Thinking that
         it would make a general saving throughout the State, I have introduced this bill, and ask
         its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: We have had some experience in this line in my county, only our experience is
         just in the other way precisely. We found that it was a loss of money and that we did not
         get as good stationery by allowing the County Commissioners to purchase it. I am opposed to
         the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: There is a good deal int he character and quality of paper, and I think the
         clerks and officers of the county are better judges of what kind of paper they want than
         the County Commissioners. I think the county officers are better qualified to know the
         quality of the paper they want.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: As far as the officers of my county are concerned I consider them honorable
         gentlemen. As has been said, they know what they want. The stationery men will form a
         combination on the County Commissioners, and they will be obliged to take the Stationery at
         the price offered by this combination. I am opposed to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: There seems to be a misunderstanding about this bill. The only difference
         between this bill and the law is that the bill provides that the furnishing of stationery
         shall be let by public auction. The law provides that the County Commissioners shall by all
         the paper they want. This bill would cause a reduction in the cost of the stationery, and I
         think it ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: For two years past the county officers of my county have been cutting down
         the price of stationery by letting the furnishing out to auction. I believe this is a wise
         measure, and ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I believe that county officers are elected with a view to their fitness and
         qualifications. I apprehend that a Board of County Commissioners know as little about the
         wants of a certain clerk as it is possible for them to know. I believe the bill before the
         House would be the means of brining into use in the offices an inferior class of
         stationery, and this is especially not desirable, when we come to include the different
         books or records and tax duplicates etc. It is necessary that they be of the very best
         quality. I can not conceive who could be a better judge of the stationery they want than
         the County Auditor, County Clerk, or any other officer. I am opposed to the bill. </p>

         <p>The Speaker announced the special order for his hour, being the consideration of the
          Senate amendment [see page 88 of the Brevier Reports] to the House concurrent resolution
          for an investigation into the Governor's failure to make an examination of the State
          Treasurer's office.</p>
         <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved that the further consideration of the concurrent resolution <pb
           n="129" xml:id="VAA8558-22-129"/> and amendment be postponed until next Wednesday at 2
          o'clock. </p>
         <p>Mr. SAYRE: I hope the motion to postpone the consideration of this concurrent resolution
          will not pass. I hope so because I feel from the information that I am possessed of that
          the subject demands immediate attention. If all the members of this House don't know, some
          of the members do know that the condition of the Indiana State Treasury is in no wise in
          the condition that the law or public safety require it. On that account I believe that
          this Senate amendment ought to be concurred in, authorizing the formation of a committee.
          I do this for the reason that the Senate has awakened to the public demand upon this
          question that the Treasury of the State of Indiana was in an unsafe condition and that it
          should be investigated, and the Senate paid heed to that voice and reversed its action
          upon this subject. I believe that the House ought to concur in this amendment, and that a
          committee ought to be formed with power to send for persons and papers. I think I am not
          going beyond what the people generally believe that the Treasurer of the State of Indiana
          for the last two years has been constantly violating the law; that he has is a criminal
          under the laws of the State of Indiana; and I believe by investigation their officer will
          be shown to be an embezzler, and when he takes the oath of office it will be moral perjury
          on his part. This is the condition of the State Treasury. Where there should be $486,000 I
          feel safe in saying there is not one half that amount. I feel safe in saying that all
          sorts of schemes and devices have been resorted to by the Treasurer and his friends to
          make an appearance or a showing that might satisfy a committee only asking of witnesses
          not under oath, I don't believe that any useful information will be derived from the
          report of the committee we have already appointed, and on that account I think the further
          consideration of his question ought to be postponed. Because of a misunderstanding between
          the members of the committee as to their power and authority, they can not and will not
          afford this House any information that will be useful upon this question, in no way can
          this matter be settled so that the people of Indiana will be satisfied except by the
          appointment of a committee with the authority to send for persons and papers and making a
          complete showing of the Treasury of the State of Indiana. I believe I am warranted further
          in giving information to this House and I am not quite sure that it is violating etiquette
          that the committee that is now in the investigation of these affairs are utterly powerless
          to make investigation. I can show that the Treasurer holds $60,000 worth of Marion County
          orders drawing interest. While the law requires that he shall have the cash in the
          Treasury to pay on demand, yet he exhibits as assets county orders issued to John C.
          Shoemaker that are more than twelve months due and drawing interest. This committee has
          not power to find out whether these orders are the equivalent of cash. I have said this
          much why the investigation ought not to be postponed. The Treasurer is soon to file a new
          bond, and before his term commences or is entitled to commence under the law this
          investigation ought to be made complete and thorough. Any legislation upon this subject
          will be retarded and prevented if it is possible. So that the wise thing for your to do if
          you want to be faithful tot he public interest and protect the funds that have been raised
          by the hard processes of taxation, is to make this investigation now that the people may
          feel entirely safe in relation to the condition of their funds in the State Treasury. </p>
         <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I shall not go into the discussion that the gentleman has indulged in.
          This resolution was passed by this House and taken to the Senate, and before that
          resolution came back they passed a resolution asking that the House concur with them in
          the making of a committee to investigate the part of Governor Porter's message referring
          to the State Treasury. The majority of this House passed that resolution. That committee
          has been doing its work and doing it well. Contrary to what the gentleman has said this
          committee hs understood the resolution very well. I know that they understood it so well
          that every Democrat voted on one side and Republicans on the other. I don't know of any
          misunderstanding. Now it is fair and right to appoint another committee before the one
          already appointed has had time to report? This is the best reason in the world why the
          consideration of this resolution and its amendment be postponed until Wednesday at 2
          o'clock, and by that time I have reason to believe that the committee that has been
          appointed to see whether this investigation was necessary will have reported, and the
          House can tell what to do. I demand the previous question. </p>
         <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operation the motion to postpone was agreed
          to by yeas 54, nays 33.</p>

         <p>The House resolved into a Committee of the Whole, for the consideration of the General
          Appropriation bill, the time of the traveling expenses of the State Superintendent was
          reduced from $600 to $500, and $450 was added for the purpose of meeting all outstanding
          obligations not paid through failure of the Appropriation bill of the last session. An
          effort was made to strike out or reduce the appropriation for a Deputy Attorney General,
          but the movement was a failure. The bill was ready by sections, and discussed and amended
          as far as the section making an appropriation for the State Librarian an then committee
          arose to meet again Monday at 2 o'clock.</p>

          said the resolution seems to be a little broad; there ought to be a price fixed, and not
          leave the cost entirely with the Librarian.</p>

         <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to fix the cost at $500.</p>
         <p>Mr FOWLER: Five hundred dollars is too much.</p>
         <p>Lieutenant Governor MANSON: I don't think it will cost $100.</p>
         <p>Mr. Fowler moved to amend by the amendment by providing the cost shall not exceed

         <p>Mr. FAULKNER: We have a very economical little lady for State Library, and I think we

         <head rend="center">SHORT HAND COURT REPORTERS.</head>
         <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced a special order, being Mr. Macy's Court Reporters'
          bill [S. 64], on the second reading, with pending amendment, proposed by Mr. Macy, so that
          the report shall receive his pay from the parties litigant, and not from the county, as
          the law now is. </p>
         <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The present law provides that a short hand reporter may be appointed
          either by the Judge or on agreement of parties. It also provides the reporter shall be
          paid not to exceed $10 per day out of the County Treasury. The amendment provides that the
          Judge, if he deems it necessary, shall appoint the reporter, but he shall not be paid over
          $7 a day. It takes from the parties litigant the power to appoint by mere agreement, and
          have the reporter paid out of the Treasury of the county. The report may never be used -
          simply parts of it may be used by the Court - it may always remain in short hand as far as
          that is concerned, and it is wrong to compel parties to pay for that kind of a report
          unless they want to use it. </p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD" My opinion is that this is practically the creation of a new officer. I
          can't see it in any other way. In actual practice we never find the Judge of his own
          motion appointing a short-hand reporter.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: The most economical arrangement is to try cases with a short hand
          reporter.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD: I guarantee that when it comes to practical operations under this bill that
          wherever a motion is made by reputable attorneys for a short-hand reporter he will be
          appointed The object of the bill as originally introduced evidently was to take this
          burden from the County Treasury, but the Judiciary Committee in amending the bill have
          struck out that idea. The original feature ought to prevail.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, thought the amendment proposing to pay the reporter by the parties
          litigant was fair and just, but did not think it right for parties to go into the Circuit
          or Superior Court, and have the Court appoint a reporter and pay him out of the County
          Treasury. He thought it better that the fees of the reporter be taxed as other costs.</p>
         <p>The amendment (Mr. Macy') was rejected by yeas 15, nays 20.</p>
         <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to amend so that the caption and Judge's certificate may be certified
          by the clerks; and also to reduce the per diem from $7 to $5. In my opinion $7 per day is
          too much as there are so many beginners in short-hand, and at the same time reporters
          ought not to be paid within a dollar a day of as much as the Judges get, and in addition
          be allowed $8 or $10 more for transcribing notes, and making his pay $10 or $15 a day,
          while the Judge only gets $8.</p>
         <p>Mr. DAVIS: There may be circumstances when it may be right to pay some reporters more
          than $7 per day. I understand there are some Judges who will not allow more than $5 per
          day now.</p>
         <p>He demanded a division of the question.</p>
         <p>The first part was agreed to.</p>
         <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks: I think short-hand reporters are becoming so numerous that
          they can be had for $5 a day; and the nay ought to be limited; if not limited the Judge
          will allow $7.</p>
         <p>The latter part of the amendment was also agreed to, and the bill ordered engrossed for
          the third reading.</p>

         <head rend="center">A $600 000 LOAN.</head>
         <p>The Lieutenant Governor announced the special order for 3 o'clock being Mr. Magee's bill
          [S. 196] to provide for a temporary loan of $600,000 - the question being on amendments
          reported by the Finance Committee.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the bil by striking out the first section after the enacting
          clause, which states the loan is made necessary by appropriations made by this General
          Assembly. No such contingency has as yet arisen. No bills have yet passed making
          extrodinary expenses, and until that has been done I think a provision of this kind
          injudicious. There is already a fund that might be considered. There already a fund which
          might be considered a contingent fund that is yielding some $35,000 or $40,000 a year,
          known as the permanent endowment fund of the State University. The Legislature ought not
          to provide for anything of this kind unless there is some demand made fo it, and it seems
          to me there is none yet. What appropriation is it necessary to meet? None <pb n="132"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-132"/> have yet occurred. Whenever appropriations are made by this
          General Assembly that makes it necessary to pass a bill of this kind, it will be time
          enough to do so. The 2nd amendment I propose is to strike out the word "temporary" I don't
          understand the words "temporary loan" should be introduced here. I don't understand all
          our bonds are temporary bonds. If these bonds are funded at all there is no reason why the
          permanent bonds should not be funded as well as the temporary bonds. It seems to me it
          should be optional with the State officers to fund any bonds when they can do so at a
          lower rate of interest. I hope these amendments will prevail. </p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD: The Finance Committee gave this bill thorough consideration and it was
          reported back as a matter of absolute necessity at this time. After this Legislation
          adjourns there can be no provision made for meeting the expenses of the State until 1887.
          This Senate by almost a unanimous vote less than a week ago passed a bill appropriating
          $568 000 for building three additional hospitals for the insane. Now we have starring us
          in the face that five hundred and over thousand dollars to provide for. How are you going
          to provide for that? You have got either to increase the levy, and that wont reach it the
          first year, or you will have to let the State officers provide for it by a temporary loan,
          or leave a deficit and the Treasury without money to run the government until the
          Legislature meets again. As tot he second amendment - to strike out the word temporary -
          that evidently was proposed under a misapprehension. I don't think any Senator could
          desire to reduce the school fund loan. We don't want to force the State to borrow money,
          but we will have to do something to provide for the extraordinary expenses we believe
          which we believe both branches of this General Assembly are in favor of. </p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: I supposed this question had been so thoroughly discussed last week that it
          would not be necessary to go over the same ground again. This is simply a question of
          business. We have a loan (costing us 5 per cent interest) amounting in round numbers to
          $700,000, known as a temporary loan. Under the provisions of that bill we can refund that
          loan at an expense of 3 5/5 per cent. Since I came to the Senate chamber to-day I received
          a note from a gentleman who does not care to have his name mentioned, but a man who can
          carry out any proposition he makes, stating that if this bill is amended so as to make the
          bonds 10 20 bonds, he will take the entire loan at 3 1/2 per cent. So there is no doubt
          but that the State officers can make a contract for 3 5/8 per cent. There was not a
          dissenting voice as to the business sagacity of this bill. We ought to have a law so that
          at any and all times the State officers can refund a debt if it can be done so as to save
          the people's money. Under this bill in the next two years the State can save $16,000.</p>
         <p>The Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) says the bill making the appropriation for the three
          insane asylums has not yet become a law. Grant all that: there would be no harm in passing
          this bill because it is a prudential measure. One of the objections to the hospital asylum
          bill was that there was no provision made for the money appropriated. Now we have made
          provision for raising the money and the Senator objects to it. All the money required to
          carry on these buildings and to do anything necessary for the State will be on hand with
          our increased amount of taxation. We have expense of $35,000 to rebuild the Women's
          Department of the insane asylum, which has damaged by fire the other day. Then there will
          be an appropriation for Purdue University, covering several years: there will be an
          appropriation for the State University, on account of fire there; and the State will
          require more money than we can raise by levy for the present year, because the new
          assessment will not be returned until 1886. We will have about one hundred million of
          taxables. The Senator from Owen says that only 60 per cent. of the taxes are collected. I
          think the Senator is mistaken.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I get my information from the Auditor of State.</p>
         <p>Mr MAGEE: I know that is not so - able as that officer is -as able as any officer who
          ever occupied the position There is not one county in the State but what pays more than 60
          per cent; 98 is about what we average. The Auditor must be mistaken, if he says that 40
          per cent is not collected. I don't suppose there need be any further discussion of this
          question, I therefore move to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: Oh, no, don't do that.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: I withdraw the motion, with the understanding that I renew it. </p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: The Senator calls in question the statement of the Auditor of State. The
          Auditor is correct, as his books show.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: They say there is a great amount of bad bookkeeping about those State
          buildings [Laughter]</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I don't believe it.</p>
         <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't either, and I don't believe there is 40 per cent. delinquent on tax
          collections.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I have known those men for many years and I don't believe there is any bad
          book-keeping there. But here is the statement of the Auditor [Reads.] I don't care to
          discuss that. The Senator from Lawrence (Mr. Willard) says his understanding is that we
          have no permanent bonds, but that they are all temporary. I understand we have canal bonds
          issued away back in 1840 issued away back in 1840, yet standing against the State. These
          are permanet bonds and they would not be included in the bill. I offered my amendment with
          the view, if these bonds can be refunded for a less rate of interest than they are drawing
          to authorize the State officers to do it. I don't mean to include the school fund
          bonds.</p>
         <pb n="133" xml:id="VAA8558-22-133"/>
         <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE, the amendments were laid on the table.</p>

         <p>Mr. MAGEE: I will look up the authorities, and if it does will move to reconsider the

         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I will move to lay that motion on the table.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD [reads from Wilson's Parliamentary Digest]: The amendment was not so germane
          as to carry the bill with it. Then the bill was not here.</p>
         <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: If the amendment was in order, laying it on the table
          carries the bill with it. </p>
         <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed to.</p>
         <p>Mr. WILLARD demands the previous question.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I insist on my motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table. There
          was a second to it. </p>
         <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Senator from Cass (Mr. MAGEE) was still on his feet at the
          time you offered your motion to reconsider on the table. I don't know whether you claim
          the floor or not.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: If the Chair decides I didn't why, no matter.</p>
         <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operations the

        <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Secretary of State
         transmitting to the House a bill [H. R. 351] to provide for the removal of mill dams,
         passed by the last General Assembly, to which the Governor (Porter) filed objections in the
         office of the Secretary of State within five days next after the adjournment of said
         General Assembly.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The Constitution says when a bill is returned from the Governor, with his
         objections to the House in which it originated, the House shall proceed to consider the
         bill, and if a majority of the House do say so, it shall become a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I want to say to this House that after this bill was presented
         tot he Governor to sign I wrote home to my constituency about it. We have fifteen mill dams
         in Tippecanoe County I asked the Governor not to sign the bill until I wrote with regard to
         the matter. I believe this thing is all wrong. Behind this thing, I think, there is an
         interest somewhere. We have four or five laws by which mill damns can be abated. And there
         is another question. The mills supply materials for brad, and their improvements are placed
         in jeopardy by this act. I f there be a mill-dam that is a nuisance, there are laws to
         abate public nuisances - if they are not used or misused. But if every possible kind of
         mill property in Indiana may be seized upon and the owner requested to take as many dollars
         for it, he is forced into court without a prima facie case I see no right in this. The law
         does not give anybody this right, and it is not for public utility Many persons when I was
         called home who were interested in this matter, spoke to me of it. I am opposed to this
         bill simply because it takes a man's property without the right of trial by jury. I simply
         think it is all wrong.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I shall sustain the veto of the Governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: As I understand it the bill denies the right of trial by jury. I will vote

         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, in explanation of his vote, said: I desire to explain my vote. Two years ago I
         voted for this bill, but there is now a bill before the House substantially the same, which
         can be modified so as to allow a jury trial, which I believe a man ought to have in a case
         of this kind. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON, in explanation of his vote, said: I will vote against this bill, although I
         voted for it two years ago - not indicating what position I shall take again.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN, in explanation of his vote sad: I think the bill is too broad in its
         character, therefore I shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS said in explanation of his vote: I believe I opposed this bill on the floor

         about the noble youths of Indiana and about your glorious educational institutions, but why
         does this institution up there ask so much? Why does it take so much to run this

        <head rend="center">ATTORNEYS' FEES IN NOTES.</head>
        <p>Mr. Smith's of Jay, bill [S. 41] to make void attorneys' fees in instruments of writing
         coming up on the second reading:</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: The reason I introduced this bill is not because I have an antipathy to the
         payment of notes containing such an agreement, but because there is a growing abuse of the
         attorney fee law to such an extent that warrants legislative interference. And if this
         Legislature did nothing else than to prohibit the entering into such agreements it would do
         a wise and judicious thing. One continually growing abuse of the present provision is that
         persons will make an agreement with the holder of the note in many cases to pay back a
         portion of the attorney fee. It seems to me this bill was not fairly considered int he
         committee I do not wish to impugn the motives of the Judiciary Committee, but I would like
         to have an opportunity to appear before it and explain the reason why I introduced this
         bill. The practice under the present statute is carried to such an extent that it is
         bringing the legal profession into disgrace. It is said that it would be unwise and
         injudicious to enact this bill into a law, for the reason that the party who loan money
         should not be put to the expense of collecting the note and paying attorneys's. Where a
         party loans money, if he expects to have to sue for it he would never loan a dollar; and if
         a man loans money, expecting to bring a suit to enforce the collection of it, he is not a
         safe man to do business, and there should not be a law which would enable him to collect
         attorney's fees. Another objection urged against the bill is that it would drive capital
         out of the State. Men who have money to loan and foreign corporations who loan money in
         this State are more magnanimous than some of our own citizens. I undertake to say there is
         not a note executed in this State to a nonresident but what specifies in the note the
         amount of the attorneys' fee. Another objection to this bill may be that it is not
         constitutional. If any Senator is laboring under an impression of that kind, I want to say
         this bill was drawn up by as good a lawyer as there is in the State of Indiana. It seems to
         me it is within the power of the Legislature to say whether or not such a contract shall be
         illegal and void.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: What effect would the bill have upon foreign corporations inserting five per
         cent. in their notes?</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: I don't think it would drive a single cent out of the State. I believe it
         would put every person upon an equal footing. There should be a law enacted that every
         person loaning money should stipulate the attorney fee to be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I rise to a point of order. I see upon examination of this bill which the
         Senator has introduced that it does not comply with one of the rules of the Senate - the
         one which requires all bills to refer to the section of the Revised Statues sought to be
         amended. I move that it be recommitted.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: I have not examined the bill carefully, and it was drawn by a person who is
         not acquainted with the rules of the Senate. I will consent to the motion to recommit so
         the Judiciary Committee. </p>
        <p>It was so ordered by consent.</p>
        <p><hi rend="sc">SEVERAL SENATORS</hi> - "Regular order."</p>

        <head rend="center">SCHOOL FUND INTEREST.</head>
        <p>Mr. Huston's bill [S. 29] to authorize school moneys to be loaned at 6 or 7 per cent.
         when 8 per cent. can not be obtained coming up on the second reading with as unfavorable
         majority and a favorable minority report from a committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: The statue requires each county to pay in the State Treasury 8 per cent. on
         all school fund moneys held by the county under the distribution of that fund. There are
         counties where it is impossible to make loans of this kind at 8 per cent. interest, and the
         result is the money is lying idle practically, yet the county is required to pay the 8 per
         cent. into the State Treasury every year. Union County, one of the smallest counties in the
         State, for years has been unable to loan the school fund moneys. The Treasurer has had
         these funds in his possession, and the Commissioners of the county are not allowed to use
         it. The fact is, a bank is being run in the lower part of this State having for its basis
         the unloaned school fund of that county. The county could loan this fund out at 6 or 7 per
         cent. This bill provides simply this, that where, in any county, that it is impossible to
         make loans of the school moneys at 8 per cent, the County Auditor, after having gained
         consent of the Board of County Commissioners, is authorized to make loans of this fund at
         any rate of interest not less than 6 per cent. It would enable Union County, instead of
         paying 8 per cent on twenty or thirty thousand dollars, if she could loan this money at 6
         per cent to pay simply 2 per cent. back to the State Treasurer This bill does not in any
         sense release the county from the payment of 8 per cent. interest into the State Treasury.
         It seems to me the counties who have endured the hardships spoken of under the present law
         are entitled to relief. Two years ago 95 per cent. of those school moneys was loaned out.
         Some Senators may say there is an urgent demand for money at 8 per cent interest, but in a
         few counties that demand does not exist and I think it not more than right that relief
         should be given them. This bill, I think, is surrounded with safeguards. No County Auditor
         would loan this money at 6 per cent. if a higher rate could be obtained. It would be no
         argument against this bill to say that the County Auditory, in collusion, might loan the
         school fund at 6 per cent. The law pro <pb n="137" xml:id="VAA8558-22-137"/> vides that
         only $1,000 can be loaned to one person, and suppose some Auditor should favor a friend
         with a loan of $1,000 at 6 per cent, that is only $20 a year, and I hardly think the
         average County Commissioner would resort to stealing just to make $20 for a friend. I think
         this bill will be found to work satisfactorily, and I hope the minority report will be
         adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The committee had doubts about the workings of this bill, and fears it
         would cause the taxpayers to make up a certain amount of interest that would be lost under
         its provisions. As has been suggested, there is not a quorum in the Senate probably, so I
         move the further consideration of the bill be postponed until Friday, at 11 o'clock, and
         made the special order for that hour the committee was afraid the County Commissioners and
         parties who wish to borrow money would consider the matter and loan the school fund at a
         lower rate of interest when it might be loaned at the regular rate; and was not sure but
         the workings of it would upset some of the provisions of the school law, and with these
         doubts the majority of the committee reported against the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I regard this as an important measure, and I hope it will secure a very full
         and fair consideration. I am not one of those inclined to think the Auditors or any other
         officers are rascals, or that there is any general tendency to dishonesty on the party
         County Commissioners. The county I live in has been paying interest at the rate of 8 per
         cent. on $25,000 for five years. I understand this bill simply permits the loaning of the
         school moneys at 6 per cent. interest, and the county makes up the valance to 8 per cent.,
         which is paid into the State Treasury. This is the first time I have heard of this bill,
         and know nothing of it except from the Senator's statement. I favor the motion to
         postpone.</p>

        <head rend="center">TEACHER'S INSTITUTES.</head>
        <p>Mr. Brown's bill [S. 120] to provide an additional county institute fund, coming up on
         the second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The law now provides that a certain sum of money may be appropriated by
         the County Commissioners to pay the expenses of county institutes, and this bill is adding
         an additional sum to to that. It don't limit the County Superintendent to what the Board of
         Commissioners allow, but the pending bill is to increase the amount the County
         Commissioners may pay toward the expenses of holding a County Teachers' Institute I think
         the amount raised from the teachers under this bill ought to be applied so as to diminish
         the amount paid by the County Commissioners; otherwise we would be duplicating what is to
         be paid for county institutes. I hope the bill will not be ordered engrossed for the third
         reading, but that it will be left open for amendment at the proper time. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: This bill is intended to provide a fund for the holding of County Teachers'
         Institutes without cost to the people of the county. There is one bill in the Senate and
         two bills in the House providing that there shall be an additional money tax out of the
         county treasury. This bill provides that each teacher shall pay fifty cents into a county
         institute fund. The object of the bill is to prove a fund to hold county institutes. It
         will prevent a large number of scholars attending school from applying for an examination
         to obtain teacher's licenses and have their papers referred tot he County Superintendant
         adding that much to the expenses of the county, $4 a day for the time the Superintendent
         occupies in examining these papers. In our county it costs not less than $100 for the
         examining of applications from parties who appy for licenses but do not intend to teach. If
         they have to pay fifty cents for an examination they will not burden the County
         Superintendent so much as now with their application papers.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I believe there ought to be an examination of teachers' papers by the
         County Superintendent I understand the County Superintendents have laid out what shall
         constitute a day's work for the examination of teachers' papers, for which they shall
         receive $4. In my judgment, if there is a fraud practiced in the State of Indiana at all,
         it is in the examination of teachers' manuscripts, for which the County Superintendent
         receives $4 a day; and I am opposed to placing the burden of these teachers' institutes
         upon the teachers, for if there is a class of people in the State earning every cent they
         get, and do more work for the money than any other class, it is the common school teacher.
         My judgment is that the law in reference to the County Superintendents examining teachers'
         manuscript should be regulated in some way, or changed so that when they examine these
         manuscripts they shall not receive so much money for it. I believe in many counties these
         examinations cost from $150 to @200 and $250, on account of persons applying who do not
         intend to teach, and those who do intend to teach should not be burdened with this expense.
         So I hope the bill will not be ordered engrossed, but left open for amendment. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr DAVIS the bill was amended by appropriately inserting a proviso that no
         such applicant shall be required to pay more than fifty cents in any one year. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The present law still remains in force and there is nothing to prevent
         the County Superintendent from drawing all allowed under Section 4 521 of the Revision, and
         also get all the teachers may pay him. If this bill is passed to raise a fund off the
         teachers this section, 4,521, ought to be repealed or the County Superintendent will get
         both funds.</p>
        <pb n="138" xml:id="VAA8558-22-138"/>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of, of Brown: I understand this fund to be raised by this bill is intended to
         assist in carrying on other institutes that occur in the county The law at present does not
         provide a sufficient fund for the purpose of carrying on county institutes, and this bill
         is for the purpose of creating a fund to supply the deficiency, and instead of taking an
         additional amount out of the County Treasury it provides that those supplying for teacher's
         license shall fund in. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I don't see anything in the bill that contemplates an
         expenditure for township institutes. I apprehend it intends to furnish, as the title says,
         an additional fund for county institutes</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: If there is any fund left over after paying the expenses of county institutes,
         it shall be held for the purpose of holding township institutes. The bill is intended to
         prevent any further expense to the county for holding county institutes.</p>

        <head rend="center">CITY FARM TAX.</head>
        <p>Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 174] to repeal section 3,261 R. S. 1881, coming up on the second
         reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, moved to amend by providing that such tracts where bounded
         on three sides by platted land shall be assessed the same as other city property, otherwise
         to pay school and road tax only. He said: My amendment is predicated upon the idea that
         these lands of more than five acres in extent which are situated with in the corporate
         limits of cities and towns should only be taxed the same as lands within the civil township
         in which they are situated that lie side by side, except that lands within the corporation
         should be required to pay tax for school purposes: the same as lands in the civil townships
         except they should pay for school purposes as lands in the city. My observation is that
         farms contiguous to cities are brought in the corporation limits principally for purposes
         of taxation, and often for the purpose of increasing the population to such an extent that
         they may be incorporated as cities Repeal section 3,261 and these lands within corporate
         cities will pay exactly the same as is now paid by city property. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings could not comprehend why such property should not bear its equal
         burden of taxation, not only for school purposes but for all other purposes. After arguing
         against the amendment awhile in order that the author of the bill may have a change to be
         heard, he moved that the Senate adjourn. </p>

        <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS.</head>
        <p>The House resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R. 327] making appropriations for the
         State government, which was pending at the adjournment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. FLEESE offered and amendment which was adopted, rpoviding that the sum of $3,000
         shall be appropriated in order to erect tablets marking the positions occupied by the
         Seventh, Fourteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth and Twenty-Seventh Indiana Regiments, and the
         Third Indiana Cavalry, in the battle of Gettysburg, the money to be expended under the
         direction of the Governor Lieutenant Governor, Adjutant General and five members of the
         said regiments.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLAN moved to amend by striking from the bill the appropriation of $400 to the
         State Horticultural Association. He asked if any member on the floor can tell what benefit
         this association has been to the State. Members of that Horticultural Board come up to
         Indianapolis to have a good time, and use this money to pay their hotel bills and traveling
         expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: I think instead of making this appropriation $500 it ought to be made $2,000
         There is not association in the State to-day that is doing more for the horticultural
         interest than this society. It is encouraging the cultivation of fruits, and that interest
         has been largely enhanced and advanced by socity. I can not see why this society,
         representing a leading industry - growing industry of the State - should not be encouraged
         by the appropriation proposed, and this appropriation, comparatively speaking, is a very
         small one. I move an amendment to the amendment by inserting instead of $400 "$2,000."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: To avoid any question of order I move to reconsider the vote, appropriating
         $400 if the gentleman will withdraw the amendments.</p>
        <p>Both amendments were withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Mr. MODDY: It certainy seems to me that when any members says that any part of this $400
         has been used for traveling expenses and hotel bills that it is certainly unfounded. These
         questions ought to be treated fully. I believe this associate is beneficial. This
         appropriation ought not to have been confined to that amount. I understand that the State
         of Illinois has appropriated $1,000, and the State of Ohio $1,500 annually for the same
         purpose, and the small pittance of $400 has been appropriated in Indiana. This sum is
         appropriated for the purpose of enabling this society to examine and propogate fruits of
         the best class in the State. It is largely to the interest of the agricultural people of
         the State to know what class of wheat and what kind of fruits are hardy and most adapted to
         the climate of the State Unless it be to increase the appropriation of $400 I hope the
         motion to reconsider will be lost.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I think the gentleman from DeKalb (Mr. Moody) misunderstood me. I said I
         wished the committee to show me where one single dollar of that amount had gone. If he had
         shown where the money had gone, that it had been spent beneficially to the State of
         Indiana, it would be different I say I want to know more about it. </p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: The gentleman wants to know how this money has been appropriated. I would say
         that these gentlemen composing the Horticultural Society Board have not spent this money in
         traveling and paying hotel expenses. They have not met here in the city of Indianapolis
         alone, but on the other hand if you make an examination you will find that they have
         circulated throughout the State. I believe the last time they met they met at Winchester.
         Now, as to how this money appropriated has been spent - it has been spent for the best
         interests of the State. They have placed this year upon the desk of each member a
         beautifully bound volume. This one is worth $1, and if the members will examine that volume
         they will find it to be incalculable value to all persons engaged in raising fruit, for it
         shows what fruits are best suited to the State. These volumes are distributed to those who
         are engaged in horticultural pursuits. If the gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. McMullen)
         desires to plant an orchard he will find it a complete treasure. He will find what fruits
         are hardy and what fruits are adapted to the climate. It is of the greatest importance to
         the people of the State to be well informed in regard to this matter. I hope the motion to
         reconsider will prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I am not in favor of this association because I do not think it is of <pb
          n="140" xml:id="VAA8558-22-140"/> any benefit tot he State. Because there has been
         appropriations is no argument in favor of continuing them. I have not a very high regard
         for precedents unless they are in the right direction. If we are going to take precedents
         it will prevent reform. Precedent is a most dangerous thing if you can't plead any thing
         better than precedent. Let us plead a little common sense We have a Wool growers'
         Association in the State, and we have an Agricultural Society, and a Horticultural Society,
         and a Bee-keepers' Society, and therefore the wool-growers and bee-keepers are entitled to
         consideration at the hands of this Legislature; not only that, but we have a tile-makers'
         association in the State, and on the ground of precedent in the State, and on the ground of
         precedent you must make an appropriation to the tile-makers' association, and where are we
         going to end with this thing? I know in speaking in this way I speak against some of my
         constituency; some of my constituents hold different opinions from what I do on this
         subject. I do not think the State ought to make an appropriation to this association at
         all, because I think the State is not in any way benefited. You must treat all these
         associations alike. It is not fair to treat one association different from another. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: It is exceedingly refreshing for the gentlemen of the legal profession to
         withdraw from the close confinement of their office and go into the country to rusticate.
         Other States have given their support to horticultural societies - States that are new than
         Indiana, and States that rank far above in the production of fruits. This appropriation is
         but a small amount. I do not undertake to say that the gentlemen will see in return large
         sums of money flowing directly from the Horticultural Society into the State Treasury, but
         by the proper education in horticulture and cultivating the feeling in this direction among
         the people, and stirring them up on this subject, I believe the State will realize largely
         in excess of the small pittance given to this association. I believe we ought every year to
         give some encouragement to horticulture I am opposed to reconsidering the vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: I am in favor of the proposition to reconsider the vote by which $400 were
         appropriated to the State Horticultural Society. Not that we may be able to strike out, but
         that we amend by making the appropriation $800 instead of $400 I am surprised to hear
         gentlemen argue that this appropriation is to not purpose. My friend from Putnam argues
         that if we appropriate to this association we will be called upon to appropriate for the
         tile-makers and kindred associations. My friend should remember that the tile-makers are
         very few in number and organized solely to make their business profitable to themselves. On
         the other hand the Horticultural Society is composed largely of men who give their time and
         money to promote the interests of a science which properly developed must benefit every
         man, woman and child in the State. I heard long ago of the man who didn't care a
         continental whether the wheat crop was good - because he bought his bread at the baker's
         but 0 I have had heard for the first time to-day, and in this discussion, that we should
         ignore the Horticultural Society, because we purchase our orchard and garden products from
         street peddlers. Some of these men have spent their lives in this favorite field of study,
         and all that they know they give to us in their reports, that go into every corner of the
         State and yield a large return to the people. To properly publish their reports and pay the
         officer for preparing them and encourage scientific investigation on this line, I am
         willing to vote twice the amount named. </p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I hope it will not delay the purpose of the amendment, whatever it may be.
         I hope it will be increased rather than decreased. What I have to say in regard to this
         matter is in the interest of a growing industry, in the southern part of the State
         particularly. That is the grape culture. Throughout the entire southern part of the State
         there is a decided tendency to develop the culture of the grape. In the last two years in
         the experience of the Horticultural Society through this department, the interests of this
         industry have prospered, and in behalf of the grape culture in the southern part of the
         State, I say I hope the members will not lose sigh of the importance that this society has
         sustained to this industry, and place it alongside this $400. This is a very small and very
         insignificant sum compared with the great results which have already come to the entire
         people of the State. I hope this appropriation will be made - on behalf of the agricultural
         people of the State, I hope it will be made.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I think I can coincide with everything said by the gentleman from Putnam (Mr.
         Gordon) Now you go into the orchards and you will find decay. The State Board of
         Horticulture have destroyed our orchards, they have destroyed our vineyards and small
         fruits in the State of Indiana. In other words, they have attempted to introduce fruits
         that could not stand the climate of the State of Indiana. If we have institution like that
         of Purdue University, for the purpose of examination into these things and we have
         appropriated $40,000 to it, why make this appropriation? I am opposed to it. </p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I am in favor of reconsidering this vote.</p>
        <p>The motion to reconsider was rejected upon a division - affirmative, 25; negative,
         34.</p>

        <p>Mr. Brownlee's bill to repeal the present ditch law was reported unfavorably by the
         committee. Speaking of the bill, Mr. Brownlee said that ditching under the Circuit Court
         law costs 40 per cent. more than it <pb n="141" xml:id="VAA8558-22-141"/> does in the
         Commissioners' Court, and that any man can have a "cat pond" drained, and compel men to
         ditch their land for a distance of ten miles. He charged that lawyers were in the habit of
         going to irresponsible parties and getting them to file petitions for drains; that all the
         parties whose lands were affected by the drain were compelled to pay the costs. Other
         gentlemen spoke in favor of the law, declaring that it was the most economical ever made.
         Mr. Williams thought it should be called "a law to confiscate property," and he moved to
         lay the report of the committee upon the table. The motion prevailed, and the bill to
         repeal was read a second time and ordered engrossed, Mr. Gooding, Mr. Hoban and others

        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill [S. 174] pending at the adjournment
         yesterday, the question being on the amendment proposed by Mr. Campbell, of St. Joseph.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: The amendment does not particularly interfere with the object of the bill.
         There are a large number of tracts of land lying within the limits of the city of
         Evansville, with city lots around them. These tracts are exempt from taxation for city
         purposes, and I don't think that is right. These lands are owned, some of them, by Eastern
         capitalists, and some of them by heirs. The object of this bill is to tax these lands at a
         reasonable figure. There is no City Council that will tax them up to their full value. I
         think the bill ought to pass and the section of the Revised States therein referred to be
         repealed, because it exempts a certain class of lands from paying a city tax which they
         ought to pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: The amendment would materially affect property in this city. We have one or
         two large tracts of land within the limits of this city paying no municipal tax, they being
         held for a rise in values, where they ought to be subject tot he same taxes and burden as
         other property. Therefore I am opposed to the amendment.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 3] to increase the bond of the Treasurer of State from $150 000 to
         $1,000,000 coming up as a special order - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, moved to amend by striking "$1,000,000" and inserting in lieu
         $500,000; and by reducing the number of bondsmen from twenty to twelve.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: I first desire to call attention to the necessity for immediate action on
         this bill one way or the other. The bond of the Treasurer of State for the next two years
         must be filed at the latest next Monday. The term of office which he now holds expires on
         that day, and he will be obliged to file a new bond at that time. It is but fair to the
         Treasurer, to the House and the Senate, that action should be taken as soon as possible in
         order to enable the Treasurer to know the amount in which he will be required to be
         responsible, and to avoid all questions as to the amount of the bond. The late
         investigation of the affairs of the Treasurer of State has shown one thing which Senators
         of all political parties can agree upon, and that is, it is <pb n="143"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-143"/> shown at certain periods of the year, in a very short space of
         time, he has in his hands property of the State running up to a million and a half of
         dollars, and, as the Treasurer himself states to the Committee on Finance, he has an
         average of about $180,000 on hand during the year. In the months of November and April, and
         extending to the list of January, when the great school revenues passes through his hands,
         the amount runs up to $1,300,000, or a million and a half dollars In 1859 the act was
         passed which gave to the Treasurer of State the right to take office upon a bond of
         $150,000. Twenty six years nearly have passed since then. Indiana has more than doubled her
         wealth since the act now proposed to be amended became a law. I don't consider this matter
         a political measure in any sense of the term. This bill passed the House of Representatives
         on a vote of 80 to none; so in that House, after an effort was made, as is now being made
         by the Senator from Jennings (Mr. Smith), to place the bond at $500,000 - after that was
         voted down the House agreed unanimously that the time had come to place the bond of the
         Treasurer of State at $1,000,000. There is reason in this. I would not treat the Treasurer
         of the State any different than I would treat any officer or man who had the management of
         trust funds. The law provides in regard to trust funds, generally speaking, that the amount
         of bond shall be double the amount of money that goes into his hands. Take a guardian's
         bond for example The guardian can't put a single dollar in his pocket for any money he
         loans. He can not by subterfuge loan his ward's money at a higher rate of interest and put
         part in his own pocket. Yet a guardian of a ward has to make his bond in double the amount
         of property in his hands, both real and personal. Why should we make another rule for a man
         who has the custody of half a million of dollars belonging to the State, and who
         confessedly loans this money, and receives interest upon it, in defiance of the statue, if
         you please - a statute which has been violated by every Treasurer of every party since it
         was enacted; and therefore, I don't think the rule should be drawn strictly upon the
         present Treasurer. There is a very large amount of the State's money loaned out, upon which
         interest is received. Therefore, I claim the reason exists more strongly for a sufficient
         bond that it does in the case of guardians' bonds. It may be said that this will prevent a
         poor man from becoming a Treasurer of State. I think not. The test of whether one man will
         go upon the bond of another comes not so much from wealth as from character for honesty and
         probity. Every Senator knows many a man who is poor but whom he would rather trust upon his
         simple word than many a wealthier man upon his bond. This bill unanimously passed the
         House, which is nearer the people than the Senate, and represents the wishes and desires of
         the people that a solid bond be required of the Treasurer of State which will protect the
         people against loss. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I believe the Treasurer of State ought to give a good and
         sufficient bond, but I don't believe the law ought to require him to give a bond which is
         not within the reach of ordinary individuals If all the Senate from Lawrence (Mr. Willard)
         said were true, it is no argument that the penalty on this bond should be increased, unless
         he desires to become the advocate of a special class of persons who can only place
         themselves, by reason of their wealth or influence in that direction, in the hands of those
         who would control the Treasury of the State if he had to give such a bond. It is very clear
         if the Treasurer of State is required to give bond of $1,000,000 that the only persons he
         could secure to go upon his bond would be acceptible would be those who are operating
         monopolies and banks, therefore he would be placing himself directly in the hands of
         monopolies and banks, who would require giving into their hands every dollar of the State's
         money. In other words, it is placing the Treasurer of State in the hands of monopolies. For
         that reason the amendment ought to prevail. It can not be truthfully said that the State
         would be in danger of losing a single cent of money if the bond shall be placed at
         $500,000. There are only two or three months in the year when a greater sum than the amount
         named in the amendment would ever be concentrated in the State Treasury, and then it only
         remains there a short time; it is paid out almost as soon as it is paid in.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Dearborn: I am in favor of the amendment of the Senator from Jennings
         (Mr. Smith) and will vote for it whenever an opportunity presents itself. My reasons are,
         that this is a different trust from the trust of a guardian or an administrator. We don't
         make the Treasurer of State trustee in this matter. When the new State House is completed I
         presume there will be a proper place provided for the Treasurer to keep the money. Then the
         Treasurer will simply act as an agent of the State and hold the money for her use. He will
         have no right to touch the money other than to dispense it upon proper warrant drawn by the
         State Auditor. And it will be a great hardship for a man of ordinary means, I care not what
         his reputation may be, to make a bond for a million of dollars. It will be a big thing to
         get twenty men worth $100,000 a piece as bondsmen. It is a difficult matter to find twenty
         men worth $100,000 each who are willing to risk their all upon another man's bond, and I
         think it will be a very difficult matter for a Treasurer to procure a bond of $1,000,000,
         unless he is very nearly worth the amount himself We don't want to exclude a poor man from
         such an office as the Treasurer of State, and I trust the amendment will prevail.</p>
        <pb n="144" xml:id="VAA8558-22-144"/>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: This is a step in the direction of special legislation, and that
         is what the Democratic party has always opposed. An honest man - man in medium
         circumstances - a man who may be able to give an adequate and valid bond in a reasonable
         sum, is forever estopped from being a candidate for the office of Treasurer of State if
         this bill becomes a law as it is. The Senator from Lawrence (Mr. Willard) refers to the
         bond of a guardian. That is not in point. The trust of a guardian of minor children
         continues on and on until the minor children come to their majority, from, perhaps, on year
         of age. The office of Treasurer of State does not continue twenty years. It continues but
         two years I am in favor of immediate action, but we should take such sensible action as the
         great body of the people of Indiana will approve.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I concur with the Senator from Jennings (Mr. Smith) There is no occasion to
         pass this bill as it came from the House. I care not whether the House passed it by 99 to
         1, it is for this body to act upon its own judgment in determining what legislation is
         necessary. The first question, when we come to consider matters of legislation, should be
         this: Does the public interest demand the passage of the bill? If it does it should not be
         passed; if it does not, it should be not be passed. Because, apparently, there has been a
         little panic produced in the other House by various rumors that have gone out about the
         State Treasurer's office we should not make undue haste. When Governor Porter in his
         message gave out by innuendoes, if you please, that there is something wrong in the
         Treasurer's office, an investigation was prompted, and but this morning we have had a
         report from the majority of that committee, and I say I believe the whole thing was
         originated and prompted by nothing else in the world by party capital, so that something
         may be made out of it one way or the other. It is that which has produced the panic, which
         I feel justified to term it, in the other House. This investigation has been carried out
         and the committee report that every single dollar of the people's money is perfectly safe;
         but in the meantime the House has passed a bill to require the State Treasurer to give a
         bond in the sum of $1,000.000. It ought to be entitled "an act to provide that no man who
         is not a millionaire shall ever become a Treasurer of the State of Indiana." [Applause.] In
         other words, if a Treasurer of State shall be elected under this bill, however honest, he
         may be or from whatever section of the State he may come he must be handed over the mercies
         of the financiers of the city of Indianapolis. I don't believe there is any demand for this
         legislation, and had not the Senator from Jennings offered his amendment I should have
         proposed a reduction to $300,000. The Treasurer of the United States has charge of over
         $400,000,00, and I think he gives a bond in the sum of $10,000 only, and why is that
         rational, sensible men - men of experience and judgment should be carried off their feet
         under such circumstances as surround this question in both Houses of the Legislature? I am
         aware there may have been a violation of the statute, but I undertake to say ] ]an can
         discharge the duties of Treasurer of State without doing it. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I am one of those who believe that when the people elects a
         man State Treasurer and his friends have become security for the money to the amount of
         $500,000, that the people who select him should assume whatever security is needed beyond
         this amount. To give a bond of $1,00,000 will, in my opinion, make it so that candidates
         will be compelled to arrange with moneyed men in order to get such a bond, and that these
         moneyed men or corporations will not only practically control the disposition of the money,
         but largely dictate who shall be the Treasurer - a condition of neither equitable nor safe,
         hence I favor the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Jennings withdrew all of his amendment except the portion to reduce the
         Treasurer's bond from $1,000,000 to $500,000.</p>
        <p>It was agreed to by yeas 30, nays 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks, explaining his negative vote: I believe a bond of half a
         million amply sufficient for all practical purposes. I feel, with the Senate from Laporte
         (Mr. Weir), that we should not be governed by the section of the House of Representatives
         at all, but faring this amendment will kill the bill I shall vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD (after the recess for dinner) moved for a dispensation of the constitutional
         restriction that the bill may be passed to the final vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to the motion at this time, not because I am not favor of
         the bill as far as it goes, but I think it ought to be postponed till to morrow, for this
         is one of those matters which, in my judgment, needs cool and careful deliberation as to
         what the law is now, and what the effect of this bill will be. I think there is an undue
         scare about haste in this case, for if there is anything the Supreme Court has decided it
         is that the Legislature may increase or diminish the bond of an officer at any time. I
         think the most dangerous thing in reference to the State Treasury is the condition in which
         the law is. It is doubtful whether his bondsmen would be liable if a loss of funds should
         occur without fault of the Treasurer. I am desiring to put that question at rest, and to
         say by statute that the bondsmen of the Treasurer, as well as he himself, shall be
         responsible for every dime with which he is chargeable, and can not be excused there from
         by loss on account of fire, burglary, or any other casualty. It may be said that we might
         pass this bill t-day, and next week or tomorrow amend another section of the statute so as
          <pb n="145" xml:id="VAA8558-22-145"/> to provide the bondsmen shall be absolutely
         responsible. That would be dangerous legislation, because, where bondsmen execute a bond
         under a statute that holds them liable only as bondsmen for a trustee or bailee, and
         afterward the Legislature enacts a law requiring them to be absol8utely responsible, it
         might raise a question as to whether or not they would be released. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: If the Senator thinks there is any difference in that regard, the bill was
         open for amendment, and he could offer an amendment. I differ with him in regard to the
         question, after a man has assumed an office whether his bond can be increased. It would be
         a condition subsequent.</p>
        <p>The motion to suspend the Constitutional rule was rejected by yeas 33, nays 10,
         two-thirds of all Senators elected not voting in the affirmative.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD the bill was made a special order for 10:30 o'clock to
         morrow.</p>

        <p>The special committee appointed to make investigation and report whether in their
         judgment, and investigation of the affairs of the State Treasury was necessary, made a
         majority and minority report, the Democrats joining in one and the Republicans in another.
         As the committee was appointed under a joint resolution of the House and Senate, majority
         and minority reports were submitted in both branches, being, of course, identical in fact
         and figure. Messrs. McMullen, Patton and Gooding, constituted the majority on the part of
         the House, with Senators McCullough, Smith of Jennings and Hilligass; and Messrs. Sayre and
         Brownlee, with Senators Lindley and Foulke composed the minority. </p>
        <p>The majority report states that on the 29th ultimo the committee examined the books in
         the office of the Auditor of State, and also the assets of the State Treasurer. The
         Auditor's books show that on the first day of November, 1884, the Treasurer was chargeable
         with $431,206.59; that between the first day of November, 1884, and the close of business
         hours on the 28th of January, 1885, the Treasurer had received the further sum of
         $1,420,154.23, making the total chargeable $1,857,360.82, and during this time the said
         Treasurer had disbursed, according to law $1,364,479 78, leaving in his hands $486,881 04.
         The Treasurer exhibited at his office assets in the sum of $491,869 24 Of this sum $7,600
         was in cash; $410,049 91 consisted of drafts checks and certificates of deposit issued by
         various banks of this city, and convertible into cash at any moments. The sum of $74,069.33
         consisted of county orders, $60,000 of which was upon Marion County, and $10 000 was upon
         Hamilton County, "which said orders are better than the cash, and the Treasurer has an
         arrangement by which he can convert the same into cash at any moment." The sum of $4,067 33
         consisted of various county orders which are good, but the committee cash at a moment's
         notice. The committee also report that they called upon the various banks of the city and
         learned from them that the Treasurer had deposited the various sums with them, as
         represented by the drafts, checks and certificates of deposit held by him, and the money on
         special deposit was exhibited to the committee.</p>
        <p>"Taking into consideration," says the report, "the fact that the State furnishes the
         Treasurer no safe place in which to keep the money, and that he is compelled to deposit the
         same in one or more banks for safe keeping, your committee is of the opinion that the
         manner in which the Treasurer has the money deposited secures to himself, his bondsmen and
         the State the least possible risk of any great loss that could be secured by any
         disposition of the same. And it enables the Treasurer at any time he may be required by law
         to pay any or all of the amount with which he is chargeable." The majority therefore report
         that they see no reason whatever why a Legislative Committee or any other committee should
         be appointed at this time to investigate further into the affairs of the State Treasury.
         "But if," says the report, "it were desired for any reason to investigate thoroughly into
         the affairs of the Treasury for the term now closing, such an investigation would involve a
         detailed examination of the books of the Auditor of State, because in those books the
         accounts of the Treasurer are kept, and such an examination could not be made thorough and
         complete by any committee in the short period of sixty days, the time allowed for the
         regular session of the Legislature." The committee express the opinion that if an
         investigation should be deemed necessary it would be better that it be conducted under the
         direction of the Governor and Secretary of State, and inasmuch as it is claimed by Porter
         that $3 is not enough to pay an expert it is asked that such expert be allowed $8 per day,
         in order that there may be no excuse for not investigating whenever, in the opinion of the
         Governor, such an investigation is necessary and proper. The committee submitted a bill for
         an increased penalty on the Treasurer's bond, with the amount left blank. It had been a
         notorious fact, the committee said, that ever Treasurer of State, for years, had deposited
         funds in the banks, because no safe vaults had been provided. The Supreme Court had held
         that the County Treasurers may be held liable for the loss of money by fire or burglars,
         and they were not chargeable with <pb n="146" xml:id="VAA8558-22-146"/> interest received
         from banks where the funds were deposited in banks for safe keeping. The statutes did not
         in terms make the Treasurer of the State absolutely responsible for the amount of money
         that comes into his hands in case the same should be lost without carelessness or neglect
         upon his part. The committee recommended that the law be amended so as to not prohibit the
         Treasurer from depositing the money in banks, and so as to hold the Treasurer absolutely
         responsible for the payment according to law of the amount which he receives or is
         chargeable with; and that his bondsmen shall be absolutely liable in the same manner to the
         extent of the penalty of their bonds. </p>
        <p>The minority report sets forth that at the first meeting of the committee, Mr. Cooper,
         Treasurer of State, was present, and "stated that he would admit for the purpose of the
         inquiry, that all the facts stated in Porter's message in regard to the State Treasury were
         true;" that at the next meeting Governor Porter was present by invitation of the minority,
         and when the majority was informed that the ex-Governor was present, and a motion made that
         he be requested to state what knowledge had of the matters contained in his message,
         objection was made by a member of the majority, and the Governor was not called or
         examined. The minority wanted to inquire as to the ownership of the money and vouchers
         found int he banks in the Treasurer's office, and as to whether he had loaned any money and
         what had been done with the interest, but these propositions had been voted down by the
         majority. The committee found that the Treasurer, instead of paying and receiving all sums
         in currency, transacted most of the business of the office by check, as the vaults of the
         Treasury are considered unsafe. The assets in the hands the Treasurer are there set forth
         as in the majority report. A number of questions regarding the habit of the Treasurer in
         depositing money, in what banks the same was placed, and whether he had received interest
         therefor we asked, but the questions were ruled out by the majority and excluded. The
         report charges as follows:</p>
        <list>
         <item n="1">$96,000 of the above was deposited by the Treasurer within two days prior to
          the examination, as shown by the dates given; $45,000 was deposited in the Merchants'
          National Bank, whose president and cashier were on the bond of the Treasurer, on November
          16, 1884, said day being Sunday, from which the minority conclude that said dates are
          erroneous and possibly made for the purpose of deceiving your committee and the General
          Assembly.</item>
         <item n="2">In a number of the vouchers, purporting to be several months old shown to the
          committee, the ink appeared to be fresh and the vouchers to have been recently made, and
          your minority was not permitted to ask whether or not said vouchers bore their true
          dates.</item>
         <item n="3">That $74,069 23 of said assets consisted of county orders, as to the validity
          of which the committee had no means of determining all except $10,000 being long past due
          and unpaid.</item>
         <item n="4">As to the $4,069.20 of them, the Treasurer said he would willingly remit the
          interest if he could get the principal, and your minority believe that a large amount of
          the said orders are doubtful security. </item>
         <item n="5"> The minority are informed and believe that $10,000 of the above, being the
          order on Hamilton County, was sold by the County Treasurer to the First National Bank of
          Indianapolis shortly after it was issued, and was delivered to the said Cooper by the said
          bank for some purpose unknown to the minority. The order is not due till June 22 1885, and
          therefore not available as cash assets.</item>
         <item n="6">The certificates of deposit shown the committee were in each case made to the
          cashier of the respective banks as payment and indorsed by them in blank and there was no
          fact to indicate that the Treasurer is the owner of them except his mere
          possession.</item>
         <item n="7">As to the deposit of $50,000 in the Merchant's National Bank, the indorsement
          up on the package, the ink was fresh and the package appeared to have been recently
          marked.</item>
         <item n="8"> As to the $60,000 deposited in the Meridian National Bank, your minority was
          informed that the same was recently borrowed from the bank by one Franklin Landers and
          others, and was not the property of said Treasurer at the time it was examined, but said
          committee neither made nor ordered any investigation or inquiry in respect of said
          information.</item>
         <item n="9">The minority learned that $13,000 of the State funds were deposited and lost in
          the bank of Fletcher &amp; Sharpe and $29,000 in Harrison' Bank, which information was
          stated to the committee, but not inquiry was directed or permitted by the majority.</item>
         <item n="10">The whole amount of cash exhibited was $7,700, and all over securities and
          vouchers taken as above was taken by the Treasurer in violation of law.</item>

        </list>
        <p>In conclusion, the minority declare that the majority was unwilling to permit any inquiry
         as to the real condition of the Treasury and the ownership of the vouchers therein. The
         belief is expressed that there should be a full investigation. Says the report: "We regard
         the present condition of the State Treasury as extremely critical, and it is our belief
         that there is a large deficiency therein, although we are unable, to state with certainty
         the precise amount owing to the refusal of the majority to permit us to make any inquiries.
         We have grave fears, however, that it exceeds the entire penalty of the Treasurer's
         official bond. It is our clear conviction that an immediate and thorough investigation is
         imperatively <pb n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-22-147"/> necessary, and we earnestly request the
         respective Houses of the General Assembly to have it instituted without delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. SYARE: Every Representative on this floor is interested int he safe-keeping of the
         funds of the State, and every member has the same duty imposed upon him, and that is to see
         to it that the funds of the State shall be faithfully applied to the purposes for which
         they are raised. I presume everybody here is familiar with the law pertaining to the State
         Treasury. They know that any kind of orders and certificates of deposit or supposed
         deposits in banks, and drafts upon banks, and all things of that kind, are not the kind of
         money required to be paid by the people of the State. The funds that go into the State
         Treasury go there in the shape of money, and the law requires that the Treasurer of State
         should be at all times ready to account to the people of Indiana the General Assembly, or
         to those to hom investigation should be referred, the kind of money he receives. The
         majority report as signed doe snot give in detail, as I remember, the assets that the
         Treasurer of State has shown this committee. The minority of the committee have undertaken
         to give this Legislature in detail what the Treasurer of State pretends to hold in the
         vaults as assets. Now, think for a moment. Is it such money as the law requires? I want to
         call the attention of this Legislature to the facts set out int he minority report. On the
         16th of last November, which was on Sunday, there was issued by the cashier of the
         Merchants' National Bank of Indianapolis a certificate of deposit to the amount of $45,000,
         payable to himself, and a certificate of $10,000 and another one for $5,000; this bank
         received from its own cashier the certificate of deposit payable to himself; and that
         certificate, after the indorsement of the cashier the Treasurer of State exhibited to the
         committee, and on inquiry whether John J. Cooper was the owner, this investigation was not
         permitted to be made. When it was brought before the committee that these deposits were
         made on the Sabbath Day, and that this was out of the ordinary and usual course of
         business, inquirty was not permitted to be made. Does any man here believe the Merchants'
         National Bank was open on the 16th day of last November, which was on Sunday? Another thing
         - the report of this minority shows that there should have been in the treasury of State on
         the 9th day of January 1885, $480,000. Now, there is no pretense by the Treasurer of State
         or by any of his friends or by the majority of this committee that such money was either on
         hands or on special deposit. There is no pretense that the money is placed where it will be
         absolutely safe. I presume the banks of Indianapolis now existing here are perfectly sound.
         I have no heard any intimate to the contrary, but last summer everybody thought Harrison's
         bank was safe; everybody thought Fletcher &amp; Sharpe's bank was in a safe condition, and
         yet today they are in ruins and their ordinary depositors are deprived of thousands and
         thousands and hundres and hundreds of dollars. Another thing the members of this committee
         in the minority asked this General Assembly for authority to send for persons and papers so
         they could make an investigation, and it was not allowed. - Now, John J. Cooper as loaned
         large sums of money to the Meridian National Bank and to his bondsmen, ore a part of his
         bondsmen, for the purpose of carrying on ordinary business or to engage in speculation. We
         were further informed that the money represented by the certificate was not in the vaults
         of that bank. Another thing, there is $60 000 that the majority of the committee reported
         to this as better than cash - that it is worth more than 100 cents on the dollar - and that
         is the orders on the Treasury of Marion County. The County Commissioners of Marion County
         on the 1st of last June made a temporary loan for six months, and on the 29th day of
         January it had been due twenty-nine day sand it was not paid. I want to see a complete and
         thorough investigation of the affairs of the Treasury.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: What I shall say upon this question is not because I am a Republican and the
         State Treasurer' office is now held by a Democrat, but because I believe the people of
         Indiana, as they have a right to, desire to know how their money is being used. Now the law
         is very plain, and it empowers the General Assembly to enforce its provisions or stop the
         penal violation of it. The law expressly prohibits any loan or deposit in any bank or with
         any person or persons, and the Treasurer of State is expressly prohibited from receiving
         any interest, gratuity or bonus upon the funds of the State. Now I say to this General
         Assembly that the State Treasurer has within the last two years received immense amounts of
         interest, gratuity, and bonus upon the funds in his hands. Why do I say it? I say it
         because i am told that the amount of interest he has so received amounts to the sum of
         $25,000. This money belongs to the State. It is not the Treasurer's money; it is the money
         of this State. It is the money the taxpayers that have paid it into the Treasury; that is
         whose money it is. Now the Treasurer is prohibited from receiving interest on that money.
         The majority report says it is a doubtful question. Is it a doubtful question? The state
         says he shall receive no interest except for the use of the State. If Mr. Cooper stands
         square with the State to-day he can not be injured; his bondsmen can not be injured; nobody
         can be inured by an investigation; but the people of Indiana will feel safe if they know
         the money is being used for the purpose it should be. The minority ask for an investigation
         because it is right. </p>
        <pb n="148" xml:id="VAA8558-22-148"/>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I do not propose to discuss this question upon the minority report, for that
         is untrue, unfair and incorrect in its statements. So far as the committee is concerned a
         majority of them know that in many respects it is unfair and uncandid. I feel as do a
         majority of this committee, that they want to see this matter correctly represented before
         this House and before the people of the State I have seen in the last two weeks in the
         Indianapolis Journal all that is in this minority report It is not new to me. I knew when I
         heard it read that it sounded the same old thing I had been reading in the Indianapolis
         Journal. Now in the first place, what is this report? The minority assails the majority. It
         seems to me that the majority of the committee compare favorable with the minority as to
         the honestly integrity and patriotism. [Laughter.] Why, from what has been said, our
         constituents might draw the conclusion that the majority of the committee stood in with Mr.
         Cooper has scarcely spoken to me since this investigation commenced. Now the minority
         complain because this investigation was not carried further. We have no authority to send
         for persons and paper. I have the resolution here. Now this committee has discharged its
         duties, why make any further investigations If the Treasurer of State is collecting
         interest for money on deposit the Attorney General can bring suit on his bond. And the
         Governor is empowered to make an investigation at any time. Now then, I do not wish to
         stand by dishonest officeholders I say, so far as Mr. Cooper is concerned, I want the money
         to be accounted for I stand by the people to the very last farthing </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS the minority report was laid on the table, by yeas 55, nays
         31.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTON: As a member of the committee to whom was referred the Senate concurrent
         resolution appointing a Special Committee of five members of each House to examine that
         part of ex-Governor Porter's biennial message relating to the State Treasury, and to report
         by bill or otherwise, what legislation, if any, was necessary in reference thereto; also,
         to report whether or not an investigation into the affairs of the State Treasury by a
         Legislative Committee is at this time probably necessary or proper, I would say a double
         duty was imposed upon us by the resolution, and I think it but proper and right to state to
         this House in detail the extent of the examination made.</p>
        <p>The Auditor of State, J. H. Rice, furnished the commitee with the following statement,

        <p>A sub-committee examined the special deposits in the various banks and found the amounts
         to correspond to the certificates in the Treasurer's office. The committee went to the
         farthest limits of their power under the resolution to ascertain the true condition of the
         State Treasury. It is true that the letter of the statute has not been strictly complied
         with, but this certainly has not been the fault of the Treasurer, as he had no authority or
         power to do more than receive and disburse the public funds, hedged in by the following
         restrictive statute: "The room now occupied, or which may be hereafter assigned to and
         occupied by the Treasurer of State, together with the safes, vaults and other proper and
         necessary means for the security and safe-keeping of the public money thereto belonging,
         shall constitute the Treasury of the State of Indiana, and the Treasurer of State shall be
         required to use the Treasury so constituted as the sole place for the deposit and
         safe-keeping of the monys of the State." To the unsophisticated <pb n="149"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-149"/> it would seem that our Treasury is a stronghold of impregnable
         walls, and that the vaults and safes are well guarded with iron bolts, bars and time-locks,
         and impervious to fire and burglar. Not so, gentlemen. The rooms are neither fire or
         burglar-proof, and it would be stupidity on the part of the Treasurer of State to even
         contemplate depositing any large amount of money in the rickety old trap called a safe in
         the "State Treasury" Burglars would go through it as easily as a buzz saw through a paper
         box. Therefore it could not be otherwise expected than that the Treasurer would seek a more
         secure place of deposit for the public funds, and indeed in doing so he but exercises the
         prudence of a wise and careful public officer, and is to be commended for his action
         instead of being traduced and maligned as a law-breaker and felon. Mr. Cooper has followed
         the precedents of his predecessors in office, and is neither better nor worse than they.
         The committee in its investigation after it ascertained that the State Treasurer and ample
         funds and good collaterals in his hands to more than cover his liability, had no
         inclination to pursue and prophetic vagaries of irresponsible newspaper pessimists, or to
         be very profoundly impressed by the vapory mouthings of the subtle sans culotte
         ex-Governor, who, during the first two years of his executive gammon and humble solictude
         for the safe-keeping of the State's money, did not think it proper or expedient to
         recommend "such additional locks, safes and vaults as would render the public funds,
         absolutely secure against fire and burglary," but with a heavenly-pensive serenity
         permitted his Republican State Treasurer to assume the "karking" cares and responsibilities
         of depositing the State's moneys in the various banks of the city of Indianapolis,
         collecting interest and recognizing his right to do so under his unconditional and
         unlimited engagement which he assumed in giving his official bond and taking upon himself
         the duties and responsibilities of the office, and when his term of office had expired the
         most potent ex-Governor, with a complacency equalled only by his magnanimity soaped his
         exit with the unctious benediction of "Well done, thou are led to infer from the
         ex-Governor's message that up to the summer of 1883 he had no knowledge of the condition of
         hte Treasury of the remotest idea of how or where the public funds were kept, bu twas
         reposing in bussful ignorance of the whole subject, although for more than two years he had
         constantly been in close relationship with the banks of the city and daily association with
         the Treasurer, and, in fact, occupying Gubernatorial rooms in the same building. </p>
        <p>It therefore seems to me that the worthy ex-Governor has not only been conversant with
         all the facts and knowledge in relation to the condition of the State Treasury and the
         practices of the various Treasurers, but in full accord and sympathy during the Republican
         administration, and permitting him to go on until the close of his official duties without
         censure or investigation, but it was impossible for the distinguished and honored
         ex-Governor to abdicate his great office and retire to the shades of political oblivion
         with out giving his old time enemy - the Democratic party - a stab through one of its
         honored officers. Therefore, the committee, after a full examination of the assets of the
         Treasury, were of the opinion that the charges made by ex-Governor Porter in his biennial
         message were without foundation or sincerity.</p>
        <p>The minority of the committee talked fair, but played a game of double dealing in the
         report. The minority report was never submitted to the committee, nor did any member of the
         majority know what it contained until read on the floor of this House, and members of the
         committee were greatly surprised to find it teeming with a mess of verbiage and statements
         which were never suggest or spoken of or in the presence of the committee.</p>
        <p>And the gentleman from Wabash and Kosciusko puts on his feathers and war paint and
         constitutes himself the Republican Warwick, and like the Colossus of Rhodes bestrides the
         swash of Republican corruption and attempts to purify the polluted waters of the Stygian
         stream by dragging the untarnished reputations of Democratic officers into it, but the
         gentleman, like the puny, ephemeral insect which dances in the sunshine for a moment and
         then ignominiously perished, when he came in contact with the blaze of Democratic
         investigation, with his false charges, was scorched to death, and he can not avert the fate
         of his party, which will be overwhelmed by the waves of oblivion, and sunken deeper in the
         obscurity than the long-list Atalantis, which lies buried thousands of fathoms deep at the
         bottom of the ocean. We have opened the books, and the first score is for an honest man and
         Democratic reform.</p>
        <p>After further debate [see appendix].</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the majority report was

        <p>The Senate proceeded to consider the special order, being the consideration of the
         majority and minority reports of the Joint Committee to inquire as to whether an
         investigation of the State Treasury is necessary at this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindley moved to substitute the minority for the majority report, and that the
         minority report be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: It has been assumed from the time this question arose with reference to
         the Treasurer of State that the statute prohibited him from loaning the State funds to
         banks or to persons, and that if he does loan them and receives interest thereon, the
         interest is the property of the State. In my judgment that is what prompted the attempted
         investigation - a wish to show that the State Treasurer had probably received interest on
         the State's money, and then go to the people with the cry that the interest belongs to the
         State I wish to call attention to the law on the subject. [Reads] Every true gentleman
         assumes what Governor Porter has stated as a fact in his message, that for years the State
         Treasurers have received interest on public moneys; they assume that the men who have held
         that high and responsible position are felons, and ought to be placed in a felon' cell.
         Suppose it is the law that they should account for this interest. According to Governor
         Porter the Legislature has time and again recognized the fact the State and Treasurers have
         been getting interest on the State's moneys and not accounting for said interest to the
         State Treasury, and it never occurred to anybody to make a fuss about it until a Governor
         that held the office for four years was retiring and turning over the office to another at
         a different political faith. I take the position that the interest on these funds is not
         the State's. You can't place money in the hands of an officer and say to him. "You shall
         pay be back every dollar." and at the same time say to him "You shall pay back every dime
         of interest you receive on it." If you charge him with the interest he receives upon it you
         have got to make him your agent, and stand any loss by fire, burglary or other casualty. By
         not giving him any secure place to keep the State funds, and by allowing him only the
         pitiful salary of $2 000 a year a sum that no insurance company would insure the money for
         - the Legislature has recognized that the interest the State Treasurer gets from the State
         funds is his own, and that fact, in my judgment, would be recognized by the Supreme Court,
         if the officer whose duty it is were to sue the Treasurer and litigate with him for ten
         years to come. The State of Indiana does not want to loan her money. The State wants the
         principal of her money. The State wants the pricipal of her money, and she wants every dime
         of it. The majority of the committee recommend that the law shall be so amended as to leave
         no question about it - that the Treasurer and his bondsmen are absolute insurers of the
         money. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: For thirty years prior to the time Governor Porter delivered his
         message to this General Assembly no suspicion was ever breathed against a Treasurer of the
         State - the fair name and famed Indiana for financial honesty and integrity stood out as
         bright as the noonday sun <pb n="151" xml:id="VAA8558-22-151"/> and there was no State in
         the Union that would vie with her in showing a better reputation for the character and
         conduct of her State officers, be they Democrats or Republicans. But as a Governor of
         Indiana who gained his ascendacy through the grandest political scheme of fraud and
         corruption in the hands of Stephen W. Dorsey, that this world or a civilized nation ever
         experienced, he pronounced to the people by innuendo that there was something wrong in the
         Treasurer's office. His message on that question is simply a grand piece of political
         demagogy. A Republican State Treasurer came into office at the same time he did, and that
         Republican Treasurer remained in office until the result procured by Dorsey was overthrown
         in 1882. In 1883 Governor Porter delivered a message to the General Assembly, in which he
         said not single word concerning the insecurity of the vaults of the State. Were not the
         same laws on the statute book then in force? Was it not his duty to investigate into the
         condition of the vaults and safes of the office of Treasurer of State prior to 1882? But he
         made no such investigation. He came before the General Assembly then with an outgoing
         Republican Treasurer, but made no intimation that there was any difficulty in the Treasury
         Department with reference to the loaning of money. And why? Because he desired to protect a
         Republican Treasurer who had been loaning the public funds the same as he charged John J.
         Cooper has been loaning them. It is political demagogy for the purpose of making political
         capital, which has come to an unsuccessful termination by the report of the majority of
         this Committee. The minority report says that $90 000 was deposited by the Treasurer of
         State within two days prior to the examination That is true; but why state is as
         objectionable? These deposits are changing all the time. They are special deposits When a
         draft is made on one and a part taken out, a new deposit is made for the balance and the
         old deposit is taken up; and that is the reason come of these deposits bear a recent date.
         Why didn't the minority report state the whole facts? This minority report ought to be
         voted down ind disgrace for the untruthful it contains. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I have listened with great patience to the speeches by the Senator from
         Gibson and the Senator from Jennings County, and with disappointment and I do not affect
         anything when I say that there has been, in my judgment, an utter failure to make any
         answer whatever to the grave charges they are called upon to face. This is a question which
         rises above politics. It is a question as to whether Senators here by the votes they will
         give on these reports are willing not only to put themselves in the attitude in which the
         Senator from Gibson says former Legislatures have been occupying for many years, as
         conniving at violations of the statute, but whether they will put themselves in the
         attitude of active participants in violations of the law in the future. It may be true, as
         the Senator says, that all Treasurers of State have violated the law and it may be true
         that Legislatures and Governors have connived at its violation, but I submit in all candor
         we can not afford to go on conniving at the violation of law when it is brought before us
         officially that the law is violated. We have taken an oath to see that no violation of law
         shall continue if it is in our power to stop it The Senator from Gibson has attempted to
         argue that the Treasurer of State has a right to keep the public moneys where he pleases
         the speculate with them as sees proper, to make whatever profit he may out of them, and no
         one has any right to call in question his acts. I tak eissue upon that statement as to the
         law. The very authorities the Senator quoted show the proposition he has been advocating is
         not law, and never has been. [Reads] Will Senators undertake to say the statute does not
         mean what it says? Isn't that language plain and specific? It is conceded that the
         Treasurer of State has been violating the law in discharge of his duties. That face alone
         creates an imperative demand for a full and complete investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I desire to address myself rather from an individual standpoint than any
         other. I find it impossible for me to agree with the majority on this question. I have been
         assured this was not a political question, and I take it that it is not. It reaches beyond
         a political question. It is a question that involves the integrity of an officer of State,
         and the safe-keeping of the funds which the people of the State have contributed for the
         maintenance of the Government of the State; a question as to whether the funds are in the
         custody of the proper officer or not - as to whether the Treasurer of State is able at any
         time to produce the money with which he is chargeable; and I can not conceive how it is
         that there could be any obstruction or any delay in that inquiry, or why it should not be
         so full and complete as to make it as a satisfactory as it would be to inquire into the
         trust of any other citizen; or why this inquiry is not to be met in that spirit of fairness
         which a man would want to meet, and show that he develops close scrutiny as to his trust.
         It is not a question as to whether the Treasurer has been guilty of felony, neither is it a
         question of an attack on Ex-Governor Porter I care not if the insinuation of Governor Por-
         was begotten in malace, the people have the right to know whether they moneys they have
         paid in for taxes are on hand or not. The majority report says it is. That may be. But what
         harm would it be to ascertain whether it is there or not? I understand to say it is not
         there. I charge that no longer than to-day a warrant drawn against the general fund has
         been protested, and I have the authority of the gentleman who holds that warrant for saying
         so. Whether that <pb n="152" xml:id="VAA8558-22-152"/> be true or false I make the
         statement that the general fund, which ought to be at hand, failed to respond to a warrant
         drawn in favor of the gentleman who is entitled to have the sum of money named in his
         warrant. I do not know anything about the truth of the reports that the Treasurer is
         delinquent, but it seems to me when there is such a report it would be the duty of the
         Treasurer of State at once to address the General Assembly a letter inviting them to make
         as full and complete investigation as it is in their power to make. It is the duty of the
         Treasurer of State to meet his obligations promptly and at all times without hesitation.
         There are some insinuations in this minority report that I hardly think proper, and that is
         why I have hesitated, and some of my friends on the Democratic side have hesitated in this
         matter. </p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The report of the minority is based almost exclusively upon newspaper
         rumors upon the streets of Indianapolis. There is sought to be made out of this by the
         minority and by the ex Governor of the State some political capital for the future. We had
         no knowledge of what the minority report would contain, while they had the full benefit of
         the majority report on this question. No baser falsehood was ever concoted on paper than
         here exists in this minority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I have felt it to be an honor to be singled out by gentlemen who signed the
         minority report as the object of their attack. As far as the accusations made in the
         minority report are concerned, we stated every fact just as we learned it. It is said that
         we have brought in this minority report for a partisan and political effect. Why is it that
         the Democratic organ of Indiana, published at Indianapolis and the Democratic organ of
         Cincinnati Ohio, published at Cincinnati, both took the same view the minority of the
         committee took? Why is it that the Senator from Cass and men who have stood as leaders of
         the Democratic party say the Treasurer of State needs an honest investigation?</p>

        <p>The House took up the consideration of the bill [H. R. 68] to repeal the act authorizing
         aliens to hold real estate on the second reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: It is time for us to awake from our lethargy. It is time for the people of
         this country to proclaim their protest against any further encroachment upon our domains,
         proclaim our protest against aliens holding lands within the boundaries of our State. We
         invite all people to come among us, and we proclaim to all the world and to all nations
         except the Chinese to come here and partake with us of our freedom and of our country. I
         believe it right to welcome them and most cordially and heartily invite them, but we ask
         them to tear a just proportion of the burdens of taxation. It is our duty to-day to wipe
         from the statute everything of this character.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I am of the same opinion I was when these bills were presented a few days
         ago, but still I am opposed to this bill because I do not think it is necessary to encumber
         the statute with two bills. I think the Senate bill will accomplish all that is necessary.
         The other bill repeals the law and allows all parties five years to dispose of their
         property. I think the Senate bill a better bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: When the committee investigated this bill and made their report there was a
         difference of opinion as to whether or not this law repeals the law of 1881 It may be it
         will by implication but there is a question about it. I am not in favor of repealing the
         law absolutely. I will vote for this bill, however, or any bill repealing that kind of an
         act. </p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: I think the statue ought to be so framed that the party will have five years
         to perfect his title and dispose of his real estate. </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: There is another objection to the bill, and that is it has no saving
         clause. I am in favor of repealing the law with a saving clause. It seems to me we ought
         not to pass this bill upon the supposition that another bill will pass. I do not think that
         it is wise. This bill does not provide for rights acquired under the law. I therefore move
         that the bill be recommitted to the Judiciary Committee, with instructions to attach a
         saving clause. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: This is one of the first bills on the House calendar. There is no bill that
         calls more for affirmative action. Of all the laws of the State of Indiana this is the most
         infamous. It is a disgrace to the State. From the time that House Bill 1[] came up from
         consideration until now gentle <pb n="153" xml:id="VAA8558-22-153"/> men have expressed
         their sympathy - have said that they favored the repeal of this statue, but every time it
         has come up dilatory motions have been made, and I say this morning the time has come to do
         something to repeal this statute. It has been said it will be confiscation of aliens'
         property. If it will, it ought to be confiscated. There is no emergency clause, and it will
         give them time to dispose of their real estate. Now, the gentleman has made a motion to
         postpone the consideration of the bill. I don't think it ought to be postponed for a single
         hour. I therefore move to lay the motion on the table. </p>
        <p>A division being called for the motion was laid on the table. Affimative, 36; negative,
         29.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: Now, with all due deference tot he terms of this bill, I want to know before
         its passage if it will accomplish anything. I have not heard a single gentleman state the
         object to be accomplished by this act. If this bill passes, I undertake to say if a man
         acquires a lien or acquires a mortgage under the existing law it will throw a could on his
         title. I am in favor of repealing this law; yet at the same time, I am in favor of saving
         every person, be he alien or be he resident of the United States. If an alien has acquired
         any property under the law we have no right to confiscate it. The Senate bill is the best
         bill. I know it has been said the law should be repealed. I believe it. </p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I do not understand the passage of this bill to interfere at all with the
         rights acquired under this law. It is a well settled rule of law, I think, that laws
         enacted by the Legislature operate prospectively unless they provide otherwise. Now, the
         report of this act will not affect the title of any right acquired by foreigners until the
         time of taking effect. And the repeal of the law will not affect the rights acquired under
         the law. </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I ask the gentleman if he is clear upon that legal proposition if aliens
         having acquired rights could convey real estate acquired under the law of 1881, if not
         repealed.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I would not say certain, but I have given the gentleman my opinion. It seems
         to me there should be an emergency clause. If we are going to repeal the statute it had
         better take effect right away, and not allow aliens to go on acquiring real estate for the
         next six months.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: The time has come for the passage of this bill. There has been several
         opinions expressed and I want to call attention to them. The first is that there should be
         an emergency clause. If we are going to repeal the statute it had better take effect right
         away, and not allow aliens to go on acquiring real estate for the next six months.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: The time has come for the passage of this bill. There has been several
         opinions expressed and I want to call attention to them. The first is that there should be
         an emergency clause. This was suggested by the author of the bill, and it was referred to
         the Committee on the Judiciary and they struck it out. The report of that committee has
         been concurred in by the House, but I still favor an emergency clause; bit it seems to some
         objectionable - there can not be an emergency clause without delay. A similar bill to this
         was delayed two years ago until it was not passed I do not desire to impugn the motives of
         any one, but I fear if we delay this bill it will share a similar fate. I do not refer to
         the gentleman from Hancock. I think is for the bill. I question whether the law was passed
         in good faith. When it passed the Assembly the caption of the law was "An act to encourage
         immigration into the State of Indiana." After it passed the Assembly the title was changed
         so as to read " Concerning aliens holding and conveying real estate." I am in favor of the
         bill. The Senate bill, I think, doesn't cover the ground. I demand the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the bill was read the third time
         and passed by yeas 68, nays 15.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS said: I am not in favor of this bill. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe in repealing the law, but I am not
         in favor of the provisions of this ibll. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING said: The bill is not what I think it ought to be, but half a loaf is better
         than bread. I therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL said, in explanation of his vote: I am not in favor of aliens holding real
         estate, but still the provisions of the bill are not what they ought to be. I therefore
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON said: On reflection I am inclined to vote for the bill. I therefore vote
         "aye," making the gentlemen from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) and the gentleman from Putnam (Mr.
         Gordon) a scape-goat for any legal complications. </p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP, when his name was called, said: This bill is not all I desire. I therefore vote
         "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY said: I am in favor of the repeal of the alien law enacted in 1881, but
         inasumuch as this bill will not, as the Senate bill does, save all rights acquired by the
         operations under the law of 1881, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: Because this bill is imperfect and the Senate bill is the
         better of the two, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM said: I am not in favor of residents avoiding their honest debts, and for
         that reason I will vote no "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE TREASURER'S BOND.</head>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I am informed that House Bill No. 3 has been returned from the Senate. I
         therefore move to suspend the order of business and take up the bill. </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to, and the Senate amendment being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said: This bill, after mature deliberations and amendment, was passed by this
         House. I do not believe that a million dollars is any too much for the amount of the State
         Treasurer's bond. Five hundred thousand dollars is not a sufficent bond, <pb n="154"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-154"/> therefore I am opposed to the Senate amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I am willing to vote for a bill making the bond one million, but I am
         informed next Tuesday the Treasurer will commence his new term of office, and unless we
         pass some kind of a bill he will give a bond for $150,000 only. I am in favor of concurring
         in the Senate amendment of $500,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: This House considered this bill and came to the conclusion that the amount
         of the bond ought to be $1,000,000</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL (after the noon recess) said: When this bill was before the House the amount
         of the bond was fixed at $1 000.00. I am still of the opinion that is the proper amount. It
         has been argued before this House that it would be better to concede to the Senate than let
         the matter pas over until next week. I am inclined to think it would not be. If the
         judgment of the House is that the penalty of the bond should be 1,000,000, we ought to
         stick to it. On the first of November, 1884, there was a balance of cash in the Treasurer's
         hands to the amount of $431,256.54. Now a bond of $500,000 would scarcely cover that. I
         find further, on the 29th of January, 1885 the total amount the Treasurer has received to
         be $420,154 33 It seems to me the bond ought to be enough to make the people of the State
         feel secure. The State Treasurer ought to be required to give a bond for everything he is
         to account for. The bond should be sufficient to cover every dollar in that treasury vault
         or wherever it may be. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROOKS: I do not believe the bond is sufficient to cover all the money that comes
         into his hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the House refused to concur in
         the Senate amendment by a vote of years 28, nays 47.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved for a committee of Free Conference, and that two be appointed on the

        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the reports pending at the adjournment
         yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: In discussing the question of the substitution of the minority for the
         majority report. I shall endeavor to be brief: but in the remarks I shall make I desire to
         have no interruption, and therefore I request Senators if they have any questions to ask
         they will defer their inquiries until I have finished, when I shall be happy to respond. I
         have ever regarded this question of investigating the funds in the hands of the Treasurer
         of the State beyond the point of ascertaining the amount, as a matter instigated simply for
         the manufacture of political capital. I believe this Legislature has the right to know what
         every dollar of the State's money is safe and secure; and I believe when the fact is
         learned the inquiry should stop there. It is true there may have been some dereliction from
         law on the part of the Treasurer of State, as there has been confessedly upon the part of
         the Republican Governor of State in the discharge of his duty to the State, but the real,
         central question of all this investigation resolves itself into this one single inquiry:
         Are the funds of the State safe? Is the State protected against loss? If it is, then I
         claim we are not authorized to go further, under the statute which gives both the Governor
         and either branch of the Legislature the right to inquire into this matter. In advance of
         the reports of the committee, and even before the matter was ascertained a Democratic
         member of the House of Representatives introduced a bill raising the bond of the State
         Treasurer to the sum of $1 000 000. In the House it was passed by a unanimous vote. It came
         to the Senate, and even under the assurance of the Treasurer of State that he doubted
         whether he could give so large a bond, it was passed with an amendment making the bond half
         a million, by a vote of two to one. I stood upon this floor and by every means in my power
         tried to fix the bond at the first named sum. The Senate disagreed with me and I bowed in
         submission to its decision, and from that time to the present on every occasion when I
         thought I could advance the bill I have called it up, and now I find that bill going to the
         Governor with a provision requiring the Treasurer of State to give a $700,000 bond, thus
         protecting the State against any loss of funds in his hands. How much further ought we to
         go? What more can be demanded? The only fact shown in either of these reports with which
         the Senate has anything to do is the fact that $491 000 is in the hands of the State
         Treasurer. Has any reason been shown - I mean not rumors - to doubt that these funds are
         there? On the contrary, both reports show that he has in his hands $5 111 more than he is
         charged with on the books of the Auditor of State. I spoke for an investigation to find out
         what sums were due the State, and I have spoken for the protection of these sums
         absolutely. The Democratic party has investigated the Treasurer of State so far as the
         statute permits him to be investigated and add to the security of the public funds they
         have placed his bond higher by $200 000 than the amount in his hands. With this record I
         believe we can safely go to the people and bear all the slander and innuendos of the
         Republican ex <pb n="156" xml:id="VAA8558-22-156"/> Governor and the Republican minority on
         this floor or elsewhere. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: It was not my intention when this question was first sprung upon the Senate
         to take any part in the discussion. I had hoped it would not assume a political character,
         but it certainly is now a question that has divided this Senate in accordance with their
         political preferences We have before us to reports - a majority and minority report, but
         are not considering a motion to substitute the minority for the majority report. That has
         been the question before the Senate this morning and yesterday afternoon, and I leave it to
         the candid judgment of the Senate if the speakers upon the opposite side have confined
         themselves to the question. A stranger coming upon this floor would naturally have thought
         ex Governor Porter was on trial for the commission of a crime. The majority on this floor
         do not deny or disprove a single charge made in the minority report. Many charges have been
         made against the Republican party. The Republican party is not afraid to stand upon the
         record it has made, not ony upon this question, but upon all other questions. The
         opposition are not satisfied to speak of the question at issue, but go back to attack that
         great and good man who retires to private life with the confidence and respect of the
         entire people, Albert G. Porter, but that grand and gallant leader, James G. Blaine,
         [applause] they can't attach his public record - a man that for twenty years has been in
         public life. [Laughter] Democrats may well laugh now, but the time will come when James G.
         Blaine will yet cause them to laugh on the other side of their face. The Republican party
         is not dead, nor is James G. Blaine dead, nor are the priciples James G. Blaine advocates
         dead. They were not satisfied to attach James G. Blaine's public life, but they had to
         resort to the extent of going into the sanctity of his household, and attack him - </p>
        <p>Mr. Magee: Will you allow a question?</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: No, I will take the same course of the Democratic speaker who preceded me.
         This question has assumed a political significance, and I want every Republican member on
         this floor to define his position upon this question. It was charged that Republicans are
         afraid to father the minority report, but they will find out the Republican members are not
         afraid to father the report they have made. We believe this minority reprot should be
         adopted, for we think it is demanded in the interest of the people of Indiana. The law
         provides that the State Treasurer shall keep the funds of the State on hand in money. Has
         he got the State's money on hand? There as not been a single Senator on this floor who has
         had the audacity to claim that John J. Cooper had the money. It was even shown that on
         yesterday a warrant drawn on the State Treasury was protested for want of funds with which
         to make payment. He had certificates of special deposit for $6,000 but the minority of the
         committee were not given a change to ascertain whether it was his money or somebody else's.
         The people of Indiana are looking with great interest to see the solution of this question;
         the people are interested in it, and I sincerely hope and trust that Democratic members
         will see it to their interest to vote in support of this minority report. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: I did not expect to take the floor on this occasion and to
         participate in the discussion of the merits of the two reports submitted by the Special
         Committee. I have read both reports and have listened attentively to the debate which has
         taken place in regard to their merits, but I must confess that neither the majority report
         nor the minority report fully satisfies me, and that I would much prefer to get a fuller,
         more thorough, and at the same time entirely impartial, statement of the condition of our
         State Treasury, before I would like to vote for either. While I am fully as much convinced
         as the Senator from Jennings, or Gibson, or Huntington, who have so eloquently advocated
         the adoption of the majority report, that our present State Treasurer has managed the
         affairs of his high and responsible office with as much prudence and integrity as any of
         his predecessors in office, and that the public funds are entirely safe and secure in his
         custody, so that no loss to the State will ever accrue through any negligence or criminal
         action of his, yet the report of the majority of the committee leaves on the mind of the
         reader a certain feeling of vagueness, uncertainty and ambiguity as to the character and
         cash value of the Treasurer's assets, so that I would prefer a clear, plainer, more
         explicit and detailed exhibit of these assets, good and sure as they undoubtedly are. On
         the other hand, the minority report, which nearly in every line displays a tinge of
         partisan hostility, not only to the Treasurer himself, but also to the majority of the
         committee associated with the minority fails to convince me of the correctness of its
         allegations and the substantial foundation of its fears and apprehensions from the very
         fact that its undeniable partisan spirit detracts from the ability with which it is written
         and from the value of the charges preferred in the report. I am here in this Senate not as
         a partisan - not as a Democrat or Republican - blinded by the desire to help either my part
         or a great State official out of a difficulty, but I am here as one of fifty Senators, to
         whom the citizens of Indiana have delegated the power and entrusted the care to watch over
         their interests and to guard their interests against loss of injury. In every vote which I
         have cast I have conscientiously asked myself whether to the best of convictions and
         judgement, this vote should be given or not, always willing to be enlightened and corrected
         in case of error, and this same course I intend to pursue this <pb n="157"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-157"/> time. And since neither of the reports which the committee have
         submitted, neither the report advocated by the Senators from Gibson and Jennings and
         Huntington, nor the minority report so persistently advocated by the Senator from Wayne and
         his party advocates I intend to offer as a substitute to the motion made by the Senator
         from Parke the following resolution:</p>

        <floatingText>
         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Whereas, The special committee appointed to consider that portion of ex-Governor
            Porter's message which refers to the State Treasury have submitted a majority and
            minority report as the result of their investigation;</p>
           <p>Whereas, Either of these reports, on account the short time alloted to the
            investigation of the important questions involved, fails to satisfy this Senate as to
            the true condition of affairs in the State Treasury;</p>
           <p>Whereas, We have the fullest confidence in the honesty, integrity and probity of State
            Treasurer John J. Cooper and are convinced that he can give as satisfactory an account
            of the conditions of the State Treasury and of the safety of the public funds entrusted
            to his official care as any of his predecessors in office;</p>
           <p>whereas,The great party which has twice honored and said John J. Cooper by an election
            to the high and honorable office of a custodian of the public funds of the State feels
            aggrieved and insuled by the aspersions on his character as a public officer, and deems
            it due to its honor to prove the utter groundlessness of the fears and apprehension
            concerning the existence of a large deficiency in the Treasury, expressed in the
            minority report; and </p>
           <p>Wheras, This great party, whenever its character is thus assailed and its honor
            sullied by open charges, as contained in the minority report of the special committee,
            or by the inuendoes contained in the message of ex-Governor Porter, never shrinks from
            its duty to the people of this State to establish a full, air, thorough and impartial
            investigation of all the facts connected with a charge involving large public interests
            and creating a feeing of uneasiness in the minds of the people;</p>
           <p>Resolved, That the two reports above named be referred to a special committee of five,
            to be appointed by the President of the Senate, to further investigate he condition of
            the State Treasury, with power to send for persons and papers and with instructions to
            employ three experienced accountants at a salary of not more than $6 per day, and to
            proceed to a full and thorough investigation of the State Treasury, to verify the
            vouchers submitted to them and to ascertain the exact cash value of the money, papers
            and valuables exhibited by the said John J. Cooper as the property of the State in his
            custody.</p>
           <p>Resolved, That the investigation of said committee shall effect the principal, the
            money really paid into the hands of the State Treasurer, and shall not enter into any
            questions, whether interest on said principal or any part of it was paid to him or
            not.</p>
           <p>Resolved, That the three experts employed by the special committee shall make their
            report to the special committee appointed them no later than ten days before the
            termination of the regular session of this General Assembly</p>
          </div>
         </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Let the resolution be carried on in a spirit of justice, fairness and impartiality, with
         out fear or favor, worthy both of the high character of the officer whose official conduct
         is to be investigated, and of the dignity of the Senate. I have not the least doubt that
         such an investigation, carried on in such a spirit, will lead to the full exoneration of
         Mr. Cooper, and will satisfy public opinion that the high and responsible office which he
         administers is to-day in safe hands, and that the large amount of public funds entrusted to
         him is in no danger of being lost or recklessly jeopardized </p>
        <p>I move the adoption of the resolution as read:</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am in full accord with the Senator from Tippecanoe who desires to have this
         matter referred to another committee. The only result that we desire and that the whole
         people desire, is that there shall be an examination of that Treasury. While we believe
         every statement made the minority report has been justified by the information we received
         and the facts we know from the investigation of the assets we were permitted to make, not
         for the sake of investigation, but because we believe, aye, we know, it is demanded by the
         best interests of the State for which we will sacrifice anything else. We say, amend that
         report almost any way you like, and which will give the investigation necessary. We don't
         do it for political capital. We don't ask for anything better, nor could we ever have you
         in a better place than now, if that were our purpose. What we want to know is that the
         money of the State is safe. So far as the main resolution of the Senator from Tippecanoe
         goes, I will most heartily give my co-operation, for I believe has had done honor to the
         Senate and to the Democratic party of Indiana in demanding that investigation. This
         resolution as to the investigation we are to a man, I think, in favor. It has, however,
         been coupled with a number of preambles for the purpose, as it would appear (I don't charge
         that upon the Senator from Tippecanoe), but it looks as if the same spirit was trying to
         get Republicans to vote against the resolution because we don't agree with the preamble,
         [Reads.] There is one objection to that preamble. It is not our business as a Senate to
         decide a case before we have investigated it. We have no business to pronounce him
         innocent. An opinion as to guilt or innocence would disqualify any man from sitting on a
         jury, and it is hardly competent for this Senate to express that opinion before making an
         inquiry. Of course a man is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proven against
         him.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, raised the point of order that the Committee making these reports
         was a Joint Committee. The house has acted upon the reports and has discharged its parts of
         the committee. The substitute proposes to refer this matter to a Senate committee, and is
         out of order. </p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I desire the Senator from Gibson shall occupy my thirty minutes. At the
         close of his remarks I shall claim time for the purpose of moving the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>Mr. McOULLOUGH (in concluding his speech) said: As was suggested by my <pb n="158"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-158"/> friend, the Senator from White, (Mr. Sellers) I will move the
         previous question. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I would ask the Senator to withdraw that motion. I wish to move to strike out
         a part of the minority report. </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH and several Senators: "No," "no," "no,"</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: If the majority here want to stifle all discussion and inquiry, let take the
         responsibility.</p>
        <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, and the main question
         being ordered - </p>
        <p>The motion to substitute the minority report for the majority report was rejected by yeas
         15, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER said: I have not been in the Senate much during the discussion of this
         question owing to my not being able to be here. I am not satisfied with either of these
         reports, but in view of the fact that the Governor has full authority to make an
         investigation at any time to ascertain the condition of the State Treasury, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, when his name was called, said: I stated yesterday that neither one of these
         reports was satisfactory to myself. I had no opportunity to offer the amendment I desired
         to modify the report of the minority. The Senator form Laporte and others objected to my
         doing so this morning. As I had no opportunity of moving to separate a portion of the
         minority report, which is very objectionable, from that which I think is proper,
         nevertheless, under the circumstances, not be able to concur with the majority report, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called said: I had a great deal of interest in this
         discussion and from my confidence in Senators, without a reference to their politics from
         either side, I have been very much troubled, and I went to a financial adviser - a
         gentleman known all over this Nation - and that is William H. English, and asked him some
         questions, and he told me that John J. Cooper stood fairer and conducted the State Treasury
         better than any other man that had ever been there with the exception of one man, and that
         was Matthew Brett; that his affairs were all sound, and all he said he had in the banks he
         had, and he didn't know a safer man in the Union than John J. Cooper to manage the Treasury
         of Indiana. Under these circumstances I feel well pleased to vote "no"</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>The majority report was concurred in by yeas 26, nays 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: In explanation of my vote I would like to say that in voting
         for the majority report of this committee I do it in order not to give any misconstruction
         as to my idea. I have arrived at the same time conclusion as the majority, however will
         hereafter move a resolution for an investigation.</p>

        <p>Mr. GOODING offered the following:</p>
        <floatingText>
         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of this House that the percentum of State tax should
            not, at the present session of the Legislature be increased, and that the appropriations
            should be economical as far as practicable, avoiding the increase of expenses by issuing
            bonds or otherwise.</p>
          </div>
         </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I think it is important to say something upon the propriety of the right to
         increase the taxation. By making appropriations we will be either compelled to increase the
         taxation or to issue bonds. I hope the resolution will be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I remember a few years ago and it was declared in one of the
         political platforms that the levy should not be over so much on the hundred dollars and at
         the ensuing session of the Legislature I remember the House was in session until midnight
         on the last day, and adjourned without passing the appropriation bill That was in 1877. And
         I remember one branch of the House was in favor of a 5 per cent, levy, and the other branch
         was in favor of 12 per cent, and I remember that to the party which adopted the platform
         belonged the gentleman that is soon to be inaugurated Vice President of the United States.
         He was then Governor of the State. I think we had better not determine how much cloth we
         have to buy before we know how many persons we have to clothe. I think it is simply going
         it blind.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSHEND: I wish to ask the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding), the author of the
         resolution, if it is the purpose of the resolution to prevent a refunding of the State
         debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I ask the gentleman to read the resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: For the first time since I have been here I find myself exactly concurring
         with the gentleman from Tippecanoe. I move this resolution be referred to the Committee on
         Ways and Means.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Perhaps the House were not paying attention carefully to the reading of the
         resolution I am opposed to a reference of it, and I hope if it is referred the committee
         will report it back favorably, and then I will be heard on the subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: If you will allow me, I desire to say that nearly every measure before this
         House has been carried into politics' we have been making political measures of them. The
         gentleman from Hancock says he wants an opinion of this House to enable him to know how to
         vote on the appropriations. In my opinion we should exercise our own judgment. The
         gentleman shall have my vote to enable him to know how to vote on the appropriation bills. </p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I am in favor of maintaining the State institutions by liberal appropri <pb
          n="159" xml:id="VAA8558-22-159"/> tions. I think the affairs of the State should be
         administered economically, but still I am in favor of maintaining the State institutions I
         am opposed to the resolution. I therefore move that the motion to refer to the Committee on
         Ways and Means, made by the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Williams) lie on the table. </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I move that the resolution lie upon the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 65, nays 28.</p>

        <head rend="center">JURY TRIAL EXTENSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. Gooding's bill [H. R. 57] coming up on the second reading -</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING said: I wish to state to the House the purpose of this bill. Equitable cases
         before the act of 1852 were tried by the Court and not by the jury. The right of trial by
         jury was restricted to common law cases. This bill, instead or requiring cases of an
         equitable character to be tried by the Court, it allows either party, if they demand a jury
         trial, to have their cases tried by a jury. If a person wishes to have his case tried by
         the Court why of course he can; but this bill provides that if a person desires to have a
         jury trial he can have it in suits in equity as well as in common law. I do not propose to
         take the time in discussing the merits of this bill. I think it is a bill which ought to
         pass. I can see no reason why it should not.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I think this is one of the most important bills presented to this House for
         years and years. Now, when a person comes into court for the foreclosure of a mortgage, in
         some cases the Court will deny the party a jury, and very often the ruling of the Court
         will be sustained when the party goes to the Supreme Court. And when the plea of fraud is
         set up and ca be supported by facts, the party is denied the right to go before a jury in
         many cases. There are many cases where a party may desire to call upon a jury - twelve
         peers of the realm - to determine the facts. For this reason I say this bill should be
         become a law. When I say this I do not wish to reflect up in a Judge of the State or the
         Judge of our Court, for I believe he is a man who has superior intellectual attainments, so
         far as that is concerned. I hope the bill will become a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: Two years ago I favored a bill similar to this. I agree with the gentleman
         from Daviess (Mr. Taylor) that this is one of the most important measures before the
         Assembly. I would rather go before a jury of twelve men and trust to their common sense and
         honesty than to try a case before the Court in many instances.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I favored the bill for the same reason stated by the gentleman, not intending
         to say anything to the discredit of our Judges and attorneys. I undertake to say there are
         few cases in which the equitable and legal principles are easily distinguished. It is very
         difficult matter for the Court in many cases to determine whether a case is a legal or an
         equitable case. Many cases are taken to the Supreme Court to determine the question whether
         it is a legal or an equitable case. I am in favor of jury trials. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I believe that a jury is the highest tribunal on this earth. I am willing
         in all cases of fact that they may decide for me. I hope this measure will pass this House
         and become a law.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I am in favor of the passage of this bill. I believe it would be a sorry
         day for this country when all questions of fact, as well as law, would have to be settled
         by th Court. Men who have been long separated from the people - Judges holding office for a
         long time - are not as competent to determine many questions of fact as twelve men fresh
         from the body of the people Now these are my views upon the bill. I hope this measure will
         pass and become a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I must say I have been surprised at this discussion. Why, the gentleman a
         little while ago talked as though he was addressing his argument to a jury - as though this
         House was a jury and he was addressing them. Now I do not see what is to be gained by
         trying this class of cases before a jury. If the Court sees fit, in his discretion, he can
         grant a new trial. The law of 1881 was drafted under the direction of the Bar Association.
         I believe it is a good law. I believe this law ought not to pass. I believe it would make
         additional delay in litigation. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: Two years ago a bill of similar character was introduced into this House,
         and we occupied a good deal of valuable time in its discussion, and it did not pass. Since
         that bill was defeated I have given the subject some consideration, and I have come to the
         conclusion in many cases a Judge is not competent to try a case. I think a tribunal of
         twelve men is much more competent to try questions of fact than a court. The gentleman has
         said the law of 181 was drafted under the direction of the State Bar Association. I do not
         want to hold the Republican responsible for the blunders of the State Bar Association, but
         I certainly think the Republican legislature made a blunder when it passed the law of 1881.
         I would rather try questions of fact before a jury than any judge. I hope the bill will
         pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: There are one or two points I wish to answer. The gentleman from Wabash (Mr.
         Sayre) contended that <pb n="160" xml:id="VAA8558-22-160"/> there ought not to be a jury
         trial in this kind of cases. I would like to ask the gentleman if he think there ought to
         be a jury trial in any class of cases, whether equitable or common law cases? I think we
         ought to restrict the power of the Circuit Judges. If a jury trial is denied, the Judge
         often appoints his referre or Master Commissioner, and they go out and come in and report
         to him. Now, I think the rights of everybody are better protected by jury trials. I hope
         this House will pass this bill.</p>
        <p> The bill was read the third time, and passed by yeas -, nays - . </p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE'S TREASURE.</head>
        <p>The Senate having under consideration the majority and minority reports pending at the
         adjournment yesterday - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I do not speak because I desire to speak to the Senate or because I am
         fond of speaking, but I have realized there was a duty devolving upon the Democratic
         majority, and all I have done in committee and out of it, and all I am going to do or say,
         I do to discharge my duty to the State and the people of the State. It has been that the
         people are clamoring for an investigation of the State Treasury,and I would have an
         influence against us unless there was an investigation. I believe if members will deal with
         questions which rightfully come before them, and enact proper legislation, that the
         intelligent demand of the people will be met. The Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) on
         yesterday insisted, as other members have asserted that the interest on public funds
         collected by the State Treasurer is the property of the State, and that we ought to
         investigate to see how much interest he has received in that way. [Reads Section 5636 of
         the Statute] As I said yesterday, to a person unacquainted with the law and the decisions
         of the courts, that section would see to make the Treasurer account for the interest. I
         also cited sections of the statute concerning County Treasurers that were just as strong.
         And the holding has always been by the Supreme Court that the County Treasurer is not
         chargeable with interest. The Senator from Marion refers to the note at the bottom of the
         section, and contends that the note shows the able lawyers who revised the Code of 1881
         thought there was a difference between th County and State Treasurer. I acknowledge the
         ability of these lawyers. But the fact that the note is inserted where it is shows that in
         the mind of the commissioners there was doubt, upon the subject. If not, why did they
         insert the note at that place? It is 100 pages from the statute governing County
         Treasurers. The note would never have been inserted in the statute governing the State
         Treasurer but to call attention to what the Supreme Court had decided about County
         Treasurers, and to suggest the doubt as to what would be the construction of the section it
         follows Considering th fact that for more than twenty yeas the State has had no place in
         which the Treasurer could keep the money, and that he has been compelled to keep it in bank
         notwithstanding that section, and during al of that time no interest has been required of
         any Treasurer, although it was known by the Governor Porter's message, that the Treasurer
         was receiving interest, no man can say that it is the law that he should account for
         interest until the courts of the State have decided it. The Legislature can not settle the
         question. It is not a court. The Attorney General is the law officer of the State, and it
         is his duty to see if the interest belongs to the State Such suit has never been brought
         against any Treasurer. What good then will investigation do? Why take the time of this
         Legislature disputing over this matter, and no good could come of it. The Legislature has
         no power to settle the rights of parties or officers in the past. <pb n="162"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-162"/> That power belongs to the judicial tribunals. That duty devolves
         upon other officers of the State and upon us. </p>
        <p>But, says the Senator from Cass (Mr. Magee), the State Treasurer has no right to take
         county orders. That, again, depends upon the construction of the statute above. If, like
         the County Treasurer, he has a right to invest the money in what security he pleases until
         called on by law to pay it out, then it is not unlawful for him to take the orders. But
         whether it is right or wrong, what can the Legislature do about it? It can not take the
         orders away from him. It has no power on earth to do anything with reference to the orders.
         Both reports show that he has the orders. Now, what more light can be thrown upon the
         question by an investigating committee?</p>
        <p>Says another, it is hinted that the Treasurer lost some money in a blank that broke.
         Suppose he did and you investigating committee should find that to be true. I say to you
         that for one I am unutterably opposed to making an appropriation to the Treasurer to make
         up the loss. And I know of now power the Legislature would have to compel a broken bank to
         make it up. </p>
        <p>Says another, there is a rumor that the Treasurer has borrowed the money to supply the
         loss he has met with. Suppose that is ascertained to be a fact, is the Legislature going to
         say that you shall not borrow money? Why the law would require him to supply the
         deficiency, if he has met with loss, and it would make no difference, so far as the State
         is concerned, whether he borrowed the money or not, so he got it. The people of this State
         are interest in having proper legislation upon the subject. We can pass laws to govern in
         the future, not the past. We want to do that carefully deliberately. For the purposes of
         legislation we want to investigation the old law, see wherein it is wrong and where it is
         doubtful. Then carefully amend it. Leave no doubt for the future, so far as it is within
         our capacity to prevent it. </p>
        <p>If this Legislature will tarn its attention from balderdash and political clap trap to
         the law, and make secure the people's money for the future, it will accomplish its duty in
         that regard, and what the people have a right to expect of it. On the other hand if for
         noise, excitement and clap trap, the time is spent in investigating and disputing, and the
         legislation is neglected as it will be if this thing continues, and the minority hope to
         have it, the people will hold us to an account for our negligence. And they ought. </p>
        <p>The Legislature is in session but two months in twenty-four. Before I was a member of it,
         I used to hear expressions (not sure but I took part in them myself) to the effect that it
         would be better if the sessions were shorter and less frequent (of course nothing of that
         kind has been hinted lately.) Since 1859 the Governor of the State has had power to
         investigate the State Treasury at any time without warning. Twenty two months out of the
         twenty-four it must be left to the Governor to investigate. And twenty-four months out of
         twenty-four it ought to be left to him to investigate. If you want game you do not go
         hunting with brass bands; and when you want to make a genuine investigation you don't want
         a Legislative Committee to do it, a part of such committee going for political buncombe,
         usually, and especially so with the minority of the committee in this case. </p>
        <p>Within a few days the Treasurer will be required to give a bond for $700,000.00. The men
         who go on his bond will investigate him in a business-like way. They will not rely upon the
         Legislative Committee's investigation. And it is the duty of the Governor, under the law,
         to investigate the bondsmen and approve the bond. With that the Legislature has naught to
         do.</p>
        <p>Governor Porter tells us in his message that $3 is not enough to pay an expert to
         investigate. The committee have reported in favor increasing the salary of such expert, and
         such amendment should be made. The Governor and Secretary are the representatives of all
         the people of the State, and they can make the investigation any moment without warning
         when it may seem necessary.</p>
        <p>One prominent member of this General Assembly is almost exhausted endeavoring for thirty
         days to get his committee together. It looks now as if by continued industry he would
         succeed in obtaining a meeting in thirty days more. Think of a committee like that
         investigating the State Treasurer's office, together will all of the other work that is to
         be done here in sixty days, and surviving.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of legislation. I am willing to assume the worst state of facts that any
         of the gentleman who want to investigate can imagine. For the purpose of legislation assume
         that the money is loaned; assume that the Treasurer had met with loss; assume that he has
         had to borrow to make up the deficiency, or if that is not the case at present, assume that
         there might be a time when these things would exist, and make your legislation accordingly.
         The safe legislator is the one who endeavors to think of every possible contingency that
         might arise, and legislate with reference to it. I am in favor of stopping this noise and
         clamor, and endeavoring to enact proper legislation to make the money of the State
         perfectly secure, and attending to the business properly before this General Assembly. </p>

        <head rend="center">MEDICAL LEGISLATION.</head>
        <p>Mr. Shively's bill [S. 18] to regulate the practice of medicine coming up on the second
         reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH moved to amend the bill so that if a physician desires to prove he has
         practiced medicine for ten years continuously he has to prove that fact by two reputable
         witnesses, either householders or freeholders of the county in which he proposes to
         practice, and also that he is a man of reputable character. He said: I hope that people as
         well as the profession Some of our fellow-citizens, especially those of the legal
         profession, may smile when we talk of proving moral character, especially of a physician.
         But I believe a physician ought to have a good moral character in order to practice
         medicine. The medical colleges of this State and all well regulated medical colleges in
         this country require of a student before he is allowed to matriculate to present evidence
         of a good moral character. But in Indiana any man can practice medicine, whether he has
         been run off from other States on account of lack of moral qualifications or not. There is
         another slight amendment to the bill in the one I offered - that the Clerk shall have
         twenty-five cents for the affidavit and pay for recording, etc.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIRD: Under the amendment, as I understand it, which I am opposed to, if the most
         eminent physician that lives comes into the State and desires to become a citizen and
         engage in the practice of his profession, he is unable to do so until he finds two
         freeholders or householders to swear in his moral character. Inasmuch as there are others
         who have given this bill more attention and are better able to discuss its merits, I will
         not detain the Senate further than to call attention to that one point, as it occurred to
         me when the amendment was read. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I introduced a bill [S. 223] on this subject, which has been carefully
         prepared by a committee appointed by the State Medical Society. It was referred to the
         Committee on Public Health, and I am informed did not reach that committee til after it had
         reported the bill under consideration. There seems to be a very general desire that there
         shall be some legislation on the subject, and we should legislate intelligently and with a
         full knowledge of the matter before us; and to consider the various bills presented at the
         same time is the only way in which we can do so. I move to amend the amendment by striking
         out all after the enacting clause of the bill and inserting in lieu Senate bill 223.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: This committee has letters from about half the physicians in the State. Some
         one has sent a circular out asking them to write their opinion to their legislators, and
         about nine of every ten favored this bill. I believe this bill will give better
         satisfaction than any bill that has been introduced in this Legislature. I understand this
         same committee of the State Medical Society, after their bill had been introduced,
         expressed themselves as satisfied with this bill Perhaps it is not as strong as they would
         desire, but they believe it as much so as any that ought to be passed at this time. This
         class of legislation must be proceeded with in a careful manner. We must approach perfect
         by degrees. The amendment provides that one of the qualifications shall be a good moral
         character. Who is to judge of the standard of moral character?</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: My amendment proposes that two witnesses shall fix it. </p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I object to that manner of fixing the standard because no two will agree as
         to what it is. Another objection is, if the persons character should become bad after
         having obtained a license, he would be liable to continual prosecution by ever person in
         the State. Another objection is that whoever makes a false affidavit shall be guilty of a
         misdemeanor. I hope no amendment will be made to the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I shall ask some of the advocates of this bill to give some
         reason why there should be any legislation upon this subject. So far as this discussion has
         gone, it is as to which is the better of the two bills. For my own part, as at present
         advised. I shall vote against either and both, on the ground that no good reason has been
         shown for legislation on the subject. </p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: Was not the bill 223 prepared by one of the schools of medicine? </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I understand it has bee submitted to the homeopathic school, and received
         their approbation. I don't know, but I am inclined to say legislation is necessary because
         surrounding States have adopted laws, under the effect of which quacks have flocked into
         Indiana. I will move that the bill be recommitted. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It seems to me it is the opinion of the citizens of the State should be taken
         as to the necessity of legislation; it should be for the interests of the people of the
         State, and not what the doctors desires. I have some doubts as to the advisability of
         attempting to protect the people against empyricism at all, or whether it can be done under
         any circumstances. I know an instance where a man who has practiced for ten years stated
         that the circulation of the blood was from the heart through the lungs directly into the
         system; and upon being asked where the heel bone is situated stated that it was at the
         bottom of the vertebral column. To a man who practiced medicine in my own town for ten
         years I handed a collection of bones from a human foot, and on asking him to distinguish
         between them, he told me I was bringing in comparative anatomy; that they were not the
         bones of a human foot, but the bones of an animal. Such men are not competent to practice
         medicine. You should establish a higher qualification than is proposed either in the
         amendment or in the bill. Medicine is a little like that of which a poet spoke in regard to
         another matter; you must "drink deep or taste not the pierian spring." </p>
        <p>A State Board of Examiners is objected <pb n="164" xml:id="VAA8558-22-164"/> to, and with
         good reason, by some of the schools, on the ground that it will give a great preponderance
         to all the allopaths. Doctors who practice the homeopathic physiomedical or eclectic
         schools have as much right, they say, to be represented on the board as the old school I
         don't know that we had better do anything in this direction. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I desire to change my motion, that the bill and amendment be printed and made
         the special order for Tuesday at 10 o'clock</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: I second the motion. The Senator from Wayne states there is not requirement
         for qualification in this bill. When a man or woman presents a diploma obtained from a
         reputable medical college, by attending that college three, four or five years, studying
         day and night it ought to be some evidence that the individual has some qualification to
         practice medicine. The bill provides that any person, male or female, who has practiced ten
         years, and has attended one full course of medical lectures, may obtain a license It
         appears to me, under such requirement, there must be some qualification. Those who have
         practiced medicine for ten years and labored day and night to qualify themselves, and
         having the advantage of one course of lectures in some reputable medical college, I
         calculate they ought to have learned something and know something about the practice of
         medicine It may be in the county of Wayne some of the profession are so ignorant that they
         can't tell a human bone from that of a beast, but I don't think that is the case with the
         profession generally throughout the State of Indiana. i think we have a very intelligent
         profession throughout the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I have been very much astonished since this session of the Senate commenced
         at the number of letters from physicians, that both the Senators from Marion County have
         received, protesting against any law on this subject, but if any favoring the Senate bill.
         We have some eight or ten prominent physicians in this city protesting against any law. We
         are confused as to what we ought to do in the premises.</p>
        <p>The motion to postpone the further consideration of the bill and amendments and make it a
         special order for Tuesday next, at 10 o'clock, was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">SCHOOL FUND INTEREST.</head>
        <p>Mr. Huston's bill [S. 29 - see page 136] coming up on second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: No man would hesitate longer before advocating a measure to lessen the
         receipts of the school fund than I. The rate must be reduced eventually to 6 per cent. We
         are coming to it gradually, but we had better proceed with a sliding scale in the way
         indicated by this bill. The question is whether or not it is better for the General
         Assembly to lessen the rate of interest to 6 per cent, in counties where they find it
         impossible to loan this fund at 8 per cent, or whether interest on the entire fund shall be
         lessened to 6 per cent. That is the question we have to meet. About $240,000 a year goes
         into the State Treasury for the use of the school fund of the State. Now, it 90 per cent of
         that fund is loaned at 8 per cent., I submit if it would not be bad policy to lessen that
         rate of interest to 6 per cent., on the whole, simply to loan out the other 10 per cent.
         that now remains unloaned. Reducing the per cent. from 8 to 6 means just $60,000 lost to
         the school fund every year. There are counties in which, they say, they could loan three
         times as much as they have at 8 per cent., and there are other counties that find it
         impossible to laon what they have. I earnestly hope the relief to which they are entitled
         will be given by the passage of this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: It seems to me, in counties where there is no demand for this money the County
         Commissioners, with the Auditor ought to be permitted to loan it as a rate not less than 6
         per cent., and thus the counties would be compelled to make up to the State only the
         difference between what they receive and the 8 per cent. In the county I live you can
         borrow all the money you want for 7 per cent., and in the larger counties the rate is 6 per
         cent. This bill affects no other counties but those needing relief, and it seem sbut just
         that they should be allowed to loan money at the best rate they can get above 6 per cent,
         and make up the difference to the State It seems to me hardly necessary to take up much
         time in discussing this bill. It seems to me the merits should meet with such a general
         indorsement upon the part of Senators as to cause its immediate passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I move to strike out the word "eight" and insert in lieu the word "seven." I
         regarded it as bad legislation when the rate was changed from seven to eight. When the rate
         was 7 per cent. we heard no complaint that the people who needed this moeny was not atking
         it out of the Treasury. It is only since the rate was placed at 8 per cent. - an
         exhorbitant rate when you take it to consideration the expense necessary to obtain it -
         that complaint has been made Reduce the rate all over the State to 7 per cent. and it will
         avoid all difficultly and complaint in the future. It will only cut the rate one-eighth. I
         hope the amendment will be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I hope the amendment will not be adopted. It seems to me that to cut down
         the interest on the fund belonging to the school children of the State is the wrong place
         to begin. As regards the bill itself, all I have to say is the Committee on County and
         Township business considered it at two meetings, and the committee was unanimous against
         the passage of the bill. The author of the bill insisted he would like to have the bill
         returned with a minority report so he could have it considered in the Senate, and one of
         the committee presented a minority report to accomodate him.</p>
        <pb n="156" xml:id="VAA8558-22-165"/>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I think it would be bad policy to reduce the rate of interest on school
         moneys to 7 per cent. because I feel sure the money can be loaned in a majority of the
         counties at 8 per cent., and where it can it ought to loaned at that. It is not an
         exhorbitant rate, and there is no good reason why it should be reduced to seven.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I am decidedly in favor of the amendment. As I understand it the school
         money of the State is distributed to the several counties so that the citizens of each and
         every county might have equal chance to have the use of the money I think upon principle,
         even if the money can't be loaned in some counties, the State can't afford to say the
         citizens in one county may have the money at 6 per cent. and in another county exact 8 per
         cent. off of those who need the money. The General assembly in fixing the rate of interest
         either upon individual claims or on the school fund, should make it equal allover the
         State, and have no uncertainty about it. Let it go out that the citizens of Laporte County,
         or Union County, are getting the benefit of the public fund at 6 per cent, the citizens of
         Johnson County would say: " We should not pay more than the citizens of Laporte and Union".
         If they are so prosperous in one county that money won't command more than 6 per cent., you
         should not go to county less prosperous and exact 8 per cent All laws ought to be general.
         We might as well say the rate of interest in one county in individual transactions should
         be 6 and not 8. We must deal out fair and exact justice to all citizens. to all who have
         the privilege of borrowing school moneys, the rate of interest should be uniform. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: The citizens of Elkhart are sufficiently loyal to the interests of the
         children of the State to borrow all the moneys in the school fund they can get at 8 per
         cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: I decidedly favor the amendment offered by the Senator from Allen and Whitely
         (Mr. Brown), for this reason: I think it is not right and fair for the State of Indiana to
         compel the people to pay 8 per cent. interest, when we all know that it is notoriously too
         much Just because some of our citizens and neighbors happen to be poor, and because we have
         the power, we say to the County Auditors: "Go ahead and continue to ask 8 per cent, and the
         balance you can't loan at 8 place at 6" At this time 8 per cent is an outrageous high
         right. The Government is getting money at 3, and the State is offered money at 3 1/2, and
         why should we compel our citizens who may want money out of the school fund to pay 8 per
         cent? I think the amendment is right and proper. It is half way meeting our citizens, even
         if it does reduce the present rate 1 per cent. I claim to be as much in favor of schools as
         any man, but I say it is only right and just and proper to come down with the interest and
         keep up with the times. if we reduce the rate of interest, I venture all the money will be
         placed. Don't let us make fish of one of and flesh of another. </p>
        <p>Mr. HILL: I favor the amendment of the Senator from Allen and Whitley (Mr. Brown) because
         I think it will produce more money for the school fund than the present rate. The present
         is 8 per cent., and that is charged and taken in advance Then there are certain expenses
         attending the getting of this money, and after all these costs are paid the person who gets
         the money pays 9 and in some cases 10 per cent. If the rate of interest is reduced to 7 per
         cent. we will likely realize more than we do at 8, the present rate, and for that reason I
         propose to vote for the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to a bill which would require individuals to pay 6 or 7 per
         cent to the county and the county pay 8 per cent. to the State. That would be compelling
         the county pay 1 or 2 per cent. for nothing I don't think that part of legislation would be
         valid. It is only because of a clause in the Constitution that the county is required to
         pay interest to the State. The Constitution provides that the county shall take care of the
         principal. it is not a trustee for the purpose of loaning. If a law is enacted making the
         rate 6 per cent. and requiring the county to pay 8 per cent. to the State, then the 2 per
         cent difference is not interest at all; it is simply a taxation of 2 per cent. I am in
         favor of making the rate of interest uniform throughout the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I hope the amendment offered by the Senator from Whitley will not be adopted.
         It proposes to reduce the rate of interest on the school fund to 7 per cent throughout the
         State, and thus reduce the income just one-eighth. Now, there may be something in the
         constitutional question raised by the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCollough), but I am not
         able to agree with him. The county has to pay 8 per cent. to the State, and this iron-clad
         rule that they must loan it at 8 per cent., and not be allowed to loan it at something near
         8, simply takes out some County Treasurer $2000 a year, and yet the money lies idle. If the
         county only has to make up 1 or 2 per cent, I can see no reason why the county should not
         be better off. I think this bill ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I am opposed tot his bill because I can see how, under its provisions the
         Auditor and Commissioners of a county, when they are candidates for re-election, may favor
         every doubtful vote in the county with a loan of money from the school fund. They will loan
         to those persons who favor their candidacy at a lesser per cent., and the citizens of the
         whole county will be obliged to make up the difference, thus allowing candidates for
         re-election to have their campaign expenses paid by the citizens of the whole county. I
         rather favor the amendment of the Senator from Whitley, and yet I am not really ready to
         vote upon it. </p>
        <pb n="166" xml:id="VAA8558-22-166"/>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: This question involves too much to be considered hastily.
         This bill relates simply to the loan of school moneys in certain counties remaining
         unloaned. The amendment concerns the interest on five millions, in round numbers, and
         involves a question of so much much more importance than the bill, the whole subject should
         receive careful and deliberate attention. I move that the bill and amendments - </p>
        <p>Mr. WEIRD: Inasumuch as the question of the constitutionally of the bill has been raised,
         and inasmuch as that is a most important question, I ask the Senator of he will not move
         that the Judiciary Committee report as to its constitutionality.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: Certainly; send it to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to report
         on its constitutionality.</p>
        <p>It was so ordered.</p>
        <p>And the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to strike out the provision that each fish shall constitute a separate
         offense.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: In all prosecutions I have ever witnessed under the fish law which
         provides that the offender shall pay a fine of $5 for each fish caught, he can always
         compromise with the prosecution by pleading guilty to catching one fish, even though he may
         have caught a wagonload.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I desire the law shall be effective, and if the amendment will make it so I
         have no objection.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: My idea in offering the amendment was to make the bill more effective. Where
         the penalty is so extreme the law is apt to be a dead letter. i would favor increasing the
         penalty from $10 to $50, and even from $75 to $200 It is a question in my mind whether a
         provision declaring that each fish caught shall be deemed a separable offense and not be
         unconstitutional, for in point of fact it is not separate, but one act, and it would be
         punishing a man more than once for the same offense.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. BAILEY his bill [S. 20] to prohibit the working of children under
         fourteen years in mills or manufactories, was taken up with a committee amendment to strike
         fourteen and insert twelve in lieu. He moved to amend so the bill shall stand as originally
         introduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: we have a stave factory in our town employing about 100, many of whom are
         boys whose mothers are dependent upon them for support Many boys fourteen years of age are
         able to earn men's wages, and in many cases are getting the wages of men, and I take it the
         committee acted wisely in proposing to amend the bill by making its provisions apply to
         children under the age of twelve years.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: As this an important question and should not be decided without a quorum of
         the Senate present, I move it be postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I favor the amendment to the bill for the same reason stated by the gentleman
         from Huntington (Mr. Hilligass). In our county we have a large cotton factory which employs
         a large cotton factory which employs a large number of these boys - dozens of them -
         children of poor people, and boys fourteen years of age get good wages And some of them are
         employed around the coal mines. While it might be well enough to prevent children from
         overwork, I don't think boys fourteen years of age should be prevented from working in
         cotton mills and coal mines.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: My amendment proposes to restore the bill to its original provision -
         fourteen years instead of twelve - as provided in the committee amendment. I consider it my
         duty to bring up the question and let the Senate decide it. It seems to me there can be no
         doubt but that the children under that age, with the provisions we have for public schools,
         should not be employed in work detrimental to their health and which breaks down their
         constitutions. And then they supplant men with families to support, and prevent such heads
         of families from obtaining the wages which are paid to these children <pb n="168"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-168"/> at a time of life when the children ought to be in school. I
         advocate this change because I was elected upon a platform that has in it the following
         clause - the third plank in the Democratic State platform [Reads.] That is one of the
         things we promised to do, and I believe we ought to keep these promises. If we change the
         age from 14 to 12 the efficiency of the bill is greatly destroyed. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks: The Senator has given some reasons why he favors his bill, and
         he gave the very one which I was suspicious of when he introduced it I was a boy once
         myself. I know men sometimes get jealous of boys when about to supplant them in the
         workshops, factories, and other fields of labor, but I believe in giving the boys a chance
         I believe if the boy can do the work of a man, it is not right to allow men to procure
         legislation by which boys shall be excluded from doing that work, therefore I favor fixing
         the age at 12, if we legislate at all on the subject and not say by law that he shall not
         have a fair chance.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The Senator from Hendricks has made my speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I think there is a reason why children under the age of fourteen should not
         be permitted to work in manufactories and mines. The purpose, which seems to be a laudable
         one in this measure, is to develop the mind of these children. Although it may be a
         hardship in some cases to prohibit boys of such age from helping to earn the living for the
         family, yet we should legislate in this matter, not for the present, but for the future. It
         is the future of the boy we should consider. Ordinarily I am in favor of letting every man
         take care of his own rights. At the same time it is within the legitimate domain of law to
         establish the time which a boy should be in school and during that time he should not be
         permitted to work in such places.</p>
        <p>Mr. Magee: I think as little legislation as possible is the best. While I am in favor of
         the principle in the party platform, still I would like to vote for this bill with an
         amendment making a discrimination. I think it ought to be left somewhat to the discretion
         of the parent and to the child also. We ought not to make a cast iron rule which will deny
         all children this privilege In our city a great many boys obtain employment during school
         vacation, and many would like to do some little work rather than run on the commons In all
         mechanical trades the unions refuse to allow a man to employ only a given number of boys,
         and as years roll on we are losing that new element that should come into the several
         trades, and simply because the boys are denied this privilege. The ratio is so very small
         that in a few years the trade would run out if they were not imported from Europe or
         somewhere else.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: It seems to me there is a strong tendency to interfere with the rights of
         heads o families, and an attempt to regulate their children in this respect. There are a
         great many instances where a child 14 years old and perhaps 12, can earn a living and earn
         a competence. It strikes me we ought to be very careful how we undertake to interfere with
         the jurisdiction of the heads of families ever their won children If the purpose is to
         provide for their education and to say when they may be sent to school how much better it
         would be get up a bill for compulsory education It would be much better than to undertake
         to interfere with the control of parents over their children, under the pretense of keeping
         them from this or that employment in order that they may be sent to school. I think it is
         absolutely impossible to enact a law that will do justice to all concerned and prevent
         children of that age form being employed in the difference avocations of life.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I am opposed to the bill on general principles. I was a boy once myself,
         and I remember well when I worked for the pitiful sum of twenty cents a day to earn a
         living. I am for the boy first, last and all the time; and the whole theory of this bill in
         my judgment is wrong. I would rather vote for a bill to make the boys work and the men too.
         We have too many idle men and boys in my judgment.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I am opposed to the bill on general principles also. It proposes to legislate
         in a way I don't feel like sustaining.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I am opposed to the fourteen-year amendment, because a child ought to go to
         school until he is fourteen years of age, and if a law is passed that he shall keep out
         until he is fourteen, we have no law to put him in the school house. If we are to have a
         compulsory law in one way, we ought to have in the other. Another thing, it seems to me it
         is going too far toward interference in the family relation to say what a father shall have
         his child do and what he shall not have him do. Another thing, our country districts where
         the coal mines are located the schools are not in more than six months in length, and if we
         pass a law taking boys of fourteen years out of the coal mines and factories for xi months
         we have not sufficient amount of money in the school fund for the other half of the year.
         As the Senator from Ripley (Mr. Faulkner) says, I am opposed to i on general principles. I
         believe a boy should have a chance to make a dime or dollar whenever he can. And I think we
         ought to have laws to put them in school.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILARD: I believe every boy ought to have an opportunity to enjoy the facilities for
         education which Indiana gives in so large a degree. I don't believe, on general principles,
         that the bill is right when we have these means of education. But I am not one of those who
         believe a party should get into power upon certain pledges, and once in power disregard
         those pledges. Upon on question presented before this Senate I have yielded my person
         convictions because it was a matter in the party platform and that was as to the necessity
         of a Consti <pb n="169" xml:id="VAA8558-22-169"/> tutional Convention. The Democratic party
         declared against it, and although I conceive there is the greatest necessity for a
         convention I yielded my person idea. One of the promises it made to the workingmen for
         their votes, and upon which it obtained a large number of votes, was quoted by the Senator
         from Marion; that the Democratic party favors enactment of such laws as prohibit - prohibit
         - I call attention to that word - the employment - I call attention to that word - the
         employment of children under fourteen years of age in our manufactories, mines and
         workshops, and goes on state other matters it promises. I say now, no matter what party
         goes before the people and makes pledges of this kind, whether they be right or wrong (in
         this case I think it is right), ought not to come afterward, when it is in power by
         two-thirds, and refuse to fulfill that pledge. For that reason I am in favor of the
         amendment of the Senator from Marion.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: As has been said by several Senators, I am opposed, on general principles to
         this whole thing In most all cases, though there are exceptions, the test men are the
         results of industry in early life. If you want to spoil a boy put him in a situation where
         he won't be employed. I have to find the first ruined man who can point to early employment
         as the cause of his ruin. But many men reason of not having been employed when boys have
         gone to ruin. I appeal to Senators on the Democratic side if they feel that obligation in
         the Democratic platform was dictated by a consideration for the best interests of the boys.
         We know that is not the case. The purpose of that provision, I am sorry to say, was to
         prevent competition - to make more employment for full grown men by keeping employment from
         boys. It is pampering to men who have votes and can make themselves felt in party
         conventions to the detriment of boys who have no votes. </p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Hamilton, moved to amend so that the prohibition should be only during
         school term in the district in which such manufactories are situated He said: I am also in
         favor of giving the boys a chance. During the session of the public schools I believe the
         boys ought to be protected so they will have the benefit of the public schools; but when
         the public school is not in session the best thing to do with a boy is to put him to work,
         and with this idea I offer this amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I move that this bill and amendments be recommitted.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS (after dinner): I think we had better dispose of this question now, I am in
         favor of the bill as reported from the committee, placing the age at twelve. I think we owe
         a duty to ourselves and tot he laboring, as well as to the children of the State. Whatever
         may be said with reference to the position of political parties on this question, I think
         the honors are easy. I remember when the Senator from Wayne was elected to the Senate his
         party stood upon the same kind of a platform as we did at the last election. So on that
         score I think we have a very fair stand-off. I undertake to say the period allotted for the
         education of children is ample, from six to twelve years, and affords time for an average
         education. I think we would do a great injustice and wrong by cutting off a majority of the
         boys in this State from employment by the passage of the amendment. We ought not to
         undertake the parental care of children between twelve and fourteen years of age in
         reference to this matter. I don't think it our privilege to legislate these people out of
         employment. Boys ought to be educated to work as well as educated in mind. If we pass a law
         of this kind affecting children under the age of fourteen we will be encouraging idleness
         among that class which depend upon their labor for maintenance. As far as we can go with
         safety to ourselves is to pass a law prohibiting the employment in manufactories of
         children less than twelve years of age, hence the committee concluded we ought to so amend
         the bill. I hope the bill will be ordered engrossed as it came from the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: I have been somewhat surprised to learn from a number of Senators of their
         absolute disregard of the platform upon which they run and have been elected. But with
         reference to the merits of the bill, in view of the fact that we have in large cities - in
         this city from 5,000 to 8,000 men out of employment, and in whose places boys of twelve to
         fourteen years of age are placed, at wages from thirty to forty cents a day, there should
         be some legislation, viewing from that point, that would put them back in the schools and
         thus give opportunity for employment to men who need money for themselves and for their
         families. It has been said by the Senator from Ripley and others, that boys ought to be
         encouraged. I agree with that sentiment, but is it better to encourage boys to make money
         or rather encourage them to lay a good foundation for proper citizenship?</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS changed his motion: That the bill be referred to the Committee on Health and
         Vital Statistics.</p>

         from Vanderburg County, when the cost should not exceed $40, and declared this bill to be a
         proposition in the direction of economy. He deprecated the practice of <pb n="170"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-170"/> transporting insane women to and from the hospital in charge of
         male attendants Experience has thought those in charge of the insane that it is better to
         have the shackles stricken from the limbs of this class of unfortunates. The time has come
         when the humane policy proposed by this bill should be pursued In most cases insane women
         have no female friend desirous of accompanying them, except where they have the benefit of
         wealth or the influence of family name. The Superintendent of hospitals will select one
         trained and accustomed to the treatment of the insane, and he would not refuse the wishes
         of the friends at home. </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The theory of this bill is all wrong. The expense of transportation is
         taxed against the county, and the principle that would permit a State officer to make
         charge for such service as against the county is certainly wrong. Under the present law, a
         relative can now, by request, accompany the patient, and receive the prescribed fee. There
         is no use for such legislation as this. </p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: This is a subject that does not demand any legislation whatever He believed it
         simply for the purpose of increasing employes at the asylums of making several counties pay
         their transportation expenses. He moved to lay the bill and amendments on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, explaining his affirmative vote: I am heartily in sympathy with the
         principles of this bill, but like the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weird) I don't think there
         is any necessity for the legislation on this subject I think probably the present statute
         is sufficient, and would have no special objection to having a bill of this character
         passed. I am opposed to the second section, and without the amendment must vote against the
         whole bill. I shall vote "aye" at present.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER, in explanation of his vote said: I desire to have an opportunity to support
         the pending amendment; and am not prepared to say that the second section of the bill is
         not necessary and proper, therefore I vote "no."</p>

           <p>The undersigned, Trustees of the Morton Monumental Association, beg leave to say that,
            soon after the death of the late Oliver P. Morton, an effort was set on foot to raise
            funds with which to erect a monument to his memory, and an association was formed for
            that purpose. The association subsequently determined that the structure to be erected
            should consist of a statue of Governor Morton to be placed in some public pace in the
            city of Indianapolis in January, 1884, a bronze statue was completed and erected int he
            Governor's Circle, in the city of Indianapolis, where it now is. The cost of the
            structure was between $13,000 and $14,000 and has been paid for mainly out of voluntary
            contributions of the people of this State. Acting on behalf of the contributors of the
            fund, we desire to present, and do hereby present, the statue to the State of Indiana,
            and ask that it may be accepted by the General Assembly of the State, now in session, as
            the property of the State, and that such protection may be given to the structure as is
            accorded to other public property. Trusting that your Excellency will transmit this
            communication, or copies thereof, to the General Assembly, with such recommendation in

        <head rend="center">BALLOT-BOX PROTECTION.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. Campbell, of Hendricks, his bill [S.4] to procure fair elections was
         taken up and read the second time. He asid: Experience has taught us that the present law
         will not be enforced because of the extreme punishment provided. There is no subject upon
         which there is more need of legislation, and legislation of a kind that can be enforced. It
         has been said that the Republican party bought the State in 1880. Whether that be true or
         not the Democratic party have the State now, and you don't want us to buy it back. I hope
         to live to see the day when an election can be held that is reasonably fair and free from
         corruption. It is admitted that ten per centum of the voters of the State absolutely out
         their votes on the market; that they sit in groups till late in the evening of election
         day, waiting for the highest bidder. I say such a class ought to be disfranchised, and I
         believe the men who tempt them by offering them oney are also guilty of crime. I hope this
         bill will be passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: There ought to be some way to prevent frauds upon the ballot-box. I believe
         this purchasable commodity that the Democratic party has had to wrestle with for many years
         is the result of the policy provided by the party of which the <pb n="171"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-171"/> Senator from Hendricks is a member. I am in favor of some of the
         provisions of the bill. I think a man who sells his vote is a dangerous element in the
         commonwealth, and he ought to be disfranchised because he has ceased to be a free, upright
         and honorable man. I would have the Trustee or Sheriff, or some officer charged with the
         duty of the posting up copies of this bill, printed in large type, in every voting
         precinct. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I am heartily in favor of the bill, but am afraid the question of
         disfranchisement goes too far. I think there will be no great danger of doing injustice to
         anyone. I offer an amendment to fix a minimum sum for the fine - not less than $10, and
         strike out the natural life disfranchisement and insert in lieu, "any determinate
         period."</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, moved to amend so as to include the Superintendent of Public
         Instruction. He said: I see no propriety in making an exception to the office of State

        <p>Mr. Moody's bill [H. R. 211] for the regulation of weights and measures, coming up on the
         second reading, with a committee report recommending its indefinite postponement - </p>
        <p>Mr MOODY: I trust the report of the committee will not be concurred in by the House. I
         feel that the committee have not carefully considered the change sought by this bill or
         they would have recommended its passage. The Legislature of 1881 changed the standard
         weight of a bushel of oats in the State of Indiana from thirty two or thirty-three pounds.
         The bill originated in the Senate, and as many supposed the only change the bill of 1881
         made in the law was fixing the standard weight of a gallon of sorghum molasses, the bill
         crept through both branches of the Legislature, aided s it was by the grain dealers of the
         State.</p>
        <p>This may seem to gentlemen a small matter, but I want to say in all candor no law enacted
         by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana in the last fifty years has caused so much
         dissatisfaction as the enactment of the law of 1881, changing the weight of a bushel of
         oats. All the great grain-growing states of the North and the West give and take 32 pounds
         to the bushel. Vermont, 32; Massachusetts, 32; New York, 32; Oh, 32; Michigan, 32;
         Illinois, 32; Wisconsin, 32; Minnesota, 32; Missouri, 32; Kansas, 32; California, 32; and
         Indiana standing alone, by reason of the acts of the Legislature of 1881, compelling her
         farmers to sell 33 pounds of their oats for a bushel.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I have nothing to say on this subject except in confirmation of what the
         gentleman from DeKalb (Mr. Moody) has said. Why, the whole State, more or less, asks for
         the repeal of that law. Ever since the passage of the law in 1881 it has been continual
         source of annoyance to farmers and shippers.</p>
        <p>The House refused to concur in the report of the committee, and the bill was ordered
         engrossed.</p>

        <head>CONSOLIDATION OF VOTING PRECINCTS</head>
        <p>Mr. Hopkins' bill [H. R. 270] coming up on the second reading with a committee
         amendmendment to make the voting district to be composed of 500 instead of 750 voters - </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE said: I hope this amendment of the committee will not be adopted. Where there
         are more than 300 voters this bill provides that a consolidation may take place, so that a
         precinct may contain 750 voters. It is not imperative. The County Commissioners may
         consolidates as they deem best. It simply permits them to consolidate so that there may be
         750 voters in a precinct, and to amend it and change it to 500 would hardly better the
         condition of things, while 750 would. Now in the county I live we have 25 precincts, and we
         have 500 electors in each precinct, and there are no large towns. Election comes late in
         the fall - in Novem <pb n="172" xml:id="VAA8558-22-172"/> ber - and the weather is liable
         to be inclement There is no place for the people to assemble on election day to keep
         comfortable. There is no provision made by anybody by which they can obtain refreshments
         and the result is that persons come and vote and go away. If there were 750 voters in a
         precinct, it would greatly lessen the expense and furnish additional security I think the
         amendment ought not to be adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I am opposed to the amendment. I hope the amendment will be defeated as
         well as the bill. I think the law of 1881, in this respect, is the best law Indiana ever
         had. You can get a fairer and fuller vote, because under the present law there is less
         opportunity to tamper with the returns. If you have a precinct so large it takes
         twenty-four, thirty-sex or forty-eight hours to count the votes and the men will become
         weary and tired for want of refreshment and sleep, while it gives more opportunity to
         tamper with the votes. For that reason I think the law of 1881 is the best law we ever had
         on our statute books. I hope the bill will be amended if it becomes a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Now, since the law was enacted in 1881, we have changed the
         time of elections from the 1st of October to the 1st of November, making the time from
         sunrise to sunset, nearly forty minutes shorter. Some have proposed opening the polls at 6
         o'clock in the morning I am opposed to that. I am in favor of opening the polls as soon as
         it is light - as soon as citizens can get together. I am in favor of giving the laboring
         men in large cities a chance to exercise the right of suffrage. Now if you would change the
         law so as to make 750 voters in a precinct, a great many perhaps would have to go away
         without exercising the right of suffrage. The right of suffrage is the dearest right a man
         can have I am in favor of protecting the people and giving them an opportunity to cast
         their votes and have them counted. I shall stand by the present election law in Indiana
         because I believe it is the best law. If we change it this session it will be an invitation
         to the next Legislature to make a change. I am opposed to the amendment and I am opposed
         tot he bill before us, and I shall vote against both of them. </p>
        <p>The House refused to concur in the committee amendment and also refused to order the bill

        <p>The Senate resumed consideration of the bill [S. 4] to prevent the purchase and sale of
         votes, pending at the adjournment yesterday.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE, an amendment was adopted requiring the posting of printed copies
         of the act on the morning of each election day at each voting place.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE COLOR LINE.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. THOMPSON, his Civil Rights bill [S. 43] was read the second time. He
         said this bill was passed by Congress, but set aside by the Supreme Court of the United
         States upon the ground that it was the duty of the several States to pass it if they chose;
         and it had already been passed by many of the States.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I believe the common intelligence of the people will regulate these
         matters without placing on the statute book any such a bill. And I don't think any bill
         ought to pass creating a misdemeanor to which is attached an emergency clause.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I wish to move to add an additional section tot he bill, in order to make it
         more effective, as follows:</p>
        <p>That all distinctions of race or color are hereby abolished, and whenever by the laws of
         this State any rights, privileges, capacities or immunities are granted to persons of any
         race or color, such rights privileges and capacities shall, under the same circumstances,
         be granted to persons of any other race and color.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved to add to this amendment a proviso that this act shall
         not apply to the laws on the subject or marriage.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't pretend to be the special friend of any particular class of persons of
         whatever race or color, but I am in sympathy to a certain degree with this bill. I am not
         in favor of constable enactments- of passing a law and putting a constable behind that law
         to enforce it. I believe in the colored man having every right that I have, and I think he
         has them now under the present law. Suppose we were to pass a bill that the rights of white
         people under the law should be enforced, would t amount to anything? The question is
         whether or not such a law as this would not excite unnecessary prejudice against the
         colored man? I am opposed to the amendment, and I think as much as we can do if we have to
         pass any act of this kind will be to pass the bill as originally introduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: i am not only opposed to the amendment, but I am opposed to the bill.
         The enactment of any law which will single out any class in the State, white or black,
         should not be a principle that actuates a Legislature. In reference to the colored race I
         am as friendly to them as I am to any, but I don't believe this Legislature should
         undertake to legislature it higher than its place socially. I don't believe it right to
         undertake to legislate one above another. The bill proposes to place a colored man above a
         white man. His rights are just the same as yours and mine now, and this bill proposes to
         give him additional rights which you and I do not enjoy. That was the principle upon which
         the Supreme Court of the United States rested its decisions. I believe it stated that they
         were enjoying all the rights referred to in the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Didn't the decision to say that under the amendments to the Constitution the
         colored man was a full fledged citizen, and that it was not competent to say he <pb n="174"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-174"/> should enjoy those rights by force of enactment, because he
         enjoyed them any how as a citizen? </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: I believe that is so. And there are provisions in this bill which are contrary
         to the provisions of free institutions. I offer the following as a substitute for the
         amendment: "Strike out the enacting clause."</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The first section of this bill re-enacts, in effect, the privileges now
         granted to every race and condition of mankind in Indiana, and to that there can be no
         objection. I'm opposed to the second section; for I am opposed putting it in the power of
         any individual, either white or black, to enter any public pace, without reference to his
         condition, and without reference to the ability of the party to accommodate him, and after
         being denied accommodation, to have the right to sue and obtain judgment of $100 damages
         and prosecute criminally It is granting a special privilege not only to one class but to
         all classes. It is giving rights they ought not to have under statute laws. I am opposed
         giving that right to white, black or any other race or color. This Legislature would be
         going beyond its duty to grant a dead-beat, no matter what his color, the privilege to sue
         under such circumstances. It is a vicious provision, and I am opposed to it. As to the
         third section, who is to determine when an officer has purposely failed to summon any
         citizen to sit as a juror? Am I to determine that the officer has passed me by and go into
         court and prosecute him criminally for passing me by? I am not in favor of excluding men on
         account of race or color from serving as jurymen, but I am opposed to that provision which
         will empower him to say, "I have been passed by, and the officer must be imprisoned for
         that offense." A more vicious provision was never proposed. I am opposed to the entire bill
         and hope to see it voted down </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: There is no question which has come before this Senate, nor any which can
         come before this General Assembly, in which I feel a deeper interest than this bill which
         has been introduced by the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Thompson), I am glad to see him place
         himself in this position. He seems to be the almost solitary instance, among the friends of
         his party, to advocate the ideas advanced by the Republican party for lo these many
         years.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Didn't a Republican Supreme Court of the United States hold this very
         bill to be unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: As a matter of law. But the Republican party has ever been, and still is, in
         favor of the principles of the bill. I would ask the Senator whether sitting upon the bench
         as a judge of a matter which, in his judgment, contravened the Constitution of the United
         States - whether he would not declare it unconstitutional?</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: Certainly; but I would not come to the Legislature and advocate the same bill
         that I hold unconstitutional as a matter of law.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: If held unconstitutional as a matter of law, because it was a proper subject
         for State legislation. I would advocate it in the very place in which it is unquestionably
         lawful legislation. This law would not impugn the provisions of the United States or the
         State Constitution. Sir, my own feelings for many years have been the same as that which I
         am declaring upon this floor. I am the son of an old time Abolitionist. My father's house
         was one of the stations on the underground railway. The Senator from Cass talks about being
         a philanthropist. This is not a question of philanthropy. It is a question of right.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I am confidence every Senator on the floor knows exactly ow he will vote on
         this question I have withdrawn the motion once I do not believe in occupying any further
         time, and I now again move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the substitute (Mr. Smith's) was
         rejected by yeas 6, nays 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, explaining: We have laws on the subject of marriage which forbid parties to
         marry within certain degrees of relationship, and which forbid marriage within certain
         ages, and this amendment shoudl be incorporated in this bill. I vote "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, when his name was called: I am opposed to the amendment and favor the
         original bill It is substantially the old Civil Rights bill which passed Congress and has
         been passed in the States of Ohio and New York. I believe under existing circumstances, for
         many reasons, such a bill ought to be passed by the Legislature of Indiana this year. I
         therefore vote against the amendment. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I desire to say a word in explanation of my vote. I believe the
         amendment of the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) would be absolutely obnoxious to the
         people, and no Senator could go home and justify his vote in its favor. I am in favor of
         the amendment of the Senator from Hendricks. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I have been exceedingly anxious for the passage of this bill. Senators have
         declared upon this floor that the colored man is entitled to all the rights and privileges
         of the white man, and I don't see what harm there is in ingrafting that into a law. We know
         a prejudice against the colored man is seen every day. I would <pb n="175"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-175"/> like to speak further on this subject but will not detain the
         Senate. I am a philanthropist. I believe in God Almighty wherever I see him in the face of
         a human being. I am afraid of endangering this bill, which I would not endanger under any
         consideration, and so I have to vote against these amendments, not because they contain
         sentiments which find no response in my own heart. I vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I have not had the pleasure of the acquaintance of any white lady who
         desires to marry a negro gentleman, but if there are any such in the State of Indiana I
         believe in giving them that privilege. I vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I desire to say in explanation of my vote that I can not reconcile my
         conscience to cast any vote that will be directly indirectly in favor of establishing or
         upholding any discrimination against any man on account of color or race, therefore I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I am in favor of the bill as originally introduced. I am in favor also of the
         amendment offered by the Senator from Wayne with the restriction proposed to be placed upon
         it by the Senator from Hendricks. I believe the colored man should have all the rights
         under the law that the white man has. I believe it is our duty when we find a distinction
         imposed by Jehovah himself we should conform our human enactments in accordance with divine
         law. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Foulke's) was also rejected by yeas 11, nays 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, explaining: I would be pleased to vote for the amendment if
         it had been amended as I proposed, but in its present shape I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, in explanation of his vote, said: I am in favor of this bill, as originally
         introduced without an amendment. If the amendment should prevail I certainly shall vote
         against the whole bill. In view of that fact I vote "no"</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOULKE the constitutional rule was dispensed with - yeas, 34; nays, 6 -
         and the bill read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I desire to explain my vote. I don't believe this bill will grant to the
         colored man any right he does not now enjoy under the law. It is therefore useless and
         needless legislation, and in a sense, vicious legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, when his name was called, said: I have persistently voted against
         this bill at every step. I am one of those who in past life have never interposed a barrier
         to the advancement of the colored man, and in my future life I shall never do so. I do not
         believe in that character of legislation which does no good. This bill can bring no good to
         the colored man. It is needless legislation, and in the language of the Senator from White,
         needless legislation is a kind of vicious legislation. Therefore I vote against the bill, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <head rend="center">APPELLATE COURT.</head>
        <p>Mr. Weir's bill [S. 45] for the creation of an Appellate Court, being read the second
         time, Mr. W. Said: There is a generally conceded necessity for some measure of this kind
         for the relief of the Supreme Court. The Governor in his inaugural message called the
         attention of the Legislature to this fact. The first thing to be considered in regard to a
         measure introduced in the Senate is. Is there a demand for it? If so, it should receive
         favorable consideration. If not, it certainly should not. The term of office of the
         Commissioners of the Supreme Court expires some time in the month of April, and what is
         done should be done in as short length of time as possible. I, therefore move that the bill
         be engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This bill is not what he would desire to see. Such a court should hold its
         sessions at other points than in this city. He moved to amend so that the argument before
         this court shall be upon written or printed briefs unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
        <p>MR OVERSTREET opposed the amendment Such a court is needed, but there should be no haste
         in passing this bill. He favored the idea of oral argument. The advantage in an oral
         argument is that you can get the ear of all the Judges.</p>
        <p>MR. McCULLOUGH was not able to agree with a majority of the committee in recommending the
         passage of this bill. He thought there ought to be more than one such court, and they ought
         to sit in different districts throughout the State. Then the court should permit oral
         argument. He would oppose but one court to sit in Indianapolis; such legislation would be
         unpopular and such court would be unpopular and such court would do great injustice to
         citizens of the State - the proposition being not to publish the decisions He moved to
         recommit the bill with instructions to amend for three courts of three judges each to sit
         in different portions of the State. It will be impossible for one Appellate Court to do the
         business of this State. The taxpayers are compelled to pay the tax by which these courts
         are sustained The Appellate Court should have concurrent jurisdiction in all amounts, and a
         man not satisfied with the decision of the Appellate Court can pay an additional expense
         and take his case to the Supreme Court </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, favored testing the sense of the Senate before recommitting
         the bill, in as much as it was thoroughly discussed in the committee. He moved to amend the
         motion by instructing <pb n="176" xml:id="VAA8558-22-176"/> the committee to incorporate an
         amendment for a term of eight weeks in each district every year, by a court of five judges. </p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH suggested a danger in the amendment; If one court be required to travel
         over the State and sit in five different districts, the business could not help but get
         seriously behind.</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jay, opposed the bill on general principles. If one or two barriers were
         removed the Supreme Court could catch up with the business on the docket within one year.
         It was not nearly up with all submitted cases. If that be true, where is the necessity for
         the creation of an Appellate Court?</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas 28, nays 11.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR, explaining his vote: I feel anxious that some bill of this kind should pass,
         and that we should agree upon some measure of relief, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I wish to explain my vote. I don't believe a perambulating court will give
         satisfaction at all. I prefer the arrangement proposed by the Senator from Gibson (Mr.
         McCullough) if we must choose between a perambulating court and more than due court. I will
         vote against this amendment. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>The amendment as amended was greed to, and so the bill was re-committed.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE MILITIA.</head>
        <p>Mr. Howard's bill [S. 83] for the organization of the State militia, a special order was
         read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill provides for an organization of a State militia, to be composed
         of some 4,500 men. Under the law of Congress there has been appropriated some $200,000 to
         be apportioned among the States according to the enrollment, and for the encouragement of
         the militia. As the law now stands there is no militia in this State that can be compelled
         to serve or, indeed, compelled to obey any orders of their commanders. This bill
         appropriates $20,000, provided the Governor calls out the militia for a general muster and
         drill. Some $7500 worth of arms and munitions were received last year from the General
         Government, but under this bill that amount would perhaps be quadrupled. The State of
         Indiana, with her militia organization, probably stands at the foot of every State. We have
         but thirty-eight sections of artillery. It is the duty of the Legislature to pass this
         bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. WEST: The bill grants too much power to Mayors and other civil officers named in the
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, moved to strike out the section which appropriates $20,000 a year
         and its distribution.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: If that is stricken out it would leave the militia not much better off
         financially than it is now. The condition of the social order is such that a well
         disciplined militia might become not only the glory but the safety of the State. The
         military branch of the State Government has always been neglected. The entire number of men
         enrolled is only about 2,000, scattered all over the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON was in full accord with the Senator who just spoke. If the amendment be
         agreed to he should vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: If the amendment is agreed to the efficiency of the bill would be
         destroyed. He moved to amend so as to make the $12 appropriation run through the three
         years instead of being an annual appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, hoped the bill would pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, would not make any petty opposition to the bill. He would support
         the bill without an appropriation; but we are making too many appropriations. Hard times
         are spreading all over this State, as well as other States. This appropriation is to be
         made for the purpose of the organization of 4,500 militia. Nine times out of then militia
         companies are organized for the sole purpose of parade, and dress parade at that. This bill
         was defeated in the House because of the very section the pending amendment proposes to
         strike out, </p>

        <p>Mr. FRENCH said: I think the requirements of this bill are too severe and the penalty too

         <p>Mr. Ely's bill [H. R. 107] coming up on the second reading, he said: The bill is to
          equalize the pay of coroners The law now authorizes Coroners in but four counties to
          charge $10 for the first day and $2.50 for each subsequent day. In the other counties it
          allows $4 for the first day and $250 for each subsequent day. This bill allows all over
          the State alike $6 for the first day and $2 50 for each subsequent day.</p>
         <p>This bill, the gentleman says, is too equalize the pay of Coroners Now, the bill
          provides for the cutting down of the pay of Coroners in four of the counties, but it
          increases the pay of every Coroner in eighty-eight counties. It seems to me when you take
          the two together you would have to vote to increase the pay of eighty eight officers in
          the State and only decrease the pay of four.</p>
         <p>Mr. BROWNING: I think there is good reason why the bill should be defeated. In counties
          like Marion it just requires enough of a man's time to keep him from doing other work. The
          bill decreases the pay in four counties and increases it in all the rest. I am in favor of
          retrenchment and economy. I will therefore vote against the bill. It does not commend
          itself to me.</p>

          costs. He thought this was wrong, as the State is able to able to pay costs as any of her

          fund. Mr. Reeves defended the measure, saying that the law requiring the Attorney General
          to pay costs when acting as relator for the State, naturally prevented him from bringing
          suits except in such cases where there is absolutely no doubt. The bill was defeated.</p>

         <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe, said: Indiana does not produce money. She raises cattle, corn
          and wheat, which she exchanges for money. Other States furnish money. Money seeks a
          financial level the same as water seeks a level. For, notwithstanding money in Ohio,
          Michigan, Illinois and Kentucky is higher than it is in the State of Indiana, money will
          flow into the other States unless is a redundancy. I do not think we ought to attempt to
          place any restrictions upon the price of money.</p>
         <p>Mr. GOODING: I am in favor of this bill, It provides for 6 per cent, and n agreement for
          a higher rate would be valid unless the same be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged thereby. I think this House intends to have a clean-cut bill for 6 per cent. and
          no more, whether in writing or not. I understand that this House is representing the
          people, and is in favor of 6 per cent. and no more. I will vote for the bill. </p>
         <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: I think I would not do my duty if I did not make a statement for my
          people. I never loan money, but always borrow, and a great many of my constituents are in
          the same condition. I undertake to say that in one county I know of there was a loan
          association that received as high as fifty applications to borrow money of Easter
          companies, and contracted at 8 per cent. interest, and could not get it. I think as much
          of my people as anybody, but the fact is that Wells County has mortgages plastered all
          over lands - mortgages that will soon be due and calling for 8 per cent. interest and
          attorneys" fees. When the time comes to pay off these mortgages were are you going to get
          the money? We can not better the 9 per cent. law. Give us 6 per cent. and we can' get it
          at all. If you prohibit us paying 8 per cent. we can not get it. These are hard imes. I
          think it is entirely wrong to prohibit men from making contracts for a higher rate of
          interest if they want to do it. </p>

        <p>Mr. Campbell's of Hendricks bill to prevent the purchase and sale of votes [see page - of
         these reports] was read a third time and passed by yeas 38, nays 6.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH saying: I expect to vote for the bill thought it is not just the kind of
         bill I should like. I would rather the penalty were affixed against the purchaser
         votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, when his name was called, said: Is hall nto vote for this bill for two
         reasons; one is, it proposes to punish the man who sells a vote and does not punish the one
         that buys Another objection is, the bill allows a bonus to a person who will testify
         against a neighbor by letting him go scot free. I vote 'no.".</p>
        <p>The result was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell's of St. Joseph, plats of additions to towns bill [S 5] was read the third
         time and passed by yeas 38: nays 2. Mr. C., explaining: Its object is simply to require
         that before plats of towns are placed upon record, such plats shall be submitted to the
         Council of the city or Trustees of the town, and they may require that the streets therein
         shall be made co-terminous to the streets in the city or town which the plat joins.</p>

        <p>Mr Davis' bill [S. 57] was read the third time and passed by yeas 44 nays 0. Mr. D
         explaining: It leaves it discretionary with towns of less than 10,000 to appoint a

         read the third time and passed by yeas 40 nays 2. Mr. Macy, explaining: The bill has been
         so amended that it is not as originally introduced I don't think it ought to be considered
         now as my bill There is a law which provides for the appointment of shorthand reporters in
         the courts, and that he shall be paid out of the county treasury which I think is wrong,
         but as this fixes the maximum amount to be paid, which is less than the law now gives, I
         shall vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH'S bill [S. 67] was read the third time and passed by yeas 43 nays 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH explaining: Its provisions are that in cities less than 70 000 where the
         office of City Treasurer has been abolished the Council may impose the duty of collecting
         city taxes upon the Treasurer of the county. And it provides the tax may be paid in

         <head rend="center">A NEW JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.</head>
         <p>Mr. Smith's, of Delaware, bill [S 74] to create a new judicial circuit by making the
          County of Randolph the twenty fifth and the County of Delaware the forty-sixth judicial
          circuit was read the third time. Mr. Smith stated that the previous Judge left the bench
          three years behind. The present Judge is one of the most industrious beginning his daily
          sessions, even in the winter time at 8 o'clock, continuing until 5 o'clock, and sometimes
          at night, and even with that kind of work the docket can not be kept clear. The bill is an
          imperative necessity, and receives the commendation of the entire bar.</p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER opposed the passage of the bill at this session. The population of the two
          counties would not seem to justify court in each. There is a great inequality in the
          judicial circuits of the State, and by the next session there may be some plan for
          equalizing this matter.</p>
         <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: There are circuits that are a disgrace to the legislation of the State.
          One in the southern part of the State has not enough business to keep the Judge in
          practice. Better have a little too large a circuit than one too small. You can never get
          rid of a Judge - at least for the term of six years.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH: One of these counties shows an average of 1,900 and the other 2,100
          cases.</p>
         <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: There is a very broad latitude as to what constitutes a case, when they
          are counted for one purpose or for another.</p>
         <p>Mr. MACY read some statistics to show the necessity of the passage of the bill.</p>
         <p>Mr. DAVIS knew no other way of determining the necessity for judicial circuits than to
          consider the voting population and the wealth of the proposed districts. He also submitted
          figures, and by comparison found a number of other districts were in excess of the
          counties of Delaware and Randolph, and came to the conclusion there was not a necessity
          warranting the extra expense proposed by this bill. </p>
         <p>Mr. BROWN is informed by worthy citizens of Randolph County there is no urgent necessity
          for the passage of the bill. </p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE did not believe a Judge in the Second goes through the same amount of work as
          the Judge of the Twenty-fifth District. The cases are rattled through too fast and thus it
          is not possible to administer justice in the way it ought to be administered. There is a
          large amount of litigation in proportion to the population in those two counties. Under
          the circumstances an additional Judge should be allowed.</p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, favored the passage of the bill. In the opinion of the Judge, the
          work in that district is too for one man to do. </p>
         <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: When Senators representing a district agree, he should vote
          in accord with their wishes.</p>
         <p>Mr. WEIR opposed the passage of the bill, believing it not demanded by public interest.
          If there were a reasonable necessity he should vote for a new Circuit, but it is time the
          creation of new Circuits in the State should stop.</p>
         <p>Mr. HILLIGASS had as much means of knowing the wishes of the people in Delaware County
          as any Senator except the Senator from Delaware. It is the earnest wish of the
          representative and businessmen of that county that a new Circuit should be created for
          them. The question is as to the business and the demands of the people. If the court
          business can not be transacted, the people should have relief. </p>
         <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware, was astonished at the objections said to come form the counties
          of Delaware and Randolph. He had never heard the slightest objection coming from those
          counties. There is no evidence so good as to the needs of a Circuit as the statement of
          the people themselves. The wants and demands of that people are not met and not be under
          the present arrangement. This is not a numerical question. The people are demanding what
          is their privilege under the Constitution, that justice shall be meted out to them
          speedily and without delay.</p>
         <p>The bill passed by yeas 27, nays 18.</p>
         <p>Mr. Weir's bill [S. 76] to exempt State officers ex rel. from liability for costs was

         <head rend="center">PRIVILEGES TO INCORPORATORS.</head>
         <p>Mr. Winter's bill [S. 96] to authorize manufacturing corporations to buy and sell
          certain kinds of goods, not of their own manufacture, was read the third time.</p>
         <p>Mr. WINTER: The bill provides that any manufacturing or mining company may buy and sell
          goods of the same character or appertaining to the same kidn as they are manufacturing.
          And it requires the word "limited" or "incorporated" to be added to <pb n="180"
           xml:id="VAA8558-22-180"/> the name of corporation taking advantage of this act, so any
          person doing business with it may know its responsibility. </p>
         <p>Mr. FOULKE: It is my impression and strong conviction that we have gone a little too far
          in conferring franchise and powers upon corporations in this State. They have done of
          great deal of good - led to the concentration of a vast amount of wealth, and have
          materially advanced the material progress of the State. At the same time there are other
          tendencies they have developed, which, it seems to me, threatens a greater injury than the
          good they have accomplished. A man will invest to a greater extent in a corporation where
          he has but little liability, where he would not risk his entire capital and credit in a
          partnership. These corporations are used to develop industries. Industries develop faster
          this that way. Where they are able to divide labor they can manufacture and sell cheaper
          and do everything cheaper than upon a smaller scale. And the necessary result is that the
          smaller dealer, doing business of the same character, is crowded out. These corporations
          can manufacture cheaper, and the small dealer can not afford to do business on the same
          terms. The result is the man who is doing a small business near the large corporations is
          being gradually crowded out and is eventually obliged to take a position with the larger
          corporation next door. While a thing of that kind contributes to the wealth of a
          community, its general effect upon society is injurious. As the Senator from Jennings (Mr
          Smith) said some days ago, "the homes of the poor - the independent homes of men doing
          business on their own account - is the safeguard of the Nation in times of war and her
          glory in times of peace." The man who works independently though not able to do so much,
          yet he preserves his independency. The corporate system tends to make the rich richer and
          the poor poorer. In view of that fact, we have gone far enough, if not too far, in
          granting corporate powers. Under this bill a general manufacturing company can carry on a
          general business in any goods they manufacture. They can carry on commercial business in
          almost every department. They are entering the lines of commerce as they did in
          manufacturing. If a man wants to go into the dry goods business it is not too hard a
          penalty to say he shall be liable to the last dollar on any contract he makes by which he
          expects to profit. I believe individual rights will be benefited if we stop right here in
          giving powers to corporations.</p>
         <p>Mr. WINTER: What the Senator has said would be a good argument against corporations
          generally. Corporations are a great id in developing the commerce of the State and
          country. It has been the policy of the State to enlarge and extent this class of
          legislation. There has scarcely been a session of our Legislature since the present
          Constitution was adopted but that this statute for the promotion of manufacturing and
          mining companies has not been extended so as to encourage incorporations and extend the
          benefits of the act to different branches. I am not prepared to say, although the
          Senator's argument is very seductive, that we have all been mistaken for thirty years, and
          we ought now to prevent the formation of any more incorporations in this State. It is easy
          to say that corporations have a tendency to aggregate capital and oppress the poor man.
          That is an argument I didn't look for from the Senator from Wayne; such an argument would
          be expected from the Senator from Jenning (Mr. Smith). There is no man upon the floor of
          the Senate more in sympathy with the poor man than I. There are a great many case in which
          it is necessary for the carrying on of a manufacturing business that there should be added
          to it something that is not manufactured by the company. They can't dispose of their goods
          to advantage unless they have other articles of a general character. and not the precise
          character they manufacture But it would not be right to allow them to become a dealer
          generally in all kinds of merchandise, and that is not the object of the bill at all. It
          restricts them to the same character and the same line of goods, and I don't see that
          there is any great danger in that. I don't see how that would have a tendency to oppress
          and crush out the poor man. </p>
         <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: As far as my observation goes, and I have had a great deal
          of observation in this line. I apprehend the bill goes but little farther than to legalize
          that which is constantly in practice now. And my observation of incorporations is that
          they are in the interest of the poor. A young man who has a trade and some article to
          manufacture but lacking the funds with which to push it because a corporation can be
          formed, he gets assistance and capital and thereby goes on and grows with the business to
          a wealthy corporation which employs many men. I believe it is right that this bill should
          pass.</p>

          act passed two years ago, found on page 113 of the acts of the last General Assemby,
          entitled "An Act to Legalize Certain Records," but in fact it did noting of the kind. I am
          told by lawyers that the bill is unconstitutional. I know it is wrong in principle and not
          worthy a place on the statute book of Indiana and I don't suppose anything further is
          necessary to be said to induce the repealing of this act. I think the object of this act
          which this bill proposes to repeal; in fact I am sure it was, to pay the Recorder of
          Marion County twenty cents per 100 words for copying general indexes which the law
          requires him to keep up any how. The Recorders of smaller counties have to do it. </p>

         <head rend="center">COUNTY CLERKS' PER DIEM.</head>
         <p>Mr. Youche's bill [S. 117] being read the second time - </p>
         <p>Mr. YOUCHE said: The object of this bill is to repeal the proviso to Section 7, Acts of
          1883, page 49, which gives to County Clerks the sum of $2 a day for attending Court Before
          the act of 1882 Clerks received no pay out of the County Treasury for attending the
          Circuit Court. It was supposed that his fees furnished sufficient compensation. When this
          act was introduced in the Senate last session there was no proviso in the bill. When it
          came back here from the House it seems there was a proviso in it, but it came back on one
          of those closing days, when bills are passed hurriedly. The proviso in the bill was not
          read. I listened to the reading attentively, and I don't believe there were there members
          of the Senate who knew they passed a law raising the Clerks' fees $2 a day. It amounts to
          the sum of $25,000 every paid out of the County Treasuries to the Clerks. This bill is to
          restore the law as it was before 1883. I think there can not be any well-grounded
          opposition to it. </p>
         <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If there is any reason why the Clerk of the Superior and Criminal Court
          is entitled to $2, it would apply to the Clerk of the Circuit Court. We are told that in
          counties where there is Superior and Criminal Courts, the Clerk has to hire a deputy to
          attend those courts. But that deputy performs similar work that the Clerk of the Circuit
          Court does, and he receives the same fees, which amount to more than he pays that deputy.
          If the bill also repealed the statute giving $2 a day to Clerks of Superior and Criminal
          Courts, I would support it, but as it stands I will vote against it. </p>
         <p>Mr. FOWLER: I concur in what has been said by the Senator from Johnson (Mr. Overstreet),
          but do not arrive at the same conclusion. I think this bill is good as far as it goes, but
          it does not go far enough. There ought to be distinction between clerks where there is a
          Superior and Criminal Court and where there is none.</p>

        <p>The Speaker announced the unfinished business of yesterday being the consideration of the
         6 per cent. interest bill [H. R. 146] on the second reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBERTSON: There never has been a bill to reduce the rate of interest but what there
         has been some argument made to defeat it. When there was a proposition to reduce the
         interest of the funds of the National Government the same argument was used. I believe it
         has been said that the supply and demand regulate the price of money. I am in favor of
         increasing the supply. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: There is no difference between this bill and the statute, except the rate,
         and it is 6 per cent. contract or no contract, instead of 8. The gentleman from Putnam
         talks of this bill very sarcastically. He said this bill ought to be entitled a bill to
         confiscate property and labeled a humbug. I understand my duty on this floor to represent
         my people. I don't believe it is right to discuss a bill in this way, by saying it ought to
         be labeled a humbug. I don't believe it is right to impute such motives to the author of
         the bill. It has been said that legislation in this direction is not requested. I insist
         that the people of this State demand relief in the way of reduction of the rate of
         interest. The rate of interest has been regulated ever since the days of Moses. We have
         always been regulating the rate of interest, and we have a right to regulate the rate of
         interest. I do hope the bill will pass.</p>

        <p>The bill [S. 196] authorizing a temporary loan by the State officers, coming up on the
         second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved the further consideration of the bill be postponed until 2 o'clock
         next Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: The suggestion of this gentleman is a good deal like a Jay county promise to
         pay - there is no time fixed. This session is rapidly running away. I don't wish to throw
         any reflection upon anybody; but why make this dilatory motion? We are about to construct
         insane asylums, and we are in need of funds. I believe, to facilitate and hasten matters,
         we ought to consider this bill now. We probably would not reach the regular order next
         Wednesday. I am oppressed to the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: It seems to me the consideration of this bill ought not to be postponed. We
         ought to go right ahead with this business in the regular order.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: There seems to be a disposition on the part of this House to postpone this
         measure until next Wednesday.</p>

        <pb n="182" xml:id="VAA8558-22-182"/>
        <p>The friends of this measure to seem to want to pay no attention to the committee, no
         matter what the report may be, but want this bill to go through without any amendment. My
         vote shall depend very largely upon the report of the committee. It is certainly a matter
         of no small importance, and this House can well afford to wait for the report of the
         committee before acting upon this bill. This bill has come from the Senate. It has passed
         the Senate, and we have four or five weeks yet. If this bill is right it ought to pass, and
         if it is not right it ought not to pass. this House appointed a committee to report upon
         the passage of such bills. The probabilities are that the committee would be able to report
         by next Wednesday. There is ample time to pass this bill. It ought not to pass with out our
         knowing something about it It only involves about $600 000. We ought to wait and see
         whether we ought to vote for that much money or not. For some purpose the gentleman from
         Tippecanoe desires to rush it through without consideration and without deliberation. Let
         them do it if they have the power. I want this House to have some time to understand
         something about the contract between the commissioners and the contractors fro the insane
         asylums. It has been shown to this House that the law has been violated that the contract
         is not where the law requires it to be. There are reasons why we should hesitate and
         deliberate - why we should know what we are going. If the friends of the measure can not
         wait it is the best evidence that something is wrong. </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Does the gentleman understand this bill votes away a single dollar?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I so understand it. It authorizes the State offices to make a temporary loan
         of $600 000. Now, what would be the rise of borrowing this $600 000 if it is not intended
         for these three new asylums? Why borrow it if is not to be appropriated for that purpose?
         For what purpose is it to be borrowed if it is not to be appropriated? It certainly is not
         to be borrowed to lie in the Treasury. That is not the purpose. Now, i want to know before
         you borrow it what are you going to borrow the money for? I know there are gentlemen on
         this floor, when a member rises in his place and speaks against running the State in debt,
         they call in buncombe I will stand against the appropriation of $600,000 or the borrowing
         of $600 000 unless the specified purpose for which it is borrowed is know. I trust you will
         postpone the consideration of this measure until next Wednesday at two o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: This bill I think is for the purpose of raising revenue for the support of
         the Government Now I do not pretend to be a constitutional lawyer, but it occurs to me
         there is one thing in the way of this bill. The Constitution of the State of Indiana says,
         "Bills may originate in either House except bills for raising revenue, which shall
         originate in the House of Representatives." What is this bill unless it is to raise
         revenue? It is to borrow money. if that is not to raise revenue what is it? I think the
         bill should originate in this House, therefore I interpose this constitutional proviso as
         against this bill. That question has recently created a great deal of discussion in
         congress, and Congress has well adhered to the prerogative of the Lower House. It is
         raising evenue. I care not whether you do it by taxation or by borrowing it. It seems to me
         to be an encroachment upon the province of the House. If the House should enact a law
         creating a tax for the purpose of extinguishing a debt. It occurs to me that this would be
         for the purpose of rasing revenue. It has no right to come from the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr HARREL: I would like to know whether it is absolutely necessary to give the Governor
         and State offices such unlimited power. I believe every person here who paid any attention
         to the provisions of the bill would like to have more light upon the subject. Now, if you
         vote for the bill you will be giving tot he State officers unlimited power without knowing
         whether it is necessary. I will not say whether I am going to vote for or against the
         appropriation for the new insane Asylums, or what position I will take upon it. I want to
         know first if it is necessary to pass such a bill or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: The purpose of my motion seems to be misunderstood at this time I agree
         with a good many of the gentlemen who spoke upon this question. We have not sufficient
         information before us to enable us to vote intelligently upon the passage of the bill. For
         that reason and that reason alone I made the motion that the further consideration of this
         bill be postponed until next Wednesday, and in the mean time the report of the special
         committee might enable us to vote intelligently upon this important measure. For the
         purpose of preventing further discussion I move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operation the motion was agreed

        <p>Mr WILLIAMS introduced a resolution in the House of Reps., which requires that President
         Smart report to the House by Monday next, the names and residences of all pupils,
         instructors and employes, the cost of boarding them, the amount of money in the treasury
         and of debts outstanding. Mr. Smith moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on

        <p>In discussing his minority report on the State University Appropriation bill, reduc <pb
          n="183" xml:id="VAA8558-22-183"/> ing the same from $50,000 to $30,000, Mr. Gordon said: </p>
        <p>MR. SPEAKER - I desire to explain my minority report. I shall confine my remarks to the
         amendment. I am glad the gentleman consented to withdraw the proposition to lay on the
         table. I am glad and willing to enter into the discussion of this proposition. Gentlemen of
         the House. I want to explain my minority report. The original bill was introduced by Mr
         Cartwright was a simple proposition to appropriate $50,000 to the State University. One of
         the committee from the State University. One of the committees from the State University
         has made an itemized statement of $50,000. The statement is headed by $1,500, cost for
         lighting, $2,000 for boiler house, $5,800 for furniture $2,000 for museums, $2,000 for
         graining, $2,000 for chemistry, $5,000 for library, and to a $50,000. This Ways and Means
         Committee has voted to recommend the passage of the bill and hence I as a member of the
         committee offer the minority report It is this, to substitute $30,000 instead of $[]0 000
         and that this appropriation shall be in full for all moneys received by the State, under
         the endowment act passed two yeas ago. That endowment act provides for the levying of a tax
         of one-half cent for the purpose of producing a permanent endowment. That tax will have
         been continued three years altogether. That was the law of two years ago. that bill
         provides further that tax received for that endowment should be received into the State
         Treasury and it should be used for the payment of interest bonds held against the State of
         Indiana. It was to be used as long as any bonds were held against the State of Indiana.
         Whenever that tax was collected it was to be paid to the Treasurer of State, and the
         Auditor of State was to execute bonds in favor of the Trustees of Indiana University
         bearing 5 per cent. interest to be paid by the State Treasurer semi-annually. Now then this
         money was to be loaned to the State Treasurer, and it should be secured. The state should
         be a preferred borrower under that bill. </p>
        <p>The revenue thus raised would be increased every year for thirteen years and it would
         amount to somewhere between $500,000 and $600,000, and that fund was to be a permanent
         endowment for the State University.</p>
        <p>The provisions of this bill are that it shall be in lieu of all money raised from that
         tax, or which might be derived by reason of the endowment bill. There has been $30 000 or
         $40 000 already collected as such tax, levied in 1883 and 1884. The taxes of 1883 and 1884
         have been already collected. The provisions of the minority report are that the $30 000
         shall be in full of the payment of such tax levied by the State, and which has gone into
         the State Treasury. The proposition is that the appropriation of $30,000 shall be in full
         payment and discharge of all moneys received by the State from that source, and in full
         discharge of all bonds. I understand no bonds have been issued. The State Auditor was to
         issue bonds for the money already received.</p>
        <p>Now we are told that the State University ought to stand as the great head of our common
         schools. Now this statement I do not think is argument. In other words, the body can not
         exist without the head. Now do you believe, and does this committee believe, the common
         schools can not exist without the State University? If you close up the State University do
         you think it will close our common schools? I think not. I think, so far as our common
         schools are concerned, they are independent of the State University. I think that argument
         is rather for an affect. It seems to me the State Normal is the head of our common schools.
         You might just as well say Purdue University is the head of our common schools as to the
         say the State University is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton: I would like to ask the gentleman if the De Pauw University is not in your
         own county.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon: I am not subserving the interests of that institution. If there was no
         institution existing there I should not be in favor of this appropriation. There is no
         antagonism, there is no rivalry, there is none whatever between De Pauw University and the
         State University. I say right here I put the broad proposition to the Representatives of
         the State, are you going to make an appropriation to every institution that asks for it? If
         you do you will have to keep on giving. it takes annually $700,000 or $800,000 to run the
         Cornell University, it takes $149,00 to run Michigan University, so that it is a
         far-reaching proposition. Are you ready to help every institution? I am opposed to the
         State of Indiana supporting universities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams: Let me ask the gentleman if he is in favor of supporting this institution
         at Lafayette?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon: I am not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patten: Are you in favor of supporting our common schools?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon: I am, sir, but I do not think it is a proper policy for the State to support
         universities. I know it is a custom and long revered. But must you necessarily follow
         tradition? I am not in favor of sustaining an institution because it is in the State of
         Indiana You have no right to and the people of a State making provisions for the support of
         such institutions by private contributions, but the people of the State have no right to be
         taxed for maintaining such Institutions. It is unjust to the people, because a great
         majority of them do not attend for want of means to pay their board and transportation. How
         many people of the State send? How many children do they accommodate? In my opinion you
         could do a grander work with this money to distribute it throughout the whole State; put it
         in every school district, so they could have school nine months out of the year. It would
         benefit a great many more. </p>
        <p>But you are met with the proposition you are not in favor of maintaining the Institutions
         of the State. I say it is not right. It is unjust to the taxpayers and people of the State.
         I tell you, gentlemen of the House, what you are doing, you are maintaining an institution
         down there for the citizens of Monroe County I believe we ought to be just to the people of
         the whole State. A half of the students of this institution are residents of Monroe, more
         than of them are residents of Monroe County. Where does the benefit come to the State of
         Indiana? Probably there are 150 altogether, and 120 of that number are from Monroe County
         and thirt of them from the balance of the State of Indiana. I say are you ready to do this
         at the expense of the State? </p>
        <p>Now, with reference to the endowment law, I believe that law ought to be repealed.</p>
        <p>Do you believe the people of the State ought to be taxed for coming generations.</p>
        <p>These burdens are already bearing hard upon the people. We are building three new insane
         asylums. And now shall we endow this university? Are you willing to tax the people still
         more? I believe the burdens of the people of the State are now heavy enough without
         sustaing this additional burden.</p>

        <p>Mr. Winter's bill [S. 129] to amend section 2,505 R.S. being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I will say a few words in explanation of this bill Under the law when a
         person makes provision for his wife in a will she may elect to take under the will or under
         the law which we all know is one-third of the real estate. The law says the widow shall not
         have both A weak place in the law is there is no provision for the manner in which that
         selection shall be made or as to its being filed in any public office, so the public may
         know what election she has made; and so there is great doubt and uncertainty about the
         title of real estate. And to put at rest the doubt and uncertainty as to whether the widow
         has taken under the law or under the will, provides the election shall be made in writing
         within six months signed by her, acknowledged before a proper officer and recorded in the
         record of wills.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: There is no provision in this bill for giving the widow notice of the
         existence of a will.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: If a man and wife have been on such terms that she does not know of his will
         she wouldn't want to take under the will at all. </p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: It seems to me six months is a short time to allow her to make her selection.
         She may know of the will, but have no knowledge of this law. So if she happens to pass by
         making a selection for six months she would irretrievably lose the benefit of this
         provision.</p>
        <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 43, nays 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis' bill [S 137] to amend Section 1 330 R S., was read the third time and passed
         by yeas 42 nays 1 Mr D explaining: The law provides no execution shall issue upon a
         judgment until the proceedings of the court are drawn up, read in open court and signed.
         The practice in some courts is not to read the daily record for weeks. This bill requires
         the Judge, when requested by either party, to sign the record that judgment may be made up.

        <p>Mr. Hilligass' bill [S. 139] so as to make Adams and Jay the Twenty-sixth, Huntington and
         Wells the Twenty eighth and Grant and Blackford the Forty-seventh Judicial Districts being
         read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jay: It is an absolutely necessity that these two districts be changed They
         are the largest in the State. The business is behind, and it is utterly impossible to keep
         it up. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: If this bill passes, this Legislature ought to create ninety-two circuits and
         give to each county in the State a Judge.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH opposed the bill with all the force he knew how. If this outrage <pb
          n="185" xml:id="VAA8558-22-185"/> is perpetrated upon the taxpayers of Indiana, as similar
         outrages have been heretofore, the taxpayers ought to damn the Legislature for it. He moved
         to recommit the bill with instructions that four Judges shall do the work of the eight
         counties of Adams Jay Huntington, Wells, Grant, Blackford Delaware and Randolph. </p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: There was an increase of over 400 pages of record last year over the year
         previous in the county of Huntington Senators opposing the bill need no relief The Senators
         representing the six counties Interested in this bill are unanimously asking for this
         relief. We are asking more than our constituents demand. the bill was not introduced to
         balance political parties or to place any friend on the bench The courts were blockaded by
         business. The pages of record in Huntington County increased from 808 in 1874 to 1,200 in
         1884 and the voting population had increased 2,112 in the same period. The business of
         Northern Indiana was increasing with wonderful rapidity, and the Senate could not afford to
         cripple it by legal delays. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The people of Indiana are paying $50,000 a year more for Circuit
         Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys than they ought to. We have forty-five Circuit Judges in
         the State, paid at a salry of $2 500 a year. Thirty judges can do every bit of business now
         before the courts or that will come before the courts in twenty years. there is not a
         circuit in the State that can show an increase of business within the past two years; on
         the contrary, it has been decreased to an extent that was driving lawyers out of practice.
         Even in Jefferson County, with the city of Madison in its limit, the business was
         transacted in one week out of the four allowed by law for a term of court Judges everywhere
         were under worked.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: The reasons why this bill should pass, and why, in my opinion, there should
         be a new circuit created out of these counties have been so well and ably stated by the
         Senator from Huntington, that I think it unnecessary for me to repeat any of those reasons,
         or offer any in addition. I will state, however, that the judicial circuit which I, in
         part, have the honor to represent upon this floor, is a large one It is composed of the
         counties of Huntington, Grant, and Blackford I am not prepared to give the number of
         inhabitants but I do know there were about 15,000 votes cast at the last election in that
         district. But as far as my observation is concerned, the decision of such questions as
         this, either by the number of voters or population, amounts to nothing. I was informed by
         the Judge of that district, in this chamber a few days ago that there was at this time
         about 1,400 cases upon the docket in these circuits, and he said if we do not obtain relief
         many of these cases must be prolonged in court for two or three years. Now, Mr President,
         it is for this Senate to say whether any relief shall be afforded or not. I trust the
         necessary relief will be granted by the passage of this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: If the people demand this relief they should have it, and who here knows
         better than the Senators representing those counties The base for litigation can not be
         made on wealth and population. The speedier trials can be had the less business there will
         be. Counties south of the National Road have twenty-nine Circuit Judges, while north of the
         National Road there are but seventeen Judges. The expenses are paid out of the general
         fund, but the expense should not weigh against the necessities of the district.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Justice is a thing one can't pay too much for. Two thousand five hundred
         dollars ought not to stand in the way of getting justice administered speedily. The
         Senators interested say this legislation is demanded, and their statement should be
         received as true.</p>
        <p>Then came a recess for dinner.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: These people asking relief by this bill are denied the justice which
         the passage of this bill would give them. The Judges of the several circuits are not lazy
         men, but they earn evry cent of money they receive. If some were paid by the case they try,
         they would not get as much as the ordinary Justice of the Peace. it is asking too much of
         any one Judge to do the business in this Circuit. He opposed the motion to recommit as one
         fatal to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER did not believe there is any necessity for the passage of this bill. Thirty
         Judges if their labor is equalized can do the business of the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill asks for no more than is justly due, and no more than the
         business in these judicial circuits require. He submitted figures to substantiate his

        <p>Mr. Zimmerman's bill [S. 159] to amend Section 3 628 R. S. was read the third time and
         passed by yeas 41, nays 2.</p>
        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN, explaining: This bill provides that Directors of turnpike companies which
         may desire to appropriate any public highway shall give fifteen days' notice <pb n="186"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-186"/> prior to the regular term of the County Commissioners. This is
         to protect people who live along the line of any highway the Directors of turnpike
         companies propose to use, so that in case of unwillingness on the party of any interest
         they may have a hearing before the Board of Commissioners and a chance to remonstrate. In
         our section of the country turnpike roads are mostly toll roads, and frequently companies
         obtain control of highways against the wish of people along the line. This bill would stop
         that abuse. It also provides that notices shall be posted, one at the Court House and four
         along the line of such highway. </p>

         Mr. W. explaining: It only applies to the city of Indianapolis, and is a bill which has
         been demanded by the citizens of this city for some-time. The bill has been carefully
         prepared. It has been submitted to the Auditor of this county, has been examined by him,

        <head rend="center">INDIANAPOLIS UNION DEPOT.</head>
        <p>Mr. Winter's Union Railway bill [S. 189] being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I concede there is a great necessity for a larger union depot in this
         city, and that it can't be built without the vacation perhaps of streets and alleys and the
         condemnation of property, but I don't think to accomplish that end the Senate ought to
         strike down the rights of private citizens without giving them a hearing. Under this bill
         property can be condemned in fee simple, streets and alleys vacated and the title in fee
         simple vested in the corporation, and the owners of property have no right to appeal. It
         does seem to me the right to appeal ought to be given to citizens who might feel themselves
         aggreived.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I feel favorably inclined to this bill, but if there is any doubt as to its
         provisions properly protecting the rights of individuals I think it would be well, and I
         move to refer it to a special committee of three to report it back to morrow, and that its
         consideration be made a special order for to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: Instead of striking down the rights of property holders this bill affords a
         greater protection to property-holders here than anywhere in the State of Indiana as
         against railroads. The whole theory of allowing railroads to take possession of property is
         that it is for the benefit of the public at large. If every citizen had the right to take
         an appeal I would like to know when a railroad could be built. One would take an appeal
         after another and the result would be the railroad would have to stand and wait until these
         cases were decided, before the first nail could be driven for a union depot. The effect
         would be to nullify this bill if a provision were inserted giving parties the right to
         appeal. I have distributed copies of this bill among a number of our citizens and requested
         them to state objections to it; this matter has been agitated for over a year. It has been
         discussed in the papers, but I have not heard of a single person who has the slightest
         objection to this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I am thoroughly in favor of the project to enable this Union Railway Company
         to build a union depot, but I think we should make haste slowly, and we should very careful
         to see that the rights of all parties are properly protected and cared for. It is necessary
         of course to condemn land, but this bill ought to provide for that according to the general
         law in force in this State at this time. We should give this company no greater rights as
         against private individuals than the general law</p>
        <p>The motion to refer was decided on a division - affirmative 18, negative 18 - but the
         yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and again resulted yeas 21, nays 21. So the motion
         was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER again called attention to the provisions of the bill. </p>
        <p>The bill passed the Senate - yeas 39, nays []</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: In explanation of my vote, I desire to say I expect I [ ] much in favor
         of the contemplated Union Depot in this city as any citizen of Indianapolis, but I feel it
         could be built without depriving owners of property a hearing in the courts; and most all -
         one at least of the most prominent and influential citizens of Indianapolis who has
         property to be affected, feeling it is an outrage upon him, and believing he has just
         reasons for it, I am content to vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE, when his name was called, said: There are some provisions in this bill which
         are so objectionable I don't feel justified in voting for it, and therefore I vote
         "no."</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE UNIVERSITY APPROPRIATION.</head>
        <p>The Speaker announced the consideration of Mr. Cartwright's bill [H. R. 201] to appro-<pb
          n="187" xml:id="VAA8558-22-187"/>priate $50,000 for the State University, the question
         being on the minority report from the Committee on Ways and Means, reducing the
         appropriation to $30 000, and to repeal the university tax law of last session.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: If it were possible for us, as members of the Legislature, to get on the good
         side of our constituents by saying we are standing by the people and standing by the
         Treasury, when we go home, we certainly would have a warm place in the hearts of our
         constituency. This question is one that demands some attention at our hands, and this bill
         demands this attention of the people of the State of Indiana. I presume every one of us and
         our constituents are somewhat interested in this measure, the question being as to whether
         or not we are going to appropriate a sum to the Indiana State University as will put her on
         a good bases and enable her to go on in the good work she is now doing. The trustees have
         asked us to appropriate $50,000 to enable them to equip the buildings now constructed. We
         all know that two years ago a serious fire swept over the State University, destroying and
         seriously impairing her libraries, etc, and over $125,000 or $150,000 was lost to the State
         of Indiana. This bill proposes to get back all that was lost for $50,000 That is the size
         of it. And we get back better buildings and property. Now, the gentleman from Putnam is
         opposed to the appropriation of $50,000. We ought to put some credit in what the Board of
         Trustees say. They are reputable men They are business men, and they come from all quarters
         of the State, and have the interest of the State at heart. Now they propose, with this
         $50,000 to put in a museum and library and equip the buildings they have already built.
         Without the appropriation the buildings will stand there without any benefit to the State.
         But we have been told that there are other universities where young men and young women can
         be educated. Now what is the argument? That we shall strike down Indiana University, at
         Bloomington, and put our young men and women in sectarian institutions such as that at
         Wabash and Greencastle. You might just as well talk about striking down the common school
         system in Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: It resolves itself into this question, whether the State of Indiana is going
         to maintain a State University or not. Fifty thousand dollars is a very small amount for
         such a purpose. I put the question whether this State is going to be the only State without
         a university?</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: Indiana is proud of her institutions. There has been something said about the
         taxpayers. Now I think if you make calculation you will find that this bill costs the
         taxpayers less than five cents apiece, and yet you grumble about it. Indiana claims to be
         second to no State in the Union as to progress, and the question is, are we going to
         maintain a State University? I will not claim the attention of the House any further,
         because I am satisfied that this appropriation will be voted.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: As I do not desire to explain my vote, I wish to say a few words now.
         I consider this a very important matter. I was here last session, and voted against a
         similar endowment bill. I did not believe it was right then, and I am of the same opinion
         still. In 1867 there was an appropriation of $8000 made to this institution, and in 1873
         there was an additional one of $15,000, making $23,000. And only last session we were told
         if we would favor that bill and vote for that endowment, they would ask for no further
         appropriation. If you will examine that law you will find this proviso: "Provided, further,
         that no further appropriation shall be made to the State University," and, notwithstanding
         that, they are asking for this appropriation. I will be compelled to vote for the
         amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I do not think I can add anything to what has been said. Now it has been
         said by some gentleman that some of the counties do not derive any benefit from these
         appropriations. I venture to say that one-half of the people do not derive any benefit from
         the common schools - some of them do not derive a single cent's worth of benefit, and yet
         would you say you must not help to support the common schools? Gentlemen, this question
         long since has been settled in the State of Indiana. The people have said that the
         educational institutions are a part of the people. I believe the appropriation asked for is
         just and right. I believe it will be to the benefit of the people of the State. I am for
         the appropriation just as it is.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the minority report was
         rejected by yeas 43, nays 45.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to reduce the appropriation to $30 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN made an ineffectual motion - yeas 40, nays 49 - to lay the amendment on the

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <head rend="center">SUPREME COURT RECORD.</head>
        <p>Mr. Kellison's bill [H. R. 58] being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON said: I regard this as an important bill. The question of getting a case
         before the Supreme Court in the cheapest manner must be important to any one in the State.
         We have but one court of appellate jurisdiction to which questions can be taken as a court
         of last resort. The lives and property of the people of the State are in the hands of the
         judiciary of the State. It is very important to every citizen of the <pb n="188"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-188"/> State that he should have the right to have his case heard
         before the court of last resort. This proposes to amend the law at the present time in
         regard to the manner of getting the record of a case before the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The present manner of getting that record before the Supreme Court is by transcript,
         which must be made not only of all the original papers filed in the court below that are
         parts of the record, but of all such papers filed in the case pending the proceedings which
         have been made parts of the record by a bill of exceptions. The cost of an ordinary
         transcript is $50 and upward, which must be prepaid before a person can have the right to
         appeal a case to the Supreme Court. The Constitution of the State of Indiana provides that
         the courts shall be open to every man for injury done to his person, property and
         reputation, and he is to have remedy by due course of law. It is to be fairly without
         purchase, and speedily without delay. When you take a case to the Supreme Court it takes
         about three months to get a bill of exceptions properly filed. The earliest possible time a
         case can be gotten before the Supreme Court so it stands for trial is about fourteen
         months, and generally it takes two or three years to dispose of a case; and while the case
         is pending in the Supreme Court the original papers are lying in the Clerk's office. This
         bill proposes to send all the original papers up, including every paper filed in the case
         the instruction given by the Court, the instructions asked by the parties, the bill of
         exceptions, but the transcript shall only contain such record entries as are in the order
         books. This bill is not without precedents. That is the law in the State of Ohio in regard
         to the appeals to the Appellate Courts, and I am informed it is the law in the State of
         Pennsylvania. I believe this law should be favored by every lawyer in this House. It has
         the indorsement of the bar of Marshall County and I can see no argument against this
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I hope that this bill will not pass. It is important to lawyers that papers
         in a case should remain in the Circuit Court where the trial is had. The original papers
         ought not to be taken from the files of the Court. If you wanted to get any information
         concerning a case you would have to come here to the city of Indianapolis, and it would
         cost cliants more than any other way. It would be a very great additional expense to
         litegants</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I am opposed to this bill, but not exactly for the same reasons that were given
         by the gentleman from Monroe (Mr. Browning) This bill is a very important bill. It makes a
         radical change in the practice. The present practice has existed since 1852, and to make
         this change have a greater effect on the practice any man on this floor knows of. It would
         require a change in the rules of the Supreme Court. And how are we to determine just what
         papers should be sent up? The only reason given by the gentleman is that it would make
         litigation cheaper. Now if a man is not able to pay the cost of a transcript he had better
         not go to the Supreme Court. The present practice has become settled, and I am not in favor
         of changing it.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: I think there are many objectionable features to the bill. It has been my
         experience that a large majority of cases that are appealed from the lower court to the
         court of last resort are taken up for time any way. I think before this bill becomes a law
         it should be considered well.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I am inclined to look at this bill with deliberation and consideration. I
         think it would be a very dangerous measure for this one reason, as it has been stated by
         some member. As it now stands a case appealed to the Supreme Court we have a record of the
         papers in the court below and in the Supreme Court. Suppose the court below only had the
         papers and they got lost, that would be the end of the case. I think it would be a
         dangerous practice, and for that reason I think the bill ought not to pass</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: There is not one man upon this floor that has given a good argument against
         the passage of this bill - not one single valid or substantial reason. The question of
         losing the papers is easily answered. Section 1,645 of the Statues provides that where the
         parties require it the clerk shall keep a complete record of all the proceedings in the
         case. Now, this question of losing the papers is absolutely a bug-a-boo. There is nothing
         in it. I say it is very important to the people of the State of Indiana that they can
         obtain justice, according to the spirit and letter of the constitution - fairly, without
         purchase, and speedily, without delay. Now, if it will be no injury to litigants, why
         should it not pass? And I have shown there is none. I believe it would save litigants of
         the State $100,000 in the first year after it has been adopted.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas 27, nays 55.</p>

         alternating - was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE, from the Special Committee thereon, returned Mr. Hoover's Live Stock Company
         Incorporation bill [S. 28], recommending the, substitution of a similar bill [H. R. 70]
         with amendments. He said the amendments are intended to afford protection against the
         ultimate tendency to drive out the small stock farmer by limiting such incorporations to
         the importation of foreign blooded stock and breeding therefrom. The acquisition of land is
         limited to 2 500 acres, with the privilege of leasing 2 500 acres more, and with the
         additional right to lease other lands from year to year. I think it a dangerous thing to
         permit a large quantity of land to be owned by a corporation. Then the committee amendments
         provide that the company shall not own over 2,500 head of stock. The capital stock not to
         exceed $250,000. I think the privileges are sufficiently large with these limitations,
         which will secure stock farmers against dangerous competition.</p>
        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>On his further motion the bill S. 70, as so amended, wa read the second time.</p>

        <p>Mr. BAILEY: When the Senate bill was referred to the <orgName>Committee on
          Corporations</orgName> a provision was inserted that each stockholder and member of such
         corporation shall be individually liable to creditors of the corporation to the amount of
         unpaid stock sub- <pb n="190" xml:id="VAA8558-22-190"/> scribed by him, and for an
         additional amount equal to the stock subscribed by him. I think this amendment very
         important It is not in the House bill No 70, therefore I shall have to vote against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I dont think that bill ought to pass without that provision is

        <p>Mr. SHIVELY'S bill IS. [S. 18 - See page 162-3 of the Brevier Reports] coming up on the
         second reading, the question being on a motion to substitute the bill S. 233 therefor - </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY said: The substitute offered by the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) is a
         bill known as one recommended by the Indiana State Medical Society, and I regret to oppose
         it, because it is a society for which I have the most profound respect, and a society of
         which I have been an humble member for more than thirty years. Since I had the honor to
         introduce this bill I have received 300 letters from physicians throughout the State
         expressing a preference for it. The bill offered as a substitute provides for a Board of
         Examiners, to consist of seven members, four of whom are to be nominated by the State
         Medical Society, one by the Eclectic State Medical Society, one by the Homeopathic Medical
         Society, and one by the Physio-Medical State Society, and from these nominations it is made
         the duty of the Governor to appoint this board. All I have to say is that from the
         extensive information I have received from physicians throughout the State there is a
         general objection to that feature of the bill, and I hope it will be voted down.</p>
        <p>Mr WINTER: I have no interest or feeling whatever for or against any particular bill. I
         Informed Doctors Rogers, Woodburn, and Hobbs, of Knightstown, there were some features in
         it that didn't m et my approval, but that the bill could be amended in the Senate. I
         believe the medical profession, which is a numerous and learned profession, and one
         entitled to respectful consideration, are desirous of some legislation upon this subject.
         If there is to be any legislation whatever there ought to be an effort to adopt a bill that
         will attain some good result. The objection I have to the bill introduced by the Senator
         from Grant (Mr. Shively) is that I don't consider it will be beneficial in its operations.
         It would not secure the people of the State against quackery. The object of these bills is,
         as I understand it, to prevent this State from being overrun by quacks which been driven
         into this State by the laws of other States; and the bill of the Senator from Grant County,
         in my opinion. will prevent that. It may be a quack will be required to commit perjury to
         get practice, but I think a man so devoid, of principle as to purchase a diploma will not
         be deterred from continuing in his evil practice, simply because he is required to make an
         affidavit, he has a diploma some reputable medical college. I am inclined to think that the
         effect of the bill will be to aid the quack to deceive the people. Another objection: The
         bill I introduced might be amended so that the Examining Board shall consist of nine
         members - three from the old school and two from each of the other schools. I don't think
         it right that a majority of the should be taken from any one school. The letters with which
         members have flooded from physicians are based upon a misapprehension of this bill, the
         writers understanding this bill requires old practitioners to go before the board and be
         examined. These letters are written in answer to a circular stating the features of these
         two bills. The House bill is the same as Senate bill 223. It was intimated in the circular
         under the provision of the House bill every physician, no matter what his attainments would
         have to go before the Board and be examined as a mere tyro in the business. That accounts
         for the expressions of physicians in favor of Senate bill No. 18. The provisions of the
         other bill is more liberal than the bill No. 18, for the bill 223 does not require an
         examinations of one who has practiced for five consecutive years. This bill requires all
         others to convince the Board that the applicant has an academic education. A man may
         qualify himself to practice without having graduated in a medical college, though this bill
         223 requires that. That provision can be stricken out, however. This bill will give better
         satisfaction to he profession, and it will more effectually rid the State of disreputable
         practitioners.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH hoped the Senate would give a fair consideration to these bills. A medical
         bill ought to be passed this session. He was not a stickler for any particular bill, but
         there is one material defect in the No. 223, because if it passed no physician who has
         practiced but four years, though he attended two, three or more courses at a medical
         college, could obtain a license. Any man who can pass a successful examination of the
         board, whether he ever attended a course at a medical college or not, ought to be permitted
         to have a license. If the Senate adopts the substitute it must take the risk of proving it
         up. If No. 18 is passed it should be amended so that the proof of a ten years practice by
         two reputable witnesses should be sufficient, and the same proof should be required of one
         who has practiced three years and attended a full course of lectures.</p>
        <pb n="191" xml:id="VAA8558-22-191"/>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: For the past twenty five years the school of medicine to which he belongs
         has made application to the Legislature for a bill to protect and raise the standard of the
         medical practice. Two-thirds of the letters received on this subject are satisfied without
         any law on the subject, while nine-tenths making comparisons between the two bills favor
         the Shively bill. The people are being fooled out of their money by quacks, but they do not
         petition for protection from them; but the physicians petition the State for protection to
         those who are qualified. He favored the Shively bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, stated objections to the bill of the Senator from Greene (Mr.
         McIntosh) It requires proof of good moral character; but how is that question to be
         determined? Under the law it is about as different as the different phases of the human
         mind. Then it requires a diploma from some regularly chartered medical college, while as he
         understands, many of the oldest and most reputable colleges do not possess a charter. A
         stranger, though ever so reputable a physician, can not obtain a license because he must
         obtain the affidavit of two freeholders or householders that he is well known to them. It
         may be true we should have some sort of legislation, but every Legislature for eighteen
         years has failed to pass one because the doctors will not agree. When doctors disagree who
         shall decide?</p>
        <p>He also cited objections to the bill S. 223: None but graduates of some medical college
         shall be eligible to an examination. If everybody were required to have a diploma from
         reputable medical college, what need is there of legislation on the subject? There is no
         reason why a young man fresh from a medical college with his diploma should be examined by
         such a board. If there be colleges who sell diplomas legislation should be against these,
         so as to wipe them out of the land as well as to punish the purchase of such diplomas Of
         all the veriest quacks, the worst one of them could prove a practice of five years. It is a
         dangerous bill. He favored Senate bill No. 18 While it may not be all the profession or
         this Legislature desires, yet it is a step in the right direction - a basis upon which
         future legislation may be had. The bill is guarded with sufficient penalties, in all
         respects more carefully guarded than in either of the other bills. There is provision in it
         made for a record for the doctor. The liberal policy is incorporated in the bill introduced
         by the Senator from Grant (Mr Shively).</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH favored Senate bill No. 18. It is not a radical bill, and we do not want
         radical legislation on the subject. The objection is made that practitioners would commit
         perjury under it to avoid which there should be an amendment requiring their affidavit to
         contain a statement as to the exact locality in which the applicant has been practicing for
         the prescribed term of ten years.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tay, thought the passage of this bill [S 18] would allow most any
         practitioner to continue the practices on the payment of $3. If there is to be any medical
         legislation, there should be some examination that should require a board of skilled
         physicians to determine who is qualified to practice medicine.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: No bill should be passed that will discriminate against some and in favor of
         others, and how can it be otherwise with a board of seven, with four belonging to one
         particular school. Another objection is the requiring all physicians to come to
         Indianapolis to stand an examination. The ten years' practice feature is a good one. Many
         such may not be as skillful as some who have received diplomas, but they have acquired what
         may be termed a vested right. In every respect the provisions of Senate bill 18 is
         preferable to those in Senate bill 223. There were in 1880 4,696 physicians in Indiana, all
         of whom under the bill 223 must pay from $5 to $25 to this Board of Examiners besides
         paying their expenses to Indianapolis. No quack will be allowed to practice where the
         rights of reputable physicians are guarded.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD, stating he was heartily in favor Senate bill 18, moved the previous
         question, but withdrew that motion on being assured discussion would cease</p>
        <p>The motion to substitute the bill, S. 223, for the bill, S 18, was rejected by yeas, 4,
         nays 35.</p>
        <p>Mr. Overstreet moved to amend by reducing the fee from $3 to $1 50 by striking out the
         requirement of witnesses, and also striking out Section 7.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. McCullough the amendment was amended by requiring the affidavit to
         contain a statement of the locality where the ten years' practice was had.</p>
        <p>A division of the question being demanded - </p>
        <p>That part of the amendment proposing to strike out the provision, for witnesses was
         agreed to, as was also the second subdivision reducing the fee to $1 50, and also the third
         part striking out the seventh section.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS made an ineffectual motion to amend, by declaring the provisions shall not
         apply to consulting physicians from other States, or officers of the army.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question, and under its operations the bill was ordered
         engrossed.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, the constitutional rule was dispensed with - yeas
         34, nays 5 - the bill read the second time by title, the third time by section, and passed
         the Senate by yeas 28, nays 11.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY, explaining: I have received a good number of letters from my constituents,
         all of then against any medical legislation whatever. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS, when his name was called, said: I have received quite a number of letters from
         various physicians, some of <pb n="192" xml:id="VAA8558-22-192"/> whom desire a medical
         bill passed, and some do not. My own impression is that there are a great many provisions
         in this bill I would like to vote for, but as I understand it under this bill a physician
         of note called upon to visit a patient in another county would have to obtain a license for
         each county. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN, in explanation of his vote, said: Inasmuch as the people in my district
         don't demand any legislation upon the subject of regulating the practice of medicine, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

        <p>Mr. Brown's County Superintendent election bill [S. 8], being read the second time, with
         two committee reports - one favorable and the other recommending that the bill lie o the
         table - </p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS opposed taking the election of County Superintendent out of the hands of
         Township Trustees, and making that officer a creature of an election by the popular vote of
         the people. A man, without reference to qualification, as far as sobriety and efficiency

         of County Superintendent, although he may be able to secure a certificate, of qualification
         to hold the office. I am opposed to interfering with the present plan that has worked so

        <p>Mr. Robinson's bill [S. R 169] to amend the dog law, coming up on the second reading with
         a committee report recommending its indefinite postponement - </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON said: The committee may not see the importance of this bill. I think it is
         one of importance to the people of the State. It is not an act for the protection of dogs,
         but it is, as I understand it, an act for the protection of the people of the State engaged
         in the industry of sheep husbandry. The bill simply provides an amendment to the law,
         whereas under the present law, if you to refer to the section of the statute, you will see
         there is a penalty for killing any dog which has been listed for taxation. There are many
         dogs through the State listed for taxation, upon which the tax has never been paid, and
         many worthless curs that go untaxed. They are listed, but the tax is never paid upon them.
         The amendment suggested simply provides a penalty for killing any dog upon which the tax
         has been paid. It simply removes the protection given under the law to dogs upon which the
         tax has not been paid. It has been said that if you remove the protection from the dog
         simply because the tax has not been paid you might as well remove it from the cow and
         horse. I think there is much difference. I insist that the report of the committee ought
         not to be concurred in.</p>

        <p>Mr. Linville's bill [H. R. 212] coming up on a second reading, with the committee
         recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed - </p>
        <p>Mr. LINVILLE: I hope the report of the committee will not be concurred in. There are two
         provisions in this bill. The first limiting the manner of catching fish, and the second
         prescribing penalties for the violation of it. I understand under the present law there is
         no protection to fish on other men's property.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I would like to the gentleman explain where the difference is from the
         present law.</p>
        <p>Mr. LINVILLE: The only change that it makes from the present law is that persons who own
         ponds may catch fish out of the river for the purpose of stocking their ponds. It also
         provides for the protection of fish in these private ponds. As I understand present law it
         does not protect fish in these private ponds.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: The objection is that it makes a criminal offense of what, under the law, would
         be a trespass, and perhaps there is already a law covering this offense. We have so many
         criminal laws that committee thought this was unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I have heard no good reason given why this should not become a law. I think
         the bill is a good one. It does not interfere with the rights of the citizens of the State.
         Therefore I am in favor bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: It seems to me the objections that have been made to this bill at this time
         would be more proper to be made by amendment to the bill. The bill contains two
         propositions. It provides for the stocking of private ponds. It allows persons who own
         private ponds to stock them with fish by going to the lakes and rivers seining for fish. I
         think it is of some importance to encourage the breeding of fish in ponds whereby the
         farmers, can raise other things beside wheat and corn and hogs. This bill has some merit
         and it ought to be allowed go to the second reading and passed for the farmers'
         protection.</p>

        <p>Mr. McGovney's bill [H. R. 101] coming up on the second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to strike out the word "ten" in line 3, page 3</p>
        <p>Mr. McGOVNEY said: This bill was reported back by the committee with the recommendation
         that it pass the House. The bill 101 proposes to amend Section 20 of the highway law of
         1883. You will find it on page 68 of the acts of 1883</p>
        <p>The old system was when a man worked out his road tax on the highway he was given a
         receipt by the Supervisor, and he presented that receipt at the Treasurer's office when he
         went there to pay his taxes. The receipt was to go in payment of so much taxes, and he
         received credit for it in the the settlement. Now if a person works out so much tax on the
         highway he receives a printed blank, and the amount is written in generally with a led
         pencil, and there is nothing to prevent a man from making a change in the receipt. For
         instance, if man has worked to the amount of $2 50 he might change it to $7 50. I have been
         informed that that was the useage and it sometimes prevailed further than any one knew of.
         The highway law of 1883 provides that the supervisor should make out a list of all the
         persons that worked in the whole road district, swear to it and present it to the Township
         Trustee. The Township Trustee would have a list of all the persons that worked the road in
         the township, and from these several lists he must make out a list in alphabetical order,
         and the Township Trustee is sworn to that and presents it to the County Auditor. I think
         the amendment would avoid a great many errors. It does not propose to amend any section but
         Section 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: There are two objects in the bill: The first is a saving of expense
         of about $40 000 a year or over to this State. The expense of the Trustees making out this
         list the object is to cut off. The other object is to have the receipts taken by the
         Treasurer as cash. Now this bill requires the supervisors to make a complete report under
         oath, stating all the facts fully, the same as the Trustee of the township; and there is
         nothing wrong about that.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the amendment was

         recommendation that it be indefinitely postposed - </p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS said: I hope the report of the committee will not be adopted. The bill
         provides that druggists shall keep an account of every prescription sold and of all liquor,
         and the name of the party purchasing it and the object for which it was purchased, and file
         a sworn statement of this account in the office of the Clerk, making the failure to do so a
         misdemeanor, for which a fine may be assessed, not to exceed the sum of $20</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I think the bill ought to be indefinitely postponed. I think it would make
         men commit perjury in addition to violating the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. ELEY: It would be a dead-letter; a man would not criminate himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. DALE: The saloon men, while they traffic in liquor, are put under heavy license. I
         hope this bill will pass and the report of the committee will not be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: The <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName> gave this bill a very
         great deal of consideration, and they were of the unanimous opinion, I believe, that the
         law could not be enforced. A law that is not upheld by public sentiment is worse than no
         law at all. It is unreasonable. The law we have now, is sufficient if enforced.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: I desire to say I, am opposed to this bill. I would be in favor of it if all
         the druggists in the State would comply with it. But the honest druggists of the State
         would comply with it, while the dishonest druggists would fail to do so; and again, if all
         the druggists would do it they would criminate themselves. It seems to me improper to ask a

         committee to embrace therein the following section: "That each stockholder and member of
         such corporation shall be individually liable to creditors of the corporation to the amount
         of unpaid stock subscribed by him, and for an additional amount equal to the stock
         subscribed by him." This committee report embraces that with the following two sections, in
         substance, "that an annual report shall be made by the corporation setting out its
         libilities and the absolute condition of business, and that report shall be signed by the
         Secretary and a majority of the directors and sworn to by them;" and the following section
         states "if such report be not as made and published, or be false in any material statement,
         and any person is misled or deceived by that report, the individual members shall be held
         liable for the amount of damage incurred by that report, and any company neglecting or
         failing to make and publish an annual report shall lose and forfeit any right of immunity
         or protection given by this act, except that any neglect or failure shall not relieve any
         member from the liabilities of this act." It may be said that this proposes to make a
         distinction against these companies as compared with companies organized under the mining
         law. The law simply makes stockholders liable for the full face of the stock subscribed by
         them, and in addition renders them individually liable for all debts to employes of the
         corporation. As to telephone and telegraph and street railway companies, they are made
         liable exactly as provided in these proposed amendments. I am not especially in favor of
         this bill anyhow, but if it is to pass I hope these amendments will be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr OVERSTREET: My recollection is that on yesterday the House bill [70] was just like the
         Senate bill [28] with the exception of the first amendment suggested by this report, and
         the bill [H. R. 70] which was substituted for the Senate bill was referred to a committee
         of one with instructions to add that amendment. I think that committee of one has
         transcended its powers when it goes beyond the instruction of the Senate, and adds two
         other sections to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: Will the Senator permit one word? I certainly did not understand the
         committee to be restricted to that amendment. I was talking to the Senator who introduced
         it [Mr. Hoover introduced the bill S. 28] and he suggested these two additional sections; I
         therefore reported them as being very proper. I think it important that such companies
         should make annual reports of the condition of the corporation and make the directors swear
         to the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I insist that these two other proposed amendments have not been referred
         to such a committee as the Senate rules prescribe. Why refer an important bill to such a
         committee of one, restricting it to do a certain thing; and then allow <pb n="195"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-195"/> that committee to add other sections which change the whole
         feature of the bill in several respects? I think the committee has gone beyond what it was
         instructed to do and therefore I move to amend by striking out these two last sections -
         sections 8 and 9</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: If that was going beyond the instructions of the Senate, I will withdraw
         these two sections and offer them as an amendment to the bill</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Yesterday when this bill came up for passage a motion was carried to recommit
         to a committee of one to make certain amendment. That, I believe, was the extent of the
         authority of the committee; not to add any new sections to the bill, but simply to make a
         short amendment. The Senator who introduced the bill, as well as Senators who were
         appointed on this committee which considered this bill, are absent this morning, and I ask
         that its further consideration may go over till Senator Hoover returns. This bill affects
         farmers more than any other class, and I move that it be postponed till Monday at 2:30
         o'clock.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BAILEY, his Oleo-margerine bill [S 136] was made the special order for
         Tuesday at 2 o'clock p. m</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD gave notice that he would move on Monday, or some subsequent day, for
         amendment of rule 54, so as to make the regular order of business imperative unless
         suspended by a two-thirds vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE moved that the Senate hold an afternoon session for the further transaction of
         routine work, the presentation of petitions, resolutions, and the introduction of bills
         only.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, said the clerks were complaining that the Senate had already cut out
         work enough to keep them up till midnight.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE replied that it was far more important that Senators should work than that
         clerks should rest. There were several bills in sight which would require debate and
         consideration. At such times the clerks had a soft snap, at others they had to toil over
         rapid transactions of detail.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Then came a recess for dinner.</p>

        <p>Mr. Williams' bill [H. R. 146] to fix the rate of interest at 6 per cent, being under
         consideration - </p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY said: I am opposed to this bill, and earnestly appeal to gentlemen on this
         floor not to disturb the present law on the question of interest. I do not believe, as some
         gentlemen insist, that legislation on this question will be in the interest of the debtor
         class. I do not loan money, but unfortunately have always borrowed. Do gentlemen believe
         that if we enact a law reducing the legal rate of interest to 6 percent., I or any other
         man can more easily procure money wherewith to remove the mortgage from our little homes?
         No, gentlemen, a greater delusion was never entertained by man, than to suppose you can
         materially assist the poor man by enactments reducing the legal rate of interest. If such
         results would follow in the pathway of such legislation, then why not make the law 5 per
         cent? Mr Speaker, I believe that legislation on this question <choice>
          <corr>is</corr>
          <sic>ie</sic>
         </choice> kindred to that of legislating on prohibiting the use of intoxicating liquors.
         Such a law is of no or but little force unless the people are educated up to a standard
         where they will enforce the law, and when they are so educated the law is not needed; and
         so in legislating on the question of interest the law reducing the rate of interest in the
         absence of money will amount to nothing, and when money again becomes plenty then you don't
         need the law. The law of supply and demand will always regulate the question of interest,
         and while I stand ready to vote far any and all measures in the interest of the debtor
         class, I am opposed to meddling with the interest law of this State, for I regard it as the
         very best as it is</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I understood the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) to say that members
         representing the people would vote for 6 per cent. Then I suppose if a member thought best
         to vote against this bill he don't represent the people. Now sir, I believe I am as well
         intended to represent the people as the gentleman, but I don't harp a great deal about it.
         The price of money is regulated by the supply and demand. The flow of money is not
         regulated by law. No man will deny that money, like water, will seek its level. It always
         seeks the best market. Do you suppose that voting for or against this bill will be any
         inducement for capitalists to bring money here and put it upon the market? I shall vote
         against the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I don't know whether you can get money at 3, 5 or 8 per cent, nor I don't
         care. It has nothing to do with this question. It has no particular bearing on this
         question. I think this ought to be entitled, "A law to confiscate property." Here is a man
         that has a mortgage on his farm, and insurance companies don't make loans for so long a
         time that they never fall due. Here is a man that has a loan of several thousand dollars
         bearing 6 per cent. interest, and when it becomes due they would not renew it at 6 per
         cent; it must be raised to 8. I do not believe in trying to humbug the people and at the
         same time do them a great injury. Suppose all the debts in the city of Indianapolis had to
         be paid under such a bill. What would be the condition of business? What would be the
         result if the debts in the city of Indianapolis would have to be paid to the foreign
         insurance companies and foreign loan companies under this bill? I think there is no demand
         for this law by the people. I will vote against the bill. I should vote against it if it
         was at 7 per cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I should think myself recreant to my constituents if I did not say just a few
         words on this subject. On behalf of the farmers of my own county I would say there are many
         of them who have their farms shingled with mortgages. These mortgages are falling due every
         day. On these is interest at six, seven and eight per cent. They have no money to pay these
         mortgages when they become due, and if they can not renew them the mortgages must be
         foreclosed. I hope the bill will not become a law.</p>
        <p>Pending this discussion the House adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH offered a resolution directing the <orgName>Committee on Swamp Land and
          Drains</orgName> to prepare and introduce a bill to repeal an act concerning drainage,
         approved April 8, 1881</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I hope that this resolution will not pass. It proposes to
         give an expression of this Senate upon the Circuit Court drainage law. The experience in
         our part of the State is that this is the most effective and the most economical drainage
         law that we have ever had. Under its provisions economical and effective work has been
         done, and I have reason to suppose that in both of the counties that I represent, as well
         as in all counties where drainage is desirable, it would be regarded as a great calamity if
         this law were repealed. In my counties I understand it has steadily grown in favor. We have
         had able and judicious commissioners and if all counties will see that they have such, I
         think opposition to the bill will cease.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS did not think this resolution should be passed. So important a matter should
         not be considered in the absence of so many Senators. He moved it be made a special order

        <p>The joint resolution [H. R. 1] proposing an amendment to the State Constitution by
         declaring that County Clerks, Auditors, Treasurers, Sheriffs, Coroners, and Surveyors shall
         be elected for a term of four years and eligible to but four years in a term of eight
         years, coming up with a committee amendment that the terms of such officers shall commence
         on the first day of January after their election, and excepting Surveyors from the
         restriction—</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks: The committee thought best to except Surveyors from the
         restrictions of a four year term because in many counties there is a difficulty in
         obtaining good and well qualified Surveyors.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, could see no reason why Clerks, Treasurers and Sheriffs
         should not hold office four years the same as Auditors, Recorders, and perhaps others.
         Neither could he conceive why the simple fact of a man having had such an office for four
         years should be a reason—and the only reason—to preclude such an one from holding that
         office another four years if the people so desire. If this resolution must pass as it is
         the proposed amendment excluding the Surveyor from re-election is desirable. He moved to
         amend by striking out the restriction against re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE opposed this amendment. Wherever there is an office elected at stated terms
         the motive to secure a re-election at all hazards should be removed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: Such an amendment would be in contravention of a constitutional restriction
         that these officers shall not serve more than eight years in a term of twelve.</p>
        <pb n="199" xml:id="VAA8558-22-199"/>

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, thought the constitutional restriction a wise one to prevent
         scheming for re-election.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Campbell's) was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY offered an amendment that appointees shall hold only till the January next
         succeeding a general election.</p>
        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to exempt, from this proposed prohibition the Clerk as well as the
         Surveyor. There is as much difficulty in finding efficient Clerks well as Surveyors.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER opposed that amendment. The object of the resolution is to prevent
         office-holders from using their offices to secure a re-election. They can so manipulate
         things as to re-elect themselves whether the people want them or not.</p>

        <head rend="center">SUPREME COURT CLERK DUTIES.</head>
        <p>Mr. Macy's bill [S. 89] to amend Sections 5, 825 and 5,830 of the code, coming up as a
         special order for this hour, Mr. M explained its provisions. It proposes, among other
         things, to increase the bond of the Clerk, which is ridiculously small, from $2,000 to
         $10,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, read the statute governing the Clerks of the Circuit Courts
         in keeping of amounts of moneys received for fees. If this is a good law for Clerks of
         Circuit Courts it would be a good law for Clerks of the Supreme Court, which this bill
         proposes. This bill ought to pass because the law should apply to Clerks of both
         courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY thought this bill of sufficient demand the attention of every Senator. It is a
         vicious and unfair measure. It proposes to throw open to the public the office of the
         Supreme Court, when Clerks and Sheriffs of counties are the only parties interested. It
         would open to the public the books of the Clerk, so that all classes of ferrets and
         shysters can go in that office and run down any fees that may be lying there uncalled for.
         A man living in Randolph County has a power of attorney from 800 men, authorizing him to go
         into the Supreme Court Clerk's office and collect such fees, if any, as may be due them.
         There is no reason for the passage of a law to make the Clerk or his deputy a criminal, if
         he should refuse to drop his business at any time to allow a ferret to come in and overhaul
         his books. Then, to make the record proposed in this law would cost this Clerk several
         thousand dollars. We ought not to pass a law simply to give power to one man to reap a rich
         harvest. He moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER did not know till this bill came up there was such a weak place in the law as
         to allow a public officer to come into possession and claim as individual property certain
         fees, and carry them away upon going out of office. This bill proposes to cure this defect.
         Then there is no law requiring the Clerk of the Supreme Court to keep a record of fees paid
         in. The books ought to be a public record.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH stated that every member of the committee who considered this was in favor
         of its passage. He hoped the bill will not be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS thought the bill, S. 125, which requires the Clerk of the Supreme Court to
         keep a public record in which will be kept a register of these fees, and turn them over to
         his successor, is sufficient legislation in this direction. He favored the indefinite
         postponement of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, understood this bill to be in the interest of a job or a class of
         fellows who are in a close co-operation to ferret out some dead fees in the office of the
         Supreme Court Clerk. In all courts, under the present machinery, any citizen can get his
         fees without employing a ferret. There are no fees belonging to anybody except two classes
         - those paid in for transcript of record, and where a writ issues from the Supreme Court to
         the Sheriff of any county and the Sheriff makes the service. The Sheriff in the court below
         keeps a record of his own cost, and does not need a ferret. This bill proposes to make the
         Clerk go to the expense of $5,000 to make a record, going back so many years, in order that
         some fellow may find out how much the Clerk of the Supreme Court makes out of his
         office.</p>
        <p>The present statute covers all that should be required of this or any other public
         officer in this respect. The presumption is that every officer performs his duties until
         the contrary is made to appear. We should not cast reproach upon them.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The Clerk of the Supreme Court has no collection of costs, but the Sheriff,
         who is a responsible officer, filing a bond in a large sum. The Senator from Jennings has
         shown the law, as at present, is ample. This bill seems to be the offspring of a desire on
         the part of the Republicans to cut down and absolutely ruin every office in Indiana, seeing
         they are barred out for a long time. Another purpose has been re- <pb n="200"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-200"/> ferred to - that of delegating some attorney who wants to go
         nosing around that office as a ferret.</p>
        <p>He moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was not seconded by the Senate</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This bill contemplates the keeping of a record from and after its passage
         only. It will cost nothing for the Clerk of the Supreme Court to open his books. Fair
         dealing is not afraid of the day light. The people of the State should know how much any
         public officer obtains by the way of fees or otherwise as compensation. The Clerk of the
         Supreme Court will not let it be known what fees are in his possession. There is no danger
         of a bill which simply provides that the books of the Clerk of the Supreme Court shall be
         thrown open. There is no valid reason why these records should made the public property of
         every citizen in the State</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill has been misrepresented or misunderstood. If this bill is in the
         interest of a job he favored the job. He could see no job in it, however. Every man who
         assists in the support of a public office or public officer should have the privilege of
         examining the records of such office. This bill only requires the keeping of a record of
         fees after its passage. It is a good bill and ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE had but just read the bill, but saw nothing wrong in it. The Clerk is not here
         resisting this bill nor asking friends to. He was for the bill with proper
         restrictions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macy understands the Clerk now keeps just such a record as the bill requires.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY withdrew his motion to indefinitely postpone.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE the bill was referred to a special committee of three with
         instructions to report tomorrow at 2 p.m.</p>

        <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY APPROPRIATION.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, the bill [H. R. 15] - see page 115] to appriate
         $40,000 to Purdue University, was read the third time. He was physically unable to raise
         his voice in such a manner as he desired in favor of this bill. He had not the strength to
         go into the details of the present management, but spoke a few words in favor of the
         immediate passage of the bill, substantially as follows:</p>
        <p>Mr. PRESIDENT - This appropriation was made two years ago by the General Assembly, butt
         failed on account of the failure of the appropriation bill, in which it had been embodied.
         After Purdue University had thus, by a mere technicality, and against the expressed opinion
         of the State, been deprived of its legitimate support, the question arose, what was to be
         done? The endowment fund granted by the General Governrment is a conditional one, and
         reverts to the United States Government of the State of Indiana fails to maintain the
         University. If Purdue on amount of the temporary absence of funds had closed its doors,
         that fund would have been forfeited, and Indiana would have lost one of her great
         educational institutions. In this predicament a number of patriotic citizens of wealth and
         influence came to the assistance of the University, and through their personal efforts
         secured the means to save Purdue to the State. For these efforts these men are entitled to
         the gratitude of the State of Indiana, because they were inspired by the unselfish and
         noble motives, prompted by the desire to do an act of justice and merit, and trusting to
         the honor and good faith of the state, which, through its General Assembly, had already
         declared for the appropriation, to be reimbursed for the assistance they had rendered.</p>
        <p>It is this appropriation of two years ago which, then, by a decided majority of the
         Senate and the House was deemed requisite for the success of Purdue University, which I ask
         the Senate to allow without further delay. Certainly the Senate can not perform a fairer,
         juster and more meritorious act, for in doing so the Senate at once expresses its will to
         sustain the educational interests of the State, and it redeems an obligation for which, so
         to say, the honor of the State stands pledged.</p>
        <p>Two years ago a certain opposition was made to this appropriation on account of a certain
         Greek fraternity rule which had been introduced and which was highly objectionable to some
         Senators. This rule has not been in practical operation for years and the University is now
         under the management of one of the best practical educators in the West, Professor Smart.
         It is for this Senate now to give Mr. Smart such a support as will enable him really to
         make Purdue University what we all want it to be, a pride to the whole State of Indiana. If
         it can be done, it will be done by President Smart. Let not a dissenting voice be heard
         against this bill.</p>
        <p>The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 34, nays 6</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, said: I have persistently opposed the establishment of a
         college of that kind at the expense of the people of the State as going beyond the limit of
         education by taxation; and having voted against the original bill creating this university,
         I now vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE, in explanation of his vote, said: I was recently at Purdue University, and
         made a thorough inspection of this college with one or more of the professors. I am
         satisfied it is doing a great and a good work, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, when his name was called, said: In explanation of my vote I want to read an
         extract from a speech of a Senator on this floor two years ago. He lives in the
         neighborhood of this university, and I read it in explanation of my vote [Reads Mr. Magee"s
         remarks, bottom of first column, page 217, Brevier Reports, volume XXI] On that information
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said: I am pleased with a great many of the benevolent institutions of this
         State, but I have visited none that gave me such an exalted idea of the proper mode of
         instruction as Purdue University did. It draws the student from his books sufficiently to
         give him practical ideas of life, and at the same time turns him out a scientific
         gentleman. I saw perhaps fifty young ladies carving wood - opening out avenues to ladies,
         and giving them not only a scientific, but a mechanical education. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above, and then the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. Pleasant's bill [H. R. 64] concerning the duties of County Superintendents, comming
         up on the second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I believe this is the bill said to render County
         Superintendents more efficient; however, I move that the bill be indefinitely
         postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: The bill will rectify a gross imposition practiced by County
         Superintendents. By its provisions, instead of a County Superintendent continually visiting
         schools as he may please, in order to put in time and draw his salary, such visits are put
         into the hands of and curtailed by Township Trustees. A great many schools need no visiting
         at all</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: There are two reasons, especially, why this bill should not
         pass. It provides that the County Superintendent shall visit every school a half day of
         each year. Taking my county as sample, you would be compelled to extend the calendar to
         provide for it. You might as well strike down our whole school system as to bind it as this
         bill will do.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: County Superintendents are allowed by law $4 per day for days actually
         employed, but all of them draw full compensation for every working day in the year. The
         Superintendent in our county draws per annum $1,300, and the school has only a five-months
         term per year. These salaries keep increasing. It is not, I say, the fault of the County
         Superintendents that they draw a salary for every working day in the year, but the fault of
         the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: This is a very important question and should be looked at calmly and acted upon
         deliberately. The bill is a proposition to strike out of existence the office of County
         Superintendent virtually, I say, to destroy it. The bill provides that County
         Superintendents shall visit schools only when invited by Township Trustees. Now, many of
         the Township Trustees are arrayed against the office of County Superintendent, and they
         would not permit such officers to visit the schools under their jurisdiction. The gentlemen
         of this House should look well before they strike this fatal blow at our Public School
         system. Though there may be but five months school term in a year, yet the Superintendent
         has other duties, and many of them to perform. He has those duties that the law provides -
         nothing more, nothing less. This effort to stab our school system should be driven from
         this hall at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I sincerely hope that the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill will
         prevail. Last week some on the floor of this House contended that the Township Trustees
         were not competent to elect the County School Superintendents - that they should be
         selected by the State Board of Education. Now they come at us with the proposition to have
         these Trustees stand over and guard the Superintendents. If you want to repeal the law and
         destroy the office come out boldly and say so.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: The idea of a man standing on the floor of this House and talking about
         stabbing our public school system is humbug. It certainly is not the intention of the
         law-makers or the taxpayers to have this law to create an office for somebody. The laws are
         to advance the education of the children. Twelve years ago we got along well enough with
         the plain School Examiner. Now we have Boards of Education, Trustees and a County School
         Superintendent. And this Superintendent rides around and draws his $4 per day for riding in
         his buggy or a sleigh. Gentle men, it is robbery - nothing less. The rich can send their
         children to graded schools, but the poor must be content with the public schools. And would
         it not be better for this money - this $4 per day - to be expended in another direction?
         Apply it where it will benefit the children; give them nine months school in the year
         instead of five months. The County Superintendents of this State cost on an average of
         $1,200 each.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I have the figures to show that the average is not $400 each per year.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Even that is too much for the good they do.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: Does the gentleman know that the County Superintendent is not paid out of the
         tuition fund, and therefore the money paid them could not be used in extending or
         lengthening the terms of school?</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I know that, but it comes off the tax-ridden people all the same. Regard the
         people at home a <choice>
          <sic>tittle</sic>
          <corr>little</corr>
         </choice> more. Keep the money at home and give your children the benefit of it. No County
         Superintendent has a right to call upon a school at the rate of $4 per day, unless his
         distinguished presence is needed there. All there is to it is, it is an office for some
         man.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: When the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patten) throws out such insinuations
         concerning the office of County Superintendent, he throws the insinuations at the opinions
         of such men as Milton B. Hopkins, John M. Boss, James H. Smart and other distinguished
         educators. The County Superintendent is as needful now as ever. His enemies have come here
         ever since the office was established to fight it, but they have been defeated every time
         and will be this time. If any man does not wish to trust the County Superintendent as to
         the amount of labor he performs, let him go home and call on the County Commissioners of
         his county. They audit the bills of the Superintendent and allow them. Section 4,129 of the
         code says what the duties of the Superintendent are, and the law further says that the
         Commissioners shall state the number of days or the limit of the Superintendent's <pb
          n="202" xml:id="VAA8558-22-202"/> labors. Under this bill political differences between
         the Superintendent and a Township Trustee might prevent the Superintendent from at any time
         paying an official visit to a township. To put the Superintend in the hands of the Trustees
         as this bill proposes is to destroy the office.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual motion - yeas 35, nays 38 - to lay on the table the

        <p>Mr. Staley's bill [H. R. 121] to provide a fund for the holding of teachers' institutes,
         coming up on the second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: I move to strike out the enacting clause.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I sincerely hope this motion will not prevail. The bill proposes that the sum
         of $50 shall be furnished to the County Superintendent by the county for the purpose of
         assisting in paying the expense of an institute which shall be at least a five days'
         session, and further that a very small fee shall be charged the applicants for teachers'
         license who apply for examination for such license, the same to be put into a fund which
         shall be held to pay institute expenses. There institutes should and will, if given an
         opportunity, last about two weeks. The cost for session like this is about $150 in anything
         like a good institute. A Superintendent is not going to hold an institute and bear the
         expense himself for fun. As it is now, with these examinations free, a large number attend
         Saturday after Saturday, costing the county a large sum of money, for the examination or
         grading of their papers takes the time of the Superintendent at $4 per day. Applicants
         appear again and again for merely the trial - not expecting to teach. A small charge for
         examination will have a tendency to decrease the number of applicatns, lessen the work and
         the expense of the Superintendent's office, besides creating a swelling fund for the
         payment of institute expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: In the first place the bill aims to lessen the expenses County
         Superintendents by taxing those who apply only for fun or mere trial. These take as much
         time as any. Instead of Tippecanoe County having 600 applicants it will have no more than
         400.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: My objection to the bill is that the proposed plan to raise an institute
         fund does not lessen the $4 per day salary of the County Superintendent. He might continue
         the institute on and on, in order to draw, his per diem.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: He would hardly do that, when if he were disposed to draw $4 for every day, he
         might, instead of doing the hard work of an institute go on a visit to some small
         school.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I would like to ask the author of the bill this: Does the bill in any way
         increase the per diem of the County Superintendant?</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: Not in the least. It is to provide an institute for the teachers - that's
         all.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I do not favor the proposition in the bill to tax teachers for library to be
         held by the Gounty Superintendent. I prefer to invest my money in books on my home shelf,
         and not invest in one twenty or thirty miles away where it do me no good. The bill should
         be amended as to that</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. STALEY, the bill was recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on
          Education</orgName>.</p>

        <head rend="center">STATE HOUSE FUND INVESTIGATION.</head>
        <p>Mr. Smith's of Delaware, bill [S. 290] for the investment in interest bearing bonds or
         securities of the State of the 10 per cent, left on the work done and material accepted
         upon the new State-house, was read the second time - being the special order for this
         hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: In 1878 the State-house Commissioners under the law of 1877 contracted for the
         completion of the new State-home, and it was agreed that 10 per cent. of money due should
         be retained in the State Treasury as a guarantee that the contract would be carried out.
         There is now of that fund about $102,000. In case of a failure on the part of the
         contractors to carry out their agreement this fund belongs to the State. These moneys lie
         idle and there is a necessity for its use by the State just now. The bill also provides
         whenever in the future this amount shall reach $5,000 it is to be likewise invested, and it
         accumulates at the rate of about $2,000 per month. The contractors have lost money and will
         probably lose more, but the Commissioners say they are living up strictly and literally to
         their contracts. The bill will result to the benefit of the contractors or of the State and
         he hoped it would pass. It is universally approved</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD saw no objection to the bill. It is proper that the contractors should enjoy
         the interest to be derived thereupon if they fulfill their contract. He moved to amend by
         striking out the word "par," and insert in lieu the words "at the lowest market rate, not
         less than par." The State should have the benefit of any rate above par that could be
         obtained.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER hoped the bill will not pass. Its title should be "a bill to grant the
         contractor more pay." He opposed the State laying its hand on the State-house contract in
         any manner, way or form. This is like the same old bill of two years ago, which proposed to
         give these contractors $300,000 more than their contract calls for. It is said they have
         lost money. Many contractors lose money, notwithstanding which it is their duty to
         faithfully carry out their contract. Not one dollar of the $102,000 the Senator from
         Delaware refers to is in the State Treasury, and never was. It was not the intention that
         10 per cent. retained should be in the Treasury. Who is asking this to be done? The
         proposition is unfair to tax the people of the State on this $100,000 and $5,000 in
         additional as fast as it accrues, in order to pay the interest thus secured, over to these
         contractors, who have no right to it than anyone else. Why should they ask to be voted an
         additional bonus for doing what they have contracted and agreed to do? This is a bad bill.
         It is a proposition to vote these contractors a bonus over and above their contract price
         for building the State-house.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, was at first inclined to believe this bill was a good thing -
         believing it to be a proposition to take money lying idle and loan it to the State - but on
         investigation soon arrived at a different conclusion. The bill proposes to loan 10 per
         cent. of the cost of the State house, which exists only in the credit of the State. There
         is no such fund anywhere. There never has been an appropriation made ex- <pb n="204"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-204"/>ceeding 90 per cent. of the cost, of the building each year. The
         balance is a reserve, and will remain a reserve until the additional 10 per cent. is
         appropriated. If this bill has any purpose it is simply to issue bonds for the credit of
         the State and give the interest to these contractors. It would be loaning wind and reaping
         a whirlwind. The bill ought not to be engrossed</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware: That fund is somewhere, either deposited to the credit of the
         State or elsewhere in the hands of the Treasurer of State. He made the statement upon his
         own personal legitimate conclusion. It it infinitely better for this investment to be made
         than to have this large museum in the hands of the party it now is, subject to loss.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: There are different statements made in regard to this matter.
         If there is in the Treasury a ten per cent. fund then the passage of this bill is merely
         supplying an omission in the original contract. It would be saying the contract should have
         read: The contractors would have the withheld ten per cent. with interest. If the
         contractors have earned the money and the money is lying idle, he greatly preferred the
         contractors should have the interest on it in case they completed their contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD read from the State-house contract and declared the money ought to be in the
         Treasury.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY preferred all investigations in regard to this matter should be made before the
         bill is ordered to the engrossment.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER also opposed its engrossment.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE did not suppose there would be much, if any, objection to this bill, it being a
         proposition that in one case would accrue to the benefit of the contractors, and in the
         other case to the benefit of the State. This bill is to fund and money already earned, the
         accrued interest thereon to go to the contractors if they complete the building according
         to their agreement, otherwise it accrues to the benefit of the State. The State House
         Commissioners suggested this bill, and he saw no valid objection to it. There is no
         authority of law to collect but 90 per cent of the State-house levy. These contractors have
         earned that 10 per cent - it is theirs absolutely, and why should they not have interest
         upon it? They have lost $300,000, and there is no bill here to reimburse them, nor will
         there be. This 10 per own per cent. has been collected and paid into the Treasury, as can
         be seen by referring to page eighty-five of the report of the State house Commissioners. To
         whom does it belong? The contractors have advanced this money, and it belongs to them in
         the eye of the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks, moved that the bill be referred to a select Committee of
         Three, with power to send for persons and papers, and ascertain as to whether or not this
         10 per cent. is in the State Treasury.</p>
        <p>The Presiding Officer [Mr. Willard in the chair] ruled it out of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of St. Joseph, with great reluctance opposed any measure advocated by his
         respected seat mate (Mr. Smith). If this money were lying in the Treasury, he should favor
         this bill as a matter that would be fair either to the State or to the contractors. There
         is no money comes into the Treasury for State-house purposes except through the special
         levy therefor. The report of the committee would seem to indicate the money is in the
         Treasury, but it simply means this is due the contractors, entitled to be drawn when the
         work is done the amount stated $98,000, but the Auditor's report shows there is but
         $64,000, and these are the only books we have to go by. This $64,000 is all that there is
         in the Treasury for current expenses, and 10 per cent. contemplated in the bill is not yet
         collected. To the end we may have further knowledge on this matter. I move it be made a
         special order for Thursday at 10 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS opposed the mmotion, and predicated his opposition to the bill on the wording
         of the contract itself. Under that contract not a dollar of this 10 per cent. is due till
         the entire contract is completed and the State house accepted. The 10 per cent. is not the
         money of the contractors, but the money of the State, any interest that may be given them
         would be but a present - a bonus - to the contractors. Senators who advocate this bill
         certainly do so under a misapprehension.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON two years ago was a member of the committee which investigated this State
         house matter. Then there was no question that this 10 per cent. fund was in the State
         Treasury in cash. Two years have since elapsed and larger sums have been expended than in
         any other two years of the construction of the State house. He moved to amend the motion
         for an investigation by making the committee 3 with instructions to report the condition of
         this fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY. This contract was made under the law. This money is only there conditionally,
         and in the event of the contractors failing, the money will never be in the Treasury. Two
         years ago it was the policy of the Legislature to let this new State House matter severely
         alone, and that policy ought now to be pursued. Any legislation, however trivial it may
         seem, might interfere with the satisfactory progress now being made. He opposed this bill
         as a matter of policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: As Chairman of the <orgName>State House Committee</orgName> in the House in
         1879, and of the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> in the Senate in 1883, he had
         considerable knowledge of this matter. This fund should be in the State Treasury. This bill
         simply says that this money lying idle, or loaned by someone without authority, shall be
         loaned for the State's benefit on one hand, or the contractors' benefit on the other; and
         he saw <pb n="205" xml:id="VAA8558-22-205"/>no objection to it. It does not conflict with
         fair dealing, nor does it conflict with any contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, made an ineffectual motion to recommit the bill to the
          <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
        <p>The motion for a select committee of three was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>. It
         was so ordered.</p>

         1 - see page 18] to regulate and improve the civil service of the State - similar to the
         New York and national civil service reform laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE spoke in favor of his bill a half hour before the recess for dinner and an
         hour and a half after. The wisdom of civil service reform is demonstrated not merely by
         reason, but by experience and historic fact. It is no longer an experiment. It has been
         tried, and is everywhere successful. Its success has been tested, not during a month or a
         year, but during a long series of years; not in one form of government alone, but by the
         governments of many of the most civilized communities in existence. It is self evident that
         the right of appointment to office is a trust; that the duty is to appoint the man best
         qualified for the office - the ones who will best serve the people in his official
         capacity. The notion that any man or party has a right to an office is erroneous. The right
         is in the whole people to have the best servants; the right is in the taxpayer to have the
         best work performed for the money which he is required to pay for it. It is just much a
         crime in principle to appoint to office one unfit to perform its duties, on account of
         personal or party services, as to devote the public money to personal or campaign uses. If
         there be any claim to office by any person it is the claim of the fittest person to hold it
         solely on account of his fitness. If these conclusions are correct, the only remaining
         question is: "By what system of general rules can the fitness of men for office be best
         determined?"</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE MILITIA.</head>
        <p>Mr. Howard's bill [S. 88 - see page 176] coming up as a special order, on motion by Mr.
         Hilligass, Section 58 was amended by additional guards as to the authorities of militia in
         case of disturbances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilligass moved to amend Section 73 so that there shall be an annual appropriation
         not exceeding $10,000 a year for uniforms, $12 to each militiaman, and $10,000 for a
         military fund - this as a substitute for a pending motion to strike out this section, made
         when the bill was last under consideration.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: There is no more difference between this substitute and Section
         73 than there is between tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. This substitute is an appropriation
         of $10,000 a year for clothes, a new suit for each militiamen every three years, in the
         first division, and the second division is called section 74 and appropriates $10,000 a
         year for a <choice>
          <sic>malitia</sic>
          <corr>militia</corr>
         </choice> fund. This is an appropriation of $20,000 a year from what the taxpayer brings to
         the vaults of the Treasury, without any return of value whatever to the people of the
         State, this military bill having for its purpose none other than to protect people from
         what may arise in the future out of what is called labor rights; and if that is the only
         design the entire bill ought to be defeated. He was willing to support this bill without an
         appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: These amendments propose to make specific appropriations for the militia.
         The original section proposed $20,000 a year. This bill is not advocated in the interest of
         one class against another. Capital and labor must alike be protected. It is one of the
         highest prerogatives of a legislative body to furnish means for the protection of her
         citizens against the irresponsible foreign element having no interest in our government. It
         is interesting to note what other States are doing for their militia. The following are
         some of the States making appropriations: Maine, $16,000; New Hampshire $28,000;
         Massachusetts, $150,000; Rhode Islanad, $23,000; Connecticut, $80,000; New York, $350 000;
         Pennsylvania, $220,000; Louisiana, $27,500; Kentucky, $10,000; Ohio, $60,000; Illinois,
         $150,000; Michigan, $57,000; California, $67,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE had made a rule to follow the recommendation of a committee as to the adoption
         of a bill or resolution. He hoped the day would never come when the unarmed citizen would
         be arrayed against the militia; but the fact stares us in the face that such a state of
         facts has taken place. It is the bane of our politics to array one class of men against
         another. This question, as all others, should be discussed above the question of class. He
         could see no harms in this bill. Is is the safety of the country to have a well-disciplined
         militia. If this amendment is not made the bill will be practically useless. If the time
         should come when the militia is needed, it will be needed at once, and needed badly. The
         bill ought to pass. This State, the richest in the Union according to area and population,
         by this bill would give but $20 000 a year to the support of her militia. If we have a
         militia we must appropriate money to carry it on. The oldest and best disciplined company
         in the State is at Logansport, kept up by the public spirited citizens</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, favored a military law for the regulation of the militia of the State,
         but he opposed the amendment as in language not easily understood. It would take the mind
         of Judge Story to tell what the proposed Section 73 means. He agreed <pb n="206"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-206"/> with the Senator from Jennings, if the substitute means anything
         it means the same as the original section in the bill. He did not believe any Senator could <choice>
          <sic>intelligentl</sic>
          <corr>intelligently</corr>
         </choice> discuss any ten sections in this bill, nor is there half a dozen who understand
         the seventy four sections of this bill. If it becomes a law Senators will have more trouble
         in being returned to the Senate than they dream of.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The object of this bill is to create a paid militia in the State
         for the purposes named. He hoped the Senate would refuse to appropriate a dollar; such an
         appropriation can not be justified before the constituents of any member</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded, by the Senate, and under its operations the first division of
         the proposed amendment - section 73, to appropriate a sum sufficient to pay $12 once in

        <p>Mr. ENGLE moved to amend Section 2 of the bill by striking out the words "two or more" in
         the first line and substituting the word "one." Very often but two men are directly
         interested in the ditch, which will, however, be of public utility, and if it would take
         two or more to start proceedings for a ditch, a case like that just stated could not be
         reached. One man should have power to move for a ditch in this instance.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I think with a few amendments this law is what our people need and want.
         Drainage laws are too valuable to be neglected or thrown aside. One man should have the
         power to move for a ditch in cases like this.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I think that the "one man power" is dangerous in cases where a great many are
         affected. It should read "two or more land owners," or "50 per cent. or more of such land
         owners.' I hope the section will remain just as it is, unless some better amendment than
         the one proposed is found.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNN: It makes no difference whether one, two or more land owners start the machinery
         in motion. Section 3 of that bill provides that a majority of the land owners shall go
         before the court, and that the same shall decide from their testismony.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: This bill will be improvement on the old law. An amendment should be made
         curtailing remonstrances after the ditch has been ordered.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe: The gentleman from Allen (Mr. McHenry) will find further in the
         bill a remedy for the evil he fears. I have no personal grievance in this bill. My ditch is
         done. But I look to the views of the people over the State. I believe that one man should
         not be given the power, but that it should be 50 per cent. or more of the land owners.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: My notion is the petition should be signed by two or three more - I would
         rather it were twenty - but two will do, for lands not named in the petition will be
         affected. This section should stand. The only men who can remonstrate are those not named
         in the petition, but reported by the Drainage Commissioners.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I move to amend as follows: Add to Section 2 the following: "In case there
         are but two land-owners affected, then one shall be sufficient to petition."</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved to amend Section 3 as that, instead of notices being sent to the
         postoffice address of such owners, they shall be notified by summons. He said: I am opposed
         to all laws that may make it possible to levy upon any man's property without due course of
         law. There is only one law of this kind now - the highway law.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: I hope that the amendment of the gentleman from Davies (Mr.
         Taylor) will not prevail. This law says that every land-owner shall be notified none can be
         harmed by it. The amendment will double the costs of the ditch. If this amendment is tacked
         on, I shall be compelled to vote <choice>

        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This is no political measure. Both of the conventions of Marion County
         which nominated the candidates to the Legislature last fall, pledged themselves to this
         measure. It looks especially to Indianapolis. In the offices which the bill designs to

         out of office, but at the expiration of their terms the offices are done away with. I want

        <head rend="center">RELIEVING SURETIES</head>
        <p>Mr. Pendleton's bill [H. R. 56] to relieve Jesse A. Avery and others Township Trustee,
         who lost money by the failure of certain Indianapolis banks, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: Some have said that to pass this bill will be to establish a bad
         precedent. Had this loss come to any of these trustees through any negligence of their own
         or through any speculation, it would not be the just thing for us to release them. But
         those Indianapolis banks where the money was deposited looked to us all sound. It would be
         only an act of charity and right for us to relieve these trustees. The night before the
         suspension of the banks everyone thought that the banks were among the strongest. The
         trustees invested or placed their money at the very place which they thought was the
         safest. In the acts of 1881 we find a case precisely parallel with this; in 1883 we find
         another. The Constitution. the Supreme Court and the Speaker of the HOuse have held the
         justice of parallel cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I said some time ago that this act would be unconstitutional. I understand
         that in these cases there are judgments already rendered against some of them. I need not
         say to you that the judgments give vested rights that this Legislature or no other body has
         the right to destroy or curtail. I understand that there are some of these cases where
         judgments are not given. Here is where I make my point. This confirms the contract - if
         good in one case it is good in another. The banks were paving interest on this money
         deposited there and that is the reason that such funds were taken there. I do not care to
         go home and by my vote say to the trustees of our county that they can invest the people's
         money as they please - in park, in wheat margins, or any other avenue of trade. On the
         contrary. I want them to understand that they and their securities must be good for the
         money. I do not want them to think that they can lose the money and then that I will go to
         the Legislature and have them released as others have been.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I did not intend to say another word on this bill, but the opposition
         remains persistent. It seems to have no charity for the unfortunate. The gentleman who just
         preceded me (Mr. Brownlee) seems to doubt the power of the Legislature to release these
         men. But against his opinion is the opinions of the highest courts of Indiana and that of
         preceding Legislatures. He finds fault with the trustees for putting this money in banks.
         Would they have kept it at home to be taken by robbers? Then he would have said that they
         were negligent, that they should have placed their money in the banks as business men do.
         The office of Township Trustee is not a paying one. And if a man takes it, and if the funds
         should by accident be lost, will his neighbors or the Legislature turn against him? Suppose
         the lightning from Heaven should destroy his home and the funds, would you take the
         trustee's stock or his all for the lost money? No one would think of that but the honorable
         gentleman who has just preceded me.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This question of constitutionality can be settled in a word.
         The highest courts of the country sustain bankrupt laws, and bankrupt laws overthrow
         contracts entered into. Our hearts, of course, should not be our whole lives, but we should
         temper our acts with mercy. Two years ago we relieved a Township Trustee and a County
         Treasurer. I did not know the politics of these men; I merely inquired into the necessities
         of the case and voted for their relief. I have investigated this case, believing that we
         should be humane and that they were faultless, I shall vote for the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: From the interest manifested by certain parties here, one would be led to
         suppose that a matter of very great importance is to be passed upon; that there will be
         great loss and actual suffering unless by act of the Legislature relief is granted. What
         are the facts? Certain Trustees of Marion County deposited money in Indianapolis banks that
         failed. The most that is claimed is that some of them have been compelled to mortgage their
         farms to obtain the money to pay these losses. Gentlemen claim that it would be an act of
         charity to pass this bill, which authorizes the levying of a tax in each township to
         reimburse the Trustee. If the loss to a Trustee is $2,000, backed by the action of the
         Assem- <pb n="208" xml:id="VAA8558-22-208"/>bly he will place a tax on the people of his
         township by which they will be made to pay $1,999 of this loss. This will be collected from
         many who are poor and ought to be free after bearing the burden of tax that would
         legitimately fall upon them. If these men and their bondsmen are to be relieved - if the
         bond in their case is to go for naught then, indeed, should we dispense with the formality
         of making bonds. If bonds are not to bind, it is worse than child's play to require them to
         be made. My friend from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) opens his big heart and says he is willing to
         assist those in distress - that his people have big hearts in them. 0, yes! Extremely
         charitable and benevolent. But I notice that his charity amounts to this: He doesn't
         propose to go down into his own pocket to get a single copper - he don't propose to take a
         single cent from those constituents of his who have hearts in them - but in his unbounded
         generosity he is willing to compel the laboring men of Marion County make good the losses
         of these Trustees. There is no charity in this - nothing that looks like benevolence. The
         maker of the bond should expect, and does expect, to make good the losses. The bondsmen
         expect to stand the losses, if any come. This action would authorize carelessness; it would
         authorize parties throughout the State to come here for relief. It is unwise legislation,
         and ought not to be indulged in.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE in explanation of his vote saying: I think the Democratic two third majority
         upon the floor of this Senate is entitled to the assistance of at least one or two
         Republicans in the able, earnest and disinterested efforts to prove to the people of
         Indiana that it meant what it said in its State platform; and if it can't prove it meant
         what it said, to help it come as nearly to what it said as possible; I am, therefore, in
         favor of the thirteen year limitation, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: I desire to say in explanation that I voted in favor of the
         fourteen years old limitation, but that being out of the way, now I shall vote "aye" on
         this question.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCullough, when his name was called, said: I desire to keep within the spirit of the
         Democratic platform. My friend, the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) has been reading
         Republican literature so long that he is unable to read aright a Democratic platform. So
         far as this legislation is intended to protect children from being employed in pursuits
         that are dangerous, or will cause them to be cruelly treated or overworked, that far I am
         in favor of the legislation. But the legislation must be on the ground of protection of the
         children, not on the ground of taking their labor out of competition with older persons. If
         it is put upon the ground of taking their labor out of competition with other persons, you
         might as well attempt to prevent all persons worth over $10,000 from engaging in certain
         employments. A proposition foreign to our institutions. Citizens of this country are
         supposed to be free and equal before the law. A monopoly ought not to be created or
         attempted by excluding from competition any class of persons. I think the age of twelve is
         the proper one to take the place of the restriction, and vote "no".</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD, when his name was called, said: I think there can be no misapprehension as
         to what the Democratic platform says. It says distinctly [Reads.] I am distinctly in favor
         of that, no matter what the Republican party may have done, I am aware is has been false to
         every pledge for the last eighteen years, but that's no excuse for the Democratic party,
         when it came into power, to break pledges to the people it made to put it there. I voted to
         place that limit at fourteen years, just as the platform which we carried this State upon,
         and gained a two thirds majority in this Senate, says it should be: but I am not one of
         those who believe in "rule or ruin;" if I can't get all I want, I take the next best thing.
         I therefore vote, under protest, for thirteen years because I can't get fourteen. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was taken as announced above, and so the amendment was defeated.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY moved that the bill be engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: If the purpose of the bill is to protect child labor from competition with
         adult labor it is defective, because there are thousands of employments outside of mines
         and factories where children come into competition with adult labor. If the purpose is to
         protect children who are too young to know the hazard of dangerous employments, I think it
         ought to be limited to a prohibition from laboring in those factories where there is danger
         to life or limb, and the bill ought to enumerate such dangerous employments. I am not
         willing to vote that a child shall not earn its own living in the best manner possible
         where there is no danger attached to the employment. For the purpose of protecting adult
         labor the bill should be much wider than it is. I move to strike out the words "or engaged
         in any other kind of manufacturing in the State"</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: I hope that amendment will not prevail. This bill seeks to prohibit child
         labor for several reasons, first because children under the age of fourteen ought to be in
         the public schools furnished by the State, not only for the purposes of education but
         because in factories and workshops their health and constitution are undermined. A good
         physical constitution and education are the foundation of good citizenship. A custom has
         grown up under which boys are forced to do men's work at boys' wages. If we attempt to
         limit the application of this bill to one or two classes of labor we would defeat the
         purpose of the bill and confine it to a much smaller limit than we as a party have agreed
         to legislate.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: The proposition amounts to a prohibition against employing
         children in dangerous kinds of labor, such as mining coal, iron and other minerals, and the
         manufacture of iron and steel, and I think it ought to be adopted.</p>

         for the third reading by yeas 25, nays 20</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: I desire to explain my vote. While the bill is a little broader than I am in
         favor of, I am in favor of protecting these children from hazardous employment, and as this
         bill does that to a certain extent I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I desire to say in explanation that I believe if our children are kept out of
         mines and factories we will have a better race of young men and women in twenty years from
         now than were they permitted to work in such places. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET, when his name was called, said: I believe the fathers and mothers of this
         State know better when and where their children shall work than either the Democratic or
         Republican party, or even the Senate. Therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: On behalf of the children of State - that they may have a chance to make an
         honest living and not do the work children are compelled to do - a man's work for a child's
         wages - I am heartily in favor of the bill, and only regret the age has not been limited at
         fourteen. I think it is for the benefit of the children, for there good many parents who do
         not use the <choice>
          <sic>judgmet</sic>
          <corr>judgment</corr>
         </choice>, but who, for the sake of making a few dollars, compel their children to work in
         factories and mines, not having enough sense to know they are taking away their own bread
         and butter, and that their children would have better health and be prepared to earn better
         wages if sent to school. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS, when his name was called, said: In deference to the expressed wish of the
         Democratic party, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I think the passage of the present bill will be a step toward compulsory
         education, therefore I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. Brown's bill [S. 8] to provide for the election of County Superintendents, was read
         the second time, with a favorable committee report and a report recommending that the bill
         lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: This bill proposes to take the selection of County Superintendent from the
         Township Trustees, and have that officer elected by the people. We ought not to make such a
         violent change without there is popular demand for it. The Trustees have the best
         opportunities to judge of the necessities of the school. This office should not be placed
         in a popular election; if so, this office will go like all others, and being last on the
         list, will be subject to trades and political bargains. He has charge of the examination of
         teachers. Two years ago the grades of teaches were elevated by a law then passed. Under it
         a great many incompetent teachers have failed to pass examination, and to those
         dissatisfied men you give the power to say to that officer: "If you refuse me a license,
         you will meet with our opposition, not only in the canvass for the nomination, but at the
         polls." There has been no office kept so free from partisan rule as is this office of
         County Superintendent. I have heard no argument advanced or put forward for this change,
         except in some counties there are Superintendents some dissatisfied teachers desire to get
         rid of by an election.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: Two years ago I introduced a bill not making so many radical
         changes as this bill does. I believe there are some radical defects in the selection, as
         now, of the office of County Superintendent. There ought to be more stability in that
         office, and my bid proposed, as does this one, to make the tenure of office four years.
         There are ways of remedying the defects, and still leave the selection in the hands of the
         Township Trustees. I have yet to hear a good reason why the people should not have the
         privilege of selecting the incumbent of this office. This bill proposes another
         improvement. That he shall present a certificate of qualification as a teacher running
         three years, and issued by the State Board of Education. Judges are nominated under our
         party system, yet I never heard of one swerving from his duty on that account; and the
         people can elect incumbents of this office who will discharge their duties without partisan
         bias. I have no fear such a course would degrade the office. This bill provides for results
         that will greatly benefit the school system. As now the people have little sympathy with
         the office. If the candidate were nominated by his party he would have their sympathy much
         more than were he elected by the Township Trustees.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I believe in the people choosing their rulers. Practically the system in vogue
         is one where the people have delegated the power to Township Trustees. While I do not
         desire to discuss the measure I will read from the abstract of the Bureau of Education
         stating the mode of election of these school officers in each of the Several States of the
         Union. [Reads]. This report shows that in the great Northwestern States the idea of the
         election of this officer by the people is incorporated, and it ought to be relegated and
         left to the people in this State, who are better judges than the ten or fifteen Township
         Trustees. This office now has become subservient to the book agent, map and furniture
         rings.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to substitute the last report - to lay on the table - for the first
         report of the committee.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 22.</p>
        <pb n="212" xml:id="VAA8558-22-212"/>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, explaining: In St. Joseph County the office of County
         Superintendent has been entirely a non-partisan office. We have a Superintendent who has
         held office for years - elected by Democrats and Republicans unanimously. I believe better
         selections for the schools can be made by the Township Trustees, upon whom rests the direct
         responsibility of the schools, than by conventions, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion - yeas 22, nays 23 - to concur in the first report

        <head rend="center">ATTORNEY FEES IN NOTES.</head>
        <p>Mr. Smith's, of Jay, bill [S. 14 - see page 136] to repeal the attorney fee clause in
         notes, coming up on the second reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: In 1873, or previously, the General Assembly passed a law authorizing an
         attorney fee clause to be put in a note. The man who is in default for non payment of money
         should pay the expense of collecting, if collection has to be forced. The people ought to
         have the right to make any contracts in relation to the loan and repayment of money they
         see fit. If the Legislature is to take the paternal relation to the people in this and
         every other thing, it may go so far as to reach inside of domestic relations. When we
         invade the established order for the repayment of money so well known in every respect, it
         should not be done in response to a demand from any particular part of the State. The
         spirit of the law is that the person who has to pay the attorney fee should have the right
         to recover it from the defaulting debtor. I never knew as able a <orgName>Committee on
          Judiciary</orgName> as the present one in this Senate, and when that Committee has
         reported on any measure it is safe for the Senate to follow the recommendation of that
         committee. I hope the bill will be defeated.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: A promise to pay attorney's fees in a promissory note or draft is
         entirely wrong. The attorney's fee always comes off the other fellow, and the attorney
         charges as large a fee as he can. Without this provision in a note the holder usually makes
         a bargain as to what the fee shall be, but when the note contains the attorney's fee clause
         the holder hands it to the lawyer without making a bargain. The valuation of the lawyer's
         fee is regulated by a local custom in reference to the collection of commercial papers
         containing that kind of an agreement. This attorney's fee clause is nothing more or less
         than usurious interest, and will Senators justify usurious interest? He believed the bill
         is a righteous measure, and that it would not injure anybody. He moved a substitute for the
         committee's report that the bill be ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE could not see how an indemnity against loss can be construed as usury or
         interest of any kind, or even compensation for the loan of money. The attorney fee clause
         is simply an indemnity. It is not just that a man who signs a note should impose upon the
         holder the further cost of collection, if forced to do so. I do not believe in this kind of
         legislation over people able to take care of themselves. It is for the good of the people
         that they should protect their own individual rights, and not that we should make that
         attempt for them. Repeal this law and in all classes of cases where there is any doubt of
         of collection, the rate of interest will go up in just those cases where the necessity is
         greatest, and it will hurt the poorer class of people. The interest is put up against the
         poor man, though it may not be known whether he will default or not.</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to order the bill engrossed by yeas 19, nays 24.</p>
        <p>The report of the committee that the bill lie on the table was concurred in by yeas 28,
         nays 14</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, when his name was called, said: I oppose the bill because it is in
         principle wrong. It is an attempt to take away from the people the right to make such
         contracts as they please. I believe every lawyer will agree that instead of being a benefit
         to the actual practitioner of law it is a curse to the profession. It is a wrong to the
         people to say they shall not make such contracts as they see fit. I vote "aye."</p>

         know of no statute or law in the State compelling a person to pay attorney fees unless he
         contracts in writing to pay. Then why does the gentleman offer this amendment compelling a
         railroad company to pay attorney fees in all judgments recovered against them? I never
         represented railroad company, but have uniformly, when employed at all, been employed
         against them; but, sir, I regard this amendment as wrong in principle, and will certainty
         endanger the passage of the bill. I am not in favor of a law that requires any man to pay

        <p>Mr. HOBAN, explaining, said he was opposed to some of the civil rights provisions, but as
         he had to take it without pepper or sauce he would vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE, explaining his vote, said: Knowing that the bill will not abridge rights of
         Germans in Indiana, but give equal rights to all, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND, explaining his vote, said: It has been stated here that there are now equal
         school rights, and because I know that that this bill will not discriminate against the

        <p>Mr. CORY moved to strike out the enacting clause.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I am opposed to bill because it will allow, if not necessitate, a change of
         text books in the State and it will cost the school patrons in Indiana $3,000,000. It will
         also take from the hands of Schools Trustees and put it in the hands of a board which will
         have no interest in your county or mine</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: Gentlemen of this House can not question the integrity of the eight members
         of the Educational Board of State. They are honest, and certainly capable to adopt the best
         text books. They are all educated men. As it is now, before the Trustees of townships,
         there is too much jobbery - schools are too high. There is a wrong some where. The bill
         will not only give us good text books but very much cheaper. If there must be a job, let's
         have one instead of ninety-two. The chief agent of Van Antwerp, Bragg &amp; Co., the school
         book publishers, has been on this floor lobbying against this bill. This indicates beyond
         dispute that the jobbery now going on in this State, for that firm now sells their readers
         in most all parts of the State.</p>

        <p> Mr. Patten's Congressional Apportionment bill [H. R. 422] coming up on second reading,

        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the minority report lay on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE made a point of order that this bill could not be made a special order <pb
          n="215" xml:id="VAA8558-22-215"/> without a two-thirds majority, and that it did not
         receive that vote this forenoon. The miles can not be changed without ten days notice, and
         that had not been given.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS said that the question before the House now was not the special order, but a
         motion to lay the minority report on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippeanoe: Nothing is in order that has been gained by wrong Parliamentary
         ruling</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I hold that this motion to lay the minority report on the table is in order
         only as to this: Because it is the day for bills on second reading, and this bill comes up
         in my practice according to its number - if not a special order.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON maintained that under the rules the Speaker was unfair.</p>
        <p>The motion to lay the minority report on the table was agreed to - yeas 53, nays 37.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, in explanation said: The minority report is the same as the
         present Congressional apportionment it is certainly fair enough for Democrats. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON, when his name was called, said that the minority report was more favorable to
         Democrats than Republicans. I shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand by yeas 53, nays 43, and under its operations the majority
         report was concurred in by yeas 52, nays 41.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH, explaining: The bill is unfair and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK, when his name was called, said: Democrat as I am I must vote against it.
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I can not vote for the bill. I am in favor of leaving well enough alone.
         "No."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOUP: It is unfair, and we should not press such a measure. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: It will return upon us to swamp the Democratic party. "No."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK, of Harrison: It is the best thing for the State. "Aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I cheerfully vote for the bill. No better one could be proposed. I vote
         "yes."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Because it is for the interest of the Democratic party I vote "yea."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Those who know me know that I am no partisan. It is an outrage
         to divide a State as nearly equal politically as this so as to give but two Republican
         Congressmen of the thirteen. A day of reckoning will come. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: My vote is "no," because, unlike the gentleman from Sullivan, I aim higher
         than party power.</p>
        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the bill was ordered
         engrossed by yeas 57, nays 38.</p>

        <p>Just before the adjournment, the State Mexican Veterans' Association visited the House in
         a body. The Speaker [Hon. C. L. Jewett] was made an honorary member of the association.
         General Manson was called upon and returned thanks in behalf of the association for the
         invitation to visit the House. He spoke of its efforts in behalf of pensioning the Mexican
         soldiers, and referred to the fact that but sixty-six veterans were now members of the
         association, while 5,000 men had gone out from Indiana to the Mexican war. Many of these,
         he said, were sleeping upon the battle-fields of Mexico. Of the fact that the Mexican War
         had cost but a little over $50,000,000 and resulted in the addition of territory to the
         United States which annually produced a revenue of $200,000,000. He declared that some
         politicians had refused to do justice to the Mexican soldier, making as a pretext the fear
         that Jeff Davis would be benefited. "Who the devil is Jeff Davis?" said the old gentleman,
         and the House roared with laughter. Major Gordon followed in a short address, and the

        <p>The motion to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Winter's Union Railway bill [S. 189 - see
         page 186] was passed, was taken up.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: It was <choice>
          <corr>represented</corr>
          <sic>reprepresented</sic>
         </choice> in the Senate that it was a purely local question. Even on the third reading
         there was an attempt not to read the bill through. It is a bill for the creation of the
         greatest monopoly ever known in the State of Indiana, and the bill by a tie vote was not
         permitted to be amended I entered a motion for a reconsideration of the vote by which it
         was passed. It would place in the hands of the Union Railway Company just what toll it
         pleased to demand on every car of freight passing through this city. Does that look like a
         bill for building a union depot? It is a close corporation, into which no mans can buy -
         this stock must not alienated or be transferred in any way whatever, except as appertaines
         to the railroads in such proprietary corporation. By this bill, changing all former laws,
         they may go out throughout the whole State, and where they find any land the railways may
         want they can condemn such land according to the provisions of any or either of the
         charters of any of these proprietary railway companies, or other laws. It gives to every
         railroad in the State the right to damn land in fee simple anywhere in the State under the
         charters of any railroad that enters in the city. There never was, in the history of the
         State, such an attempt to pass such a monopoly under the pretence of building a new Union
         Depot in the city of Indianapolis. The bill is skillfully drawn to defeat the will of
         property-holders whose realty is proposed to be used. It absolutely silences the voice of
         the people in the immediate vicinity of property they want, and these provisions are
         extended throughout the State of Indiana. If you pass this bill, for all time to come there
         never can be a company to compete with this Union Railway Company; you practically say no
         railroad line can ever be built from Indianapolis to Evansville. There never yet was
         attempted to be granted in this State such a monopoly - utterly preventing any additional
         railway competition in the city of Indianapolis, because no railroad can be built from this
         city but its business will conflict with that of some railroad now established. This bill
         for all time transfers to this monopoly the right to control all the railway traffic of the
         State. I never heard of such a monopoly as is proposed in this bill. In only two of the
         twenty sections of this bill is a Union Depot mentioned, but it comes here with the
         pretense of being a Union Depot bill, while it is for the absolute ruin of certain property
         that company may <pb n="217" xml:id="VAA8558-22-217"/> wish to condemn, and gives to
         property-holders no redress whatever. If this bill can be made a bill for the erection of a
         Union Depot so as to protect property-holders, no man will more gladly favor such a
         proposition than myself.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: During the thirty-three years since the law was enacted there has been but
         one Union Railway Company formed in this State, and that is the one in this city; and so it
         has come to be said that this bill will affect only the city of Indianapolis, while, in
         fact, such Union Railway companies may be formed in any city of the State where the
         surroundings afford an occasion. Now when this company find it necessary to build a much
         larger depot, which will require the expenditure of over $1,000,000, and to do so it must
         have authority to borrow money, such legislation as is proposed in this bill becomes
         necessary. While this has been a matter of agitation in the city for many years past and
         while all the papers of the city have united in urging upon the Legislature the passage of
         this bill and while not a single citizen that I know of has objected, it is most marvellous
         that the Senator from Lawrence (Mr. Willard) has discovered this company to be an
         oppressive monopoly. Myself and my colleagues have no interest in any of the railway
         companies that would make us champions of them rather than our constituents. The Union
         Depot was constructed in 1882, and since then has had the right to levy toll, and I have
         yet to discover that any citizen of Indiana feels that he has been robbed or plundered by
         anything of the kind. Whoever heard of a railroad company that has not a right to levy a
         toll? Why, Senators, what is a railroad company organized for? Another nightmare the
         Senator has discovered is that this railway company has the right to go out anywhere in the
         State and confiscate anybody's property. The Senator talks as though this was a new power.
         Let us see what powers are given by the present law [Reads Sec. 3,955 of the code]. For
         thirty-three sears the Union Railray Company has had these powers that the Senator says are
         so perilous to the inhabitants of the State of Indiana. He says that this company may
         condemn property under the provisions of the charter of any proprietary companies. Such a
         provision is also old with age [Reads Sec. 3,937.] Who has been hurt by it in the past
         thirty-three years? There is nothing new in the provisions of this bill on that subject. In
         this old law there is a provision that no advantage shall be taken of the benefits. The
         imputation has been made that the Senate has been imposed upon, and I want to show that is
         not the case. The argument that this corporation can go out any where in the State and
         condemn land is unworthy of notice; for every one knows property can be condemned only for
         the purposes stated - for the building of a Union Depot or for the purposes of a Union
         Railway Company. This bill, instead of being for the purpose of excluding., is brought here
         for the express purpose of bringing in all other railroad companies and giving them a voice
         in the management. The Union Depot and Railway belong now to but five railroads, and three
         of them are now controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and that road practically
         controls, as there are but two outside of the Pennsylvania Company. They can shut out any
         road from running cars over their tracks. We can all see what a monopoly it has been for
         thirty-three years. Is this monopoly more odious now than at any time in the last
         thirty-three years? The other seven or six railroads running into this city have thought
         this should not be controlled by these five old companies. The dissatisfaction has been so
         great that last fall they entered into an agreement that all railroad companies shall have
         admission to equal rights with the original five proprietary companies. Does that look like
         excluding new railroad companies from the use of the Union Railway tracks? This contract
         says there shall be a Board of Managers, to consist of one from each company, including
         those that may hereafter come in. Instead of a monopoly it liberalizes the old monopoly. I
         have no objection to this bill being limited to the city of Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: Will the Senator consent the bill may be amended so a majority vote shall
         admit other railways instead of a unanimous vote? It should be like all other
         corporations.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: No, sir.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.</p>
        <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas 43, nays 2</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE, explaining his affirmative vote: There are two or three provisions in the

        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD the Senate resumed its sittings as a Committee of the Whole.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE moved to increase the salary of the Deputy Attorney General from $600 to
         $1,000</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved to amend by making it $1,200.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD thought $1,000 sufficient.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: That officer has more business as a lawyer in connection with
         that office than any other lawyer in Indiana can manage. It takes a good lawyer, and $1,200
         is not too much.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER thought this was a reform Democratic Legislature, and now it seems they want
         to double up. He could find 500 men in his county who would take the office at $600.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR had given some attention to criminal cases in the Supreme Court, and the
         Attorney General had not the time to give such attention as is required to details. $1,200
         is little enough for the deputy.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Has the Legislature the right to pass a bill in direct opposition to what
         the statute provides? $600 is the salary provided for in the law of the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend by making the salary $1,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: If there were no other emoluments pertaining to this office the sum proposed
         would be fair; but in truth and fact the salaries given to State officers in this State are
         not one half or one fourth of what they receive. He favored $600</p>
        <p>The $1,000 amendment was agreed to on a division - affirmative 22, negative 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD understands there does not exist, unless in some private library, a full list
         of the laws passed by this State, and an additional item of $75 is incorporated in this
         bill for the purpose of securing a full and complete set in the State Library.</p>
        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD never learned what the item meant "for office and chamber expenses of the
         Supreme Court, $2,000." The <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> thought proper to
         reduce that sum to $1,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, knew but little about this thing, but was informed the
         appropriations for the Supreme Court are so meager it is almost impossible for the
         surroundings to be made respectable. It is the most dignified court we have, and the places
         of work of the Judges should be made comfortable. Trusting in their integrity, I shall
         stand by this appropriation of $2,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I say it is respectable and would be sorry to say otherwise. We pay those
         Judges all the law requires. There is no law requiring the State to find the Judges with a
         fine spring-bed and fine furniture.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE declared the Judges' room hardly fit places to live in. Some officers in the
         State are paid largely more than the Judges of the Supreme Court, and the State could well
         afford to make this $2,000 appropriation.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to make the item $1,500, all, as estimated by the Auditor of the State,
         that will be necessary.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> proposed to strike out the item for furnishing
         and repairs of Supreme Court rooms and insurance of law library, $1,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to amend by reducing the sum to $500.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, resisted both motions. If the State can not take enough interest
         in the law library to insure it, the Legislature that shall restore it should not be blamed
         for making such appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The Supreme Court Room is not used but about six hours in each year. In two
         or three years the Supreme Court will move into the New State House, so there is no
         occasion to furnish that room, but the law library should be insured.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS made an ineffectual motion to amend by adding "Supreme Court Chambers," and
         leaving the appropriation $1,500.</p>
        <p>The amendment [Mr. Winter's] was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> amendment proposing three janitors instead of
         two for the State Officers' Building at $600 each was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to cut down the appropriation for the maintenance of the Hospital for
         the Insane from $260,000 to $240,000 - the latter being the estimate of the Auditor of
         State.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved to reduce the item for the Fish Commissioner from
         $2,000 to $500, believing this department to have been of little service to the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: For many years this has been the regular appropriation. This Commissioner is
         doing a great work in the introduction of fish culture, as I am informed.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN favored the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to strike it all out. This Fish Commissioner is located at my town, and
         of all the choice frauds ever per-<pb n="219" xml:id="VAA8558-22-219"/>petrated upon the
         people of Indiana it is the choicest. I think there are nine persons in Owen, and probably
         ten in Clay County, enjoying the benefits of the Fish Commissioner. Nobody has ever got any
         fish to speak of. Buckets have been sent there from all over the State, and I have received
         many letters asking why the writers do not get fish. When they do get any they get about
         two the size of a common tadpole. [Laughter] I am in favor of fish, but when I want them I
         buy them, and don't ask anybody to buy them for me. The new Fish Commissioner has decided
         the German carp is a failure, and he will introduce some new kind, I suppose. The German
         carp is very much like a mud catfish. It is trifling with the taxpayers to tax them for any
         such foolishness and fraud. This law was created in 1881. I hope it will no longer be
         allowed to remain on the statute book.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I voted for a similar proposition two years ago. The object of this bill is to
         preserve and propagate the fishes of the State. The object of the legislation is to develop
         the resources of the State. This is but a small appropriation. I shall never vote for any
         measure that is a retrograding measure. I believe in getting the moss off our backs and
         keeping abreast with the times. We protect our game, why not protect our fish? There is not
         one fish now where there were 1,000 twenty years ago. This has been a wise, economical and
         just proposition. I would like to see the fishes of the State protected and propagated</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: Nobody who has ever eat German carp will say it is like a mud cat-fish.
         They are A No. 1 - the best fish a man ever put in his mouth. Through the influence of
         Senator Voorhees we have succeeded in getting a good many in Riply County, and they are
         doing <choice>
          <sic>bsiter</sic>
          <corr>better</corr>
         </choice> than any fish, native or foreign. I have yet to find any gentleman or lady who
         has eat them but pronounce them superior to any fish they ever eat. I have one acre of
         water which affords a greater profit than any other ten acres on my land.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: This money will have to be disbursed by the Fish commissioner under the
         provisions of the law. [Reads from the act of 1881 creating the office of Fish
         Commissioner.] A great source of food supply can be made made more abundant and cheaper by
         proper legislation in this direction.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: The purpose is to place fish and protect fish in the streams and lakes of the
         State, and thus aid in producing a cheap food supply.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: You may put 40,000,000 of fish in White River, and they will be no more
         numerous there, because they will go out. The former Fish Commissioner (Mr. Fletcher) has
         gone to a considerable expense, but his fishery is his own private property - it does not
         belong to the State.</p>
        <p>The motion to strike out the item was rejected.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Campbell's) was rejected.</p>
        <p>The item was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to strike out the item of $300 for the State Horticultural Society. The
         Secretary of that society has charged has charged $180 for disbursing the $400 appropriated
         two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS favored the appropriation and opposed any retrograde movement.</p>
        <p>The motion to strike out was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD, the committee rose, reported progress and was discharged from
         further consideration of the bill.</p>
        <p>The report of the <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> was concurred in by the
         Senate, and the amendments ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved that the constitutional rule be suspended, the Senate amendments to the
         General Appropriation bill [H. R. 327] be considered as engrossed, the bill read the third
         time and put on its passage.</p>

        <p>The report of the <orgName>Committee on the Legislative Apportionment</orgName> bill [H.
         R. 423] being the unfinished business - </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I make the point of order that the report is out of order, as it was set for
         yesterday afternoon, and by a vote less <pb n="220" xml:id="VAA8558-22-220"/> than
         two-thirds, as the rule requires, at that.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The point of order is not well taken. As I stated yesterday, the bill did
         not come up as a special order exactly, but in accordance with its number and place among
         bills on the second reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sayre and Mr. Adams appealed from the decision of the Chair.</p>
        <p>The question being, "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House?"
         - (Mr. Gordon presiding) - </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE said: Yesterday when this question for a special order was made the House was
         proceeding with regular business. There was a motion to suspend the regular order. The ayes
         and nays were called, and 63 voted for and 32 against it, lacking, under the rules of the
         House, the necessary two thirds majority. Another question: There is nothing in the rules
         on this subject but Rule 59, and that forbids it, save for appropriation bills, which are
         preferred. The House journal shows this report was made a special order, and no other
         construction can be put upon it.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I am sorry that this appeal did not come up at the proper time. The rules
         say that the Speaker may designate certain days for bills on second reading. I designated
         Wednesday. When the apportionment bills came up, Mr. Patten moved that they, on the second
         reading, be made a special order for 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon. I have no doubt that it
         requires a two-thirds vote to make a special order. I so stated yesterday. It takes a
         two-thirds vote, however, only when to make a bill a special order suspends the rules. When
         it does not suspend the rules a majority vote is sufficient. When bills, as this
         apportionment bill, have been reported upon, they stand for second reading, and, according
         to my practice, I arrange them according to their numbers. This is common fairness to all,
         and so it was done. These apportionment bills were perfectly in order, for they came in
         with their numbers. Coming to that Chair under flattering circumstances, I have desired to
         treat all members, brilliant or lowly, whether his measure is great or small, with equal
         attention, and I hope to leave that Chair with that name.</p>
        <p>M. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: If I were to appeal privately to the Speaker to ask if I did not
         have the highest regard for him, he would say "yes." But I stand here believing with and
         representing the minority, and I must differ with the ruling. There is another rule wrapped
         in this one decided upon. Yesterday morning, according to our resolution, the reports of
         committees were made, and according to custom not even read, but the purport of them given,
         until we come to this particular one - the most important one yet coming up - when the
         committees report was read, and, contrary to all rules, it was made a special order for the
         afternoon. Why, the decision of the Speaker is that by a majority vote you can take up any
         bill on the second reading. By that process the majority could rush their own measures at
         all times, and swamp the minority. The rules are made to protect the minority.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I desire to make the point of order that the question is not debatable</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER pro tem: The point is not well taken.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. GOODING the appeal was laid on the table - yeas 57, nays 37</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON made a point of order that the consideration of this bill is not properly
         before the House, because the bill does not come up in its regular order, and it would take
         a two-thirds vote to place it ahead of time.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The point of order is not well taken.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I wish to appeal, and I sent the same to the Speaker's desk.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The appeal is a reiteration of the appeal just decided. It is out of order.
         I shall not entertain it</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I shall appeal from the decision just rendered.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The Reading Clerk will proceed with the reading of the reports of the
         committee.</p>
        <p>The question being on the minority report, it was laid on the table by yeas 57, nays
         39.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, in explanation of his vote, said: For the reason that the old apportionment is

        <p>Mr. FRENCH, explaining his vote, said: I have voted "no" on these measures, but, since
         the Republicans have seen fit to filibuster, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON, when his name was called, said: I determined when I first learned of the
         provisions of these two apportionment bills to oppose them from first to last. I see no
         reason now for changing my mind. Because my party associates have seen fit to enact
         measures that are unfair is no reason why I should act and concert with them. Sir, I prefer
         to walk with my own manhood to sleep with my own self-respect, and I therefore vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY, in explanation, said: At the present time I vote "aye," but when it comes to
         the final vote I can not disgrace the record of my party by such injustice.</p>
        <pb n="221" xml:id="VAA8558-22-221"/>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN: For the reason that it is a most outrageous partisan measure; for the reason
         that small Democratic countries have the same representation as Republican counties twice
         as large, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: I am gratified to learn that the gentleman from Morgan (Mr. Adams) regards
         the present Democratic apportionment as so eminently just, and believing the proposed
         apportionment more just, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Because the minority report is fair, and because it was made by Democrats and
         they should be satisfied with it, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: For fear that some may not understand my vote I shall explain. First, it
         abolishes the office I hold; but, seriously, because it disfranchises 6,000 or 8,000
         Republicans. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick, when his name was called, said: Because it is unjust and
         discreditable to my party, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: As I vote as I talk, and as a reminder to our apostate brethren, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>And so the minority report was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the majority report be adopted, and moved the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>The demand for the previous question being seconded by the House - yeas 58, nays 38 under
         its operations, the report of the committee was concurred in by - yeas 51, nays 41.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN, explaining his vote, said: In view of the fact that debate has been cut off
         and as I could not have an opportunity to say that in making but one Representative from
         the counties of of LaGrange and Steuben, the Democrats have used the only alternative,
         unless they should go over into Ohio or in Michigan for another county. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe when his name was called said: I am sorry that I am not included
         in the invitation of the gentleman from Davies (Mr. Taylor) to go to their fatted calf with
         the apostate brethren</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I have no doubt the gentleman will be included.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: You have no calves but those in your boot legs [Laughter.] As this is the last
         speech I may have a chance to make in behalf of my constituents I wish to make my "no" most
         emphatic. "No."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: As this is the most <choice>
          <sic>neferious</sic>
          <corr>nefarious</corr>
         </choice> scheme ever known in politics, as now the Democrats have a majority of forty-six
         on joint ballot, and as this gerymander will give them seventy or more, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON, when his name was called, said: As the Democrats of this State have taken
         this most outrageous plan of theft, not having courage to follow their brethren in
         Mississippi and the Carolinas by the tissue ballot and shot-gun, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the majority report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
        <p>The question recurring on the adoption of the amendments proposed by a majority of the
          <orgName>Committee on Apportionments</orgName> -</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operations the
         committee amendments were adopted by yeas 54, nays 41.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call -</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING, explaining his vote, said: I should not have explained my vote here to-day
         had others not done so; but I want to say to the Republicans that we have been yelling
         "bloody murder" now for about a quarter of a century, and we propose to give them some of
         their own medicine. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS, when his name was called, said: As my county, Greene. gives 150 <choice>
          <sic>ReRepublican</sic>
          <corr>Republican</corr>
         </choice> majority, and as Daviess County has 250 Democratic, these counties were about
         evenly balanced, but byp utting Greene and Sullivan together that aspect is changed, and as
         I would rather our Senatorial district would be represented by Mr. Taylor, who would make a
         more dignified and obedient Senator than Mr. Patten, of Sullivan, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above, so the committee amendments to the bill were
         adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved that the bill be engrossed, and moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the House, and under its operations

         instructors, whose annual salaries amount to $18,800, average salary, $1,260; eleven
         laborers, who are paid from $25 to $65, a month. The questions relating to the expenses of

        <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER his bill, S. 185, was taken up with a majority report unfavorable
         and favorable minority report from a committee. He said: This bill provides where one is
         convicted of felony or misdemeanor where part of the judgment is imprisonment, he shall not
         be imprisoned while an appeal is pending. Great injustice is sometimes experienced under
         the present law. He ought to be permitted to give bail just as when first arrested. The
         object is to stave off imprisonment until the appealed man, so that no irrepairable injury
         shall be done unjustly. I move the part be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Great mischief may be brought about by legislation of this kind. The time has
         passed when it is necessary to throw safeguards around persons convicted of a crime. It is
         now very seldom the case an innocent man is pronounced guilty. If the bail fixed would in
         all cases secure the appearance of the parties bailed such a bill might be passed without
         much injustice. We want to throw more safeguards around society and not around the men who
         attack society.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: The committee agree with the purposes of the bill, but the
         practica1 effect would be the man able to give bail would escape, while the poor man would
         invariably have to go to jail. I move to lay the motion to concur in the minority report on
         the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">NARCOTICS IN THE SCHOOLS.</head>
        <p>The special order was taken up, being Mr. Foulke's bill [S. 60] requiring the study of
         physiology and hygiene, and the effects of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics, in the
         public schools, with a favorable majority report and a report recommending the indefinite
         postponement of the bill - the committee were equally divided -.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved concurrence in the first report. A bill like this has been asked for by
         petitions in large number - 15,500 and over. Two years ago there were also numerous similar
         petitions, but they were utterly ignored at that time. The request is so reasonable, it
         hardly would become the Senate to refuse it. This measure is no interference with personal
         liberty. It is a thing which the taxpayers have a right to demand, that children shall be
         taught conceded scientific facts which will tend to make them better citizens in after
         life. It has been ascertained by scientists that alcoholic stimulants increase the brain
         cells, and if used to excess, its evil effects are transmitted to posterity. Wherever there
         is a special liability to fall into special error, special efforts should be made to guard
         against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, spoke in opposition to the bill, as follows:</p>
        <p>M<hi rend="sc">R</hi>. P<hi rend="sc">RESIDENT</hi> - The main reason which induces me to
         oppose this bill, and, if possible, to prevent it from becoming a law, is founded in the
         fact that it is the outgrowth and offspring of that fanatical agitation which, for the last
         ten years, has disturbed the public mind in regard to intemperance, its course,
         preventives, and results. There is not a Senator on this floor but who knows and deplores
         the evil and destructive effects which intemperance has on the human sys- <pb n="224"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-224"/> tem, and that it fatally attacks and prematurely ruins many a
         bright mind, many a heart otherwise noble and generous, many a constitution of giant
         strength and power. This is what intemperance the immoderate and excessive use of alcoholic
         liquors will inevitably do, and almost superhuman efforts of moral reformers, educators,
         and statesmen have been made to suppress and eradicate this vice, and have invariably
         failed. Instead of decreasing and losing its pernicious grasp on nations and individuals
         intemperance seems rather on the increase and to extend its power. And yet, Mr. President,
         nobody, I believe, will claim or can justly claim that the people have been kept in
         ignorance as to the baneful effects of the excessive or immoderate use of alcoholic
         liquors; on the contrary, our pulpits, our lecture-rooms, our public platforms have
         resounded with the eloquence and the fervid arguments of the apostles of temperance and the
         advocates of prohibition, and thousands of daily, weekly and monthly newspapers and
         periodicals have echoed and re-echoed this eloquence and these arguments and carried <choice>
          <corr>them</corr>
          <sic>tham</sic>
         </choice> to the remotest village or farm house of this great country. With such an
         unlimited and powerful assistance, one might have supposed the cause of temperance would
         make rapid progress and march victoriously over the broad domain of the Union, irresistible
         in its conquests and all overpowering in its gigantic strength. But, as I stated before,
         nothing of the kind has been witnessed or recorded; the greater the agitation against
         intemperance the more numerous its victims and the more plentiful its harvest. There must
         be some reason for this, some secret cause, which produces this phenomenal effect, so
         contrary to all expectations and desires of reform, and if I am not greatly mistaken, one
         of these reasons at least is the spirit of fanaticism and intolerance with which the
         agitation against this great and deplorable vice has been carried on. Our country is too
         enlightened, the minds of our people, educated in the great school of practical liberty,
         are so averse to intolerance, that temperance agitation, though undoubtedly inspired by
         noble motives, just on account of the intolerant and fanatical spirit with which it has
         been identified, is looked down upon and is too often the subject of ridicule and contempt.
         The great mistake these advocates of temperance are constantly making is their want of
         moderation both in their arguments and their aspirations. As long as history gives record
         of nations and their actions - nay, farther back than that - as long as epic poetry and
         legendary song celebrates heroes and heroic deeds, wine and alcoholic stimulants have
         coexisted with man and human nature, and it is rather late now, after so many thousands of
         years of their daily consumption, to attempt to suppress and banish them from the domain
         which they have so long occupied. The use of alcoholic liquors is, in small and moderate
         quantities, neither injurious nor destructive. The most civilized nations of the globe
         to-day are those where these liquors enter into the daily diet of the citizen almost with
         the same regularity as bread or meat. I refer to France, Germany and England, the three
         leading nations of Europe, which for centuries have been at the head of civilization, and
         have furnished an abundant list of illustrious thinkers in every department of literature,
         art and science. It is only the immoderate use of these liquors which is so injurious, both
         to the physical and mental constitution of man. And just because the advocates of
         temperance often fail to advance this true and scientific doctrine, and blindly denounce
         and curse even the moderate indulgence in them, they fail to convince the people, and their
         lessons of morality are preached to deaf ears and mutinous minds. Now, Mr. President, it is
         this same spirit of intolerance and unwise fanaticism which is to be from the rostrum, the
         pulpit and the public platform to the school room of our public schools. A so called
         text-book of physiology and hygiene, in which the pernicious effects of alcohol and
         alcoholic liquors on the human system are presented in glaring colors, as ridiculous as
         they are untrue, will, if this bill becomes a law, be placed in the hands of the young
         scholar of our public schools and imbue his mind with the erroneous idea, not that the
         immoderate and excessive use of alcoholic stimulants is highly injurious but that its use
         in whatever quantity - no matter whether large or small - is perdition to man's body, mind
         and soul. Who is to get up, I wonder, this text-book? To whose bands is its composition to
         be entrusted? <choice>
          <corr>Whose</corr>
          <sic>Wose</sic>
         </choice> pen will be selected to fill the youthful mind with horrible dreams and
         phantasmagories of the effects of a glass of beer or wine? After what reform pattern of
         prohibition philosophy is the teacher, who wants a license, to be examined, and who to get
         up the questions and answers required by the applicant to obtain this license?</p>
        <p>Mr. President, so far I have only objected to the general aim and tendency of the law, if
         this bill should become a law. The very thing which our educational system should carefully
         avoid, the introduction of intolerant hobbies and isms, will be effected by this measure.
         There is plenty of room now for every teacher in our public schools to use his influence
         and his example with his pupils in behalf of virtue, morality and all the ennobling
         qualities of human character; all text-books used as readers are replete with lessons on
         temperance and virtue. If our churches, our Sunday-schools and the daily instruction and
         exhortations of our schools are powerless to avert the calamity of intemperate habits among
         the young men of the Nation, what do you expect to effect by establishing a special branch
         of instruction, which, from the very fact of its<pb n="225" xml:id="VAA8558-22-225"/> being
         founded on prejudices and ignorance, will create dissatisfaction among the people, and by
         its misrepresentations and unscientific teachings may breed in the minds of the young a
         feeling of contempt and rebellion against parents who may hold different and reasonable
         views on the subject? Now, Mr. President, I have already too much extended my remarks on
         this bill. I hope it will not pass. Limit the school to its legitimate sphere of action,
         and do not try to make it the vehicle of intolerant ideas and puritanical notions. The
         church, the Sunday-school, the influence of father and mother, the public press, and the
         general tone of morality pervading our social system are sufficient safeguards and barriers
         against a vice which, unfortunately, seems to be beyond the power of legislation and legal
         restraints.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM saw no use in teaching temperance in the public schools. You can pass all
         legislative laws you please and there will still be drunkenness. We have Sunday-schools,
         churches and families, and those are the places to teach temperance. I don't think
         discussion will effect the fate of the bill, and I move to lay the motion to concur on the
         table.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 20.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH said: I am in favor of the principles contained in the bill but opposed to
         its tyrannical provisions. For the purpose of giving its friends a chance to amend it, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY said: I feel very largely instructed by my constituents to favor the bill
         before the Senate, so I will obey instructions and vote "no" on this question.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I am not opposed to the principles of this bill if properly
         incorporated therein and if necessary, but I am of opinion that the bill is wholly
         unnecessary, because this same question can be taught in the public schools now, and is
         taught wherever any one desiring to teach it has the ability to teach it. Therefore, there
         being no necessity for the bill as I understand it, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I am in favor of the principle of this bill as provided in the first section. I
         am not one among those who believe that because the question of protection of prohibition
         has been made a political issue it is not proper to teach hygiene and the effects of
         alcoholic stimulants to the children attending the public schools. I believe instead of
         that it is a duty to teach it. Not that it will interfere with the rights of pupils or the
         rights of their parents, but simply that they may learn what the effect is upon the human
         system. I know of no reason why this should not be taught. I have no apprehension that it
         will involve a political question. Therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS moved to refer to a committee of seven.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved to strike out Sections 2 and 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: Nothing has been before the Senate on which the people have so favorably
         expressed themselves as on this subject. He opposed the motion to refer.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to strike out the enacting clause as a substitute for the
         pending motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, was fully prepared to vote in opposition to the bill, but not
         opposed to teaching the effects of narcotics in the common schools. The bill is based upon
         the incorrect theory of what is now taught in the common schools. One of the eight branches
         required to be taught is physiology, and the effect of alcoholic poisons is one branch of
         that study. So it is nowt fully provided for in the public schools. Twenty pages in one of
         these books, used in seventy of the counties of the State, is devoted to the effect of
         alcoholic stimulants and tobacco upon the human system.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I believe the people have a right to petition their representatives to
         carry out their views, and of all the subjects upon which we have received petitions this
         subject has had more in its favor. I don't think we ought to dodge so important a question.
         Four years ago I voted for a constitutional amendment to submit this question to the
         people, because I believed it constitutionally right, morally right and politically right.
         No teacher does his duty unless he teaches his scholars the dire effects of alcoholic
         stimulants upon the system. I shall vote for this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILILGASS: I was in favor of the first section of this bill, and of the amendment
         offered by the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir). If it is proper and right to teach this
         subject in seventy counties, why not make it uniform throughout the State? Senators who
         oppose this bill say the effects of alcoholic stimulants are becoming more and more fatal
         as the years go by. If that be true, it is our highest duty to put in the hands of children
         information that will enable them to shun its evil consequences and stay this tide of evil
         that is sweeping over the laud. We cannot evade the responsibility if we refuse to allow
         the evil effects of those narcotics to be taught in the public schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to second the demand by yeas 20, nays 24.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll-call -</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH said: If I understand it aright, if the demand for the previous question is
         seconded and the Senate refuses to sustain the motion to strike the enacting clause from
         this bill, the bill will be carried to the engrossment without giving a chance to amend it.
         I, therefore, vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said: I am in favor, in the abstract, of teaching morals in the public
         schools. I think it of the highest importance, and that we owe it to the children of the
         State; but this idea of making it a <pb n="226" xml:id="VAA8558-22-226"/> statute appears
         to me as not good policy. As it is I don't suppose there is a school in the Commonwealth
         but what the effects of alcohol is taught. The teacher that don't do it ought to be turned
         out. But this bill says it is not to be taught till next September. I think that develops a
         job. There is probably some man who has a book that will be out about that time, and he
         expects the schools to adopt it. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>The motion to strike out the enacting was also rejected by yeas 21; nays 23.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll-call -</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, said: I am opposed to the bill, but I desire to see its friends
         receive fair treatment, and would like to meet that question squarely. Therefore I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I want to explain my vote. While I want to give everybody a fair chance, I
         want to get rid of this sometime or other. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I simply want to say that I am not in favor of this summary way of killing a
         bill in any legislative body. Therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: All the explanation I have is that I wish to give the friends of this bill a
         fair chance, and I consequently vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH said: I am in favor of fair dealing but I think this bill has had more
         than a fair chance - a great deal more than a fair chance. It had more discussion than it
         was entitled to before the motion to lay on the table was made. There are but ten or twelve
         days before the close of this session, and if we are going to discuss bills of this sort
         and that sort a great deal of important legislation must go over. The Senate should not
         spend hours and hours upon a bill they all have their minds made up on. I am opposed to it
         all the time, and am willing to go on the record as opposed to it without any discussion. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: The same reasons I gave when I made a motion to lay the bill on the able, are
         the same reasons I shall vote in favor of this motion; because there is no use in fooling
         away our time; and there is no chance to pass this bill here or in the other House. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR said: As the amendments I proposed show, I am opposed to some of the provisions,
         while the object of the bill I am in favor of. But there was no opportunity allowed to
         offer amendments, therefore I think the friends of this measure have not been treated in
         such a manner as they are entitled to upon a question of so much importance. I therefore
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to indefinitely the bill.</p>

        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS' bill [S. 39] to appropriate $25,000 annually out of the school fund to the
         State Normal School, coming up on the second reading -</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I hope this bill will never become a law. There has been $20,000 already
         set apart to the State Normal School. Now this appropriation is to set apart a $25,000 a
         year more. It is now enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I think this is a pernicious bill in principle. It is all wrong. This shows
         how these things creep in. It never was intended to divert money from the common school
         fund for any purpose. Let all such appropriations, if they must be made, be made out of the
         general fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS: The Trustees of the State Normal School find it impossible to pay the
         teachers, and the school is now indebted for borrowed money. The school is increasing in
         usefulness and numbers. There were 1,175 students last year. The school fund can not be
         diverted for a better purpose than to the Normal School. I hope the bill will pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I saw a large number of small children attending the Normal School. Are the
         teachers of such paid by the State?</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS: The Normal pays part and the city of Terre Haute part of the salaries of
         these teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This seems to be pernicious legislation. When the Constitution was adopted
         there was no such thing as a State Normal School, and it can't be said that is a common
         school. The Constitution should be liberally construed, but the Constitution prescribes in
         Section 185 [Reads] that the income of the school fund shall be distributed to the several
         counties. How can Senators get around this provision in the Constitution, and say this fund
         shall be distributed to this or that institution?</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I differ in the opinion, that this is a diversion of the
         money to the Normal School. I regard it in a different light from what I do the State
         University or Purdue University. I regard this State Normal School as part of the system of
         public schools, and it is an institution of which we ought to be proud.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: The General Appropriation bill passed yesterday gives the State Normal School
         $7,000.</p>
        <pb n="227" xml:id="VAA8558-22-227"/>
        <p>Mr. WEIR called attention to a communication from the Governor in reference to the title
         to the grounds on which the State Normal School is built, and insisted we should know more
         about this before any further appropriations are made</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS: The committee has done its duty, and everything is in order, and the papers
         will soon be returned here, and the report of the committee will show all is right.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The proportionate amount of the school fund that should go for the instruction
         of children attending that school must be just. I doubt the constitutionality of an act
         that would divert money from the school fund for the education of teachers. I do not agree
         with the statement that the State Normal School is a part of the common school system of
         the State. I think there are about 800 children taught in the Normal School building, which
         is called a "model school." If the fund is used for common school purposes, it don't matter
         whether the children are taught in the Normal School building or elsewhere, so it is
         properly and justly applied. I am willing the portion Case County will give of this $25,000
         shall go as this bill proposes. Therefore, I am in favor of the passage of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS understands this bill would make the appropriation to the State Normal School
         some $45,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: There is a doubt about the constitutionality of the measure, and he moved the
         reference of the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, with instructions to
         report to-morrow on that question. If the bill is constitutional I want to vote for it.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">MONTHLY PAY TO COMPANY EMPLOYES.</head>
        <p>Mr. Weir's bill [S. 47 - see page 38] to require corporations to pay employes in full in
         money at least once a month, was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE knew no reason why individuals should not come under the provisions of this
         bill if its provisions be just. He moved so to amend. If such a bill were passed so many
         corporations would go out of existence. This bill, would require certain things to be done
         that it is utterly impossible to do under certain circumstances.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: We have in this city large manufacturing establishments paying their men in
         store orders, and the men are compelled to take their supplies at a greater price than if
         they had lawful money; and sometimes these orders have to be sold by the men at a discount
         of sometimes 25 per cent. I shall favor the amendment but if it is defeated we should pass
         the bill. I refer Democratic members to their platform which says they will pass a bill
         that will make the payment of wages in lawful money of the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: All the information I have of the bill is received from this discussion, for I
         have not read it, but I do know it would have a deletreious effect in the locality where I
         live. By the co-operative system Tell City has grown to be one of the liveliest little
         towns in the State. This is a blow at co-operative institutions that will ruin them. There
         has not been a more pernicious piece of legislation attempted than this.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The amendment means indirectly to defeat the bill. Corporations stand
         upon an entirely different plane from the individual. They have asked and obtained from the
         law-making power rights that private individuals have not, and the law making power can
         regulate their affairs as proposed in this bill. It is a false argument to say the
         Legislature shall take no control of them. The bill says, unless there is a specific
         contract to the contrary, the workmen shall be paid in full, in money, every month. I think
         that is right. Give the corporation the month's credit they always take, and then compel
         them, under penalties, to pay what they justly owe. The day is at hand when the Legislature
         must take hold of these corporations and see that justice is done by them. There is nothing
         in this bill but what is reasonable and just.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: It is only the corporations that are doing business on credit
         that can complain of the provisions of this bill. There are a great many railroad
         corporations in this State doing business wholly on credit, and if workmen dare to quit
         they are told they will be lawed to the end of time and will never get anything. They have
         been driven to desperate deeds the cries of their children when asking for bread they could
         not give. This bill out to become a law. The man who earns his living by the sweat of his
         brow should be protected by the Legislature of Indiana. Owners of mines frequently pay
         their men in store script, payable only at the grocery owned by the corporation owning the
         mines, where the workmen have to allow a greater price for the necessities of life than
         money would buy. It is to protect the working people that this bill has been reported
         favorably to the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: The labor question has often been mentioned on this floor. If we will enact
         this law, and the corporations will satisfy their <choice>
          <sic>emplyes</sic>
          <corr>employes</corr>
         </choice>, every month, it will be a great preventive of riot. I believe when corporations
         are properly managed they are an advantage to the State, but I believe they ought to deal
         out justice to the men they employ. A great deal of suffering in my county has been brought
         about by companies not paying their laborers. This bill will work no injustice to a
         corporation. I hope it will become a law.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR had intended to discuss the bill somewhat, but as it is getting late, and if the
         bill can be disposed of this evening, he would abandon that intention.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH presented a petition of 376 laboring men from his district on this subject.
         He favored the passage of the bill, <pb n="228" xml:id="VAA8558-22-228"/> and did not think
         theme petitioners would object to its provisions</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I never was employed by a railroad corporation in my life, but I am a friend
         to corporations so long as they deal justly to its employes. This bill, if it becomes a
         law, will harass and annoy corporations all over the State. It ought to be entitled "a bill
         to breed law suits." It is a pernicious and vicious measure.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Magee's) was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE the bill was amended by requiring payment to be made within
         "thirty" instead of "ten" days</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>On emotion by Mr. WEIR the bill was read the third time under a dispensation of the
         constitutional rule, and passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS, explaining: This bill, if passed into a law, would very likely be detrimental
         to the interests of both the employer and the employe. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am informed that in different parts of the State a great deal of hardship
         is borne by employes that this bill would remove. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I represent some 3,000 miners, probably more than are in all the balance of
         the State, and these men working deep under the earth are constantly being defrauded out of
         their hard-earned toil. In Clay County wherever you find a mining shaft or wherever a car
         load of coal is taken out you will find a little grocery established for the purpose of
         furnishing groceries to the miners, and instead of paying them money they are paid in
         script, and they are obliged to pay from 15 to 25 per cent. more for their living. This
         bill proposes to remedy that great outrage, and that is the reason I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I also live in a coal mining and manufacturing region, but our people are paid
         regularly every month as a general thing in cash. So far as the bill grants a lein to the
         laboring man I am in favor of it, but as far as it affects co-operative institutions I am
         opposed to it; therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: With the amendment made by the Senator from Cass (Mr. Magee) changing the
         time from ten to thirty days, I think the object of the bill is to a certain extent
         defeated. I think there should be placed in the hands of the laboring man immediate remedy,
         but hoping the ten day clause will be put back in the House I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I don't know that a railroad company or any other corporation has the right
         to make a forced loan on workmen and then discount their wages by paying them in grocery
         orders; therefore, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then amended as above.</p>
        <p>So the bill passed the Senate.</p>
        <p>The Senate adjourned till 9:30 o'clock to-morrow.</p>

        <p>Mr. McMULLEN, reported from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> the

         provisions are as follows: Perin &amp; Gaff Manufacturing Company, for workshops at the
         Southern Prison, $6,360; Commissioners of Marion County, for extra rooms, light and fuel
         for Legislative sessions of 1879 and 1883, $3,000; for the present session, $1,500; for
         interest on the debt of the State Board of $5,000; for completion of chapel at Southern
         Prison, $5,000; for brick wall to enclose the grounds and four stone towers, $32,000. A
         number of smaller allowances, ranging from $2,000 to $3,000, were recommended for various
         services rendered the State by employes of different institutions, special Judges and
         others.</p>

        <p>The House <orgName>Committee on Prisons</orgName> submitted its usual report, and made
         recommendations for appropriations, improvements and changes. Regarding both institutions,
         the committee declares are in excellent condition, the food is good and plentiful, and the
         convicts apparently contented. The consideration of the Legislature is called to a
         proposition to appoint a State agent, whose duty it shall be to look after the future of
         discharged convicts. An appropriation of $500 for the purchase of library books is
         recommended; also, that two new heating boilers be purchased, and that cells be provided
         for insane convicts. Regarding the Southern Prison the following recommendations are made:
         The purchase of three more acres of ground, at a cost of $3,300, and the building of a wall
         around it at a cost of $32,000; the purchase of an additional house at a cost of $1,000;
         furnishing of the chapel at a cost of $1,000. It is also recommended that Dr. W F. Sherrod,
         the prison physician for years, be retired on account of advancing age, and that a younger
         and more active man be appointed. The most important recommendation made is that the
         Legislature should take some action to provide that convicts who were sentenced to life
         imprisonment, and whose conduct has been exemplary, should be released after having served
         fourteen or sixteen years.</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The bill will hurt no other fence, but will merely legalize
         barbed wire fences.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: This bill does not touch a fence now built, but refers only to those
         to be built. It provides that the posts and wires must be just so and so, and will
         necessitate the rebuilding of all wire fences now standing.</p>

        <head>APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, the House resolved itself into committee of the whole, Mr.
         Adams in the chair, and resumed consideration of the bill [H. R. 427] making appropriations
         for the State government.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM moved to amend so that the sum of $3,000, instead of $2,500, be allowed the
         Feeble Mind Institution for allowance to the Superintendent and Trustees</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD said the amendment should pass by all means.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: This bill does not propose to help the institution nor the inmates - only
         to increase the salaries of the officers. These officers get not only their salaries, but
         have their families boarded, and that makes a handsome pay. There are men in Indiana now
         running after us, pulling the buttons from our coats, to get the position at the old
         salary.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: The law allows the three Trustees each $500 per year, making $1,500, and the
         Superintendent $1,500, and your appropriation must be $3,000 to be good for it.</p>
        <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE offered an amendment providing that the Governor should have the power to
         remove, with or without cause, any officer or employe of the institution. He said: the
         recent investigation has disclosed a most outrageous scandal at that institution, yet no
         legislator has had courage to introduce a bill to remove some of the officials who have
         badly abused their positions.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved to amend the striking out the word "without."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: It would look strange to have such an amendment put in an appropriation
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. JEWETT: I am so heartily in favor of this amendment that I can not remain silent. I
         go further, and say that the Governor should have the power to remove from our public
         institution any man, for cause. The amendment and the amendment to the amendment should
         carry.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I think this is the wrong place to make the law which these amendments
         propose. We should, in justice to ourselves, first hear a report from this investigating
         committee.</p>

         Twenty-second Judicial Circuits and creating the Forty-seventh Judicial Circuit was taken
         up.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I do not want to oppose this bill, but as it makes a new circuit I am opposed
         to taking it up out of its order.</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: I tell this Assembly, upon my honor as a man and upon my honor as a member of
         this body that you can not in any one of the five counties find a man who opposes this
         measure. On the contrary, they demand the passage of this bill. Montgomery County is 530
         cases behind, Vermillion is in arrears and so is Parke County.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I do not believe in creating new circuits. I do not say but that this
         circuit is in need as badly as any. I do not know how it is in the northern part of the
         State but in the southern part of the State litigation is decreasing. I am afraid that in
         these circuits wanting less territories the judges do not work as hard as they should.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I am authorized to speak only for Montgomery County. I will say that unless
         this circuit is changed the wheels of justice will be clogged.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I can testify that Montgomery County needs this. Clinton
         County, not so large, has a circuit to itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: The Constitution says that every man shall have a trial speedily and without
         delay. We must have it arranged to that end.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOOE: Montgomery is one of the large and populous counties of the State. Those

        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend, that none of the money be used in the erection of the Insane

        <p>On motion by Mr. TAYLOR, the amendment was laid on the table - yeas, 76; nays, 8.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend by stating from which fund the interest shall be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Unless the amendment is really necessary it should not be

        <pb n="230" xml:id="VAA8558-22-230"/>
        <p>The amendment was adopted</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I favor this bill because of the great necessity of it. We can't avoid
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I know I am in the minority. I have been so before, but there are those
         outside this House who are with me. I am not afraid to stand alone. There are many here who
         will speak after I do; they will fire from the rear. This money is to be borrowed to build
         the new Insane Asylums, which are not needed. I am here to call a halt. This money will
         come from the sons of toil. Of course we borrow it, but it will become due, with interest,
         some day. And again, this $600,000 will not go far enough to pay the appropriations. If you
         continue as you are going before the close of this session it will take $600,000 more. Let
         us show the country that the Democratic party meant it when it said that it was in favor of
         retrenchment and reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: In the present condition of the State's finances the importance of this bill
         can not, in my judgment, be overestimated. This bill, originating as it did in the Senate,
         was, as I understand, carefully and most thoroughly considered by the <orgName>Finance
          Committee</orgName> of that august and honorable body, and on its passage met the approval
         of the combined wisdom of the House. It is purely a business proposition, and advocates for
         this measure will be found, in my judgment, in the proportion to the care and investigation
         given it by each member of this House. After the adjournment of this Legislature no
         provision can be made for meeting the expenses of the State Government until 1887, unless
         an extra session was called, which all fair men would deplore. The Senate, but a few days
         ago, almost unanimously passed a bill appropriating $568,000 for completing three
         additional hospitals for the insane. Now we have the following financial condition of the
         state to day staring us in the face. The expenses of our State Government for the fiscal
         year ending November 1, 1884, found on pages 39, 40 and 41, Auditor's report for 1884, is
         classified as follows: [Reads-]</p>
        <p>You will thus see at a glance that the ordinary current expenses of the State for all
         departments last year was $973,572.31.</p>
        <p>This may seem and in fact is a very large sum of money, yet it is less than fifty cents
         for each inhabitant of the State. On examination of the present appropriation bill
         gentlemen will find that it exceeds the expenses above given for last year's expenses by
         $150,000 in round numbers. For the present year it will then be safe to say that the
         current expenses will be as follows, to-wit: $973,572.31. Reads Auditor's estimate.]</p>
        <p>To this sum of $1,864,127.87 should be added the excess of the General Appropriation bill
         of this year over the expenses for all purposes of last year, $150,000. Also, the following
         special appropriations, made at this session, and not found in the Appropriation bill:
         Appropriation for the House of Refuge, $6,800; for New Orleans Exposition, $3,900; for
         damage to Insane Hospital, $3,000; for Bloomington University, $30,000; making expenditure
         for the year, $2,057,827.87. How then is the State Treasury to meet the demand for the
         present year, to-wit, $2,057,827.87, is the question addressed to each of us. There was in
         the general fund, at the commencement of the present fiscal year (see Auditor's Report,
         page 7) $28,036.17. The receipts of the general fund last year, after deducting the
         $109,000 transfer warrants, were, as shown by the Auditor's report (pages 8 and 9),
         $1,422,915.19; add fund on hand, $26,036.17; available assets, $1,448,951.96. According to
         the Auditor's report (page 8) the State Treasurer called in in advance of the regular
         December settlement of the revenue for 1884 $61,222.27. So the receipts of last year were
         augmented by this amount, and the receipts of this year will fall below those of last year
         by that amount, so that we must not only provide for this $61,222.27 deficit, but
         $122,444.54. Deducting this amount from the $1,448.956.19 leaves the receipts for this year
         $1,326,507.34. In this calculation I have assumed that the taxes will be as closely
         collected as last year, which is extremely doubtful. The expenditures for this year, I have
         shown, will be $2,057,827.87; the receipts $1,326,507.34; deficit at the close of year,
         $731,320.53. This amount may still be increased by special appropriations made by this
         Legislature before its close. Since 1887 the tax levy has been twelve cents on the $100 and
         fifty cents poll. You will see by the Auditor's Report, page 70, that the assessment of
         real and personal property in 1884 was $797,884,706, being $56,205,419 less than in
         1877.</p>
        <p>Gentlemen, when we stop and examine for a moment the extraordinary expenditures for all
         purposes in the last year it is not surprising that we are compelled to adopt some plan to
         meet them. There is another matter which might very properly be considered at this time. We
         have a 5 per cent. temporary loan of $585,000 in round numbers, now due and drawing 5 per
         cent. interest. If this bill is passed these bonds can be taken up and be replaced with
         bonds drawing 1½ per cent. less rate of interest. In these calculations I have not taken
         into consideration the proposed appropriation for completing the new Insane <choice>
          <sic>Assylums</sic>
          <corr>Asylums</corr>
         </choice> which seems to give the gentleman from Hancock so much trouble. Add this amount
         to the demands I have already shown to exist and the amount will be $1,345,106.14.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: The insane that will be taken from the county almshouses, and thus relieve
         the counties of expenses, will more than pay for those asylums.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON - I do not believe that this $600,000 will meet the demand.</p>

        <p>Mr. HUSTON's bill [S. 29 - see pages 136 and 164] coming up on the second reading with a
         pending amendment proposing to make the rate of interest 7 per cent - </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The bill ought not to pass without this amendment. Under the Constitution
         no more than 6 per cent. can be collected from any counties that may lend at 6. Upon
         principle I think 7 per cent. is a fair rate. There are expenses incident upon making these
         loans that make it cost at least 1 per cent. more. If the people are relieved from this
         higher rate of interest it can be supplied by the entire State. To harmonize all feelings
         in this matter we ought to fix the rate at 7 per cent. as this amendment proposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: The practical effect of this bill will be to loan the school fund at 6 per
         cent. With the rate at 7, as proposed by the amendment, the bill will have the effect of
         loaning the entire school fund; and this would be a relief to a great many counties.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The object of the constitutional provision is to make this a permanent and
         certain fund. If it be loaned in Wayne County at 8 and in Cass County at 6, we in Cass
         County would have to make up this difference of 2 per cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: Seventy counties can loan the entire fund at 8 per cent. Only
         eleven counties recommend the reduction to 7 per cent., and ten to 6 per cent. This
         amendment would reduce the school fund interest fully 12½ per cent., and the result would
         be we must cut down the terms of schools or reduce the salaries of teachers, either of
         which attempt would be a crime against the children now in this State and those yet unborn.
         Do not cripple the income which sustains the Common Schools. The Democratic party should
         bear in mind that it is charged with assailing the system of Common Schools. I am here to
         enter a solemn protest against doing so.</p>
        <pb n="232" xml:id="VAA8558-22-232"/>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The committee had this bill under advisement at two meetings. I am opposed
         to the amendment and to the bill because it cuts the rate of interest down from 8 to 6 per
         cent. There is but one section that fixes the rate of interest on the school fund, and that
         is the very section this bill would amend if it passes. Then there would be no law to hold
         the counties for 8 per cent.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR would oppose the bill if it will reduce the rate of interest to 6 per cent.</p>
        <p>The 7 per cent. amendment was rejected by yeas 16, nays 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend by providing that the several counties shall be held liable to
         pay the amount of interest as required under Section 4,226 of the Revised Statutes of
         1881.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If the rate is fixed at 8 in this bill where it can be loaned at that and
         in others at 6, the 8 per cent. rate could not be enforced under the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS also thought this amendment would render the law unconstitutional. The bill
         and the amendment ought both to disposed of in a summary manner.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I do not think that county officers will loan this fund for any lower rate of
         interest than can be obtained.</p>

         minority have refused to defend it. They can not and dare not give their authority for any
         of the facts stated. It is bottomed upon rumor and unworthy suspicion, and grows out of
         personal difficulties with the Treasurer of State. They are but the deductions of unworthy
         newspaper <choice>
          <sic>scriblers</sic>
          <corr>scribblers</corr>
         </choice>, whose only ambition is sensational notoriety. The authors of these unfounded
         rumors are as silent as the dull stones of the forest, and no one will ever justify the
         facts stated or reveal the character of the author. From what source does these charges
         come? Who is the witness who has thus borne testimony? Eye hath not seen his hideous form;
         ear hath not heard his lying voice; he has not been unmasked to the public gaze, nor has he
         written his name in the book of public accusation; but from the filth and the grease of the
         gutter, the puny head of this vile calumniated arises, smoking with the fumes of hate, and
         through the channels of vague suspicion and dishonorable rumor, he breathes his malicious
         poison into the ears of the people of Indiana.</p>
        <p>If fair play had been desired, and honest dealing had been intended, why is the minority
         report silent upon the author of the facts stated? If shame for the company they have been
         keeping has not admonished the minority to silence, why have they not placed before the
         public the authority for the charges contained in their report? But since silence has cast
         the mantle of protection about the head of the unworthy author of this political libel, it
         may not be improper if I should say that the ex Governor of Indiana, from the beginning of
         this investigation, shadowed the minority like the ghost of an ill-omen, and with his cold
         and designing nature guided its every action and inspired its every motive. From the lofty
         position of Governor of Indiana, he descended to the common level and vulgar plane of the
         lobbyist, that he might accomplish, through other means and by indirection, what he failed
         to do in an open and honorable contest. The minority report is as much work as if he had
         penned it. The hand is the hand of Esau, but the voice is the voice of Jacob.</p>

        <p>Mr. GORDON, explaining his vote, said: I am not exactly in favor of the bill as it is,
         yet with slight changes I would like to vote for it. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: It is no more than right when a railway corporation takes our land for a right
         of way that they should fence the line. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Inasmuch as many of the roads of the State have without compulsion fenced
         their lines, I think it no more than right that the other roads should do like-wise. I vote

        <p>The question recurring on the adoption of the minority report - </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE said: If there is any argument why a railroad should not fence its line to
         protect farmers' stock, I do not know what it is. I hope the minority report will be
         adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: Many farmers cultivate right up to the railway track, and this bill will shut
         that off, doing wrong and no good.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: The railway and the farmer could waive the law in that case.</p>
        <p>The majority report was concurred in, and so the amendments were agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH moved to amend that the farmer may enter into an agreement with the railway
         relative to omitting the fence, so that the land may be cultivated up to the tracks.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: There is no penalty attached to this bill. The farmer through whose land the
         railroad runs may collect damages from the railway, but if he agree to omit the fence then
         the provisions of the bill may be evaded.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: The amendment can do no harm, certainly.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: The only objection to fencing, I fear, is that it costs too much. As farmers
         are compelled to fence, railways should be compelled also. I am opposed to the amendment
         because I think railways should be compelled to fence the whole line. I believe that the
         law should not be left in such a condition that a farmer can enter into a compact to
         abolish the fence. I believe that this amendment will make the law inoperative.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I believe the railroad companies should be compelled to fence always. These
         railway companies frequently go through a man's land without paying a cent, and they should
         fence.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: It is a mistake to suppose that farmers are compelled to fence. It is <pb
          n="234" xml:id="VAA8558-22-234"/> only in certain localities, and that is left to the
         County Commissioners.</p>

        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET did not think all our legislation should be especially for Indianapolis.

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend the second section of the bill, so that in case of disagreement

        <p>Mr. MAGEE accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drake's bill [S. 82] to amend Section 12 of the drainage act of April 8, 1881, coming
         up with committee amendments - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE did not believe one bill can amend two acts, as is proposed in this.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE explained: The committee added the second section.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: The first section proposes to amend an act of 1881, and the second section
         another section of the same act as it has been amended in 1883. The amendment, with the
         original act, compose the entire drainage law. So in amending the amendatory act of 1883 it
         is necessary to refer to that act</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER still insisted every act must relate to one subject, which must be expressed
         in the title read. This bill is obnoxious to the Constitution because it proposes to amend
         two different acts.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The two acts may be upon the same subject or upon two different subjects. It
         would make no difference. As it is now it is questionable.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: As the committee have added to my bill what is not germane I move to strike

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE'S bill [S. 97, see page 49] to amend Section 5 of the liquor law, with a
         majority report recommending that the bill <pb n="237" xml:id="VAA8558-22-237"/>lie on the
         table, and a minority report recommending its passage, coming up,</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved to substitute the minority for the majority report.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SELLERS this motion was laid n the table by yeas 25, nays 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, when his name was called, said: I have great doubts whether I should vote for
         or against the motion to lay on the table. I have no confidence in the sincerity of
         Republicans on the temperance question. I don't believe they are in earnest upon this
         question. I have seen their shilly-shallying when a Republican Legislature defeated the
         fairest proposition ever offered on this question, and that was to send this question to
         the people for their decision. Believing the Republican party is entirely insincere in its
         advocacy of high license, for when it had the power it would not favor high license I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I would like an opportunity to briefly discuss this question. Whatever
         the Republican party may be in favor of, I stand as an individual conscientiously in favor
         of this increased license. Inasmuch as it is the best I can get I feel under obligation to
         support it, not because I want to make political capital one way or the other. I want a
         fair opportunity given to test the question whether the Democracy are in favor of it. The
         Senator from Cass (Mr. Magee) says the Republicans had an opportunity to present this
         question to the people two years ago, when he knows there were but three Republicans voting
         against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Was the Republican party not pledged to carry it out, and didn't it fail
         because the Republican party did not stand together.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: In that same canvass the Democratic party was pledged in favor of that
         question.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Oh, no; our platform was on both sides of that question. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Your speakers pronounced themselves in favor of that proposition. As it
         is, with no opportunity to be heard on this question, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: In explanation of my vote, I am not an advocate of prohibition, but
         have serious doubts whether on this question the State of Indiana is regulated as it should
         be. I don't believe the present license fee is enough. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: There was certainly no issue made in this
         city upon the question. I pledged myself that I would not vote to disturb the old law. I
         should hesitate before I would say that the people ought to come up to this point when the
         matter was not joined in issue in this canvass. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I desire to say a word in explanation of my vote: I was not here two years
         ago when the question of calling a Constitutional Convention was under consideration, and I
         don't know how many Republicans voted against it. I always understood that the submission
         of a constitutional amendment to the people was a Republican measure, whatever some
         individual Republican Senators have done. There is no question but that the Republican
         party has declared itself itself in favor of the people of the State having the right to
         express themselves upon the subject of regulating the liquor traffic; and it was the
         position of the Democratic party, as a party, that the people should not have the right to
         declare themselves on that subject. And it was the Democratic party, as a party, that
         defeated a submission of that question to the people of this State.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Didn't a Republican clerk of this Senate by bungling, either purposely or
         accidentally, report back the constitutional amendments so they were defeated? And it was
         the fault of your party, as it had charge of the Legislature, and your party should have
         seen that it was properly done.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I do know that the Republican party in 1881 was, as it is to-day, pledged to
         a proposition to give the people of this State the opportunity to express their views on
         any proposed amendments to the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Why did it sit down on Mr. Cumback in the last State convention?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: In its last State convention the Republican party in this State did embody in
         its platform a proposition upon the subject of temperance - the only proportion feasible at
         that time. The other proposition had been acted upon by the people at a preceding election,
         and it was defeated by the Democratic party as a party. The only other measure feasable -
         the Constitutional Convention - the Republican party on the floor of this Senate have
         upheld.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I rise to a point of order; the gentleman from Marion is not
         explaining his vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I am only following the Senator from Cass</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Was there not presented in this Senate in 1881 a proposition for a
         Constitutional Convention and your party voted it down?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: Republicans as a party never voted down any such proposition. The Senator has
         attempted to assume that the Democratic party is the friend of temperance in Indiana. If
         there is any fact established as a matter of history, it is that the Democratic party has
         never been the friend of temperance.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I rise to a point of order. Let him explain his vote but not make a stump
         speech. [Laughter].</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: It comes with poor grace for any member of the majority on this floor to
         object to a rather liberal latitude in the explanation of my vote, in view of the fact that
         debate has been cut off by a motion to lay on the table. It wont do for any <pb n="238"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-238"/> Democratic member on this floor to claim that the Democratic
         party has ever been or is now in favor of temperance in any way shape or form. That party
         has been convicted by State declarations, by acts of its Senators on this floor, and by the
         letter of acceptance of its Presidential candidate, of opposition in every shape and form
         to temperance legislation. And the Democratic party is committed by its past history, and
         its declarations in conventions to prohibit the people from having any opportunity of
         declaring what their opinions on this subject are.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Didn't the Democratic party pass the present temperance law?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: It ought to be called an intemperance law If there is anywhere a law that
         does less to regulate, less to mitigate or less to put a stop to the evils of this traffic,
         it is the law upon our statute books, for which the Democratic party is entitled to full
         credit</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: Would you have been elected to this Senate if you had made the speech you
         made just now in the canvass?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: If there is a single voter in Marion County who voted for me upon idea that I
         was friendly to the sale of liquor, or that I don't think it is an accursed traffic, that
         man could have been very easily undeceived if he had come to me. I have sever postured as
         being a slave to the rum-selling power.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: Would you have been elected if you had made that speech before
         election?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I think I would have been elected by a larger majority than I was if this
         issue had been made in the canvass.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Has not the Prohibition party denounced the Republican party?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: It may be there are some Prohibitionists not pleased with the Republican
         party on this question. I know the Democratic party is not. While I say the record of the
         Democratic party has been consistently in favor of the free and unlimited selling of
         liquor, with the least possible restriction, I say the Republican party has always placed
         itself upon the other side of that issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: What did your candidate far Governor state upon this question with
         reference to the temperance people of Iowa?</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I don't know what he stated. I believe the sentiment of the Republican party
         is in favor of such legislation upon the subject of temperance as will have some tendency
         to restrain and restrict the evils of the liquor traffic. This bill is an attempt in that
         direction. Therefore, as I believe it is the sentiment of the Republican party, as I know
         it is my own individual sentiment, I vote "no" upon this question.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: Is the Republican party in favor of prohibition or license?</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: Don't invite him up any more. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I never understood the Republican party to commit itself to prohibition. I do
         believe the doctrine of high license and strict legislation on the subject of this traffic
         is practicable and right, and the true policy as applicable to our people.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGAS asked that his name be called, and said: Upon this question I think I shall
         vote "aye." I am a native of Indiana, born in Rush County, and I have been conversant for
         twenty five years with the legislation of the different political parties upon the liquor
         traffic, and I have made up my mind the Democratic party is the only real temperance party
         in the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOGH made a point of order. If it is to be the rule that Senators may step out
         in the cloak-room and have their names passed, and then come in and ask that their names be
         called in order to make long speeches after all the other Senators have had their names
         called, I am opposed to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I would not have occupied one fourth the time the Senator has. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM moved to concur in the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The question is whether we will require those vending liquor under
         licenses granted by County Boards to contribute a reasonable portion to the expenses of the
         State. A man may set up the business of selling liquor on $50 or $100, and the income in
         proportion to the amount invested is four-fold the income in any other business.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Have you any evidence that a $500 license will produce more than a $100
         license?</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I know that in the little town of Franklin, four or five years ago,
         before the present law was passed, we exacted, by an ordinance of the corporation, $500
         license, and in one week seven men took out their license and paid in $3,500. We had a law
         under which we could charge $500 license, but that law was stricken down by the present
         license law. We are now asking to restore it. The bill ought to be passed on the ground
         that it will tend to curtail the evils of the liquor traffic. It would cut off a number of
         the saloons all over the State at county cross roads and in the smaller towns and in the
         suburbs of cities, and those are the little dens where the great mischief is done by men
         engaged in this business. I have no doubt if it were once the law that these men were
         compelled to pay a $500 license that the revenue would be largely increased and the evils
         of the sale of intoxicating liquors would be largely diminished. Then our officers would
         have fewer men to watch. Reduce the number of saloons and the violators of law would be
         more readily detected and punished.</p>

        <pb n="239" xml:id="VAA8558-22-239"/>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: I think if the Senator from Johnson [Mr. Overstreet] and his party want to make
         an issue of this they can have a chance in two years from now. There is no evidence that
         the people want us to pass a $300 license law. I thought two years ago they had enough of
         that dose. Men who want to drink will drink under a $500 license just as much as under a
         $100 license. To save further time I move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operation the majority report was concurred
         in by yeas 27, nays 14.</p>

        <head rend="center">NEW INSANE ASYLUMS.</head>
        <p>Mr. GOODING, from the minority of the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>,
         submitted a report on the New Insane Asylum bill [S. 65], recommending its amendment so
         that <pb n="240" xml:id="VAA8558-22-240"/> the one located in Vanderburg County shall
         completed and equipped, appropriating $150,000 therefor in addition to the unexpected
         balance under the act of March 7, 1883, one-half of said moneys to be paid in the fiscal
         year ending October 3l, 1885; also appropriating $40,000 for maintenance to March 1, 1887,
         and prohibiting any further contracts or expenditures or payments of money for the erection
         or completion of a Hospital for the Insane located in either the counties of Cass or Wayne,
         but good care and protection shall be given to the property pertaining thereto. The report
         concludes as follows:</p>
        <p>The undersigned begs leave to briefly submit for the consideration of the House of
         Representatives some of the reasons why the said bill, without the amendments proposed by
         him, should not be enacted into a law, and why, if amended as proposed in his minority
         report, the bill amended should pass and become a law.</p>
        <p>It seems now to be very generally conceded that the act of March 7, 1888, authorizing the
         erection of three additional hospitals for the insane was very unwise legislation and
         without an real necessity therefor, and in utter disregard of public economy, it is not
         necessary at this time and here to inquire into the means used or motives by which the
         enactment was procured. It is sufficient to know that it is the law without the Governor's
         approval. It is not now or here important or material to comment on the action of the
         Governor nor of the Board of Commissioners as to the exercise of the wide latitude of
         discretionary power given them by law. That in some way they were overreached and misled as
         to the necessity can hardly be a question. The number of insane was most likely greatly
         exaggerated, and the Board thereby misled. Be this as it may this Legislature is compelled
         to accept the situation, and to determine what action is best to be taken under all the
         existing circumstances. It is believed that not more than 800 insane persons of this State,
         who should be in an insane hospital, are not now provided with a home therein, and that the
         completion and finishing of the Hospital for the Insane, located at or near Evansville,
         together with the hospital near Indianapolis and now in use will afford ample
         accommodations for all the insane of the State who should be inmates of such an
         institution. That all such should be carefully and generously provided for with suitable
         accommodations in an Hospital for the Insane is not controverted or questioned, nor is
         there intent or purpose to refuse any necessary or proper appropriations therefor, but it
         is not believed that there is at this time, or that there will be for many years to come,
         any necessity or requirements for the contemplated Insane Hospital in Cass and Wayne
         Counties.</p>
        <p>If the goregoing is correct, then it would seem to be unwise legislation to make further
         appropriations for the completion and furnishing of the hospitals at Logansport and
         Richmond. It is now apparent that the erection, completion and furnishing of these two
         hospitals, with necessary attachments, will cost the State about one million dollars before
         they are at all ready for use, and annually thereafter the necessary appropriations for the
         two hospitals, if inmates can be found by searching the State as with a lighted candle,
         including the pay of officers and employes, about the sum of $300,000. It is now evident
         that this Legislature will make appropriations in excess of the revenue of the State in a
         sum of one million dollars or more.</p>
        <p>A bill bow already been passed by this House providing for the sale of State lands in the
         sum of $500,000. It is conceded that it is inexpedient to increase the rate of taxation,
         leaving from four to six hundred, thousand dollars of indebtedness unprovided for at the
         adjournment of this Legislature, thereby greatly impairing the State's credit and a future
         increase of taxation on the people already under the weight of taxation. The adoption of
          ame<gap reason="missing text"/>dments proposed and the enactment of the bill as amended
         will in the course of a few years save millions of dollars to the taxpayers, and be no loss
         or detriment to the unfortunate who have the sympathy and good will of all.</p>
        <p>None will be damaged but the contractors, whose actual damages will be very small when
         compared with the actual costs of the State of continuing the work. The people can well
         afford to pay all the actual damages in preference to paying the annual Treasury. The land
         purchased and the material furnished can be sold for other uses at no very great loss. In
         no event would the entire damages exceed $100,000. To go on with the erection, completion
         end equipping of the two hospitals will cost appropriations not yet made of near
         $1,000,000, as it is believed, exclusive of the costs of running the same after the
         completion and equipment.</p>
        <p>All of which is respectfully submitted, and the proposed amendments are recommended for
         adoption.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Helen M. Gougar addressed a small audience at the House of Representatives at night
         on female suffrage; her subject being "The Relations of the Present Legislature to the
         State of Indiana." She was introduced by Mrs. Walace. Mrs. Gouger said that women are
         debarred from the juries, while men ignorant in every way, men of but merely nominal mental
         capacities, were not. Women were better jurors than men. Chief Justice Green, of Oregon,
         had tried women on juries, and had been so pleased with their performance in that position
         that he would never have a jury unless it was composed of women. Moreover, if a negro could
         have a jury of his peers, why should not a woman? In touching upon Dr. Hammond's Amercan
         Review article, written in opposition to woman suffrage, the speaker said that one of his
         objections was that women were too much inclined toward lying. "If this was a reasonable
         objection, how many editors," asked Gougar, "would then be allowed to vote?" The ballot was
         needed by woman. Her influence now had no practical effect. A ballot in the hands of the
         stupidest, most vicious men had more effect on men and measures in America than all the
         arguments and appeals of the brightest and best woman in the land. Give woman the ballot
         and she would vote for principle. But it was argued that woman suffrage would not cause any
         change, would double the vote, for wives would vote as their husbands did. This was in fact
         an argument for woman suffrage. The dangerous ballot of this country was the tromp vote,
         the "no home" vote. Double the "home" vote, and the "no home" would lose its power. Woman
         suffrage has been tried and was found good and practicable. It improved government. Indiana
         needed this. There was not a Mayor between South Bend and New Albany that was not a cross
         between a decent man and a scoundrel. There was no objection to woman suffrage that could
         not be met and conquered, aside from that of selfishness and prejudice. The Republicans had
         earned eternal fame by freeing the negro, and Mrs. Gougar urged that the Democratic members
         of the Legislature should make their party immortal by freeing woman.</p>

        <p>Mr. RAHM: If we want a Court that will commend itself to the people, we ought to favor

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, from the special <orgName>Committee on Reorganization of the

         appoint new Trustees, who shall appoint a Superintendent, with the consent of the Governor.
         The Governor shall have power to remove Trustees and appoint their successors; the
         Superintendent may be removed by either the Governor of the Trustees. He moved to suspend
         the Constitutional rule that the bill may be pressed to the third reading now.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I make this motion because it is the unanimous desire of those
         who understand this matter. The time has come for the Legislature to take a decided stand
         in reference to this matter. If the General Assembly adjourns without passing this measure
         the same men whose characters are stained by the investigation progress will remain in
         charge. The present management ought to go and go forever. If we do less than this we will
         be recreant to our trust. It will take but a few moments to pass this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: All will agree that some bill of this character should be passed, but we
         should know the provisions, and the bill should be printed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: That bill simply disposes of the present trustees and authorizes the Governor
         to appoint others. That is all there is of it.</p>
        <pb n="243" xml:id="VAA8558-22-243"/>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: If that is all I don't object.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Two years ago the General Assembly thought fit to take these appointments from
         the Governor and placed it in the Legislature. I have always been opposed to bringing the
         management of these benevolent institutions into politics. The only objection I have to
         this bill is that it does no require the Governor to appoint a non-partisan board. This
         seems to be the only way to escape from the present complication of affairs. The Democracy
         would not have been laboring under the cloud that now attaches to the management of the
         Knightstown institution if the Board of Trustees had been non-partisan. The benevolent
         institutions should have representatives of both parties on their boards. The law enacted
         last year was proven to have been a blunder.</p>
        <p>The motion to suspend the Constitutional rule was rejected</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I prepared this bill with little time and in a hurried manner by direction of

        <p>Mr. WILLARD: This bill is a bill in behalf of better prison government. Nearly every

        <p>The lifetime convicts are the only class exempted from the beneficient effect of such

         without any hope for the future. A man thus sent to the State Prison who has wealth or
         wealthy friends has some hopes, but the poor man has no ray of hope unless some such
         measure as this be enacted into a law. This class of men ought to have extended to them a
         chance to ameliorate their condition by good behavior during their confinement. This bill
         is in the nature of a ticket-of-leave system, nor can any man escape from the walls of the
         penitentiary under it without a certificate of recommendation from the warden and directors
         of the prison, after serving the term of twenty-five years, and if within the period of
         five years he misbehaves he is returned with a life sentence. Life prisoners were not the
         vilest of the criminal classes. Murder for gain was generally punished by death, the
         murderers committed for life were generally men who acted under strong and perhaps
         uncontrollable temporary impulse, sometimes were unjustly convicted. I trust this bill may
         pass to its engrossment.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I am opposed to this bill. We have only two crimes for which the life
         sentence can be pronounced - treason and murder. In a great majority of cases where the
         prisoner should suffer the severest penalty of the law, under a false sentiment of the
         community, he manages to obtain a life sentence in the penitentiary. This bill would
         release such, with time earned by good behavior, in thirteen years and one month. It
         reduces the punishment so that a man that should be hung will only be imprisoned from
         thirteen to fifteen years. I am much more inclined to look after the welfare of the entire
         community than that of a criminal class. The times would probably be better were there a
         more severe execution of the criminal statutes. The law passed two years ago is sufficient
         mitigation of prison discipline. Murderers needed severer punishments rather than lighter.
         Wherever capital punishment has been abolished murder had increased. Wherever capital
         punishment was rigidly enforced murder was comparatively rare. Imprisonment for life should
         be the mildest punishment inflicted for murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, questioned whether the first section would not at once
         release all who have served the time prescribed in this bill, under the operation of the
         existing law.</p>
        <p>Mr. WLLARD: The law of 1883 is not a retroactive.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I hope this bill will not pass. It seems to be a dangerous bil. It would turn
         loose upon society a class of men possessing the lowest instincts of humanity after
         confinement some thirteen or fiteen years. It certainly is not possible that our criminal
         laws need such amendment. If a little more hanging were done society would be much better
         off. The law as it stands is not any too strenuous an this class of prisoners</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I feel that I want to be on the side of humanity, and will support the
         bill. I have learned that the Good Time bill passed in 1883 has worked wonders in our
         penitentiaries. Every man is put upon his good behavior. When you consider the length of
         term they will have to stay in prison, there are very few men who live in prison so long.
         That such may have something to live for, this bill should be passed. I think the great
         object for which a man is put in prison has been accomplished in about two years'
         confinement.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to this bill. It proposes a material change in the criminal
         laws. That class of community disposed to commit crime should be shown what punishment will
         follow crimes. I believe murder is the worst of crimes. It is not honorable under any
         circumstances. If conviction follows, the doom of the convict should be the gallows, or
         incarceration in prison for life. Say that such men shall be turned out, and such
         legislation will be condemned by the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: There has been no bill that has come before a committee on
         which I act that I have given so much considration to. During the two terms I have been a
         member of the <orgName>Prison Commit- <pb n="244" xml:id="VAA8558-22-244"/> ee</orgName>, I
         have conversed freely with the class of persons serving life sentences. At least eight of
         revery ten have committed the crime under momentary or temporary insanity - that is, they
         were drunk. This sympathy, has wrought upon me very much. The object of punishment is two
         fold - for punishment in its reality and for protection to the community. I have feared the
         effect that would come upon the community if it were enacted that a life sentence should be
         but fifteen years' imprisonment. I believe that 95 per cent. of such would go out and make
         good citizens, but I am afraid of the restraining effect upon community. This is a grave
         question; and should be carefully considered. I believe it is not wise for the Legislature
         to enact that a jury shall not impose a life sentence. I move to amend so that "thirty
         years" be inserted instead of "twenty-five."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: If punishment is for reformation, the punishment heretofore inflicted has
         proven a failure. Men have served five and ten years, and have come out worse than when
         they went in. Instead of turning them out reformed, they are turned out with the spirit of
         devils. Many fires in cities are attributable to men who have served long terms in the
         penitentiary and feel they are cut off from other human beings. I believe hope never should
         be removed from the human breast. Where such is the case that man is no friend to humanity.
         I hope the bill will pass. It may need some amendment, but let Indiana take a step in
         advance in this matter.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative 21, negative not counted.</p>
        <p>The Senate ordered the bill engrossed for a third reading by yeas 25, nays 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, explaining his negative vote: I believe it is a too radical
         change and would result in turning a great many life convicts loose.</p>

        <p>Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 178] to appropriate $10,000 to Sarah May, widow of Edwin May, for
         services as architect of the new State-house, was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBBLL of St. Joseph, explained the circumstances of the claim: The claim is based
         upon equity. There is not a dime due upon the contract - the committee and the
         commissioners of the State-house agree upon that.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET moved to amend by striking out $10,000 and inserting -in lieu $4,000. Two
         years ago I voted for this claim as a whole without any personal examination. Since that
         time I have taken the pains to ascertain what would be right. In point of law there is
         nothing due, but inasmuch as the commissioners were able to let the contract at a more
         reasonable price, whatever was saved by that transaction I am willing this claimant shall
         have. The Commissioners s say if Mr. May had lived and performed his contract $4,000 would
         have been every dollar that would have been due, and they say there is no legal obligation
         to pay a single dollar on this claim.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I have come to the conclusion that this is a just claim and ought to
         be paid, every dollar of it. It is not right, for a sovereign State to refuse to allow a
         just claim preferred by any citizen.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: While it is the duty of the Legislature to devise just claims, the
         Legislature should see that no unjust claims are allowed. The State house Commissioners
         have the full power under the law to pay any debt contracted onaccount of the construction
         of that building. Then, let them pay all such just claims and not throw the responsibility
         on the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Until there is some means of determining whether a claim not, we should not
         refuse a just claim because some unjust ones have been allowed. There is more danger in
         refusing to pass this bill to the engrossment than order it engrossed. This is an
         unsatisfactory way to ascertain the justice of claims, but we have no better way. The
         State-house Commissioners know better than any man whether this claim is just or not. The
         state can afford to do right whether it can be compelled to do right or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I had the honor two years ago to be the chairman of the committee which
         considered this claim, and I took exceptionable pains to examine it. It is unfortunate
         there is no tribunal before which citizens can go with their claims against the State. This
         is the only forum where claimants can press their claims. No man hearing the testimony
         could do otherwise, were he sitting as a juror, than to give judgment for the full amount
         of this claim. I know of no other way to ascertain facts for our guidance than to have a
         committee investigate and report as to the matter. I bottom this claim on what is right and
         what is just, and I support this bill and support it cordially. When he had concluded, he
         dmanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the motion to amend the bill by
         reducing the sum to $4,000 was rejected by - yeas 15, nays 34</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, in explanation of his vote, said he should vote upon the
         recommendation of the committee and the State-house Commissioners.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER said as he did not believe the State owes one dollar of this claim he should
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I shall vote for the amendment because it is preferable to the $10,000; but
         on the final passage I shall vote against the whole proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS, when his name was called, said: There has been no testimony or argu- <pb
          n="245" xml:id="VAA8558-22-245"/> ment showing the State owes Mrs. May $10,000 or $4,000;
         therefore I vote "no.'</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: There has been no question that has embarrassed me more thaw this matter
         since the beginning of this session. The State should not deal with her subject as one
         private citizen would with another. I don't think a legal right enters into this question,
         but I have no doubt this claimant has a moral right to $4,000. The argument here has made
         me think she probably should have more than $4,000; therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading by yeas 24, nays 24.</p>
        <p>The Lieutenant Governor, in giving the casting vote, said: I feel, under the
         circumstances, the State of Indiana can not afford not to pay her just debts, therefore I
         vote "aye." [Applause.]</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: Acting as a sworn juror to justice, if I thought it just, if everybody
         voted against it I should vote for it, but as I don't think it is just and as the committee
         all concur there to no legal obligation to pay this sum, therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET felt that $4,000 could be allowed without injury to the State, but feeling
         that $10,000 is not supported as a claim against the State he should vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: Two years ago voted against this allowance, and is more satisfied now that
         upon all questions of paying claims the State should not screen herself under the fact that
         she can not be sued; but such things should be decided as they are between man and man;
         therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN voted for the $4,000 but thinking the $10,000 too much, voted "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the bill was ordered engrossed.</p>

        <head rend="center">STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.</head>
        <p>Mr. Schloss' bill [S. 330] to appropriate $25,000 a year to the State Normal School was
         read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: A bill has been fully considered by the friends of the
         school, which he offered as a substitute for this bill 330.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE thought a provision to take this out of the general fund would be the proper
         way.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill ought not to be engrossed. It seems to have for its object the
         appropriation out of the 16 per cent. levy for school purposes. That is part of the common
         school fund of the State. This 16 per cent. levy has the same object as the common school
         fund, and this bill proposes to divert $25,000 of that fund to this one school at Terre
         Haute; and this diversion might just as well be made to other schools in the State until
         all the Common School fund is absorbed in that way. The bill should be amended so that the
         the money shall come from the general fund. Let us see what amount is expended for
         professors and teachers there. The first item is $3,000 for the President, when the
         President of the State University does not get so large a salary. [Reads.] Nineteen
         professors are teaching in that normal school. The number is too large and the compensation
         is too high, and that is why it is this school asks an additional appropriation every year.
         Twenty thousand dollars is all the Legislature ought to vote, and not another dollar more
         than the Legislature has been appropriating.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The State Normal School is an adjunct to the common school system of the
         State. There is no way in which the common school system can be aided better than by
         furnishing it good and trained teachers. This school is growing from year to year, and will
         need large appropriations as the years roll by.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: It would be very wrong to pass this bill. [He read a short extract from
         Governor Hendricks' last message to the Legislature, prefacing recommendations as to the
         school system of the State.] This bill comes directly in the line of perverting the common
         school fund from the purpose for which it was intended. He had a list showing that the
         State Normal School had but few in attendance in comparison other normal schools in this
         State. This State Normal School is a Terre Haute and Vigo County school. He demanded the
         money belonging to the children of this State be allowed to go to them. I hope this bill
         will never be engrossed and never passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET would not cast a vote knowingly that would tend to cripple the common
         schools of this State. I don't know why it is these large salaries are paid. In a college
         in our town there are professors who do as good work as any in the State, on a salary of
         $1,000 a year. I have heard no good reason stated why there is $5,000 more asked for than
         heretofore. I want to give this school enough, but desire to have a good reason for the
         additional appropriation. The people are beginning to feel that this is too expensive a
         luxury.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I can hardly understand the arguments made against this bill.
         While not as well informed on this subject as he would like be, it is thought the better
         plan is to raise this fund out of the fund which is raised by special taxation.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This bill would be taking away 5,000 days of schooling from the children of
         this State.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: It would make such a slight difference in the terms of the schools in the
         State - one half-day in each school district - that it is thought to be less objectionable
         to take the fund as proposed. Those in charge are indifferent as to what fund the
         appropriation comes from. The trustees of this institution are the best judges of the
         moneys needed to carry it on. More is need- <pb n="246" xml:id="VAA8558-22-246"/>ed now

        <p>On motion by Mr. PETERSON the bill [H. R. 66] fixing court terms in the Twenty-first
         (Fountain and Warren), Twenty-second (Montgomery), and Forty-seventh (Vermillion and Parke)
         Judicial Circuits was read the second time by title and the third time by sections under a
         dispensation of the constitutional restriction.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: In view of the fact a committee has been appointed to redistrict the
         State for judicial purposes, it seems to me there ought not to be new circuits created.
         There will be too many on hand, and they will be hard to get rid of. At the last <choice>
          <sic>Septembar</sic>
          <corr>September</corr>
         </choice> term of the courts there was but little business done anywhere in the State on
         account of the political canvass, and now use they are a little overflowing it is not to be
         wondered at. There are enough circuits already established to do all the business of the
         State with dispatch.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I have some knowledge of the business of some of the counties proposed to be
         created in new circuits. The bar of Montgomery County is not unanimous on the measure. Park
         and Vermillion have about three weeks' court in each, and I understand that is ample time
         to transact all the business in those counties; indeed, there is not more than two-thirds
         labor in counties for a Judge to perform. And the committee appointed to redistrict the
         State ought not to be hampered by the creation of new districts.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I have some experience with committees appointed to sit during the recess.
         Last session there was a committee appointed on prison convict labor, and yet to-day that
         subject is no better digested than it was two years ago. It is simply impracticable; the
         committee men can not afford to leave their private business without pay, to attend to such
         matters. I have never cast my vote for a new circuit, but as the county of Montgomery is a
         year and a half behind with court business, it would be practical a denial of the
         constitutional provision that justice shall be dispensed speedily and without delay, unless
         relief is granted. I think the bill ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: The people should have justice meted out to them, and it seems to be an
         utter impossibility for Montgomery County to get along without the relief asked for in this
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I understand the Senators from these districts not only
         advocate this bill, but state there is a necessity for it, and I shall vote in favor of
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I understand there is a necessity for this bill and consequently shall
         vote for it. There is no State in the Union but has more courts and different courts than
         the State of Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLCUGH: There are less than 8,000 voters in Montgomery, and there are 500 000 in
         the State. Upon that basis there would have to be more than sixty Judges to do the work of
         the State, to be paid out of the State Treasury. I am opposed to this measure. There it
         nothing to show these counties should have Judges they ask for.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: In Montgomery County they are over 500 cases behind, including four murder
         trials, and there is an urgent necessity for the passage of this bill.</p>
        <pb n="249" xml:id="VAA8558-22-249"/>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the a previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded, and under its operations bill passed by yeas 80, nays 13.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: Though it has been insinuated that those who may vote against this measure
         are parsimonious and so on, I am not influenced by any such talk, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, being informed they can't very well get along up there without this bill,
         voted "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Out of deference to the presiding officer and to the Senator from Montgomery,
         and from information I have received from private parties, I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. Foulke's Civil Service bill [S. 1 - see pages 18 and 205] was read the third time and
         failed to pass - yeas, 17; nays, 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: In explanation of my vote I will say: Although the author introduced this bill
         for the sake of civil service reform, I do not believe he is in favor of it himself,
         because when we had the Metropolitan Police bill before the Senate last session, which was
         a civil service reform measure, he was opposed to it. I believe the Republican party needs
         civil service reform, and very badly, but inasmuch as the Democrats have control of the
         State and National governments, I think it is fair to let President Cleveland and Governor
         Gray and the balance of the Democracy show that there is a necessity for civil service
         reform. I believe they will reform everything to the satisfaction of the majority of the
         people. As this bill is for buncombe anyhow, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS, when his name was called, said: I am in favor of civil service reform, but I
         desire it made applicable only to Democrats, and as this bill makes no such provision I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above, so the bill was rejected.</p>

        <p>Mr. Youche's bill [S. 12] to authorize owners of tracts of land separated by the right of
         way of a railroad company to construct wagon and driveways over the same, was read the
         third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I introduced this bill at the request of a gentleman who is affected by a
         railroad running through his land, not giving him a crossing. Since then it has occurred to
         me it may be unconstitutional. If it were constitutional we could all vote for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The right of way of a railroad company is said to be not a fee simple, but an
         easement only; yet there are Supreme Court decisions declaring that the right of way of a
         railroad company is exclusive. The matter is not wholly free from doubt.</p>
        <p>M. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: If the parties under this bill could in any way attempt to
         interfere with the right of way of a railroad, it would be objectionable, but I think the
         bill ought to pass in the interest of the public at large, and let the question
         constitutionality come up afterward if occasion should require.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. YOUCHE the bill was passed over informally, to give friends of the

        <p>Mr. McClure's bill, S. 15, being read the third time - </p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: On the first day of the session I introduced this bill: the Senator from
         Jennings also introduced a similar bill, which I returned to the Senate, but it was voted
         down. I requested the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) to write a bill including the
         provisions of the two, which he did, and this is the bill. It is a just one. It is for the
         purpose of having a contingent fund sat aside from which the Superintendent of Insane
         Hospital may draw from month to month to pay contingent expenses of the institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The bill provides that $2,000 shall be set apart out of the appropriation for
         the asylum as a contingent fund for the use of the Superintendent of the Hospital for the
         Insane. The necessity of it is stated in a letter from the present Superintendent, Dr. W.
         B. Fletcher. [Reads.] During every month he borrows from $500 to $1,500, which he disburses
         for this institution, as I understand. I don't think that sort of responsibility ought to
         be placed upon him. The Board of Trustees, as I am informed, are in favor of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I am satisfied of the propriety of passing this bill. This will release the

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: If this bill proposed to state what children under twelve
         years of age should do; that is, if it required them to be in school, I should be in favor
         of the bill, but as it simply provides that they shall not be at work to aid their parents
         in providing for the family home - in other words, as it leaves them to run without
         employment on the streets - I believe it is vicious legislation, and therefore vote

        <p>Mr. JOHNSON of Tippecanoe, when his me was called, said: I think the best feature of the

        <p>Mr. WEIR: That amendment would make a man liable without being in fault. Suppose some one

        <head rend="center">LIVE STOCK CORPORATIONS</head>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 70 - see pages 189 and 194] coming up on the third reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE explained the provisions of the bill as he did on page 189.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I have examined this bill, heard both sides, and I think it ought
         not to become a law. Foreigners may assist in the organization of such corporations - as
         many as may be possible to organize. There is no question that if this bill becomes a law
         in less than five years the entire agricultural interest in the State will be controlled by
         corporations of this kind so far as the raising of live stock is concerned. I do not
         believe the Legislature dare to lay its bands upon the agricultural interest and say it
         shall be controlled by corporate powers. If this bill be enacted into a law there will be
         no reason why persons may not come to the next Legislature, asking to be incorporated for
         the purpose of raising wheat and corn in Indiana. Step by step are the people losing
         control and being overshadowed by corporations. This is the worst bill which has been
         introduced in this body, though I believe it comes from pure yet mistaken motives. One of
         great objections to this bill is that it gives the power to corporations to buy up real
         estate in Indiana, and if it becomes a law in less than five years millions of acres will
         be owned by corporations, and a corporation never dies; it has neither blood nor brains,
         soul nor heart. I insist on the defeat of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I see no danger in creating a stock corporation of this character. I
         anticipate no trouble in that respect, and the other provisions will be sanitary.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I believe that this proposition to throw the importing and
         trading in imported stock into the hands of large corporations must be of great harm to the
         farmers of this State, who are as much interested in the raising and selling of stock as
         they are in the raising of grain. If monied corporations are to take lands, and with a
         capital stock of $250,000, which by surplus may be raised to any amount, are to take this
         business, the farmers who are conducting it in a small but profitable way must be injured,
         as for the last few years profits on grain have been small, and farmers are more and more
         looking to fine stock for profits. The agricultural interests are paramount to all others,
         and I hope this bill in the interests of monied men and against agricultural interests will
         not pass</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operation the bill failed to pass, for want

         with the agricultural business, but I think we have hedged that around so as not to
         endanger competition, except as to importing and breeding from imported cattle, and in as

        <p>Mr. WINTER: Persons frequently meet with an accident on streets, and the plaintiff has
         the right to join in an action all persons he may think liable. This bill cuts that off,
         and the claimant would be compelled to sue all in a separate suit, which might result in no

        <p>The House proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this hour, being Mr.
         Boyd's Drainage bill [H. R. 222 - see page 206] proposing a repeal of all existing laws on
         the subject and the enactment of entirely new laws on the subject.</p>
        <p>Pending which -</p>
        <p>The House took a recess for dinner.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <head>THE DITCH LAW.</head>
        <p>The House resumed consideration of Mr. Boyd's bill [H. R. 222] to abolish the office of
         Ditch Commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I do not believe that any man in the State thinks more of a good ditch law
         than I do. But the one at present in force should be amended or repealed. I believe in the
         majority theory. I do not think that any member here would vote to repeal the free gravel
         road law in regard to a majority petitioning for a road. I stand with the gentleman from
         Hancock (Mr. Gooding), that it should take a majority start the ditch. I was in hopes that
         the old bill would be repealed. I believe that this bill will do as I think is best for our
         drainage. I shall support it.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON Take it all in all this bill will make the best law. Property will be as
         well protected under this bill - as well as any law on our statute books. The gentleman
         from Wells (Mr. Mock) makes the objection that ten days are given for remon- <pb n="252"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-252"/> strance while the petitioners have but one day. But suppose the
         petition is defective in form, all the petitioners have to do is to, by one stroke of the
         pen, correct it, and the movement goes on. There is not one thing in that criticism that
         one day is not enough for the petitioners to correct. In ten minutes' time any defect may
         be corrected. The second objection was that a majority may defeat the bill. I regard that
         as a redeeming feature. If a ditch is of public benefit I undertake to say that it will
         affect a majority before it will be of public utility. Will any one say that anything
         regarding the State is of public utility when it does not affect a majority of the
         taxpayers of the State? Suppose men of wealth near land owners who have little should go to
         the latter and say: "We propose to make you rich in spite of yourselves, and we know and we
         propose to cut a canal through your land." This would be the minority urging against public
         utility. I regard this majority feature of the bill one of the best in it, and I say to
         those gentlemen of the House, who are now objecting to it, that I verily believe that they
         must take it as it is, or it must fail. The third objection the law was that in relation to
         cleaning ditches - that of taxing all benefited to keep it clean. Suppose a man should own
         a small bit of land with quicksand in it. Should he constantly labor to keep that from the
         ditch for the benefit of all the others who might be benefited? There was an insinuation
         thrown out here that this law is in the interest of attorneys. I can not say how, because
         if the proceedings are not gone ahead with properly then the whole thing falls at once - no
         prolonging for fees. The old law is far more to the advantage of the lawyer than the new
         one. I have ditch trials - remonstrances - in my county (Marshall) where it took nine days
         with three lawyers on a side, and their fees running up to $300 or $500.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I come from a county in which this old law has operated. In that county we
         have made over 100 miles of ditch under the old law, and in that county I have seen $20,000
         of property confiscated under it. I am opposed to the majority confiscating the property of
         the minority, and, of course, I am much more opposed to the minority confiscating the
         property of the majority. I shall at least vote to repeal the old law, if we can not have
         the proposed bill made a law.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD, There are some objections to this bill, but it is far better than the old one.
         When it goes to the Senate I hope that the bill will be so amended as to strike out lines
         26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31, and all before the word "provided" in line 32 of Section 3, page
         3 (printed bill), to allow any man the right to drain his land if he is willing to pay
         damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operation the bill passed by yeas 60, nays
         30.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH, explaining his vote, said that the bill had been so doctored as to become a
         monstrosity, and he would be compelled to vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON, when his name was called, said: The bill is far better than the old one. It
         does away with the most objections, and I shall vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN, in explanation of his vote, said: The old law was a robbery on poor men, who
         have hard struggles to support their families, and as poor men generally are Democrats I
         vote 'aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: This bill repeals a very bad law, and while the bill may
         not be free from objections, yet as it is far better than the law, I shall vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. FRENCH, explaining his vote, said he thought that if there were morality and

        <p>Mr. HARRELL, when his name was called, said he believed that such a law on the statute

          <corr>becomes</corr>
         </choice> a law, will compel that, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: For two reasons I do not favor this bill. One is because of the change of
         the text books; the other because it is too comprehensive to be defined clearly in any law.
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL, when his name was called, said: I do not see in the measure where a
         benefit can occur, because it is not clearly defined. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Because it will not necessitate a change in text books, and because the
         evils of alcohol should be learned in the schools. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN, in explaining his vote, said: It looks like a jobbery, especially in our
         common schools. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: Because it will teach children who will have no other means of learning it,
         the evils of alcohol, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I am not a fanatical temperance man, but as the text books on
         this question are already prepared, and as it should be taught to check the era of
         drunkenness, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY, when his name was called, said: I owe its to my constituents to sup- <pb

         would urge me to vote for it; aye, the sainted mother above would urge me to vote for it. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: It is not taught as it should be, and believing that it should be made
         mandatory, I vote quot;aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: If this bill were confined to alcohol and tobacco I should vote for it, but
         it embraces all narcotics, and to teach all the latter would be to consume all the school
         time. I vote "no."</p>

        <p>So the bill passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill passed. In the haste to

        <p>The question being upon the engrossment of the bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: The bill is just and should be passed. Last session it

        <p>The SPEAKER: There was time given for amendment. Mr. Patten wished to offer an amendment
         out of order, but there was objection. A gentleman has just said to me that it was the

        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: This bill is an unnecessary expense. The law as it now stands is much

        <p>Mr. WEIR understood the Auditor and Treasurer have assumed the responsibility of so doing

        <p>Mr. Youche's bill [S. 77] to repeal the Township Railroad Aid act, and to prevent
         townships from voting appropriations in aid of railways, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE explained: It is for the purpose of prohibiting County Commissioners from
         taxing the people for railroad aid. The people should be no longer taxed for such works,
         the emoluments and benefits of which go to corporations. The time has come to stop this
         kind of public aid to private enterprises.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I think the railroad development of the State has brought about great
         beneficial results, but there are thirteen lines running through the north part of the
         State into Chicago, where not half of them are needed. The necessities for the present law
         have ceased. Capital is abundant, and if the people can be assured that by investing their
         money it will bring a fair return, there will be no trouble about getting such improvements
         made. The law can now be repealed without injury. I am in favor of protecting the interest
         of the taxpayer in this particular. It is a question of some importance. I have heard of no
         good reason why the law should not be repealed.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I have decided to vote against the repeal of this law. As far
         as I have observed no township has ever lost money by aiding the building of a railroad
         through it. There may be others who desire to avail themselves of the benefits of this law,
         and let therm decide whether they will tax themselves or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am very warmly in favor of this bill. The time has passed when another
         dollar of subsidy should be paid to any railroad enterprise, which, although it has done
         great good, is a fruitful source of impending danger to the interests of the State. In the
         interest of the people, who ought to have the right to determine for what they will pay
         their own money, we ought not longer to continue the present law upon our statute
         books.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I sincerely trust this bill will pass. Under a bill like this I saw built
         through Lawrence and Greene Counties a narrow-gauge road, when the subscription was made
         for a broad-gauge road, and saw the taxpayer pay out $42,000 for no return whatever. It is
         almost impossible for taxpayer to defeat such a tax, after the County Commissioners have
         ordered an election to vote for or against railroad aid. It is almost always carried by
         corruption and by a floating vote. These taxes are laid for private enterprises, to build
         up corporations in which the people have no interest. The time has come when we should no
         longer say to corporations that you can put your hands into the pockets of the taxpayers
         for your private benefit.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I believe this law has produced great benefits to the people. I
         oppose this bill because it takes away from the people the right to govern their own
         affairs in this matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: I believe I know the feelings of the people of Southern Indiana, who have not
         the advantage of railroads the northern part of the State have, and who are anxious to take
         advantage of this law. The only motive for the repeal of this law seems to be to prevent
         competition. I have heard no demand for the repeal of this law. It is a disgrace to say
         these propositions are carried by corruption. We want these railroads if we can get there,
         and, for one, I am opposed to the repeal of this law. The argu- <pb n="256"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-256"/>ments made in favor of this bill are enough to defeat it.
         Railroad competition does inure to the benefits of the people of the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am opposed to the passage of this bill. One of the best investments our
         county ever made was voting a tax to secure the building of the Chicago and Atlantic
         Railroad, and I am not willing to cut off other counties from obtaining like benefits if
         they so desire.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operations the bill was rejected by
         yeas 20, nays 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, explaining: In our township, in the city of South Bend, we
         have within the last year received great benefits by the law now in force. I am willing
         other townships in the State shall have an opportunity to receive similar benefits from the
         operations of the present law, end so I vote "no" against the passage of this bill.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE'S joint resolution [S. 11] for an amendment to Art. 2 Sec. 2, by striking
         therefrom the word "male," being read -</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I desire the question as to whether a woman shall be entitled to vote, shall
         go before the people of the State with the other amendments to the Constitution that are to
         be submitted for their ratification or rejection. I ask any man to state any good reason
         why the right of suffrage should not be conferred on women if they want it. That is an
         inherent right which God has given to woman as well as to man. There is only one bar
         remaining - the bar of sex. What right have we to draw a line which shall include us and
         leave women out? Every class is best qualified to take care of its own rights. It is an
         unjust government which imposes taxation without representation. There ought to be nothing
         the boy can aspire to but that the girl also ought to be allowed to aspire to.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It is a fact there is a large number intelligent men and women desirous
         of having an expression of the will of the people on this subject, and now when that
         privilege can be granted without expense, it is but a matter of justice that the
         opportunity should be given. If we desire to quiet these people, give them an opportunity
         to have it voted upon. Can any Senator object to have this question once for all passed
         upon? It is a right the people have to ask the privilege of testing in a legal way any such
         proposition, and they ought to have the opportunity of so doing upon this as upon any other
         question.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER opposed the resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: This subject has been agitated so long that it is about time the people
         should have a chance to vote upon it. We ought to meet this question as man, and not shrink
         from it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The vote for this amendment is just as much a vote for the principle as a
         vote for any bill is in favor of the measure contained in it. After two succeeding
         Legislatures agree to an amendment to the Constitution, then it is submitted to the people
         to ratify or reject. The great trouble is these gentlemen want to commence at the wrong end
         of the line. If an amendment to the Constitution is right - if gentlemen are willing to go
         before the people and advocate it as right - then they can consistently come in and
         advocate an agreement thereto by two consecutive joint assemblies. The first step to be
         taken is to submit to the people any proposed amendment to the Constitution, and then come
         to the Legislature with it. So I think the Constitution contemplates. I will vote for an
         amendment in order to let it go to the people, but must first be convinced a majority of
         the people want it. You make ladies electors and you make them qualified for Governors,
         Judges and jurors, as well as any other elective position</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: While it is my belief that delicacy of instinct, peculiarity
         of sex, burdens of maternity, domestic cares and inclinations, all make it impracticable
         and undesirable that women should enter politics, I yet believe there is and has been a
         desire throughout the State to test this question at the ballot-box. I believe this to be
         right, and for this purpose I shall vote for the resolution.</p>
        <p>The resolution was rejected by yeas 23, nays 25</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE explaining: Believing the people have the right to say at the ballot-box what

        <p>Mr. Weir's bill [S. 45] to create an Appellate Court, being the special order for this
         hour, was taken up, the question being on the adoption of a minority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: This is an important measure. The original bill provided for a Court of
         five Judges, to sit at Indianapolis. A majority report recommends its passage. A minority
         report recommends the passage of a bill for three Courts of three members each, to sit in
         three several districts of the State. The latter bill is drawn by some of the best lawyers
         in the State. One objection to the bill providing for one Court is those Judges must be
         paid $4,000 a year, that is, $20,000 for the five Judges. There are 1,200 volumes of the
         Supreme Court reports sold, while numbers of the States around us sell reports running up
         to thousands. Only 100 are sold outside of the State, while 30,000 copies of Massachusetts
         reports are sold. The Supreme Court of Indiana is taking a very low stand. It shows Indiana
         Courts are not authority. Our Judges will, compare with the Judges of other States, but
         this discrepancy is because we compel them to pass upon cases without the consideration
         they should have the time to give.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I would just as soon have the one as the other, perhaps I might say my
         preference would be for the three courts. If the Senate conclude there must be an Appellate
         Court, then the choice can be made as between the two. I believe this measure to be as
         important as any bill that has been presented to the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: This is a measure of great importance to the lawyers, to the
         judges, and of greater importance to people of <choice>
          <sic>Indana</sic>
          <corr>Indiana</corr>
         </choice>. It is the only way in which we can in a legal manner relieve the Supreme Court.
         Under the bill which the Senator from Gibson advocates nearly every case now sent to the
         Supreme Court now could be brought to that court. The bill of the Senator from Laporte is
         preferable. If the decisions of such court is not to be authority, I shall vote against
         creating any court. Were there three courts there would be decisions conflicting at times,
         each with the other. We should have a court that will produce decisions that are uniform
         and binding. It seems to me this is the greatest objection this system of three courts with
         nine Judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I don't entertain the opinion that there is an absolute need
         of this Court to enable the Supreme Court to catch up with the business. The time has been
         when the Supreme Court was farther behind than it is now. My principal reason for favoring
         an Appellate Court, is that it will supplant the Commissioners of the Supreme Court. An
         Appellate Court of five Judges would be no additional expense. I believe it better to have
         but one Appellate Court with three Judges.</p>

        <p>Mr. LOYD from the <orgName>Orphans' Home Investigating Committee</orgName> reported to
         the Legislature. It finds, among other things, that the charges made by Goar that White or
         his sons had been guilty of immoral conduct toward or with inmates of the institution were
         untrue; that the character of White for sobriety and chastity was good; that he had
         maintained a good sanitary condition throughout the institution, but that he had been
         guilty of gross negligence in the supervision of his subordinates; that boys have been
         severely whipped by such attendants. That two boys were handcuffed together for two days.
         That he has permitted children to be locked in dark closets and kept on a diet of bread and
         water for nearly a week at a time. That one Morgan, a subordinate, had cruelly treated one
         Ed Boker, who was feeble-minded and an orphan of a soldier. That one subordinate had been
         guilty of an unnatural crime with boys between the ages of ten and fourteen years; that
         White retained such employe in the service of the institution for a period of seven or
         eight weeks after he had come into possession of sufficient information to warrant the
         expulsion of said employe. That White had been imprudent, but not criminal, in secluding
         himself with female attendants of the institution. That he had been negligent and
         inefficient in the discharge of his duties. That he should be removed from office. The
         committee further recommended that a bill be prepared to remove said White and said Goar
         from office; that the Brown bill be repealed, and that the appointment of the trustees be
         vested in the Governor; that the trustees be chosen from the two political parties polling
         the highest votes at the last general election, and that the Soldiers' Orphans' Home and
         the Asylum for Feeble-minded children be managed as separate trusts.</p>
        <p>[A similar report was presented to the Senate by Mr. JOHNSTON of Dearborn.]</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I do not care to make a speech in submitting this report, but in view of the
         fact that the interest of the State, the interest of the soldiers' orphans, and the
         interest of the feeble-minded children have been at stake; in view of the fact that sore
         charges are sustained against character, I deem it proper to say a little. It was the
         honest aim of the <orgName>Committee of Investigation</orgName> to make a thorough and
         complete investigation. The committee worked hard and together for twenty-one days and
         nights and examined ninety one witnesses. They were unanimous. Politics did not interfere
         with the investigation. As a Democrat I wished to relieve my party from all blame. I
         understand that a bill has been introduced in the Senate on this question. I regard that as
         an insult to this committee. Charges were made in the Senate that the committee delayed to
         hear long arguments from attorneys on the defense in the case, all of which is false. That
         Senate bill is previous, to say the least.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: To make an impartial investigation it became necessary for us to allow the men
         against whom charges were made to introduce such witnesses as they chose. I have heard
         to-day that there are men in this city able and ready to swear that Mr. Goar <pb n="259"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-259"/> was frequently intoxicated here, at Knightstown and at New
         Castle. As a fact, on the last night before the committee he appeared intoxicated. And as
         to the charges at his criminal intimacy with Nellie Leighton, every circumstance, without
         going into detail, points to his guilt. All the evidence for the defense was worked up by
         men in Indianapolis. We learned that one James H. Woodward, whom the committee failed to
         find, had undertaken Goar's defense, and wrote decoy letters and so misrepresented matters,
         and urged young girls to give untrue testimony, that he left the State to avoid trouble -
         subornation of perjury.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: Is this man Woodward the correspondent "Jayhawker?"</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: The same I believe. The evidence goes on to show where Goar bought a jersey and
         dresses for Mary Thompson; that he undertook to entice her into a house of questionable
         character. In fact, there is every evidence against his character.</p>
        <p>And as to Mr. White, the Superintendent, we find beyond doubt that he allowed a man who
         had lacerated the back of a soldier's ward with a rawhide to remain in the Institute for
         some time after he knew these facts. Mr. White knew of the imprisonment of boys in
         dungeons; of all character of cruelties. Mr. White, when put upon the stand before the
         committee, said he believed that for a year past Goar had been guilty of these evils, yet
         we find that he and Goar were on good terms less than a year. If he were a fit man to take
         charge of the institution he would not have been on as friendly terms as then nor kept an
         eye closed to the horrible truth. I do not believe that Dr. White was guilty of criminal in
         intercourse with females of the institution, but he was guilty of improprieties. Mr. White
         had the power to discharge and employ whom he pleased, yet with this power he allowed
         insubordination, and he is not a fit person to govern the institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: I would like to ask the committee why when the authorities drew $130 which they
         had no right to do, the committee says nothing of it in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: There was not enough testimony presented to show that the Trustees were
         entirely to blame for that, and I did not feel like making a minority report on that point.
         I want to exclude Dr. White from blame in the private bills, which were attempted to be
         charged to the State. He adopted that. And I want especially to call attention to the
         testimony which shows that the most outrageous acts, such as sodomy, were committed on the
         persons of inmates of the institution by a man more vile than the chained demons in hell.
         Yet Dr. White failed to investigate this, because, as he lamely says, he did not believe it
         when told of it, though he was told of it frequently by responsible persons. Take this
         institution from politics, or at least allow the Republicans a minority representation on
         the board. Every man who has the good of the children of the dead soldiers at heart; when
         we think that daughters of our dead comrades were seduced in the very shadow of that

        <p>On motion of Mr. TAYLOR, Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 189] relative to a Union Depot at
         Indianapolis was taken up, the rules suspended and the bill read the second and third
         times.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I think the bill should not pass. It is proposed by the syndicate of
         railway corporations to condemn such property as they like for a union railway. This
         Legislature should not grant this. It should be done - this condemning - in the courts the
         same as other matters of like character. Otherwise but for this I would like to vote for
         it. I would be glad to see a decent depot at our Capital city.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: Every man in Indiana, everyone who comes to Indianapolis, is interested in
         this bill. The bill will give to every man in Indianapolis his full and complete rights. I
         say this after a foil and complete consideration of the bill. It is the desire of the
         railway companies to build a Union Depot that will be of comfort to the cities. The bill
         has the indorsement of all the newspapers of this city, irrespective of party, and it ought
         to have the indorsement of every member of this body. There is no opposition to it by
         citizens.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 55, nays 35.</p>
        <p>The question being upon the passage of the bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: From action on bills of this character for the past few days I do not believe
         remarks on the bill will do any good. I do not intend to refer to this measure as
         nefarious, damnable or anything of that sort, for such words would be complimentary to it.
         If this is to be the attitude of the reform of the Democracy which we have heard so much
         of, I say, God pity the American Government. There is some consolation to me in legislation
         of this kind, when I think of the history of gerrymander in Indiana. The Republicans, in
         1872, made an apportionment bill which took nine of the Congressmen and a majority of the
         Legislators; yet in the succeeding campaign the people arose against it and reprimanded the
         Republican party by defeat. In 1879 the Democratic party repealed the Republican
         gerrymander and made one of their own equally as unfair. What was the result? Again, as is
         always the fate, the people, because they believe in equity and justice in politics as well
         as anything else, elected a Legislature that sent General Ben Harrison to the United States
         Senate instead of Hon. Joseph E. McDonald. Yet I do believe that if this bill could be made
         more infamous, the majority of the House would vote for it.</p>
        <p>I will invite your attention to the little County of Floyd - Democratic - yet hardly
         large enough for one Representative, yet it joined to another of Democratic majority, and
         another and another until it helps send four Representatives here. Jennings County and the
         Republican majority is so joined to another county of larger Democratic majority until the
         voters of Jennings are disfranchised. Clay County, Democratic, is so favored that it is
         used to help to elect three Representatives. The Constitution says that the districts shall
         be composed of continuous counties. While this does not violate the letter of it, yet it
         violates the intention. Here is Vermillion County, Republican, put in with Democratic
         Sullivan to rob the Republicans of Vermillion - Sullivan County, where during the war the
         County Commissioners had put on the record an order seceding from the Union. Is this
         fairness? Is this the beginning of reform? Take the counties of Miami and Cass and
         Kosciusko and Wabash. Ail changed and so looped to disfranchise Republicans. The two
         Democratic have a much larger representation to a smaller population. Every place where a
         Republican majority can be disfranchised it is done. More than thirty counties that have
         Democratic majorities are not only permitted to vote for one but for three Democratic
         Representatives. Quite to the contrary are th« Republican counties. The counties, richer,
         larger, that have more school-houses, churches and therefore Republican - nearly
         twenty-five - there the people are permitted to vote for one, very rarely two,
         Representatives. As a part of my speech, I propose to read a quotation from Hon. Thomas A.
         Hendricks on the Republican gerrymander. [Reads]. This Democratic gerrymander, which gives
         them, lacking two, a two-thirds majority, shows the Democratic fear, which I believe is
         well grounded.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I should bot have risen but for the personal attack on me by the gentleman
         who has just taken his seat. I did not glory in what he calls the "Democratic shame" on
         this floor. I did say that Democrats had been yelling "bloody murder" for a quarter of a
         century, and now let the Republicans try it and see how it goes. I am not ashamed of this
         measure. The proudest moment in my life will be to go home and say to my constituents "I
         helped make another Democratic county or two." Take your Republican map and look at your
         own picture. You may just as well as not make up your minds to step down and out. You will
         have to go</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: If there was a question of property in this, there would be plenty of
         Democrats come to our aid. But owing to politics one-third of the voters must be
         disfranchised, and the months of Democratic members are closed. The truth comes home to me
         at this hour that the Democratic party has no faith in itself, with all its pledges of
         reform, and so on. They are so void in fact of any ability to manage the affairs of
         government that they propose to steal their way in. So they make ready to secure themselves
         in advance from all mistakes. It is no use to talk of this long. The bill will pass. But in
         the minority, as I am, I shall go down with my boots on. The old Democratic wagon can not
         be repaired. You can't paint out the warp in the boards and the shaggy wheels. It is there.
         In spite of all this, the Democratic party will go down with its broken promises - open the
         books for all. Put this bill through and from this body we appeal to the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I regret that I am not in a physical condition to speak as I wish. My
         connection with my first apportionment bill is not a pleasant one. Of twelve years of
         fidelity to the Democratic party, I have now found it necessary to leave the majority. I
         want to stamp this measure as infa <pb n="261" xml:id="VAA8558-22-261"/>mous. I can not
         support it, looking at my oath. Why should I follow a Democratic caucus when I have been
         taught from infancy that the Democratic party is one of justice and equity. I have been
         pronounced an apostate. If to be a consistent Democrat, to stand squarely by my oath and
         support justice is an apostate, then write me down as one. I can say to those blinded by
         party zeal that in the Northern part of the State we study principle and vote it, and
         therefore our vote fluctuates. The Constitution of the State says the number of
         Representatives shall be apportioned according to the number of male inhabitant. This does
         not do that. There are nearly 2,000 more males in Marshall than in Pike County, yet this
         apportionment is not observed. Here are scores of others. Is this carrying out either the
         spirit or the letter of the Constitution? I am here to protest against all this injustice.
         I go back to the year 1878, when I began to take an active part in politics. Then the one
         great issue was the Republican gerrymander. I listened to the speeches referring to that
         infamy and it set my blood boiling and has always, and I say to the Democratic party,
         beware. No one can question my Democracy. I have never voted for any one but a Democrat. I
         have talked to, have been spoken to by a Democrat of this floor, whose hair is whiter than
         mine, but whose Democracy does not ante-date mine one year, and I have been looked upon by
         him as a bolter. The aim I had in view in supporting the Democratic party and putting it in
         a position to control was to correct abuse and cause reform. Is this to fail? Then you will
         hear from the people. They want a good government, and will not cling to any party to the
         hurt of rights. The majority must be respected. If they are not to be heard, then let us
         return to the one man power; the system of voting is a farce then. Let us progress in
         politics as in everything else. If my position here, without order from my constituents,
         takes me out the Democratic party, then I say amen.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: When by any system in this Government one man is counted for
         more than another, then our idea of equality is destroyed. Since 1840 I have been a close
         student of political science. I have been able to call by name and from memory every
         Congressman, commencing at Maine and ending at California. Of all I have ever read this
         apportionment bill is the most outrageously unfair of any in history. I do not except the
         celebrated shoestring district of the times of Gerry. I defy any on to show me one as bad
         as this one. In the last enumeration of Indiana there is about 5,000 for each
         Representative and 10,000 for Senator. The idea of a picture of an apportionment does not
         convey all the truth. A fair apportionment might look hideous by the side of a gerrymander
         and yet be far more fair. The Democrats are not satisfied with 57 per cent. of power but
         they insist upon 97 per cent. or more. Is the insatitate maw unfilled or the craving or
         power unmitigated? In 1846 a party which would do such an act as this would be at once
         overthrown. Why here in Brown County, back among the hills - what meat has this Cæsar eat
         that it has grown so strong, that the little county shall govern four others? It is the
         worst of Mexicanizing. In New Hampshire at one time its Constitution prohibited an
         amendment to itself, yet the people arose in their power and made a Constitution for the
         people. This is not in the memory of the author of the bill, but I remember it. I am sorry
         my friend across the way (from Brown) (Mr. Browning) made the speech he did. It would be a
         good one for a campaign document.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Take it if it will do you good.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: It is altogether as to how we are constituted. The alligator can not help it
         because his hide is thick, nor can the other animal help it because a mosquito can torture
         it; and more, what right has Hancock County to a Joint Representative when it has not
         enough votes for one Representative? In the interest of good government, the rights of the
         people, and in justice to my oath, I can not support the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: My conduct on this bill has been criticised. It has been said that the measure
         is not a just one. It has been said that this same kind of matter has overthrown the
         Republican party. Without going into detail concerning the iniquities of the Republican
         party, what have they proposed in opposition? What reason have they presented for relief
         but the Democratic apportionment of years ago? They have held off this measure until it has
         cost the State hundreds of thousands of dollars. My eternal and unbounded hatred for the
         Republican party of this country, their corruption, their grinding down the poor, setting
         laboring men idle, their bad financiering, has led me to support this. I am content to
         know, and the future will verify my conclusions, that the Republican party is forever
         overthrown.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>His demand was seconded by the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN, the author of the bill, said he wished to set Sullivan County aright. Its
         County Commissioners did not write an order of secession, but that county was loyal, and
         sent its share of soldiers to the war. As to the Democratic brother from Marshall (Mr
         Kellison) the Democratic milk had curdled for him. This is the fairest legislative
         apportionment bill that has ever been attempted in Indiana. No gerrymandering scheme ever
         entered the heads in this House.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 56, nays 38.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM, explaining his vote, said: So far as Henry county is concerned it is eminently
         fair. Henry county has the best <pb n="262" xml:id="VAA8558-22-262"/> showing of any
         Republican county in the bill, but because it is not fair to other Republican counties I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN said: I am sorry there is not a better religious atmosphere. I was to hear
         Moody last night, and he has given me strength for it. I am told that the Republican party
         did as much. Now we are even-handed. And as it will keep peace with the Democrats, and as
         it is in the interest of the Democratic party, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK, of Wayne: Because I think it unjust to people, irrespective of party, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: The passage of gerrymander bills have defeated parties, it has been said
         here. That is not strictly true. In 1887 the Republican party gerrymandered the State and
         no defeat followed. In 1873 they again gerrymandered the State and were defeated in 1874;
         not because of their gerrymander, but because the party Congress had demonetized the silver
         dollar. A Republican who left his party by reason of gerrymander would bring more money to
         Barnum than Jumbo. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: Because it is fair, and as one of its authors, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: There is no inconsistency as it seems, so I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: My first impression was to vote against it, as it affected my
         Senatorial District, but, as that is Republican and I am a Democrat, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: As this bill doubles the representation from my county, and to vote against
         it would make me an ingrate, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: If I were a Republican, would be a stalwart. I have no apology for my vote.
         Good-bye to my Republican friends "Aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I have always tried I be conscientious; I have always had the courage of my
         convictions, and because this scheme is malicious I shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: For the reason that the franchise of the people is stolen by this bill, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: While the Senatorial District of my part of the State is destroyed with its
         Democratic majority, as well as others there, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: Because of its outrageous unfairness I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: There are times when patriotism should rise above politics. One of the
         greatest nations of the earth fell because its people were disenfranchised. Because this is
         so unfair I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: Because this measure tramples upon the rights of the people, "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYWORTH: Because it is not fair to the voter, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: Because there is no justice in it, I vote no.</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above, as the bill passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved that this vote be reconsidered, and that that motion lie on the
         table.</p>

        <head rend="center">INVESTIGATION OF SENATE OFFICERS.</head>
        <p>Mr. May, from the Special Committee appointed to investigate charges against officers of
         the Senate (see page 198), submitted a report. On his further motion it was made a special
         order for to-morrow at 10 o'clock.</p>
        <p>The special committee appointed by the Senate to investigate certain newspaper charges
         that there are more than the legal number of assistants now in the employ of the chief
         officers of the Senate, and that certain officers had overdrawn their pay, made a report to
         Senate. The committee find as follows:</p>
        <p>1. More than the legal number of assistants are employed, and the excess is as follows.
         Mr. Kelly, the chief Secretary, has eleven assistants on his pay-roll. Eight of these are
         authorized by the statute, two by resolution of the Senate, and one, a page, at $2 per day,
         without any authority, and the committee finds that said page has drawn $34. As to
         Assistant Secretary Huffstetter, the committee finds that he is entitled to seven
         assistants by law, and he has nine on his pay-roll, two of whom are without authority. Also
         that Max Dembufsky has drawn $35 for services under Huffstetter, without warrant of law.
         Also the committee say that the law provides that no enrolling or engrossing clerks shall
         be employed until bills are ready for them to enroll and engross, that seven enrolling and
         engrossing clerks have been employed, who have drawn pay at $5 per diem since January 8.
         That the books show that only three bills had been engrossed up to January 27. As to
         Doorkeeper Cope, the committee say that he is entitled by law to seven assistants, and that
         twelve are on the pay-roll, but that the extra force were appointed by special resolution
         of the Senate. All the clerks in the Secretary's employ had drawn pay from the 8th of
         January, except James Walsh, the reading clerk, who has drawn only from January 16, the
         date of hit appointment.</p>
        <p>2. By reason of objection of the majority, the committee made no investigation as to
         whether the number was in excess of the needs of the Senate.</p>
        <p>3. The committee finds that Mr. Huffstetter has drawn $75 in excess of the total amount
         due him for <choice>
          <sic>sxity</sic>
          <corr>sixty</corr>
         </choice>-one days' service. That such oversdraw was the result of an error of an assistant
         in footing the ledger, and that Huffstetter had returned the money on discovery of the
         error. As to Mr. Kelly, the committee find that be had overdrawn the total amount due him
         for a full session's work by $25, which was due to an error in book-keeping, and that he
         had returned such money to the treasury on discovery of the error.</p>

         title, the third time by sections, and passed by yeas 39, nays 0.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL explained: Many old soldiers are entitled to but can not obtain pensions
         because they can not find the required evidence. This bill provides that assessors shall
         take a list of the soldiers of the State when taking the regular assessment and forward the
         list to the Adjutant General of the State, so that when one soldier wants to find any other
         soldier he can readily do so by writing to the Adjutant General of the State. If every
         State in the Union would pass this kind of a bill every old soldier would be enabled to
         find his comrade.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The committee have unanimously recommended that the bill do pass. It will
         not cost the people anything for making the report to the Adjutant General. The Assessor
         takes the enumeration as he passes around, and sends a certified copy of this enumeration
         to the Adjutant General of the State without expense to anybody.</p>

        <p>Mr. BRYANT stated it would make the <pb n="265" xml:id="VAA8558-22-265"/>board to consist

        <p>Mr. ADKISON, explaining his negative vote, had no objection to the Democrats turning the
         Republicans out, but did object to adding another trustee. Therefore he voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: There has been no action in the Democratic caucus on this matter. The caucus
         action two years ago was against changing the State Board of Health. I am one of those who
         believe there should be no politics in an organization of this kind which is simply one for
         sanitary purposes. Once it was attempted in the city of New York to establish a Board of
         Health as a political organization, and the result was the ward bummers controlled it and
         made it an outrage upon the people. I don't believe in this proposed change. A caucus has
         not demanded it, and as the last action in caucus upon this subject was against the changes
         I vote "no."</p>

        <p>Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 177] to pay $5,152.69 to David R. Munson for lightning rods
         placed on the Insane Asylum seven years ago was read the third time, and - </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON and Mr. Foulke explaining the merits of the claim: The State has received
         the work and the State ought to pay for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER would not look with favor upon State claims, but this seems to be a just
         claim. I hope the good name and fame of Indiana will not be tarnished by a refusal to pay
         any just claim.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 35, nays 9.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll-call - </p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ, when his name was called, said this was in the Specific Appropriation bill two
         years ago, but since Senator Fowler has talked in favor of lightning-rods, I know it most
         be an honest claim or he would not vote for it; therefore I vote "aye." [Laughter]</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER, in explanation of his vote, said: I am decidedly opposed to this bill. I
         don't believe it is just. Another reason is: If any man without authority went to England
         to bay a lightning-rod and put it up, it would be a disgrace to the great name of Indiana
         to pay the bill. I think it be worse and more of a disgrace to say we haven't a
         lightning-rod fit to put on our State institutions in this country; therefore I shall vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Two years ago when this claim was presented it was put in the Specific
         Appropriation bill. I was against this claim then because I had no time to investigate it.
         The Senator from Pike was the Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>. I
         regard him as a very careful man and one who would not make a recommendation which is not
         right. I am satisfied if this claim should be brought into the courts of justice in this
         State, as all these claims ought to be brought, the State could make no good and valid
         defence against this claim. The State is able to pay, and the same rule that applies in
         such cases against individuals ought to be enforced as against the State. She has received
         the benefit of this work. There may be some question as to the authority of the person who
         made the contract by allowing the rods to remain on the building. The same laws should
         apply to the State as to individuals. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY, when his name was called, said: Two years ago I was on the <orgName>Committee on
          Claims</orgName>, and I was not convinced that this was a just claim, and I am not
         convinced, now. I do not believe there was any power to make any such contract, and for
         that reason I don't believe the State is liable. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I am a member of the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, and
         as such I assisted in the investigation of this claim. We did not investigate it hastily,
         but we took all the testimony we knew anything about. As far as I was able to I made as
         thorough an investigation as if I had been trying it as a court, and I am satisfied from
         the investigation made that if I had been a Judge of court with jurisdiction to adjudicate
         the claim, from the same evidence before this committee, as a Judge of the court, I would
         have to decide in favor of the plaintiff. The State of Indiana has provided no way by which
         suit can be brought against the State, although the Constitution permits, by enactment,
         such a proceeding. But we have no such enactment, and claimants are debarred from
         recovering except by appeals to the Legislature. I believe if this claim were presented to
         a competent court and tried upon its merits the claimant would recover. From these facts I
         conclude the claim is just, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: An Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> I will state that we
         gave this claim a fair and careful consideration, and were very well satisfied that this is
         a just claim. We acted on the theory if it was a debt an individual ought to pay, it is a
         debt this State ought to pay. The State has no right to hide behind her sovereignty. I
         believe this is a just claim, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I have taken the opportunity to examine this claim, and I believe it to be
         just, I consider it an outrage to an honest claimant that he is forced to go to a jury of
         150 men for the purpose of prosecuting his claim. It is found under the provision of the
         Constitution, referred to by the Senator from Jennings, allowing the establishment of a
         Court of Claims absolutely impossible in this State, for the reason that if such a course
         is permitted every one of the old internal improvement bonds of this State, against which
         we have passed a con-<pb n="266" xml:id="VAA8558-22-266"/> stitutional provision, would
         become enforceable in the United States Court. That has been the difficulty in establishing
         a Court of Claims in this State for many years. I consider it an outrage that people with
         honest claims are forced to come to these bodies with pitiful appeals for an appropriation,
         and find gentlemen, through motives of economy, which I do not question, feel constrained
         to vote against it. As far as this claim is concerned, knowing it to be just, I vote
         "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: Two years ago when this bill was before the Legislature I resisted it and
         fought against it. Since that time I have made some inquiries about the justice of this
         claim, and I have consulted with men who ought to know, and I am informed that this is a
         just claim, and that the State of Indiana ought to pay it. I therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: I think it would establish a very dangerous precedent for the
         General Assembly to allow this claim. Any contractor who might lose money under his

        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: If the committee had reported the exact facts they could go into the

         Legislature should vote money out of the State Treasury. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I was not able to examine into this case. I left that to the
          <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, and when such gentlemen as constitute that

         time earned by good conduct, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: As the bill now stands it embraces a material amendment made
         by myself. There has never been any incentive to life-time convicts for good conduct. The
         bill applies only to those now in prison, and in the future the jury may convict for a term
         of years not less than thirty. The good time may reduce that to twenty-two years. We should
         leave a ray of hope for such prisoners.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: It seems to me if this bill is passed the Warden of prisons
         may choose to mark down every life convict now in the prison, so they may all I set free.
         Then we are passing a law that every man guilty of murder who has been in prison long
         enough to count up the good time under the present law, may go free. I don't believe we
         ought so hastily to pass such a bill. The pardoning power can be exercised in all
         meritorious cases. The bill I think, when printed, will make us appear somewhat ridiculous.
         I shall vote against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: There is a mistake as to the provisions of the amendment adopted. The effect
         would be to change the penalty for murder in the first degree to a term of seventeen or
         eighteen years. I think this principle is vicious in character. It in well known it is in
         the power of a jury to find him guilty of a lesser crime with a lighter punishment.</p>

        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I rise to a point of order. That is a covert attach upon the motives of

        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I impugn no one's motives. But I expect this bill will pass the Senate,

        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: I don't wish to appear inconsistent in my vote on this question. When it was
         up some time ago I voted under a misrepresentation. I voted against the bill when it was my
         intention to vote for it. I now vote for it. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: In casting my vote for this bill I do so with a full realization
         of the duties and responsibilities devolving upon me, and I ask no advice and accept no
         criticism from any source or any person, or any Senator on this floor or off this floor.
         The way I cast my vote only concerns the persons to whom I have to answer. I cast it
         honestly and from a conviction of right and justice. I vote "aye" for this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Two years ago I made an examination into the justice of this claim. I
         was a member of the committee which visited the Board of State House Commissioners to
         inquire this session as to whether this was a just claim, and I became convinced it is
         nothing more than justice that this Legislature should allow it. Hence I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I was very much prejudiced against this claim at the outset. I realize the
         fact that members and committees of the Legislature were not provided with adequate means
         of ascertaining what the facts were, so I took the trouble to see the State House
         Commissioners and inquired as to the merits of this claim. I examined the original contract
         and papers and became satisfied that there were merits in this claim. I have consistently
         voted for that claim since, and I now vote for it. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I have uniformly voted against this claim, and, although I have voted for

         motion.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The question being, shall the bill pass to a third reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: My minority report recommends the stopping of work on these two superfluous
         buildings. I do not propose to play bad faith with the contractors, but I want to pay them
         for the work they have done and quit. These two asylums are not necessary. They are not
         needed, and will be a heavy and unnecessary expense continually. An effort has been made
         here to make the number of insane of Indiana larger than it is, in order to put through
         this scheme. I should not have talked this long, but for the act of the gentleman from
         DeKalb (Mr. Moody ) who has been so mysteriously connected with this bill. There are but
         800 insane in Indiana outside of Indianapolis, and the Evansville Hospital will accommo-
          <pb n="268" xml:id="VAA8558-22-268"/> date them. If not, increase the Evansviile and
         Indianapolis Aslyums some, and save a million dollars to the taxpayers of the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I think my friend from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) has not examined very carefully
         into the figures. The gentleman, by his own remarks, puts his own opinion as to these
         asylums against every other member on this floor, and then puts an imputation against all
         who disagree with him. He should be practical. A portion of the work on the buildings has
         been done. It is not a matter of economy with the gentleman. If the State does not pay for
         the care of these insane the county must in the Alms Homes. So the money comes from the
         taxpayer after all. These people must be provided for. Why was that $600,000 loan made or
         authorized the other day if not to pay for these buildings?</p>

        <p>Mr. PENDLETON moved to amend that physicians write their prescriptions in the English

         have practiced ten years, but not ten years in this State.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: If any bill is to pass relative to medicine, this bill as it comes from the

         pay no attention, receiving little or no pay, and very often they failed to attend

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I represent a corn-growing district, and I believe it should be

         pounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON thought that it should remain seventy pounds. He was not here to antagonize

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph: The report did not state the names, but stated there were two

        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Why was the name of Mr. Dembufski put in?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD withdrew his motion to lay on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: We found no special irregularity in the pay of Mr. Dembufski, but in order
         to show that the committee had made a thorough examination it seemed right to state how and
         why the money had been paid. The committee did not think it was its function to name
         others.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER questioned whether this report was not a reflection upon every employe who was

         insert the names of the persons who have been drawing money from the State Treasury without

        <p>Mr. MAY: The report will show the overdrafts and the return of moneys.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: If the report shows that, why has it not been read?</p>

        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Certainly; but I think the report ought to be concurred in.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Will you have it read first?</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Yes sir.</p>
        <p>After the report was read - </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: I should like a personal explanation of this matter. I have
         been in the habit of signing all warrants. The law makes it my duty to approve all the
         Senate warrants, as you know. It is impossible for me, under the circumstances, to
         ascsertain the correctness of the warrants. I relied altogether upon the Assistant
         Secretary to keep the books, and I asked the Secretary to be exceedingly careful that there
         was not a single dollar paid to any employe in advance. He stated that he posted the books
         every night so there could not be a mistake. I regret very much that I have trusted to him
         in this matter. I feel that the law ought to be changed so that the presiding officer, if
         compelled to be responsible to any extent at all, should have tbe say who shall be the
         clerk to draw warrants. I say to Senators now, I would not bave signed a single warrant to
         pay any employe or any Senator in advance. I feel it is contrary to law. The law pays so
         much a day. If a Senator had leave of absence to go to his home for a week, and desired to
         draw his pay for that week I feel it my duty to sign the warrant. I feel that the Clerk has
         made a great mistake in this matter. I know he has been pressed on all sides with anxiety
         to draw pay. I urged him to see when a party called for a warrant that he had authority
         from the Secretary of the Senate or the bookkeeper to draw the warrant I am not in favor of
         paying everybody who wants to come up here and loaf around the hotels unless they perform
         service. I will say further I want the new Assistant Secretary to understand that I shall
         sign no warrants for the pay of any employe or Senator in advance unless they have leave of
         absence from the Senate for the time they propose to be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: By some mistake the Clerk has failed to put in the statement
         of overpaid employes, which unintentionally has been left out. I ask that it may be
         appended to the report.</p>
        <p>It was so ordered by consent.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, offered the following:</p>
        <floatingText>

          <div type="resolution">

        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The President of the Senate ought not to be required to do this. The law makes

         take any official action. Mr. Huffstetter is outside of the jurisdiction of the Senate. It

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: It seems to me this measure ought to be cut off at its earliest stage. I
         can't think the Legislature will release parties from default on official bonds. If this
         practice is established every man who is a defaulter will come here for relief, and we
         might as well pass a general law for relief. Sureties should understand that the signing of
         a bond means something. The report should not be concurred in.</p>
        <pb n="272" xml:id="VAA8558-22-272"/>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I am informed this bill applies to Marion County, where certain
         Township Trustees had township funds in the banks that failed in this city last fall. The
         rule of law is that Township Trustees are the absolute insurers at money in their hands
         belonging to the township. They are not sureties as bailees. With this extraordinary rule
         of law, it is nothing more than fair to pass this bill, if the people in those townships
         ask the Trustees shall be relieved because these Trustees used due diligence by placing the
         funds in what was supposed to be secure banks.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: The purpose of this bill is to afford relief to eight Trustees of this county
         because they lost funds belonging to the township, on deposit in the banks that have failed
         in this city in the past eighteen months. In every case the school fund has been paid in,
         and is intact. There are two thirds of the taxpayers in the several townships petitioning
         in favor of the passage of the bill. Perhaps in the cold letter of the law under decisions
         of the Supreme Court this is not a legal claim, but these men had no better place to put
         this money, for these banks had been considered solvent for thirty years, and, with but one
         exception, no interest has been received by any of these Trustees, and in that instance he
         deducted the interest he received from his pay as Trustee. Mr. Bailey submitted a detailed
         statement of the losses by these several Trustees. Tbey are among the best citizens in the
         county, and if their neighbors ask that the burden be placed upon them, it is but right the
         Legislature should allow that to be done. Before he had concluded - </p>

       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY resumed and concluded his itemized statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: If the Senator had not attempted to lasso a part of the Senate holding
         over, I probably should not have said anything. Where are the taxpayers who do not
         represent much wealth in these townships? In these hard times and low prices for produce
         and stock this bill asks the tax payers to make up for losses sustained by the failure of
         banks. I intend to vote against this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If this was a case in court I feel that I could successfully defeat gome
         of the allegations made in this case. I undertake to say these banks were interest-paying
         banks. I understand most of the money lost was lost in the Indiana Banking Company, and
         other banks would not hold the checks of that bank over night for months before its
         failure. It is said a large majority of taxpayers have signed these petitions. There are
         some eight or nine of these Trustees, and their bondsmen are a much larger number, and we
         know how petitions of this kind can be gotten up, especially where there are so many
         bondsmen. These petitioners ask us to compel those who are unwilling, to help to pay these
         losses - many of the them unable to pay. This would be one of the most dangerous precedents
         ever established, and the bill ought not to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: If I was to consult my own feelings, I would keep silent and vote for the
         bill. I have no right to regard what might be considered as popular in my locality. It was
         never intimated before the election that this measure of relief would be presented to this
         Assembly, and so the people did not express themselves upon that question. Although
         petitions were circulated previous to the election, two weeks before this session commenced
         was the first time I knew of them. These measures should be decided upon what is right and
         just. The law holds each one of these Trustees liable for every cent of this money. [Reads
         the note to section 5991 of the code.] The law says the Trustee is answerable for every
         dollar, and has undisputed right to do with the money as he pleases, answering only for the
         principal. If bills of this kind are passed, that will be no security for the public funds.
         The care of public moneys is one of the most sacred trusts of the Legislature. But I don't
         propose to rest this case upon a bare legal proposition only. Every one of these Trustees
         placed this money in the bank to obtain interest, and did receive interest with perhaps one
         or two exceptions. I took the trouble to go to the books of the three banks now in the
         hands of receivers, and I am speaking from the record with reference to these facts. Three
         had their accounts in Fletcher &amp; Sharpe's Bank. When men come with affidavits, such as
         those presented here, trifling with the law, they have no right to receive any
         consideration at the hands of the General Assembly. [Reads some of the affidavits and
         figures and dates from bank books to refute them.] A number who signed these petitions have
         come to me and said they were induced to sign them under misrepresentation. I make the
         assertion there is no precedent in the statute book for any such bill as this. It is not
         the amount of money to be taken from the taxpayers twice in itself, although a considerable
         sum - $20,000 - but behind that is the Treasurer of this city with some $40,000, the
         Treasurer of this county with some $20,000, and the Clerk of this court with some $15,000,
         and the Treasurer of Greene County some $8,000, all of whom could come in under a bill
         similar to this</p>
        <p>The establishment of such a precedent should be stopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: There is no analogy to the the county officers referred to, as none of them
         come here with two-thirds of the taxpayers willing to take this burden from their
         shoulders.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE made an ineffectual motino - yeas, 18; nays, 18 - to indefinitely postpone the
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKIS0N, explaining: I have invariably voted against indefinitely postponing every
         measure. I desire every bill be <pb n="273" xml:id="VAA8558-22-273"/> decided upon its
         merits. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ, when his name was called, said: I don't think it right to postpone this bill
         indefinitely. We have had worse bills than this. I think this bill ought to have a show. I
         think everybody ought to have a show in this Senate, therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER (explaining): I had not fully made up my mind as to how I should vote until
         after I heard this discussion. I have been asked about this measure, and I stated if these
         Trustees came here with a petition substantially representing the taxpayers of the several
         townships interested, I should vote to relieve them, but after listening to the argument of
         the two Senators from Marion, especially Judge Winter, I am very profoundly impressed that
         this bill ought not to pass, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAiLEY made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 11; nays, 25 - to concur in the report of
         the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, explaining: There mty be cases where it is right for the Legislature to
         relieve Township Trustees, but they ought to be extreme exceptions to the rule. I am
         unwilling to vote any more in favor of these private matters until there is a record made
         on the ground on which we vote the appropriation. There was connected with the matter of
         this kind two years ago a good many other matters, and now it is cited as a general
         precedent. I feel that I can not vote for a precedent like that. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. YOUOHE the bill was laid on the table by yeas 24, nays 10.</p>

       <p>The SPEAKER: A resolution was under discussion at the close of the session last night,
        calling up bills to-day, on a call of the counties, on tbe third reading. I suggest that
        some of you get together and prepare a resolution which shall make a call of counties from
        day to day as we have time, and that members be allowed to name one bill for consideration.
        By that means over 100 House and Senate bills can be considered.</p>

       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">THE MAY CLAIM.</head>
        <p>The bill [S. 178 - see page 144] allowing the widow of Edwin May $10,000 for architect
         services of the deceased on the new State House was read the first time.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I move that further consideration of this bill be indefinitely postponed. It
         is claimed among architects that their plans belong to them; but in this case May became
         pressed for means and secured money on the plans from the State House Commissioners, so he
         really had no further claim against them. Of course Mrs. May is in unfortunate
         circumstances, but so are thousands of women in Indianapolis. To pay her that claim wouid
         be to give away $10,000 of the people's money. There is not a single particle of evidence
         to justify the claim or a single dollar of it. The State House Commissioners - or one of
         them - told me that May received every dollar he was entitled, and they could pay him no
         more under their bonds.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I introduced a bill like this - written by Governor Hendricks by request -
         and I am willing to give it fair consideration. I have no special pride in it. One of the
         bills - the House or the Senate bill - should be investigated. I do not care to kill the
         measure at this time. I am not that discourteous to this House. An attempt was made by the
         last Legislature to pass this claim, but by a technical error it failed. The bill was
         written, by someone's mistake, "Be it resolved" instead of "Be it enacted." Something has
         been said here about the State House Commissioners, but there are further means of
         investigation.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRELL: Why is this claim for Mrs. May, instead of Edwin May's administrator?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: Because there was no estate to administer upon. Edwin May spent his all to
         prepare these plans. It cost him $17,000 to prepare them.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Will the gentleman tell this House why this claim is even-rounded $10 000 -
         no fractionS of dollars - no cents?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIIAMS: Of course. If the gentleman from Putnam had been consulted in this, he
         would have made it $999 99; but, as a fact, at Edwin May's death it was found that his
         services to the amount of $10,000 were unpaid.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Was not a new contract made by the State House Commissioners at May's
         death?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: No. The building went right along under May's plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Did not May receive his contract price - 2 per cent. of the money
         expended?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: In round numbers he received $27,000. That is on record here, but there is
         no profit on a building at its beginning for an architect.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Did not May take up parts of plans of other architects for the building?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: He did, but at the order of the State-house Commissioners Mrs. May has had
         trouble enough to get justice. Without undertaking to cut any one else off from debate, I
         move to lay the motion to indefinitely postpone on the table, and upon that I demand the
         ayes and nays.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: That is gag law and should not be tolerated. I hope the motion will be
         withdrawn.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: That may be, but it is parliamentary law. I am powerless.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I insist on my motion.</p>
        <pb n="274" xml:id="VAA8558-22-274"/>
        <p>It was agreed to by yeas 58, nays 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: Because a preceding Legislature thought it right, and because the best
         authority in Indianapolis say the claim is just, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: As I said days ago I believe this a clean cut steal. While I think as much
         of Thomas A. Hendricks as any man, I do not care for his recommendation on this. I think
         for myself. I hold here in my hand the original contract, signed by Governor Williams and
         Mr. May, which calls for 2 per cent. and $6 000. That shows the truth of it. I am here in
         the interest of the taxpayer of the State.</p>
        <p>I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: Because I believe in fair play and thorough investigation. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: This will be no hasty action. Our minds are made up, and I protest against this
         bringing in of the names of prominent men in this debate. I have taken the pains to send
         for the bill, and I say Mr. Hendricks did not write a syllable of it. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: I am told by the State House Commissioners that the claim is just, and I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: Without intimating how I shall vote on the final passage of this bill - in
         fact I do not now know - but in order to hear more of it, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I do not believe that Governor Hendricks or Governor Porter would care to
         have their names drawn in here as supporting this claim. It is not true. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON: As a <choice>
          <sic>membar</sic>
          <corr>member</corr>
         </choice> of the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, I can say that Governor Hendricks
         did meet with the committee and urge the payment of this claim in strong language, as did
         the members of the State House Commission. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I came here as a stranger, and sit in the hearing of this bill as an
         impartial juror. That it may be fully discussed, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: That it may be investigated, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: I investigated this two years ago, and believe it a just claim. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I believe this bill would have been allowed by the last Legislature but for
         one word. I know nothing of the claim, and can not now vote intelligently. I have no axe to
         grind, but wish to learn what may be the side of justice. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLIS0N: From all the light I can get upon this claim, I conclude two things: The
         claim is too large, but the lady is entitled to something. In order to put the bill in a
         position where it may be cut down and passed without equivocating, or where I may amend it,
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: As a member of the <orgName>Committee on Public Buildings</orgName>, I must say
         that the State House Commissioners favor allowing the claim, but they do say we do not owe
         the claim; that it was all paid according to contract. I vote "no" and shall vote so to the
         end.</p>
        <p>Mr LOYD: It has been said tbat Governor Hendricks and Governor Porter are in favor of
         this claim. So is Mrs. May. But it is our duty to stand here opposed to this claim until it
         is proven good to us. But I am not in favor of cutting off investigation, so I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK: As I do not favor shutting off investigation, and without indicating, how I
         shall vote at the last, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: For the reason that we heve no Court of Claims in this State; for the reason
         that the Senate, after thorough investigation, passed it, and for the reason that I hold in
         my hand the written and signed statement of the State House Commissioners that we owe this
         claim, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOSIER: For the reason that I have thoroughly investigated this and at one time voted
         for it; for the raeson that I have found no man with a good reason why it should not be
         paid, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLELLAND: For the reason that we may thorouhly investigate I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: For the reason that on a square and fair vote in the Senate this measure was
         voted down and then by some means worked through; for the reason that the House two years
         ago squarely voted against it, and then for some reason unknown to this body passed it; for
         the reason that the administrator of the late Edwin May did not bring suit for it, because
         the estate owed men for money for the comforts of life; for the reason that this claim has
         no bill of particulars; in view of all these facts I shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I must say - and I don't refer particularly to the gentleman from Sullivan
         (Mr. Patten) - that this thing of explaining votes is degenerating into speeches, and I
         shall hereafter call gentlemen thus digressing to order.</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: I am not prepared to say whether this is a just claim or not, but believing
         in treating bills against the State respectfully, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: For the reason that misstatements have been made here concerning this
         claim, and that further investigation may be had, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: Because the Senate has investigated and passed it, and that we may further
         investigate, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr TOWNSEND: For the reason that we may investigate, that we may vote for it if it is
         justly due, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion to lay on the table was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I move to recommit this bill to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and
          Means</orgName>, that they may examine the State House Commissioners under oath and obtain
         from them, if possible, an itemized statement of the debt owing to the late Edwin May <pb

        <p>Mr. Engle's bill [H. R. 170] relating to persons who, after committing crimes, are
         declared insane, that they must be sent to an asylum, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: The bill is fatal in this: If a man commits a crime and is not tried for
         some time, then when he may become sane he may be tried and found insane at the time tne
         crime was committed. Under this bill no further trial shall be had as to his sanity at the
         time the deed was done and the defendant, though he may now be sane, will be sent to an
         asylum.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: We want no Kentucky spectacles here - that of shooting down judges and their
         slayers at large as insane The laws protect men as to sanity. In any trial the man's sanity
         is on trial before the jary. This bill provides that to be sent to the asylum the man must
         be insane at trial time.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: This bill corrects an evil which has long troubled us. If a man is sent to the
         asylum after committing the crime he can not be liberated until a jury hears the testimony
         and passes upon his sanity, and the officers of the institution can not liberate him at
         will. He must be taken back to the county from which he was sent for trial.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 53, nays 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING explaining his vote said that he opposed it because it changed the law which
         declared a man innocent until proven guilty</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST in explanation of his vote said he favored it because it successfully met a
         defect in the present law.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, said that he believed it contained a defect as to
         a man's sanity at the time of the commission of the crime and at the time of the trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. HABAN voted "no" because of the defect as mentioned by the gentleman who preceded
         him.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON said that because if there was blowing hot and cold in these cases, it was a
         fault of the courts, and for its defects he voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK, when his name was called, said he opposed it because of its serious defects
         and voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK thought that the bill was safe in all respects, because no sane man would be
         held in the asylums, because it does not often occur that a man is insane when crime is
         committed and becomes sane afterward. He voted "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUCK: Because we will have the new insane asylums in spite of the objections of the
         gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding), I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

         from day to day until every member has designated a bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: The resolution is evidently unjust. Those who happen to come from a county
         beginning with the letter "A" have been first in everything, and now propose to stay first.
         Those who have been last all the time are nearly at the foot, and now propose by this means
         to go to the first again. I don't believe the members of the House will go into this
         arrangement.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: This is manifestly wrong. You begin with "A." and run down to "P," and then
         the majority having their bills in may change the resolution to begin at the head
         again.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The resolution says no bills shall be acted upon until all the counties are

           <p>Your attention is called to the subject of public printing, in page 66 of the report
            of the Auditor of State for 1884, in relation to the increasing cost of the State
            printing. You will find upon examination of the report that this branch of the public
            service has cost during the past four years the sum of $107,420.89. I can see no reason
            for printing every year the report of the State Geologist and the reports of the State
            Institutions for <pb n="276" xml:id="VAA8558-22-276"/>the year in which the Legislature
            does not meet. They might very properly and without any detriment be very considerably
            curtailed, and I would suggest the advisability of a law giving the Board of
            Commissioners of Public Printing and Binding some discretion in determining what part of
            the annual report should be printed in the interests of economy. I invite your careful
            consideration of this subject. Respectfully submitted.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE APPROPRIATION BILLS.</head>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved that the order of business be suspended in order that he might introduce
         a general appropriation bill. He said: A motion of this kind was introduced in the House
         and a motion also made that each member wonld have the right to call up one bill before the
         House would pass to the consideration of the general appropriation bill. The result will be
         that a general appropriation bill will be defeated. I believe that many Democrats as well
         as many Republicans are anxious that there shall be no special session, and in order that
         there may be no cause for an extra session, I ask that the order of business be
         suspended.</p>

        <pb n="278" xml:id="VAA8558-22-278"/>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Never in the history of Indiana has a general appropriation hill originated
         in the Senate. I think it would cause a disagreement and the defeat of the bill. It is
         true, as the Senator has said, that an order has been made enabling counties to call up
         special bills, bat I understand that the House to-morrow will rescind it and take up the
         general Appropriation bill and send it to the Senate. No one more earnestly desires the
         passage of this bill than myself, yet I think that this action proposed to be taken by the
         Senate would lead to such a difference as would absolutely prevent the passage of such a
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am opposed to the motion made by the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke). I
         am not willing to go beyond precedence in the past and permit the appropriation bill to
         originate in the Senate. I am opposed to an extra session, and stand ready to resign if it
         becomes necessary to have one I suggest that the Senator from Wayne abide his time, and an
         appropriation bill will be passed in goad time. If there is any responsibility it must
         necessarily rest with the Democratic majority, and I will stand by that majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: If the Democratic majority can stand the responsibility of not
         passing this bill I want to be counted out of this majority. I think the appropriations are
         addressed to the conscience of the members of the General Assembly and is not a party
         question. I believe we ought now to give the House an opportunity to see if they will not
         pass an appropriation bill. I am willing to trust them; but if at the last moment the time
         comes and no appropriation bill comes to us from the House, I stand ready to join the
         Republicans and pass a proper appropriation bill before the session expires, although if
         the appropriation bill fails and all other bills fail, there will be an extra session.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: That is the reason we ought to see to it that the appropriation bill will mot
         fail. I am very sure that so far as the Republicans in the Senate are concerned there will
         be a desire to acquiesce in almost any kind of a bill. I think the effect of the
         Introduction of this bill in the Senate will be to accelerate the passage of the bill in
         the House. It did not behoove the Democratic majority at the last session when it could
         have passed the appropriation bill in the for the Speaker to take the floor and maintain it
         at the last day when he thought the bill could be passed, and it ill becomes the Democratic
         majority now to come and charge upon the Republican members the defeat of the appropriation
         bill of two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It is well known that the Republican members here, in the face of the
         majority, were enabled to get the floor and hold it for hours after hours, and I stand
         here, sir, to charge that this body alone was responsible for the passage of the
         Appropriation bill two years ago, and that failure was on the part of the presiding
         officer.</p>

        <head rend="center">NARCOTICS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</head>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS moved that the report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 16] be concurred
         in.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I would like to say that very recently, within a week, acts of a similar
         character have been passed in Missouri and Alabama.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: To have the effect of alcoholic liquor taught children in our
         public schools is not the proper remedy for intemperance. I think that if the influence of
         home, if the influence of the church and the Sunday-schools are ineffectual in conquering
         this great evil, certainly there will be no such result in introducing it as a course of
         instruction in our public schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I made a minority report on this bill, and I am opposed to the bill as it
         now is. If my report could be adopted by the Senate, and then amended somewhat, I would be
         in favor of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I understand if this becomes a law it will be necessary for
         children to purchase new books. There are more children deprived from the benefits of a
         common school education on account of their being too poor to buy new books than from any
         other cause. Although I am opposed to the bill I desire to give every man a fair
         hearing.</p>
        <p>The motion to lay on the table was rejected by yeas 16, nays 24 </p>
        <p>Then came a recess for dinner.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I move the adoption of the majority report. The only remonstration that
         has come to the Senate against the passage of this bill has come from an Eastern
         school-book firm. Any person acquainted with this subject at all knows that this question
         is entirely ignored in the public schools of the State. Two-thirds of all the paupers and
         three-fourths of the criminals come from the class of parents addicted to the use of
         narcotics. It is the highest duty of the Legislature to lay the facts in regard to the on
         of narcotics before the children of the State. As a vital question to posterity, these
         principles ought to be taught in the public schools. It is not fanaticism to teach the evil
         effects of narcotics on the human system.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I am a fast and strong friend of the common schools, but I believe the
         passage of such a bill will obstruct and practically destroy the common schools of the
         State. I doubt if there are a dozen teachers who can pass the examination proposed in this
         bill. There are many physician practicing medicine who could not pass such an examination.
         Our school teachers are teaching these things as well as they know <pb n="279"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-279"/> how, and I believe they ought to be taught I will not vote for
         this proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It should not be the desire to bring the common schools into the dirty
         cesspool of politics, as this bill would do. I believe this bill is the outgrowth of
         persons disappointed in the success of prohibition. This bill should not become a law. This
         bill proposes additional labor for the the teachers, and we should hesitate about passing
         it for fear it will prove an injury to the common schools of Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: When it is said that even the school teachers and many
         doctors do not know enough about the evil effects of the narcotics referred to to pass the
         examination required in this bill. I regard that is a strong argument in favor of its
         passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I am not in harmony with the principles of this bill. I don't think it would
         correct the evils complained of. The most efficacious teaching is the frightful example of
         the effects of alcoholic stimulants frequently seen on the streets, but it does not
         restrain the use of intoxicating liquor. I have suspicions that there is a job behind this
         bill. The second section of the bill would turn out probably two-thirds of the teachers of
         the State I don't believe in making the common schools a medical institute. I don't believe
         this bill would be in the interest of the people or the interest of the children of the
         State.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Why is the history of the United States made a branch of instruction in the
         common schools, and not the history of England, France, etc.? It is because of the special
         need the boy should know of what most concerns him. And so the effects of alcoholic
         stimulants should be taught as specially affecting the people of the United States. I don't
         believe there is a school teacher in the State who can not before the taking effect of this
         act acquire a sufficient knowledge of physiology and hygiene to teach under the provisions
         of this bill. Then if there be a job behind this bill by book publishers there is open
         competition; the bill does not prescribe any one work. But if desired by the Senate, strike
         out that portion of the bill. There is nothing more required in this bill than is required
         in the teaching of any other branch in the common school. The adoption of the minority
         report would strike out the vitals of this bill without producing any good effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: Upon general principles I am opposed to the bill. Every doctor fit to
         practice medicine is conversant with the science of physiology. Is not the true principle
         of physiology taught now in the public schools? I am so informed. There is no objection to
         teaching the children the pathological effect of stimulants upon the system. A common
         drunkard will tell you it is detrimental to health and will bring one prematurely to the
         grave. The evil goes back to the depravity in the human heart. Alcoholic stimulants have
         played havoc with the greatest intellects in the past and will continue to do so in the
         future. It is not in consequence of the people being uneducated in the fact that it is an
         evil? Most certainly not. Yet there is a something that impels a part of mankind on in this
         way until they come to a premature grave. I believe more in the law that governs the moral
         feelings in appealing to mankind to correct these evils. Some believe the laws of man will
         prove more efficacious than the laws of God or the laws of our forefathers.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to indefinitely postpone the bill and demanded the previous

        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH called up the bill [S. 45] for three Appellate Courts, to consist of three
         judges each, to meet in the northern, central and southern districts, which was read the
         second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill is to create three new courts and 9 new judges. I believe that one
         Appellate Court sitting in Indianapolis can do all the work. If this bill was a bill to
         create three judges, it might be passable. I hope the bill will not pass for several
         reasons; we do not need it, and these different places are not where they should be
         placed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: There has been a demand for more rapid decisions than the quality of them. The
         question of cost ought not to enter into this discussion. The difference in is nothing if
         the people get speedy justice. The Supreme Court desires there shall be a court to relieve
         them of this kind of legislation and, as between a a Commission and a Court, they are in
         favor of a Court. Will we let that Commission, confessedly <choice>
          <sic>ineficient</sic>
          <corr>inefficient</corr>
         </choice>, stand, or will we establish a system of judicature that is desired by the
         people? It entails only an additional cost of $7,000 over our present system, an amount
         that ought not to be taken into consideration. It is the name system in vogue in Illinois
         and Ohio and other States, and is recognized as the best.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: From the very fact that there would be three different Courts there would
         be as many different decisions. I believe we have not much regard for the Commission, and
         we will not have any more respect for the Appellate Courts. The main purpose for the
         introduction of this bill was to give relief to the Supreme Court, but I don't believe that
         will be accomplished.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: In the first place I was in favor of one court of five Judges sitting at
         Indianapolis, but there is no doubt but that we need Appellate Courts now. The only
         additional expense would be $7,000 It seems to me by these laws we can have a good system
         of judicature in this State. In regard to the different decisions, it can be said that the
         various courts of the State now make different decisions. It is true of all Appellate

        <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved that the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for
         the consideration of the bill [H. R. 479], an act making appropriations for the State
         government.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, asked if this proceeding could go ahead in view of the fact not
         that the House had decided on a roll-call of the counties for bills on the third
         reading.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER pro tem.: I had a private conversation with the Speaker before he left and he
         was disposed to regard the call of counties for bills as unfinished business, and that it
         should go ahead unless otherwise ordered by the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS protested against ceasing the unfinished business The fear expressed in the
         House on Saturday that after this call by counties had been begun it would be changed, had
         been verified.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING thought that in view of the importance of the Appropriation bill it should be
         considered and the same taken up.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY believed that the agreement entered into on Saturday - the call of counties for
         bills - should be kept. There are important measures which come up under this call - the
         people demand legislation contained in bills to come.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING desired to make the point of order that as the House had decided to go on
         with the bills on the call it could not take up the Appropriation bill without
         reconsidering the vote on Saturday for the call.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER pro tern, overruled the point of order.</p>
        <p>The motion that the House resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole was rejected.</p>

        <p>Mr. AKIN'S bill [H. R. 352] authorizing Township Trustees to aid in the construction of
         bridges was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said that it was regarded as a safe bill; while it was general
         in its application, yet it was local to Parke County.</p>
        <p>The bill passed - yeas, 54; nays, 18.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">FEES AND SALARIES.</head>
        <p>Mr. CRECELIUS' bill [H. R. 283] relating to fees and salaries, allowing County Treasurers
         6 per cent. for collecting delinquent taxes, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr ENGLE opposed the bill because in would unnecessarily increase the fees of county
         officers.</p>
        <p>Mr MAUCK said it would greatly assist in collecting delinquent taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS was of the opinion that the delinquent taxes collected would far more than pay
         the extra fees. This is in the interest of the taxpayer; it compels men who never pay taxes
         to come forward with their share.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I am in favor of an economic administration of affairs, but I am of the opinion
         that County Treasurers get too little for his services. He is the most poorly paid of all
         county officers. I investigated before coming here, expecting that a fee and salary bill
         would come up. This measure would pay the Treasurer to make an extra effort to collect
         these delinquent taxes.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass - yeas, 43; nays, 33.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: Being a member of the committee which considered this bill, I want to explain
         my vote. The only bill on fees which will have a chance is this one. I am in favor of
         passing this bill increasing the fees, if the treasurers' fees could be reduced somewhere
         else. Therefore I must vote "no" at this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Believing that if this bill pass it will decrease rather than increase the
         tax of the general taxpayer; that it will be an incentive for the treasurer to collect
         taxes; that it will increase the fees in smaller places more than larger, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: Under this bill the income of some of the treasuries will be doubled, and for
         the reason that under it treasurers will not try to collect taxes until they are
         delinquent, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: For the reason that it will assist in tax collecting I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: Because I do not believe in bribing County Treasurers to do what their sworn
         duty is I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: Because I believe the bill will work public benefit to the general taxpayers
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Because it will oppress the unfortunate who can not pay taxes I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: Because it will bring in our taxes I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: Because it is just and will fill the Treasury I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I think that this will have a tendency to oppress the people because it will
         increase the burden of taxpayers. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KREUGER: Being desirous of giving my county a chance to get some of the money due it
         from men who can and will not pay taxes, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: As I understand this bill, it not so much to increase the salary of the
         treasurer as to benefit the county, inasmuch as the treasurer will get 6 per cent. while
         the county gets 94 per cent. of the money. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I think this bill is in the interest of honest people. Honest people pay
         their taxes. Unfortunate people must be compelled to pay their taxes, of course with a high
         penalty. That can't be helped. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: In voting for a bill like <pb n="282" xml:id="VAA8558-22-282"/> this, I do
         not particularly care whether it increases the pay of officials or not, but whether it is
         of good to the people. I believe that the bill will increase rather than decrease the
         taxes, as County Treasurers will permit taxes to become delinquent just to collect these
         fees. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the bill failed to pass.</p>
        <p>Then came a recess until 2 o'clock</p>

        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I desire, just at this point, if I have any rights and privileges as a
         member, to move that the bill [H. R. 94] regarding the colored race, which was the other
         day made a special order for 2.30 to-day, be now taken up. When, the other day, a call of
         the counties was made I called up this bill and would have made an argument on it that day,
         with the unanimous consent of the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: Because the House agreed to it is not and should not now be considered; but,
         Is it a special order?</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Is the gentleman willing that this House should so stultify itself as to
         not adhere to that premise?</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: The gentleman from Wayne can call the action of the House what he chooses.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Does not the gentleman understand that this bill is not engrossed, and that
         the House agreed to save time the other evening to allow me time at this hour?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I think this House owes it to Mr. Townsend to adhere to his word. This
         without saying how I shall do by the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: This is a special order and the gentleman should be heard.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I think the appropriation bill is more important than this measure, and that
         was voted down.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I think that the gentleman from Wayne should withdraw his measure in favor
         of Senate bill No. 43</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: This House agreed to let Mr. Townsend have this floor. As one who would
         support every man's right, I think we should let Mr. Townsend have his turn.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I move that Senate bill No. 43 instead of 99 be taken up.</p>
        <p>The motion was ruled out of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved that further consideration of this bill be postponed until next
         Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING offered an amendment to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I have introduced a bill here asking the repeal of the statutes of Indiana,
         known as the "black laws." The statute includes just what the amendment of the gentleman
         from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) includes and which is excluded in the bill I have offered. I am
         driven to make some remarks on the statutes of the State of Indiana as they stand. But as
         these statutes mostly stand on amalgamation, my remarks must be mostly on that subject.
         Limited time compels me to make but a summary of the case. These black laws should be
         repealed for these reasons:</p>
        <p>1. That simple and exact justice may be done to every race and color.</p>
        <p>2. Because they are repugnant to the principle underlying our constitutional
         government.</p>
        <p>3. Because, in my opinion, they can not be reconciled with the State Constitution.</p>
        <p>4. Because they as they stand are not in accord with personal liberty and personal
         contract; to choose in marriage as allowed to those not colored, though as a fact then are
         few of either color, who have taste, who are so inclined.</p>
        <p>5. And because of this forbidding of intermarriage, license, aye encouragement, is given
         to the white man who may be so vile to ruin the colored woman, while she has no recourse in
         her shame.</p>
        <p>6. And under this law unmarried colored women have no protection in the State against men
         responsible for bastardy.</p>
        <p>7. Because children born of white and colored parents out of wedlock can not be
         legalized.</p>
        <p>8 For the reason that this law allows that inequality which says that the colored shall
         suffer all the penalty of such wrong, while the white shall go free.</p>
        <p>9 Because I believe that the prejudice, education and castes of each race will allow it
         to choose for itself without these laws. Society is self-distributing; society will take
         care of itself.</p>
        <p>And for more than all, for the reason that a white man, so low, so degraded and interior
         enough to dishonor and degrade a colored woman, should be made by the laws honorable enough
         to marry the woman he has thus degraded. I have now given you briefly the reason I think
         our lowest laws should be repealed. I now propone to make some general remarks. Look into
         the history of the past - come from the past 260 fears ago down - a prejudice of the
         American people has been bearing up the colored races, all continually inflicted upon them.
         Here I have to deal with a most delicate question, more delicate than any gentleman upon
         this floor has had to deal with. This bill purposes to wipe from Indiana's laws, to say the
         least, the relic of the most barbarous age. This State stands alone in this injustice, and
         this is the very last chapter of the black laws which have disgraced Indiana. These are the
         laws preventing blacks from marrying whites and from their belonging to the militia of the
         State. The colored men wen prevented from belonging to the militia, <pb n="283"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-283"/>but were good enough to fight, to vote, to held office, to sit on
         the jury and to be witnesses in court. Good enough to fight when the draft was suspended to
         save the white faces of Northern men. One hundred thousand of God's sons, carved in ebony,
         engaged in 250 battles of the South. Under the laws of our State they can not belong to the
         militia. How patriotic! But the negro in good enough to die for his country. This entire
         system is the language from the slave holder of the North and put upon their white slaves
         of the North, the so-called white freeman. In Indiana the colored man was never entirely
         free. Never, nor now. Thirty-three years ago the question to allow the colored man freedom
         in Indiana was submitted to the vote of this State. Of these voters 21,066 voted for
         liberty and 109 976 said no - five to one that the negro should not live in your State.
         Then the sun in its course looked down on an action as inhuman as ever characterized the
         cotton fields of Georgia or the rice swamps of the Carolinas. Even in this very city at
         that day, when the death knell of slavery was sounded by the first shot on Fort Sumter, a
         bishop of the M. E. Church declared that the church property should not be used by a negro,
         a mulatto or a harlot. Comparing a negro to the most degraded of all - a harlot. Even in
         1880 your people refused to correct this evil in the Constitution. You now have it in your
         hands.</p>
        <p>On February 24, 1866, a gentleman well known upon this floor, and in the State and
         Nation, said that he did not believe the colored man equal to the whites, and that he did
         not care to see them placed on the platform on a level with the whites. The people who
         refused this freedom sent him there. It is not because I encourage intermarrying that I
         introduced this bill. The negro on that question has prejudice just the same as the white
         man. I must not be misquoted. I represent in this hall one of the most enlightened and
         cultured counties in the State. I am the peer of any man here as regards rights and duties.
         And in my official duties I have been treated with that courtesy and respect due any man by
         the members and the Speaker. I ask no man to accord me more. I am colored, it is true, but
         I am a man. I ask no favor nor shall I shrink from any responsibility. I am in favor of
         absolute freedom. I am a humanitarian and, thank God, a Christian. I am not wrong. Very
         often on the car seat I am shown the favor of a whole seat to myself. Very frequently at a
         hotel table I have the whole table to myself. The best class of colored, like that of
         white, do not desire a different color. But law should not regulate affection. When I was
         asked if I married a white woman I said, "No; I married a lady." In slave times whites were
         bought and sold as slaves. So they were regarded and so they existed. The laws of the State
         draws the line at one-eighth negro blood, but as no herd book has been kept to preserve
         pedigrees, it can not be determined when one is past that point. I want to say that with
         this law a man is granted the infamous license to betray colored women, and this had led
         some to believe that there is no such thing as virtue among colored women. In the South the
         mulatto grew from white fathers, but you scarcely heard of one born of a white mother. Let
         as have rights for the colored man - civil, political, business, church, State, everything.
         I plead no special legislation - no favor of grace. I am no sycophant. I want right. You
         can not legislate a man to my fireside, but there is no law but that of brute force to
         protect my family against the white. As Judge Taylor said on this floor the other day that
         laws are not for the rich nor the majority, but for the minority and the poor. True. Mr.
         Browning said as much. We have long appealed for perfect freedom. We have asked the pulpit
         for 260 years. We now appeal to this General Assembly. If refused, we can ask as we have
         asked since 1620, and look to heaven for aid. This much we must say, and that is that we
         put more faith in God than we do in political parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Regarding the militia, the Constitution forbids that; the Legislature
         abolished <choice>
          <corr>discrimination</corr>
          <sic>descrimination</sic>
         </choice> in public schools; and as to marriage, there is no discrimination, as a white man
         is as much forbidden to marry a colored woman as a colored man to marry a white woman. As
         to any other things, the laws allow civil rights. If society is not as good as law that is
         the fault of society, not law. But the gentleman should not make an attack on Mr.
         Hendricks. That was a great mistake. The remark that the colored man was good enough to
         fight for his country was in bad taste. Why, the white sons of Indiana were there then
         fighting solely for the freedom of the colored man. His feelings are largely imaginary. The
         gentleman has spoken only for Republican colored men; the Democratic colored men will
         repudiate him.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: If you will treat this man's bill like you did all the rest -
         order it engrossed and pass it to the third reading - well and good. We will take a hand if
         spades are to be made now. I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>The amendment [Mr. Gooding's] was rejected by yeas 35, nays 41.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING, explaining his vote, said that he should oppose it because he believed it
         unconstitutional; because a Senate bill was much better, and because he would rather his
         right hand should drop off than to favor the intermarriage of blacks and whites. Because he
         opposed it all, bill and amendment, he voted "no."</p>
        <pb n="284" xml:id="VAA8558-22-284"/>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN, as be believed the amendment did not reach the case, voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: Because I believe in complete liberty to every rock, everything upon the earth,
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN voted "no" because he believed the amendment was not effectual.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: Because he favored equality of all men of one blood, he voted "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST made an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to - yeas, 43; nays, 40.</p>

        <head rend="center">CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE.</head>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, called up bis bill [S. 341] relating to claims against the
         State.</p>
        <p>An amendment by Mr. Willard to strike out in Section 1 the words "on any account
         whatever" was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR, the bill was further amended so as to quiet the title to real
         estate sold by the State and fully paid for.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The necessity of this measure is apparent. It is perfectly evident that it is
         necessary to have some proper court or tribunal which can proceed according to legal forms
         to ascertain the legality of claims against the State of Indiana. What would be the
         objection to allowing persons having claims against the State to file their claims in the
         Supreme Court and have the Attorney General represent the State. I move that all claimants
         be allowed to file their claims in the Supreme Court, and that the Attorney General
         represent the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Handricks; It is a great deal less expensive for a court to sit and hear
         witnesses on one of these claims than for 150 men to sit and hear the witnesses. Our
         experience has demonstrated that we are compelled to sit in judgment on claims involving
         many thousand dollars, of which we know almost nothing. It occurs to me that it would not
         only be a hardship to many claimants to have to file their claims in the Supreme Court, but
         it would be a burden to the Supreme Court to put that kind of business in their hands. I am
         quite sure that claims are allowed here that would not be allowed by a court. If this bill
         becomes a law, and a person presents a claim against the State of Indiana here we can refer
         it to a tribunal where it can have just and equitable action. When the Court of Claims was
         enacted by Congress it was an experiment, and from time to time the law governing that
         court has been amended until it is satisfactory. This law will only be in operation two
         years, and if experience shows that it is imperfect, it can be amended at the end of that
         time. It has been said that we may have Prosecuting Attorneys not honest enough to
         represent the people. I consider it an unjust reflection upon the officers of the State to
         say they would not properly look after the interests of the people. It is my opinion that
         if this bill becomes a law the amount paid out by the State for claims will not be more
         than one-half what it now is. The Court of Claims had from 1855 to 1880 considered and
         adjudicated claims amounting to $80,000,000, and the judgments rendered were a traction
         less than $20,000,000, whereas if the claims had gone before Congress the probabilities
         were that nearly the whole amount might have been allowed by Congress.</p>
        <p>Several States of the Union have enacted laws permitting suits to be brought against the
         States, and experience has shown the <pb n="286" xml:id="VAA8558-22-286"/> wisdom of such
         laws. Only in one State, so far as I know, has there been a proposition or suggestion to
         repeal the law, and that was in Tennessee, where the war debts had become so great it was
         impossible ever to pay them, and the law was repealed in that State, which was avowed
         repudiation.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill provides that after the claim has been adjudicated the Auditor of
         State shall issue his warrant for the sum. Wat costs there are ought to be paid by the
         State. I have no doubt if this becomes a law it will save thousands of dollars to the State
         of Indiana. I think it is right that the State of Indiana shall establish a Court of
         Claims.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I am in favor of this bill, provided the amendment proposed by the Senator
         from Wayne is adopted. It is a recognized fact that the claimant brings his witnesses in
         the court and it always decides in favor of the claimant against the whole State. The
         proposition to permit the Circuit Courts of the different counties to adjudicate upon these
         matters I am opposed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to the bill as it now is, and I will vote against it. I do
         not believe it would be just to let courts and Prosecuting Attorneys stand between the
         parties and the claims. If you open fifty courts to turn loose thousands of claims upon the
         State, there will be claimants here and there who will undertake to get the State in debt
         to them for large amounts and take the risk of going into court and getting the claim.
         There will be no misunderstanding in regard to claims if the man who does work for the
         State understands that he must work under a written contract. The trouble about the matter
         is that men who have no contract are continually attempting to go to the Legislature and,
         without a fair showing, lobby their measures through.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: Rather than have the bill fail, if the Senators who favor the
         measure will accept the amendment of the Senator from Wavne, I will accept it.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion to strike oat Section 3 of the bill, saying: This
         is an attempt to destroy altogether the legislative power by making a continual
         appropriation bill without intervention of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr, Willard then moved to strike out of Section 3 the words "of any Circuit Judge."</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 30; nays, 13 - that the constitutional
         rules be suspended, that the bill be read the second time by its title, be considered
         engrossed, read the third time and put upon its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, explaining his vote, said: A bill of this kind will be very far-reaching
         in its consequences. It would open the way to throw into the Supreme Court hundreds of
         cases. Therefore I am opposed to suspending the constitutional rules to put the bill
         through to-day.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I believe it is absolutely necessary that these claims should be
         removed from the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER, when his name was called, said: I was one of the members of the
          <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> that reported favorably on the bill. I would very
         cheerfully support the bill in its original shape with the amendment offered by the Senator
         from Wayne (Mr Foulke). I think the amendment of the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) should
         not be adopted.</p>

        <head rend="center">CONVICT LABOR.</head>
        <p>On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, the constitutional rules were suspended, and the
         Senate took up consideration of the joint resolution [S. 8] proposing an amendment to the
         Constitution to regulate the hiring of convict labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON: This is a very important measure, and one which Governor Porter recommended
         should be put immediately into operation. Two years ago I had the honor to introduce, on
         the floor of this Senate, resolutions and afterwards a bill looking towards that same
         thing, and while a majority of the Senators then here were in favor of the measure, it
         failed, on account of want of a proper remedy. It was only because we could not find the
         proper remedy that the measure failed. Anybody with an unbiased mind will say that the
         system ought to be abolished. Measures have been introduced in every Legislature in the
         country. The man that employs the convict labor at a merely nominal price, has an advantage
         over the free labor. The man who employs free labor must employ it at a loss. A great wrong
         is done to the moral nature of the convict. It would be marvelous if the convicts under the
         present system could reform. We turn them out ill-fitted for the labor of life. The
         convicts might be employed in making all articles necessary in their own and similar
         institutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The Democratic party in the last campaign stood firm upon this legislation.
         The Democratic platform asserts that it is in favor of using the convict labor so as not to
         compete with free labor. For four years we have attempted to repeal this evil. When
         Legislative Assemblies have found it impossible to pass this measure, it is time it should
         be looked to. The convict system is an outrage. The contractors all over this country have
         grown rich under the operation of this iniquitous system. The profits of the labor goes not
         to the State, but to individuals. We have had enough of half-way measures in this matter;
         for the past six years we have made various attempts. The convict is not taught a trade.
         This constitutional amendment will tend to the reformation of the convict.</p>
        <p>The joint resolution was ordered engrossed by yeas 21, nays 18.</p>
        <pb n="287" xml:id="VAA8558-22-287"/>
        <p>Mr. BAILY, in explaining his vote, said: I am very much in favor of this resolution. The
         present system of convict labor in not only injurious to the convicts themselves, but to
         free labor. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR made an explanation of his vote which he desired should go upon the records of
         the Senate, as follows: Mr. President, I vote no on the adoption of this joint resolution
         amending the Constitution, for the reason that the Constitution in force gires the
         Legislature all necessary power to regulate the matter, and this proposed Amendment is
         wholly unnecessary. The present Legislature can regulate the question of convict labor as
         well as to wait four years for the adoption of this amendment to the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE suggested, as this explanation is not in the nature of a message or other paper
         which properly go on the journal of the House, it ought to go into the Brevier Reports,
         where the remarks of the rest of us go.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Certainly.</p>
        <p>It was so ordered by consent.</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the joint resolution was ordered endowed for the third reading.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <head rend="center">CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the Congressional
         Apportionment bill [H. R. 424] which was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: It is with a feeling of regret, almost amounting to sadness,
         that I rise here to mke some remarks on this proposition to redistrict the State of Indiana
         in the manner in which it has passed the House of Representatives, or by the amendment to
         that bill. This proposition, I understand, has not only received the approbation of the
         joint Democratic caucus, but also the indorsement of the Democratic majority of the House
         of Representatives, and yet, Mr. President, in spite of these considerations, which in the
         eyes of many Democrats may be of paramount importance, I can not, persuade myself to
         support it and vote for it. My opposition to this apportionment bill, as it comes from the
         House, and also as it is amended, is caused by the conviction that it conflicts with my
         ideas of and my respect for right, justice and fairness, and that by voting for it I would
         sanction and help to commit a wrong which finds no excuse or apology in the dictates of
         party.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: If any political measure ever offered for endorsement call
         for all the attributes of greed that humanity can summon to stifle its natural tendency to
         decency and equity, these Congressional and Legislative bills are such measures. Party
         caucus and organization is right for the purpose of forwarding measures in the interest of
         the people, but when against the people and against right, and against the spirit and
         letter of the Constitution, it is then time to step out from caucus and walk alone, while
         yet a man can <choice>
          <corr>respect</corr>
          <sic>rospect</sic>
         </choice> the company he is in when he walks alone. These apportionment bills are made
         without regard to ratio of voting numbers in direct conflict to the mandate of the
         Constitution. Can Democrats upon this floor forget tbe oath of fidelity to the Constitution
         and give the stamp of official approval to these products of irresponsible politicians. The
         purposes of these measures are to disfranchise a large number of the voters ot this State,
         to deny a large number any representation at the National Capital, to take charge of every
         institution of the State end throttle advice or criticism, to lock the doors of the
         uncounted treasury and manacle every hand that would open to investigate. These measures
         have not even a pretense of being dictated by any standard higher than that which has
         controlled monarchs and Arabs and pirates and Indians and bogs at the swill-trough. "Might
         makes right." Politically these measures are as corrupt as infamy, unfair as dishonesty,
         vicious as robbery, tyranical as oppression, unchaste as rape. No argument or explanation
         or excuse is made except the one given by the child, the street gamin and the saloon thug,
         the taunts "you did it first," "you are another," the logic of which is that to copy and
         repeat the meanest things Republicans ever did is the highest virtue to which the
         Democratic party desire or expect to attain, and a proof that the Democratic cry of fraud
         and corruption and theft has not been a call to protection, but the rallying call for
         pillage and plunder.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I will commence by saying that I am for this bill, and in presenting this
         apportionment for Congressional purposes to the people of the State of Indiana, I want to
         claim that there has been no such Congressional map given to the people in its contiguity
         of territory. It presents as just and as fair an apportionment as ever has been made of tbe
         State of Indiana. It is true we have nine of the thirteen Congressmen, but it is also true
         that in 1873 the Republicans made an apportionment that gave them eleven out of the
         thirteen Congressmen. I will say to the Democratic side of this House that we can stand
         before any audience in the State and hold that map up with pride. [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: If my party were in the majority and would present a bill which to my mind is
         as unfair as this bill, I should not vote for it. I should take the position of the Senator
         from Tippecanoe (Mr. Johnson) and say that I repudiated any action of that kind. Under this
         bill it would take 24,514 Democratic votes to elect one Congressman, while it would tafce
         79,248 Republican votes to elect one Congressman. In other words, one Democrat has as much
         Congressional representation as three and <pb n="288" xml:id="VAA8558-22-288"/> one-half
         Republicans. Will anybody say that is fair? [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: Never in the history of Indiana was there an apportionment like that of 1872.
         The Republicans passed that law under the operations of the previous question without
         allowing discussion, and without even allowing the bill to be printed.</p>
        <p>The result of that bill was to give the Republicans eight members of Congress and the
         Democratic party only five. This kind of talk about unfairness is something always heard
         whenever an apportionment bill comes up. This bill has been drafted upon the plane of
         making it equal as between the parties and the doubt was decided in favor of the party in
         power on this floor. Could we do less? This bill has been drawn in fairness. Were it not
         done in fairness I certainly would not give it my support. [See appendix]</p>

        <head rend="center">LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. Hilligasa the special order being the Legislative apportionment bill [H.
         R. 423] was taken up with the engrossed amendments made last night.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: I feel that it is the privilege and a duty that devolves upon every
         Republican Senator upon this floor to as least express his disapprobation of this bill I
         admit the fact at the outset that we of the minority expect no good results from any
         argument we may make. Though we may show this bill ever so unfair, ever so infamous, or
         ever so unjust, it can in no sense affect the result. Therefore in speaking of the
         provisions of this bill I shall endeavor to point out those instances in which I feel the
         minority has been trampled upon. [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I shall not call attention in detail to the enormities of this bill. That has
         been well done by the Senator from Fayette (Mr Huston). I wish to call attention to one
         feature, utterly indefensible. No party has a right to deliberately violate the
         Constitution which each of us have taken an oath to support. The Constitution requires that
         each county shall be given the full representation which its population entitles it to. I
         propose to show that this bill deprives at least one county (Marion) of its constitutional
         rights. [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This bill has grown out of that fair dealing we always try to show to our
         Republican friends. The Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) and the Senator from Marion (Mr.
         Winter) have both insisted that under the provisions of this bill the people would not
         enjoy their constitutional rights. This same State Constitution was in force in 1867 and
         1872, and at that time the same argument made by Republican Senators now was made by
         Democratic Senators then in opposition to that gerrymander. The Democratic party has the
         strength of a giant, but it has not exercised it in the spirit of tyranny. The
         representation that bill gives to the Democratic party at the next General Assembly is not
         eqnal to the representation the Democratic party has to day in this General Assembly. We
         have a Democratic majority on joint ballot of forty-six, while under the provisions of this
         bill we would have but thirty-two. There is a concession to you of fourteen members of the
         General Assembly. [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: Some Republicans have said they believe the Democrats would lose the
         election if this bill were passed. I don't look at it that way. I believe their intention
         has been to so disfranchise the Republicans of this State and put their feet upon our
         throats that they will throttle the life out of us for the next twenty-five years. They are
         afraid to meet the Republicans of the State with the same kind of arms and munitions they
         ask us to meet them. [See appendix]</p>
        <p>Mr. Overstreet, Mr. Foulke and Mr. McClure continued the discussion. [See appendix.]</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operations the bill passed by yeas
         30, nays 17</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER explaining his affirmative vote: I think this bill a very fair one -
         especially the Democratic side of it. [Laughter.] If we had any more Daniel W. Voorhees I
         would not be particular about having quite as large an advantage; but as we have not only
         him, but have more fully as good and better than the Republicans who want to go into the
         Senate and as this is the last day of Republican rule in the United States When the sun
         sets to day it goes down on Republican rule, and in the morning it rises on the great star
         of reform. In Washington the doxology is to be sung, and the great Mexican Band is to be
         there to blow the rogue's march. [Laughter.] I vote "aye."</p>

        <head rend="center">NIGHT SESSION.</head>
        <p>The Senate took up the bill [H. R. 204] appropriating $30,000 to Indiana University.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: Thirty thousand dollars is not enough. In 1883 a destructive fire
         destroyed the museum and the library amounting to $118 000. To cover this loss the county
         of Monroe gave $50,000, and the insurance was $27,000, amounting to $77,000. There were 143
         students in that institution, and thirty-six belong to Monroe County. More than half of
         these thirty six are children of parents who have moved to Monroe County for educational
         purposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I can not see the necessity of appropriating $30,000. They want more for the
         library than it originally cost. When they could have gotten ground free, they paid $300 an
         acre for it and moved the university a mile off. They want $5,000 for chemical apparatus,
         when they have already expended $5,000 for that purpose. There was no itemized report of
         the expenses <pb n="289" xml:id="VAA8558-22-289"/> brought before the committee, although
         often demanded. The Trustees did not show that they needed more than $25,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Will you get value received for the appropriation? The truth is, that
         institution is not worth that much to Indiana. There are other institutions in the State
         which have just as good instructors. The sooner you get rid of that institution the better.
         It is strange that these other institutions are able to pay their teachers and their
         expenses, while this State institution is a drag on the State. I move that the minority
         report be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I was at the Bloomington Institution three years, and I know the workings of
         the institution. I know the paltry salaries paid at Bloomington. We owe it to the people of
         Indiana that we give a suitable appropriation to this deserving institution. This
         institution has produced many of the brightest minds in the State. The institution is
         there, and ought to be supported liberally by this State. I would like to vote for $50,000
         or $75,000 for this institution rather than but the small sum demanded. I hope to see the
         day when the Normal Schools and Purdue University and the Bloomington College will redound
         to the glory of this State. If the power of this institution has been crippled by anything
         it has been crippled by the parsimony of each succeeding Assembly. I hope there will not be
         a dissenting vote against the appropriation to this noble institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I know the Trustees, and I feel certain that they would not have purchased
         those lands for $300 per acre for any other than good reasons. I think the Trustees made a
         wise and prudent purchase. The old grounds were utterly unfit for the University. I know of
         no more eminent men that have graduated at any other institution than Bloomington. I
         believe that the institution ought to have more than $30 000. Bloomington is not a
         sectarian institution. I have been careful about voting money. I have always, however,
         voted money to educational purposes. I was uninformed when I voted on the Purdue University
         bill, and I was not enlightened until Dr. Smart, President of the institution, handed me
         the act of Congress, with the act of the Legislature of 1865 accepting the Constitutional
         gift. By the act of Congress it is made the duty of the State to support this institution,
         and on failure so to do, the State is held liable to return to the General Government the
         gift. When I voted against the appropriation the other day I did it under a misapprehension
         that there was no obligation resting on the State to support this institution, and I take
         this the first opportunity of correcting my error. I am in favor of liberally supporting
         all the State educational institutions of the State. The State University deserves to be
         liberally supported. I hope this bill will pass and the appropriation made. It is a worthy
         object, and we can not afford to smother it to death. If you are not in favor of making
         this appropriation, you ought to close the doors of the institution and drive the students
         from her halls. I trust this will never be done. Let it never be said that we are opposed
         to supporting our educational institutions. Let that time never come; but with a liberal
         hand and generous support uphold them by all reasonable appropriations. I trust the bill
         will pass.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. HAWORTH this motion was laid on the table by yeas 53, nays 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING explaining his vote said <pb n="290" xml:id="VAA8558-22-290"/> that he
         thought that this House had badgered long enough. A square and fair agreement was entered
         into to read bills the third time. If we are men let us stand by that agreement like men.
         It has been said in one of our principal newspapers that we are holding for this agreement
         in order to make a special session. I want to hurl that back into the teeth of the man who
         wrote it as an infamous lie. Still, if necessary for my constituents, I shall vote for a
         special session.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: Because it will take but little time to pass this important bill I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: I have as much sympathy for the orphans at Knightstown as any man upon this
         floor. I believe my feelings were as much moved by the recital of their wrongs as any man
         upon this floor. But, sir, I am opposed to any man coming upon this floor and stealing the
         robes of Heaven to serve the devil in. My Corporation bill is the next bill in the regular
         call. That bill has been stolen, and I was put to the trouble of getting it reinstated, and
         now this motion is made to defeat its passage at the behest of interested corporations.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: Because such votes as this are but to consume time, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion to lay on the table was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, opposed the bill because the increase of the ratio of pupils
         demanded the use of a greater amount of money. This bill has been called the "poor man's
         fund," yet it is better to give it to the children than to loan it to the poor fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: I can't see how the children will suffer by this. Seven per cent is enough to
         pay for money at any time. This money is loaned to the people in small amounts. All the
         expenses of getting it makes the money cost 8 per cent. That, in God's name, is enough to
         pay for money. By this means all this money can be kept in use. Then the money will not be
         locked up.</p>
        <p>Mr. DONHOST: My first intention to introduce this bill for 6 per cent, but finding that
         some counties were leading at 8 per cent., I changed it to 7 per cent., as the of it will
         be at the end 8 per cent.</p>

        <p>Mr. REEVES' bill [H. R. 8] providing for the speedy publication of decisions of the
         Supreme Court, was read a third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEBS moved that the bill be recommitted to the Judiciary with instructions.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 28; nays, 52 - to lay this motion on the
         table.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON said that a reform was needed in this office. It was time to advance it.</p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected.</p>
        <p>The question recurring upon the passage of the bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Some of the gentlemen here are afraid to vote for the bill because it will
         affect the salary of the present incumbent of the office of Reporter of the Supreme Court.
         Some one must be affected at some time. It is a burning shame Democrats can not be true to
         their oaths above party. This bill puts the publication of the Supreme Court Reports in the
         hands of the Reporter. He is to publish them and charge net more than $3.50 per copy. There
         are ninety two counties in the State, and suppose two copies were to go to each county -
         that would be 184, and then ten to the colleges of the State, and now the rest so into the
         archives of the Supreme Court - to be given away to the pets of the Reporter of the Supreme
         Court. This is done to distribute in order to influence legislation in behalf of the office
         of Reporter. In the last ten years the Reporter has got five volumes per year. That makes a
         total expense to the State per year of $8 750. This law seeks to repeal this outrage.
         Besides this, the Reporter has been allowed to sell his books to the lawyers at $3 50 per
         copy, and they cost him but ninety-five cents each. And the right to copyright is also
         given to the Reporter, and one publishing firm has recently offered a Reporter $20,000 for
         his copyright. That is the kind of a law you are asked to keep on the statute books of
         Indiana. This bill of mine proposes that the publication of these reports shall be let to
         the lowest bidder, and the Reporter shall be allowed a salary of $3,000 per year. Some say
         that the salary is too small. Don't fear but that you will find a man to fill it. I will
         give a bond of $10,000 myself to fill the office We have heard a great deal of prating
         about reform. Let's see if they are sincere about it. This matter is worth considering -
         far more than the rights or large salary of one man.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: If I ever own a Supreme <pb n="291" xml:id="VAA8558-22-291"/> Court Report I
         have it yet to buy. So I shall have no selfish motive. I do not want to correct one evil by
         inflicting another. This bill leaves out of the question the fact that the office of
         Reporter demands three assistants, and to reduce, as this bill does, will be but to
         legislate the office out of existence. We can not afford to do that. That is the reason I
         shall be compelled to vote against it. The bill to establish the Appellate Court will, if
         passed, take a good deal of work from the Supreme Court, and thus lessen the income of the
         Reporter.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: It has been said here that the Reporter must have three assistants. Now under
         this everything going to the Reporter goes to him written out. All he has to do is to write
         out a small syllabus.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas 40, nays 47.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING, explaining his vote, said: Believing that the bill is unfair in all its
         provisions I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Believing that this bill would be quite as unjust to the Reporter as the
         present law is said to be to the people, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: Because the bill does not give a sufficient allowance I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: Because the new bill does not give a sufficient allowance I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. JEWETT: Two years ago I voted for a reasonable reduction in the salary of this
         office, the reduction to take effect, however, at the expiration of a term of office, so
         that the man to be elected would know what the fees would be. As I am opposed to changing
         an official's salary during his term of office, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLIS0N: Because I want a reform in this office and in hope that the Senate will
         amend this in some particulars, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: For the reason that as the law now stands those who receive the books pay
         for them, and for the reason that the bill will call for $3,000 of the people's money, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: While the bill is not without objection, yet the bar at my home and my
         constituents demand a reform, and hoping it will be considered in the Senate, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: As a reform is needed, and as I hope the bill will be amended in the Senate,
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>The SPEAKER: There are two special orders now pending, the General Appropriation bill and
         the bill creating an Appellate Court. I have been informed that the House refused on Monday
         morning to take up this appropriation bill, which was set for that morning. Of course that
         is past and can not be helped. But it should come up.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: This very important bill should now come up, and if the smaller bills are not
         reached let them go.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The special order must be disposed of, but in two ways - either to go into
         the Committee of the Whole or postpone it. It was not postponed on Monday; it must come up
         now.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I move that the House do now resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole
         for the consideration of the Appropriation bill.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: A test vote on it would better be to postpone it. The gentleman from
         Dearborn (Mr. McMullen) can withdraw his motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: I have too high an opinion of the members of the House to believe that the
         House will go back on its agreement to first dispose of bills on the third reading. If this
         appropriation has to go over let it go. Why was not this Appropriation bill brought up
         sooner? One of the first things always done here is to provide for the State institutions,
         and then some are ready to go home. If a special session is necessary let it come. I had to
         vote to day against the Knightstown Institute bill coming up when I favored it, because I
         wanted to stand by my agreement - that of bills on the third reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: My understanding when I voted for these bills to be read in order the third
         time was that we should dispose of the special orders when they came up in order.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: It takes no motion to bring this before the House. It is before the House It
         takes a motion only to go into a Committee of the Whole.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I understand that the majority on Saturday postponed this appropriation
         bill, which was on the Friday night before made a special order. If, as said by some, this
         appropriation bill can not see daylight, then I say let it stay in the dark. If the time
         has come when I can not trust the word of my fellow-members - that we go on with reading
         bills the third time - then I want to resign and go home.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I am distinctly opposed to this bill. If this appropriation bill is not
         reached let it go. If Governor Gray has not lost his Republican courage and his Republican
         cunning he will run the State as well as ever. I am unable to understand the sudden turning
         of the gentleman from Dearborn, (Mr. McMullen) who formally fought off this bill. I believe
         the Speaker is wrong in saying that a special order for Monday morning is a special order
         for Tuesday afternoon. The House agreed to go on with the bills on third reading. It was
         agreed that every county should be called and bills refuted. The term is expiring, the
         Governor is refusing to call an extra session, and the Democrats see confusion before them.
         We are at the Oats bill in the callender - away up in the "D's" - the gentleman from
         DeKalb's bill - and yet some of the bills above <pb n="292" xml:id="VAA8558-22-292"/> that
         are to be taken up yet. I move as a substitute, that bills on the third reading be
         continued.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I would suggest that the motion be to postpone, and then it would require
         but a majority instead of a two-thirds vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I believe that this special order was set in good faith. I believe that it
         is buncombe for any party to saddle an extra session upon the other party. For one, I am
         ready to go home before my people on a special session. These are the piping times of
         peace, and the crack of the party whip has no terror. I believe that the period of
         sixty-one days is too short a period. It was put upon away back on the frontier, and before
         the great pulse of business was throbbing as it is now, and before commerce permeated every
         part of the State. The Democrats dare not, if business demands it, refuse to call a special
         session. I believe there is enough integrity and honesty among these members to stand by a
         solemn pledge.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: It is our duty to pass this bill in some shape, and you all know I am not
         much for appropriations. I don't know that I shall vote for it as it is. My bill has not
         been reached; yet I am willing to let it go for eternity, if needs be, for one more
         important. I understood that when we voted for these bills on the third reading that we
         were to proceed with the special order. I thought this bill should come up yesterday. I so
         spoke then. For the last time, then, I appeal to the majority to vote for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I voted "aye" at every roll call before this to bring this appropriation
         bill, but now I shall vote against its coming up at this time. This is no time to bring it
         up. We agreed on our legislation, and it is no time now to forsake that and our words to
         bring up the Appropriation bill. Let us cease talking of this man or that man being a
         Democrat or Republican. There are other very important bills to be considered - countless
         of them. This House has yet the Knightstown bill concerning insane asylums; countless
         claims, and many others not introduced by demogogues. I might go on and on. Are you going
         home and leave all these undone?</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I want to say that in the first place this matter of considering this
         special order has never been postponed. Every member on this floor did not enter into an
         agreement to read these bills before these special orders. Many of us voted against it. The
         gentleman from Kosciusko (Mr. Sayre) is himself on the roll as against it. Ail those who
         voted for the call of the counties knew that the special orders would come up at this hour.
         But one time has this bill been urged when it would be a political measure, and that was
         when the gentleman from Kosciusko urged it to take the place of the Apportionment bill.
         Then why does he say that I have opposed it? I deny it. Where is his authority? I voted
         against it but the once - when it was called up by him I move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The motion that the House resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole was rejected by
         yeas 37, nays 50.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, explaining his vote, said he should vote against it because he thought it
         unfair.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: For the same reason I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Having gone into this compact to read bills the third time, I would regard
         it as dishonorable to break it. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Because to take it up would be unfair, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING moved that the two special orders be now discharged.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH moved that the General Appropriation bill be made a special order for

         when the prosecutor nor his deputy neither is present. This bill provides that when the
         defendant pleads guilty the fee shall not be allowed to the prosecutor. The bill is in the
         interest of the fund for the reason that it will lessen the fine, and will be an inducement
         for the defendant, if guilty, to plead such.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 58, nays 24</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, explaining his vote, said: For the reason that I do not think the bill in the

         for the reason that it shuts out the allowance to the Prosecuting Attorney, who is now the
         poorest paid officer in the State, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: As one who has had experience as Prosecutor I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I do not think this favors the criminal, but that it is criminal to draw a
         fee when he is not present. The present law is robbery - to rob and plunder unfortunates.
         It prohibits the gain of those Deputy Prosecutors who go about hunting up petty violations

        <p>Mr. BAILEY'S bill [S. 136] to fix the time of closing up saloons in Indianapolis and
         Evansville at 12 o'clock midnight - </p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: It leaves the laws in the other parts of the State as they are, except at
         Indianapolis and Evansville. These two cities are metropolitan cities; trains arrive at all
         hours of the day and night; these cities are under the Metropolitan Police system. It would
         be no hardship upon other sections of the country. This would leave election laws as they
         are.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I doubt very much whether such legislation is demanded by either of the
         citizens of Indianapolis or Evansville. Whilst there may be a very strong element in favor
         of such legislation, there is a strong element against it. I can't see the propriety of
         extending the hour at which the saloons in Indianapolis and Evansville close up. If he is a
         railroad man, instead of going to a saloon, he had better go home. There is no good reason
         why a law should apply to Indianapolis and Evansville, and not to the rest of the State. I
         move to lay the bill, with all the amendments, on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 17.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, explaining his vote, said: One reason alleged was that many times
         passengers come in late when most of the hotels are shut up, and many of the saloons have
         restaurants, and it is very convenient for the passengers to go to the saloons and get
         something to eat. I therefore vote no.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR, when his name was called, said: I think a man ought to have all he wants to eat
         and drink.</p>

         relating to the payment of soldiers in the Indiana Legion, was read the second and third
         time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILL: This bill provides to pay certain officers and soldiers for services rendered
         in the militia in 1862 on the call of Governor Morton. Tɥere was a bill passed in 1867 to
         pay these troops, but the Captain of this company was in Alabama at that time. There was a
         provision to cut off the pay of all persons whose pay-rolls were not in at that time, and
         owing to the Captain being absent the pay-rolls could not be put in. I think there is
         nothing wrong in the matter. I hope the bill will pass. These soldiers have been kept out
         of pay for a long time. There is some $16,000 in the State Treasury now for the payment of
         these soldiers, and I think it no more than right that it should pass. In 1867 there was
         $30,000 appropriated to pay these soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I want to make this statement: The Captain was away and he was written to
         come home and make out his muster-roll and go to the Legislature and have his claim
         allowed. He came, but he came too late to get their pay at that Legislature. The Captain
         says he has felt em- <pb n="295" xml:id="VAA8558-22-295"/> barrassed ever since from the
         fact that the men say to him that if he had done his duty they would have had their

        <p>The bill [H. R. 72] in relation to the duties of the Supreme Court Clerk coming up - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, offered an amendment that the Clerk of the Supreme Court be not
         required to keep for public inspection a record of his receipts.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, made an ineffectual motion to strike out the enacting clause by
         yeas 13, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr MACY moved to substitute the minority report for the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: There never was a more vicious bill introduced into a Legislature. It
         opens the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court to ferrets, who may go and examine the books
         and then travel over the State and secure old claims. Let this bill be amended so as to
         give to the Clerk the custody of that record. I hope the bill will not pass.</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jennings: We had this matter under consideration once before [see page 199]
         It was the sense of this Senate once to not allow the bill to pass. I am satisfied that the
         bill originated in the same place as the other bill. I have not the least objection that
         the unclaimed fees shall go where they belong. I object to the words "keeping a register of
         all fees, including his own." If the words "including his own" are stricken out, I see no
         very great objection to the bill. As the bill now stands it would require the Clerk of the
         Supreme Court to employ at least one clerk, and possibly two, to make and furnish the
         record. If he keeps a private record for his own convenience he ought not to be compelled
         to show them to the public. I move to strike out the words, "including his own."</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: The effect of this bill will be to require the Clerk of the Supreme Court to
         keep a register of all fees received, including his own. The principle difference between
         this bill and Senate bill is that it does not require the Clerk to give a bond. I ask a
         fair consideration of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I see that the majority report was adopted on February 18.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The Senator from Jennings gave no reasons why the bill should not pass. There
         is no valid reason why the fees of the Supreme Court Reporter as well as any other public
         officer should not be kept open to the public</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to recommit the bill to the same committee that the Senate bill was
         reported to.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by ayes 20, nays 21.</p>
        <p>The amendment [Mr. Smith's, of Jennings,] was rejected.</p>

         for another vote on its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to take the bill up and put it upon its passage for the reason that it
         had failed for want of a constitutional majority, whereupon - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, said: Mr. President, I rise to a question of order. It is this.
         The bill when voted upon only received 21 votes, as against 21 votes in the negative.</p>
        <p>The vote being a tie the bill was lost; not because it failed for want of a
         constitutional majority, but because it received a minority of all the votes cast. In other
         words, when a vote is tie the proposition is lost. That being true the bill can not again
         be taken up.</p>
        <p>The CHAIR: I confess I am not able to decide the question correctly, and I therefore
         submit it to the decision of the older Senators who ought to be posted.</p>
        <p>Mr MAGEE and Mr. FOULKE held the question of order not well taken, and it was so

        <p>Upon the vote being announced as above - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, moved to reconsider the vote just taken. He said: When this bill
         was defeated by a tie vote it ceased to be a living thing. There was no power that could
         revive it into life or give it a legal entity in this body, except that it could be again
         introduced and read three times on three several days, as is required of any other bill.
         But under the circumstances this bill has not received a constitutional consideration here,
         and consequently has not been legally passed, and the whole matter ought to be
         reconsidered. We ought not to take up a dead measure and breathe new life into it, without
         letting it take its constitutional course. [Here the Senator read from the rules of the

         order to-morrow at 10 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr YOUCHE moved to substitute S. 94 concerning the cost of Supreme Court reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This is a bill that affects the price of the Supreme Court Reporter. It has
         been reported back from a special committee with a recommendation that the price of the
         Supreme Court Reporter be hereafter fixed at $2 75 instead of $3 50 which is the price at
         the present time. I hope the matter is of sufficient importance that it will be taken up
         and acted upon. We learn that there is an edition of 1,200 copies of each report sold by
         the Reporter. We also learn that the cost of publishing the reports of the Supreme Court,
         including printing, binding, etc., does not exceed $1.50 a copy. That was the highest
         estimate put upon it so that it so that it leaves the Reporter a clear net profit of $2;
         and at this rate his salary off of the reports would be something more than $21 000. Here
         is an officer getting more than the Governor, and more than the Judges of the Supreme
         Court. The bill that I am seeking to have made a special order, reduces the price of the
         reports to $2 75; that will still leave the Reporter a profit of $1 25 on each one and that
         would still leave him something over $13,000 a year profit on these reports. And if, as has
         been said, there are only six volumes gotten out, it would still leave the Reporter a
         profit of $9,000 a year. I think a bill that will regulate the price of these reports is a
         bill of great importance. The reports of the rounding States do not cost to exceed $2.75 a
         volume, and they run down to $1.10.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. SELLERS this bill along with several others was made a special order for

         upon its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: This is an honest claim and one that ought to be paid. It is the only one
         of these swamp land claims that has not been paid. I do hope that the Senate will do jutice
         to an honest man. This is one of the most distressing claims. The person is an old man who
         paid one thousand dollars in getting a $400.00 claim</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: There is nothing in the claim that shows how the claimant became the owner
         of the claim. There are not enough facts here to warrant the passing of this bill to
         engrossment. All the information we get in regard to the claim is from the claimant.
         Whether there has been any legal assignment of the claim to this claimant I doubt, and for
         that reason I will vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: At the time the claim came before the committee we were satisfied that it was
         proper, and I have no doubt as to the justice of the claim. The only question was in the
         ownership of the claim and we were satisfied on that point.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I don't know anything about this claim, but in view of the fact that it has
         been recommended by the committee and Mr. Thompson, and in view of the fact that the papers
         laid before the committee are lost, and if the claim subsequently comes before any other
         committee it would be hard to convince the committee of the justice of the claim, I will
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: I know nothing of this claim, personally. I have talked to Mr. Bynum, ex

        <p>Mr. BARNES, explaining his vote, said that he should vote "no" because he had asked a

        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Because the members of the committee were at no expense, and were

        <p>Mr. DEEM: Because it cost them nothing, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I understand that none of this money is asked for by members who visited the

         reported more fun and no expense on the visit, I think that the claim is an outrage and

        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: I was with this committee, and we were dined and were treated royally. And

        <p>The Senate amendments to Mr. Patten's bill [H. R 243] to fix the number of
         Representatives and Senators in Indiana being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the amendment be concurred in and demanded the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand and under its operations the Senate amendments were
         concurred in by yeas 58, nays 38</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY explaining his vote said: I will state that day after day we have voted to go
         on with this call of bills on third reading; and now that this thing comes up, I vote
         no.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: Believing that the amendments offered by the Senate still leave this the
         most odious, unjust and subversive bill acted upon in the Indiana Legislature, and
         believing its every part to be revolutionary - to be infamous; and believing further, that
         the adoption of the amendments would be a continuance of a most inconsistent measure that
         ever throttled a free people; believing that it disfranchises the honest voter, I shall
         vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: If I understand this measure it abolishes the Indiana General Assembly and
         substitutes a Democratic caucus. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: About this hour of the day that party which has long controlled this
         Government goes out of power; and if this measure is a help to the party coming in I shall
         be happy; therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN: If I were to speak of this whole scheme, I would speak of it in a
         modification of the inspired writer who referred <pb n="298" xml:id="VAA8558-22-298"/> to
         wickedness in high places; but I denominate it as "pure cussedness in high places."</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: I shall not now make my farewell address; that must go to a future time; but
         believing this measure an unfair one, though we might take our medicine without kicking,
         yet I say that if the tide turns count on as to hoist the black flag and show no quarters.
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: At the door of the people of Tippecanoe County no charge of
         unfair elections has ever been laid. But still you rob us of oar representative, while
         other and smaller counties are given a greater representation. It is pure stealing. That is
         plain English and pure Anglo Saxon. I would not be true to my constituents if I did lift up
         my voice against the infamous outrage upon the people. We are made unequal two to one on
         this floor in the future. I enter my protest, and with it my "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: As this is the day when the Republican party goes out of power,
         and hoping that it will never return again, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: Because of its unfairness and infamy, and because of the dignity and
         persistence of the Speaker in refusing to recognise members who had the floor, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I move that the words be taken down.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: No, no. Proceed with the roll call.</p>

         Congressional purposes being read —</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the amendments be concurred in, and demanded the previous

        <p>The House seconded the demand, and the Senate amendments were concurred in by yeas 58,

        <p>Mr. GOODING, explaining his vote, said that though the assignment of Rush County was
         objectionable to him, he would, all things considered vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON would vote "aye," because he knew of nothing in the State Constitution
         providing that an equal number of Republicans should be in this body; or, for that matter,
         any Republicans; and, further, it was as fair as the Republicans made</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I explain my vote for the reason that before I voted against the bill. I now
         vote for it, because the objectionable features have been removed by the Senate amendments,
         chief among which objections was that Rush County was tacked on to my district. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: By these amendments my district is made certainly Republican
         beyond all contingencies save another gerrymander; still the bill is unfair to my
         neighbors, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: When this bill came up I voted for it because it was party action — it was
         caucus action. But coming from the Senate amended it ceases to be caucus section. All these
         changes have been made at the expense of the Democrats of the Ninth District We had 900
         majority to overcome in our district, and for our success this is the reward. In this the
         members have not been true to us, and had this been known this bill would never have left
         this House with the vote it did.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: As I stated when this bill first came up, I have no apology to offer for my
         support of it. I like the spirit of my friend from Vermillion [Mr. Sears], who talks of the
         black flag and no quarters. We have up our old flag now, and are pouring hot shot into the
         enemy. I shall vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: The man who puts on the armor should not boast of himself, but the man who
         puts it off. For the reason of its injustice, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: This is not wholly a party question. I represent both Republicans and
         Democrats. One party in the House has a temporary majority, but the matter is in the hands
         of the voters. I shall never lift my voice and lend my aid to any measure to disfranchise a
         single voter. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. VICKERY: Because of its unfairness to the Ninth District I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the Senate amendments were concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, raised the question that the bill should be again passed by 51

        <p>The bill [S. 48 — see pages 176 and 205] regarding the militia of the State was read the
         third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: The present military code of Indiana is very imperfect. It does not give
         sufficient strength to our military organizations, and now is as good a time as we will
         ever have to remedy it It is not necessary that any great expense should be incurred. The
         provisions of the bill ask this Legislature to uniform the enlisted men now in the State
         service. Our companies are made up of the best young men. They are not able to attend a
         military school yet; they have so far borne all the expense of uniforms, armory rents fuel,
         lights, and traveling expenses, going to and returning from our State encampments, buying
         their guns and ammunition. They are liable to be called upon at any time to risk their
         lives in the defense of the property and the lives of our people. The militia comprises the
         best and cheapest police force that can be organized.</p>
        <p>Can any gentleman on this floor assign a just and laudable reason why the State can not
         afford to aid, to some extent, the citizen soldiery of our State? Our State stands today
         second to none in all matters of public interest, but we lag behind in this one particular
         matter. It will not do for us to say that in case of war, that we have old and experienced
         officers that could organize companies and regiments.</p>
        <p>The men must have confidence in the ability of each other, and the only way to accomplish
         this is by associating the men together. Every Legislature appropriates large sums of money
         for the mental culture of the young men; but why should the physical development that comes
         from a thorough military drill be wholly neglected by the State?</p>
        <p>I know of what I am speaking about. I organized a company of fifty-eight young men more
         than two years ago and the members were hastened into the State service, me as their
         Captain, and out of all that number there was not one gentleman of leisure — all poor, but
         hard-working and honest young men. There is not one of that company able to attend any
         institution of learning, except it be a free school. My company will compare favorably with
         the other companies now in the Indiana Legion.</p>
        <p>There is nothing that inspires a man or puts him upon his honor quicker than the uniform
         of his State or country in whose service he has voluntarily entered, and from which he
         receives aid and support. I hope that these matters will receive your careful consideration
         and support, regardless of political affiliations. Most of the States recognize the
         importance of an efficient organization by making suitable annual appropriations for the
         support of their troops as follows: [See page 205 — second column]. The Commonwealth of the
         grand old State of Indiana in her financial prosperity and educational advancements passes

        <head rend="center">DITCH LAWS.</head>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved that the bill [H. R. 222] to abolish the office of Ditch Commissioner
         be read the first time by sections and the second time by title.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: The present law is a system of robbery. Under the present law a man may start a
         ditch scheme and rob the people of thousands of dollars. We need some legislation upon this
         question; the people are expecting and demanding it. In one county of this State I am told
         there are over sixty executions that have been returned, while the property assessed as
         benefited is not sufficient to pay the executions. This is an infamous law and ought to be
         changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I hope that motion will not prevail. There have been bills introduced here
         and reported by the committee that would do away with the most objectionable parts of the
         drainage law.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: It is evident that no bill that has not gone through the House can originate in
         the Senate and then go to the House and pass this session. It is the duty of the Senate to
         take some action upon this matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This is going to make a radical change in the law. The people have become
         thoroughly familiar with the present law, and the law has worked satisfactory with few
         exceptions. I am opposed to this bill at this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: The people in my section have become so familiar with the law that they regard
         it as infamous. It is from this familiarity that the people demand a change.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't know why the bill should work one way in Cass County and another way
         in Laporte County. You can't have a public highway law that is not arbitrary. I insist that
         a bill so important as this, coming at this late day, ought not to be considered. It is
         utterly impossible to give this bill the proper attention. The first law that was passed in
         Indiana in regard to drainage was in 1865, and we have have changed that law until we have
         got the present law, and it is the best law we have ever had.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The present law is not satisfactory to the people of Indiana.</p>
        <p>The present law is eminently satisfactory to one class of people, and that class of
         people is the attorneys. In my county, where a great deal of ditching has been done, the
         most satisfactory law is the Commissioners' law. A more arbitrary law has never been placed
         upon the statute book than the present one.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: It seems to me that this Legislature in this late day of the session is
         trying to follow out the action of the Legislature of 1881, when several bills were rushed
         through that were afterwards found to work unjustly. I doubt whether there are three
         members on the floor of the House who understood anything about this bill It changes
         radically the entire drainage law of the State. We ought not to change the present law by
         passing a bill we know nothing about.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: I introduced a bill to repeal the present law in regard to drainage; this
         was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Drainage</orgName> and they made a favorable
         report. I was told by several members of that committee that there would be a bill
         introduced in the Senate for the purpose of amending the ditch law. Now we have a bill
         before the Senate proposing to amend that law, and I <pb n="301" xml:id="VAA8558-22-301"/>
         trust that it will pass. If there is any law that is infamous, odious and oppressing the
         people it is this Circuit Court ditch law. I trust the rule will be suspended.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINIOSH: Nearly one-half of my county have written to me in regard to this law and
         spoken of its unjustness. I understand the intention of the bill is to keep the Ditch
         Commissioners from confiscating the property of the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This bill proposes to repeal the present Circuit Court drainage law in toto,
         and to pass a new act upon this subject. It provides that there shall be a jury trial, and
         if there were five hundred witnesses, as might be the case, it would hardly be possible for
         a jury to do justice to the parties concerned. The jury provision would result in rendering
         inoperative the ditch law. This bill provides that if a majority of the residents of the
         county remonstrate against the ditch, it will go down. In the case of a nonresident, who
         owned land and paid taxes, having no friends in that county, it would work a very great
         hardship indeed. This bill comes to the Senate without any recommendation from any
         committee. I hope so radical a measure will not come up at this late hour of the
         session.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: It is not too late to do justice. This bill was introduced January 21. It
         provides that where any two landowners of the county, or a majority of the land owners
         shall remonstrate, they shall proceed no further. I say that, a majority of the people
         should always have control of this matter. I move the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded, and under its operation -</p>
        <p>The motion (Mr. Seller's) was agreed to — yeas, 34; nays, 11 — and the bill was ordered
         printed, with amendments proposed by several Senators.</p>

        <p>The bills [S. 84 and 94] were taken up.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The report signed by the Senator from Wayne and myself proposes to sell
         these reports at a profit of seventy-five cents a volume, and provides a good salary for
         the Reporter. The State paid $14,560 for her share of these reports last year. I desire to
         be fair to the Reporter of the Supreme Court, but let this law be passed so that hereafter
         these Reporters may fully understand what the emoluments of the office will be.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: Two members of the committee were in favor of reducing the price of the
         Reports to $2 75.</p>

        <p>The report submitted by Messrs. Sellers and Foulke was read.</p>
        <p>The minority [Mr. May's] report, recommending indefinite postponement, was rejected by
         yeas 19, nays 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE, explaining: There is a demand for some legislation on this subject. I think it
         bad policy to indefinitely postpone this bill, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: With the view that the bill shall be so amended as not to take effect during
         the term of the present incumbent, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: As the terms of the five Commissioners expire this year, which
         increases the number of reports about one-half, and as it is likely there will be an
         Appellate Court, which will still further reduce the number of reports, and believing they
         should not cost more than $2.75 a volume, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: In view of the explanation of Senator Sellers, I change my vote to "no."</p>
        <p>So the Senate refused to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved that the report signed by Mr. Fowler and himself be adopted instead of
         the other majority report, which leaves the law on this subject as it is, except that it
         proposes to cut down the price of the Supreme Court reports from $3.50 to $2 75. There is a
         great deal of detail about the other report.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The amendment which I propose met the favor of a majority of the House. The
         volumes will be cut down to not more than six a year. This bill provides that the State
         shall issue these reports, and have all the profit after paying all costs of publications
         and officers. I hope the report signed by Mr. Foulke and myself will be adopted. The
         measure as it stood without the amendment was defeated in the House, but after the bill was
         engrossed, an amendment similar to the one I have in my hands was intended to be offered,
         but could not be because the bill was ordered to be engrossed. I am satisfied the amendment
         will be accepted by the House. This bill gives to the State all the profits arising from
         the publication of these reports. This new system is easily understood. If we pass it
         to-day, I don't think there will be any difficulty in the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the report submitted by Senator Youche and himself by providing
         that the provisions of this bill shall not apply to the present incumbent.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, moved as a substitute that the provisions of this act shall
         go into effect from and after the 1st of January, 1886.</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected on a division — affirmative, 14; negative, 23.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, moved as a substitute that the provisions of this act shall
         not take effect till January 1, 1887.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Inasmuch as we will probably have another session before 1887, I move the
         substitute lay on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 18, nays 26.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It is not just to cut down the emoluments of the office during the term of
         an incumbent, who made the race understanding what the office would be <pb n="302"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-302"/>worth. Let the legislation, if any is made, effect only the man
         who comes into office after the bill is enacted. Had either of us made a race for any
         position we would think it unjust to have the fees of the office cut down in our time.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Like the Senator from Huntington, I hope the substitute will not prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I undertake to say that these reports can be sold for $1 50. You can get the
         Pennsylvania reports for $1.25 a volume. It is entirely wrong that any officer in the State
         should get the salary that the Reporter of the Supreme Court gets. I can show that he gets
         nearer $25 000 a year than $20,000 — more than the Judges of the Supreme Court get. From
         every town in the State a petition has come up here asking us to pass such a bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I don't believe in the theory that we can't cut down the fees or salary
         of an office during the term of an incumbent. I think we have the right to regulate the
         fees of any officer at any time. The only trouble I find is I don't know what are the
         emoluments or fees of this office. It has been said that tbe Supreme Court Reporter gets
         $20,000. That is robbery. The great tremble is to get at the facts about this office. These
         committees are utterly unable to get the ex-Reporters or any one else to give them any
         facts in regard to the cost of the reports. I believe we ought to make this law take effect
         in 1887, and if the Supreme Court Reporter sees fit, he can come before the next
         Legislature with facts and ask the Legislature to repeal the law. I am willing to put the
         price so low as to compel the Reporter to come in and show what the cost is. We are doing
         no injustice to the Reporter when we require a showing of the cost to be made.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: The amendment proper does not meet with my sanction. I have
         made it as a sort of compromise. Heretofore we have cut down the salaries of various
         officers of the State, and I think it would be a bad precedent to say we could not pass
         upon the fees or salaries of an office during the incumbency of an officer. We have
         stricken $2 a day from the fees of clerks during the present session, and it would be a
         dangerous thing to say we shall not legislate upon the fees of incumbent officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: This same proposition was voted down in the House. If we pass a law now
         fixing what will be the compensation of the office of the Supreme Court Reporter, the next
         applicant will seek this office with his eyes open.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Up to 1880 you could not get any reports for anything like the price
         mentioned by the Senator from Cass (Mr. Magee) A company in New York published United
         States Reports, four volumes in one, for about a dollar a volume. This proposed change will
         decrease the emoluments of that office about half, and, in addition, the introduction of
         the Appellate Court will take away a great part of tht business of the Supreme Court
         Reporter.</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET questioned whether it is competent for this General Assembly to pass a law
         to take effect after the meeting of the next General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I think the Constitution is sufficiently plain on that subject. [Reads.]</p>

        <p>Mr. HILL: S. 322 is a bill to regulate the county school revenue. This is a matter of
         great importance, not only to every county in the State but also to the State officers. It
         is also a matter of great importance to every taxpayer, because it lessens the amount of
         liability of the State Treasury. If you keep this money in the County Treasury it will be
         much more safe than otherwise. I have had the combined wisdom of the Auditor of the State,
         Supervisor of Public Instruction, and the Committee on Finance to assist in formulating
         this bill. I move to suspend the constitutional rule, read the bill the second time by its

        <p>On motion of Mr. FOULKE, the constitutional rule was suspended and the bill [H. R. 400]
         authorizing colleges and universities to hold real estate to the value of $500,000 was
         taken up.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend so that real estate may be received by donation or devise, but
         it must be disposed of in twenty years.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I hope the amendment of the Senator from Lake (Mr. Youche) will not prevail. I
         am in favor of fair legislation in regard to the educational industries of the State. This
         bill has passed the House. There are those who feel toward this institution in such a way
         that they are prompted to leave to this institution a large endowment of real estate. I see
         no reason why the university should not hold this real estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I move to add after the word advise "to purchase on foreclosure of mortgage,
         give to secure any part of the endowment fund."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: The purpose of this amendment is not to prevent them from receiving the real
         estate, but the purpose is to prevent them from using up the real estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Why not give the institution the right to build up itself by private
         enterprise? Any educational institution should have the right to hold $500,000 if they can
         use it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I don't think any university receiving $500,000 would cause any real estate
         crisis. I think we had better not jeopardize the bill by any amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: At the time of the incorporation of DePauw it was allowed to hold real estate
         to the amount of $50,000. Now they are asking that they be allowed to hold real estate to
         the amount of $500 000, which some benevolent person desires to give them.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I believe there are twenty such institutions in this State, and under this
         bill there would be $10,000,000 wrapped up in these institutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I would not object if they held that much.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The object of this bill is to allow every institution - to allow each and
         every one $500,000 more than they need for the purpose for which it was incorporated. I am
         ready to allow every educational institution the right to buy or receive by purchase
         property or anything else for the purposes for which it has been incorporated. Such action
         as that proposed by the bill is against all reason</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I am not afraid to allow institutions to receive large donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: If a college has five hundred thousand dollars as an income
         the presumption is that it is going to be invested in real estate or some other live
         property to bring an income.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: This bill is against the policy of our law. I am opposed to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The opposition to this bill is that the institutions would
         acquire by purchase or gift large amounts of real estate which they would not yield up. It
         would be the creation of a landed monopoly, with landlords and tenants. I am not sure that
         this would be the right sort of a corporation to create. When this $500,000 becomes
         invested in real estate it will be grasped by the university and not yielded up. The people
         of Indiana will live to regret that a university has been allowed to become a grasping
         monopoly. It is against the policy of our government and against the policy of human right
         that a university should hold real estate</p>

        <head rend="center">THE STATE MILITIA.</head>
        <p>The unfinished business was consideration of the bill [S. 88] to regulate the State
         militia.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I do not see how this bill can pass. The Constitution says that no colored
         men shall belong to it; and while I have no prejudice against that race, yet I am sworn to
         support the Constitution, and for that reason I can not support this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Does not the Constitu- <pb n="304" xml:id="VAA8558-22-304"/>tion of the
         United States declare this State constitutional provision void? And are you not sworn to
         support the United States Constitution?</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I do not believe that the United States has any right to interfere with
         this State right.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I am a member of the G. A. R, and my post does not wish this bill. This is an
         unjust measure. It will throw an extra burden on the people. Do the men who labor ask for a
         military institution in Indiana? No. It is only the people in the cities who ask for it -
         and for what purpose? It is for the purpose of crushing out labor. It is a direct blow at
         wage laborers, and if they dare raise their voices to oppression this militia is to declare
         a riot and charge upon the laborers. The bill declares that the officers are to be chosen
         by an Examining Board. This is very objectionable. The militia, if there is one, should
         select its own officers. Then there is tax exemption, which would entail much loss to the
         State. We should rather encourage our young men to thinking rather than to marching. It is
         proposed to donate a large sum to purchase uniforms for these men to strut in. It will
         amount to over $100,000 per annum. It is an institution to rob the school fund. I hope the
         members of this House, especially the Democratic members, will assert themselves and see
         that this bill does not pass. We need have no fears of mobs under Democratic rule. It is
         not a militia but a standing army.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I do not desire to make any attack without cause upon this bill. I do think
         that a close scrutiny of the bill will develop no reason that will be approved by the
         people why the bill should pass. If the bill pass, it should have, on one or two grounds,
         that either it is an ornament to the State or that it is needed. Will anyone say that
         because other States have it we should have it as an ornament, to satisfy the whims of a
         few? We are told that there is to be an appropriation of but $10,000. Don't delude
         yourself. Money will be demanded constantly and it is but the beginning of stupenduous
         military organizations of the State. In private arguments the supporters of the bill say,
         "give us a start." The cost to the State will not be less than $25 000 per annum. Even
         though you have 17,000 petitioners for the bill don't forget the 500 000 voters who have
         not been heard from. An organization to secure petitions against it would far outweigh the
         petitions for it. Don't let it be said that on the very day a Democratic administration
         came into power that the Indiana Assembly organized a standing army; we do not need it.
         There is no foreign war coming on, nor is there an impending riot. No man need charge that
         the Democrats on this floor are fearing labor riots. Go into the States which have <choice>
          <corr>militia</corr>
          <sic>malitia</sic>
         </choice>, and they are no more peaceful than Indiana. Take Ohio, for instance, with its
         Cincinnati and Hocking Valley riots, and yet that that State pays $60,000 per year for its
         militia. It is the same in Pennsylvania. The cost of uniforms will be at least $50,000,
         then there is the $10 000 appropriation and the release from poll tax. It will be too great
         a burden for the taxpayer. Does Marion County want this tax on its property for the sake of
         a parade through the streets of Indianapolis? I have that confidence in the people which
         precludes any fear of riotous destruction of property.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) has stated this question most
         thoroughly. What is the necessity of enacting this bill into a law? Don't delude yourselves
         with the idea that the law can be repealed in two years. The military organizations will
         then be here with demands. Henry Clay once warned the people against military power. In
         time of war I am for soldiers; but in times of peace let us have peace. It is twenty years
         since the war, and even our Republican friends have discovered that it is over. What
         necessity is then for this bill now? It will make Indiana a general encampment for this
         militia. Some speak of riots in cities, where some corporation of great power is keeping
         men at starvation's door and want "protection." The Sheriff can call every man in the
         county to his aid to suppress riot. The Democratic party is for the people, and it can not
         afford to pass this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: Being a member of the <orgName>Military Committee</orgName>, and
         the only smaller opposing this unjust Military bill, I will offer some thoughts against it.
         I represent a county which does not favor a standing army. I followed the old flag with my
         musket. But these are times of peace. You will find a great many men braver in peace than
         in war. It has been urged that other States pay for military organizations, but as we do
         not need it I can not see why we should favor it. We should vote down the bill and save the
         taxpayer thousands of dollars. We want no such State dignity.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I would like to support a reasonable bill regarding the militia, but I would
         rather encourage something of benefit to the State. I would rather vote to organize
         farmers' sons into a company for better stock raising or a company of carpenter^ sons or
         the like. But such a scheme would not meet with favor here. I do not care to "point with
         pride" to any military organization. I happen to be adjutant of a post of G. A. R, and it
         does not favor it. We should not contemplate the organization of military even, I say,
         though the workingmen were organizing to protect themselves against oppression. Let it not
         be sent abroad that we oppose any labor organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: While I am too old to take part in military parade, yet I favor the
         education of the young men. I am no alarmist I am willing to trust the State officers of
         whatever political party. When property is destroyed and the lives of inno- <pb n="305"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-305"/>cent ones threatened, then I want the military to quell such
         trouble. I like to treat this subject fairly. I am not sure that a company would be
         organized in my county, but my people are not afraid of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. GARRISON: I am the representative of a county which has an interest in this measure.
         It seems that this bill is an inroad against the principles of the Democratic party. We
         have provided our children with books instead of swords, and we are capable of self
         government. There is a dispute between capital and labor. I believe it would be calamitous
         alike to put the military in the hands of capital or in the hands of labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: I am a member of the G. A. R., but I see no necessity for the bill</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: We are not here to make military laws. We do not need such, and the people
         will not favor it. The expense will be heavy and the good nothing. I have studied the bill
         carefully, but I can not find the need of the law. I believe the bill to be
         unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I am an advocate of this bill. The opposition has drawn largely upon
         imagination regarding the bill and the cost. The long list of officers is complimentary -
         not one cent of tax upon the people. The only argument I have heard against this bill is
         the constitutionality of admitting colored men; but that may be so declared by the Supreme
         Court and stricken out We have five companies in Indianapolis, and they are all laboring
         men, and hard laboring men.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY: As the representative of 17,000 old soldiers, I must say that they are almost
         unanimously in favor of this bill. In the seventy-one counties where petitions come from,
         every old soldier is in favor of it. Go back before the war, when we were sleeping in
         peace, and a volcano suddenly bursts under our feet. The militia was the backbone of the
         war of 1812. We may need a militia suddenly in Indiana. No man regards brass buttons when
         he is going to be shot at. There is nothing in the ornament argument.</p>
        <p>The bill passed — yeas, 56; nays, 35.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, explaining his vote, said: Inasmuch as I hold in my hand a petition in favor

        <p>Mr. BEST: Because I believe that it is demanded, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BOOE: Because I am opposed to military powers in times of peace; because it is
         against the principles of our Government to equip and maintain large military forces;
         because it endangers the future peace of our country, in that it engenders a military
         spirit; because it will largely increase our burden of taxation; because this is an era of
         greatest peace and such a vast military force is not needed; because, lastly, the people do
         not demand it, but it is only asked by red-tape military companies, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: Because I think it needful, I vote "aye."</p>

         be put in the hands of the Governor, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. FRANKLIN: The bill is not free from objection, but it is better than no bill. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I thought last night that I would vote for this bill, but as I think it
         anti-Democratic, and as I think that morality is better than firearms, and thinking it
         unnecessary, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: Because I am not in favor of filling the laboring men with bullets instead
         of bread, because history has taught me that all other Republics have perished because of
         military tactics and standing armies, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK, of Wayne: Because I have a petition signed by 350 people of the great Quaker
         county which Mr Gooding spoke of, and because I represent, with my colleague, those people,
         and not Mr. Gooding, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: Though a large petition was sent to me asking the passage of this bill, yet
         I believe it was signed under a misapprehension; I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: I have a petition of 250 names, from all parties of St. Joseph County,
         asking for the passage of this bill. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN: I voted against the bill before, because I had a misapprehension. I vote for
         it now, because I understand it, and because the Senate has relieved it of its
         objectionable features. I believe in a system of protection to life and property. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Because the militia in this State has never been used for improper purposes,
         and because I don't believe it will be, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Because my people demand it, though I have some misgivings about the bill, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: Because we should cultivate the acts of peace instead of the theory of war,
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Because Constitution says that citizens may take up arms in
         their defense; because its spirit was indorsed by Thomas Jefferson, not because I fear
         riots at home; because I wish our army to be fully equipped and ready, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I am a man of peace, but in the time of peace prepare for war. The people of
         Indiana demand the law. I hold a petition signed by 175 men from my county, mostly working
         men, asking it: therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Because I do not entertain the misgivings expressed, here, to-day; <pb
          n="306" xml:id="VAA8558-22-306"/> because I am not afraid of the soldier; for
         precautionary reasons; and that I may be allowed a little personality, I think I should
         vote opposite to Mr. Browning. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: Because I believe it contrary to the spirit of our country, I vote
         "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. McCLURE: This bill, as a matter of course, is general in its character, but local in

         people in the vicinity of Jeffersonville have complained of the charge of ten cents for

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH made an ineffectual motion - yeas. 16; nays, 19; - to lay this motion on the
         table.</p>
        <p>The motion to take up the bill was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BAILEY the report of the majority of the committee was concurred in -
         yeas, 22; nays, 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS, in explaining his vote, said: The bill throws down the doors for saloonkeepers
         to sell liquor whenever they please except upon Sundays and election days. I am not in
         favor of such liberal provisions for the sale of intoxicating liquors. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I am opposed to the passage of this bill and therefore opposed to the
         report of the committee. I am perfectly surprised at the votes that are being cast in the
         Senate. Is it possible that the saloon-keepers of Indianapolis and Evansville can put ring
         in the nose of the Democratic Senators in this Indiana Senate and make them vote what they
         want? Is it possible that members who, a few days ago, voted to lay that <pb n="308"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-308"/> bill upon the table now come here within two days of the end of
         the session and charge their votes and bring the bill back and take up our time? In the
         name of my constituents I protest against this measure and vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: The travelling public goming in at late hours of the night after the hotels
         bad been closed would be benefited by the extention of the time of closing saloons until 12
         o'clock. My associate Senator (Mr. Bailey) has looked into this matter by day and night,
         and he says the travelling public demand it. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Two years ago I was not in favor of the Metropolitan Police bill, but I have
         been persuaded that is the right kind of legislation. We have got to have an <choice>
          <sic>arbritrary</sic>
          <corr>arbitrary</corr>
         </choice> hour for closing up the saloons any way, and I think 11 o'clock is a good hour.
         Earnestly I don't believe that the law ought to be interfered with. The law simply applies
         to Indianapolis and Evansville; if it was general there might be some question. I am
         opposed to any change. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: If this proposition was to apply generally I should oppose it, and since
         it is special I will oppose it. If such a law would be good in Indianapolis and Evansville
         it would be good in my town. I do not think it would be good in my town. I am opposed to
         taking up so much time in this kind of legislation. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY moved that the bill be engrossed. I submit that it is simply a police
         regulation that has fixed the hour of closing saloons in Indianapolis for the past two
         years. The statute upon this subject is not regarded. The saloons have not any particular
         hour for closing. It seems to me unfair that Senators from other districts should come here
         and vote for legislation unjust to this large city. The whole community were well pleased
         with the police regulation closing the saloons at 12 o'clock. One or two papers objected to
         it on the ground that it was a police regulation instead of a statute law. Therefore we are
         seeking by this bill to make the law conform to the demands of the traveling public and the
         people of this city. Indianapolis is the Capital city of the State, and there are a large
         number of respectable people on the street after 11 o'clock at night.</p>
        <p>Mr OVERSTREET: I want to repel the Slander that is attempted to be perpetrated upon the
         traveling public of this State. The idea that there is a necessity after 11 o'clock at
         night for men to have access to a saloon is absurd. The bill is for the accommodation of
         the saloons. It would indeed be strange if a person could not procure in Indianapolis,
         after 11 o'clock at night, a sandwich without going to a saloon. I do hope and pray that
         the senior Senator from Marion will not surrender his manhood to the saloon-keepers.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: We would not be doing any violence by voting to allow the saloons of this
         city to remain open until 12 o'clock. I have come to the opinion that temperance is to be
         established in the family circle, in the Church and Sunday-school, and not by law. I have a
         horror of establishing religion by law.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The only class of people that is demanding the passage of this bill is the
         saloon people and a small class of ward politicians. I know the sentiments of the better
         class of Democrats and Republicans of this city, and they are opposed to it. It is for
         political success that these small fry politicians court the saloon vote. There is no
         sentiment whatever among either Democrats or Republicans for a change in the present law.
         In an early day of this session there came before this Senate a memorial of the pastors of
         this city asking that the law in regard to saloon closing be not changed. In 1875 the
         saloon-keepers fixed the hour to close at 11 o'clock, and there is no occasion to make the
         hour later.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: The Republican Senators will vote straight ahead for temperance. So far as I
         know, everybody ta satisfied with the bill. I am here to defend the rights of the citizens,
         and I intend to do so by voting for the bill. It is not fair that a man should not have the
         right to drink from 11 to 12 o'clock. It is not the saloon-keepers and bummers in
         Evansville alone that demand this change.</p>
        <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 19.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, in explaining his vote said: While my county is not
         interested in this bill, yet I am opposed to the motion to indefinitely postpone. In small
         cities life is ebbing away at 9 or 10 o'clock, while at Indianapolis life is just
         commencing. I don't think the Senate would commit any mistake in passing this bill. I
         believe the metropolitan character of the city of Indianapolis would justify the extending
         of the hour until 12 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY, when his name was called, said: While I am in principle opposed to the
         proposition of the bill, yet as it is local in its character and as a majority of the
         Senators representing these localities appear to be anxious for its passage, I vote against
         the motion to indefinitely postpone. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. BAILEY, the Constitution rule was suspended, and the bill [S. 271]
         prohibiting the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: I think we ought to hear from some physicians as to whether then articles are
         injurious. I think there ought to be a provision that a man could sell oleomargarine as
         oleomargarine it he desired. If <pb n="309" xml:id="VAA8558-22-309"/> it is not injurious,
         and a man desires to use it in his family, he ought to be allowed to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: This bill was copied from the law in New York. It was beneficial to both
         consumers and manufacturers. This bill is intended to stop an imposition upon the board
         upon the boarding public. If we simply say that nothing but genuine butter can be sold, it
         will be what the people demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I can hardly see how any law could be passed to prohibit the
         sale of anything unless it was shown to be injurious.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: As I am in favor of prohibiting the sale of anything that is injurious —
         be it whisky or oleomargine — I am in favor of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL: As no data has been given showing that this was injurious, and not knowing <choice>

         following extract from the inaugural address of President Cleveland in regard to civil
         service, and pledging unqualified support in the enforcement of the principle so
         declared:</p>
        <p>The people demand reform in the administration of the Government and the application of
         business principles to public affairs. AS a means to this end civil service reform should
         be in good faith enforced. Our citizens have the right to protection from the incompetency
         of public employes who hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service, and from
         the corruptive influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of those who expect
         such rewards; and those who worthily seek public employment have thought to insist that
         merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of
         honest political belief in the administration of a Government pledged to do equal and exact
         justice to all men.</p>

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH called attention to a proviso in Section 4, which seems to declare forfeited
         money paid in because the whole subscription is not paid in; also, in Section 12, providing
         for further forfeitures.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE understood Section 4 to mean that the money paid in was to be held as a sort of
         security for the payment of installments, but did not think a forfeiture would work without
         proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: This bill comes under almost all objections to a usury bill;
         besides, preferred stockholders may hold 90 per cent of the stock. Then these corporations
         may hold almost unlimited property. A cursory glance at the bill indicates that it should
         receive a careful consideration. This seems to be, boiled down, vicious legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: There is a similar law on our statute books, commencing with Section 3,407
         of the code. This bill gives a greater latitude than the present law. There can be no
         forfeiture except by a borrower. The bill gives the association the right to loan to
         outsiders, and does not interfere with the law as it now stands. He had known many men to
         acquire homes with the aid of these associations by paying but a little more than rent
         would cost for five, sir or seven years There can be no injustice growing out of this bill,
         but it would be productive of good.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: I am very strongly in favor of the building and loan association law as it
         stands. This bill is not subject to the criticism made by the Senator from St. Joseph.
         These associations never charge more interest than the law allows But there are such
         serious objections to this bill I can not support it. It proposes some radical changes, to
         which I am opposed. The section proposing to make preferred stockholders is all wrong.
         There also are objections to Section 4</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It is said the present law has worked well and done much good; then why
         not leave it alone? This bill prescribes that no premiums shall be deemed usurious. It is a
         dangerous bill, and ought not to pass</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER has been a manager of Building Association for many years, and by the aid of
         such associations many have acquired homes who otherwise would not have homes. This bill is
         an insidious effort to convert such associations from their legitimate purposes by allowing
         the managers to reap a rich harvest from outsiders. There is no wrong about it under the
         present law, but this bill would allow usurious interest of the worst kind. As now operated
         they may be called the poor man's bank. Under this bill a small minority of the
         stockholders would have all the profits, with but few exceptions.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 151] for the incorporation of building, loan fund and savings
         associations, a special order, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: There has been no law upon our statute books that has done so much for the
         welfare of the people as this law. They encourage people to save their, earnings. In this
         city these associations have become more and more popular. They have built up hundreds of
         homes. They are managed so economically that the percentage of losses is exceedingly small.
         There would be no danger of making a continuous association. These associations have had an
         influence in lowering the rate of interest. Loans to persons outside of the associations
         have been allowed under the present law. Most of the associations receive only 6 per cent.,
         while the law allows them 8 per cent</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: As this bill now stands it is, in my mind, subject to great
         criticism. I see in it only a scheme to organize a corporation, with the power to have a
         million of dollars of stock, and under the name of premiums loan it at a usurious rate of
         interest, as it provides that loans may be made not only to stockholders, but to those
         outside, and premiums or bonus be taken as consideration for such loans being granted.
         There is no reason why such power of usury should be given to these associations any more
         than that such privileges should be given to savings banks. As the bill now stands it is
         vicious and dangerous</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: I believe the question has been fully discussed. The Supreme Court of
         Pennsylvania has decided that taking premiums for priority of loans is not usury. It has
         been decided this way in Indiana. The workings of these associations have been beneficial.
         The objection of their being associations with large capital is not valid, when we
         understand that the funds of the associations are put out in mortgages, small loans,
         etc.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The contemplation of these associations is that, at first, the man who gets
         money from the association pays a high rate of interest, bat afterwards he receives a high
         rate of interest from the other borrowers; hence it would not be usurious Under the present
         law they can not loan their money to outsiders This bill provides that when the association
         can not loan to any of their members they can loan to outsiders at the legal rate of
         interest. This bill has been recommended by 250 loan associations of the State. The only
         capital the associations ever have is the weekly dues upon their shares. This bill provides
         that the loans shall only be at the legal contract rate. The provisions in the existing law
         in regard to holding property is not changed. Members desire some time to take out shares
         in favor of their children. We have no savings banks; our laws proved an utter failure in
         regard to them. These associations act as savings banks.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE, by consent, amended the bill so that loans to outsiders shall not be at more
         than the legal rate.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: I am satisfied that the only purpose of this bill would be to make straight
         loans.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I believe the spirit of fairness has always been exercised in these
         associations. None of the members of the associations have spoken against them.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: Since the bill is amended so that loans to who are not
         stockholders shall not be at more than legal rates, and with no premiums, the great
         objection which I saw in the bill is largely removed.</p>

           <head rend="right">THE MILITIA BILL VETOED.</head>
           <byline rend="center">EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,<lb/> INDIANAPOLIS, March 6, 1885.</byline>
           <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE - Senate bill No. 88, "an act supplemental to an act entitled
            'an act for the organization and regulation of the Indiana militia,'" was presented to
            me yesterday, March 5, 1885 for my approval, which is respectfully returned to the House
            in which it originated, with my objections. While I recognize the importance of some
            additional legislation looking to a more perfect organization of the militia of the
            State and the necessity of the State extending, by proper appropriation, aid for its
            support yet, I am constrained to return this bill, on account of constitutional and
            other objections. The appropriations contained in the bill, and any authorized
            expenditure fron the military contingent fund, would, in my judgment, be insufficient to
            a practical and successful execution of the law. While the burden of taxation falls
            heavily upon our people, the financial condition of the State is not such as to warrant
            the outlay at the present, or in the future, necessary for such an organization of the
            militia of the State as contemplated by this act. If, however, I were to waive this
            objection, I still can not give my approval to the bill, on account of grave
            constitutional objections.</p>
           <p>Section 53 of the act provides "that any member of the militia who shall fail to
            attend any drill, parade or encampment, or any other duty when ordered, shall be fined,
            and the commanding officer is authorized and directed, if such fine is not paid seven
            days after notice, to issue his warrant for the amount of the fine therein named, and
            deliver said warrant to the Sheriff or Deputy Sheriff, Town or City Marshal, or any
            Constable in the town or township where the delinquent resides, and suck warrant shall
            be levied upon the goods and chattels of the delinquent, and the amount therein named
            shall be collected wi hout relief from valuation, appraisement or exemption laws."</p>
           <p>This is a very summary and arbitrary mode of collecting a fine, and, contrary to the
            spirit of our institutions, it makes no provision for either a Judge jury or trial. It
            makes the judgment of the officer final and denies the right of the delinquent to the
            benefits of the laws accorded to all in other cases.</p>
           <p>Section 50 provides "that any person who shall fail, refuse or neglect to deliver and
            return the books, blanks, arms or equipments or other military property, to the person
            to whom the same has been legally entrusted, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
            and, upon conviction thereof, may be fined in any sum not less than twice the <pb
             n="311" xml:id="VAA8558-22-311"/> value nor more than five times the value of such
            property, to which may be added imprisonment in the county jail for any period not
            exceeding three months."</p>
           <p>Section 50 provides "that any member of the organization who shall conduct himself in
            a disorderly manner, incite any riot or tumult, or shall be guilty of drunkenness, shall
            be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $50 or be
            imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding ten days, at the discretion of the court or
            jury trying the offender, said fines named in this and preceding section of this act to
            be imposed collected and paid to the treasury of the county to which delinquent or
            offender belongs, for the use and benefit of such company."</p>
           <p>Section 60 further provides "that for any violations of its provisions the offender
            shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in
            any sum not more than $200, or may be imprisoned in the jail of the county where such
            offender resides for not more than six months, or either, or both, at the discretion of
            the Court or jury trying the same, such punishment to be enforced by indictment or
            information in the name of the State of Indiana, in the Circuit Court of the county
            where the offender may reside."</p>
           <p>It is further provided in Section 65 "that for any violation of the provisions thereof
            the offender shall be deemed guilty of misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, may be fined
            in any sum not exceeding $500 and confined in the county jail for a term not exceeding
            six months; and on violating the provisions of Section 64, shall be fined in any sum not
            less than $5 nor more than $20." And Sections 3, 4 and 52 provide "that any violation
            thereof shall be a misdemeanor and punished by fine."</p>
           <p>Section 72 provides "that all fines and penalties for any violation of this act except
            as otherwise "specially provided, shall be paid to the Treasurer of the county in which
            such fines and penalties are assessed, and shall be paid by the County Treasurer to the
            Treasurer of State at the time such officer makes his annual settlement, and such sums
            of money so realized shall be by the Treasurer of State set apart as a portion of the
            military fund of the State for the sole use and benefit of the active militia of the
            State, to be paid out and expended on the order of the Governor"</p>
           <p>In my opinion, the disposition sought to be made of the money realized from the fines
            in the foregoing sections divests the same from the common school fund to a military
            fund, and is contrary to the provisions of Section 2, Article 8, of the Constitution. It
            is provided in said section 2, Article 8 of the Constitution, "that all fines assessed
            for benefits of the penal laws of the State shall constitute a part of the common school
            fund."</p>
           <p>For the foregoing reasons, and others that might be given, I can not give my sanction
            to the bill. It is not conspicuous for brevity; it contains seventy-five sections and
            its extreme length has prevented me from giving it a more extended review.</p>

        <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. DAVIS it was ordered that the message be spread at large upon the

        <p>Mr WINTER: I think the Constitution does not contemplate immediate action upon a veto.
         [Reads.]</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved the Senate take up the consideration of the Governor's veto and
         demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operations the motion was agreed to
         by yeas 21, nays 20</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE believed the objections of the Governor would have weight with the Senate, and
         the proper way to treat the message is to refer the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName>, and he made that motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD insisted the previous question goes to the question "shall the bill pass the
         objections of the Governor to the contrary?"</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCullough in the chair) decided that the operation of the
         previous question had been exhausted.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jenning. objected to the bill being referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName>. We can do an honorable service by sustaining the message. Every
         laboring man against whom this bill is directed, would praise the Governor for his glorious
         action. It is the most odious bill that has been introduced in the Senate. I demand the
         previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate, and under its operation the notion to refer was
         rejected by yeas 16, nays 26.</p>
        <p>The Senate sustained the vote of the Governor by yeas 6, nays 35.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL of Hendricks, when his name was called, said: I voted for this bill
         believing that in a certain emergency it would do great service in preserving the peace. I
         understood that the bill had been prepared by those competent and interested in the
         measure, and had no reason to doubt its constitutionality. I gave little attention to the
         details; the main provision of the bill was all I had in mind I am constrained to believe
         and do believe that the Governor's objections are valid, and that certain parts of the bill
         are unconstitutional. While I voted to refer the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName>, I am not prepared to vote for the bill. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, in explanation ot his vote, said: I was in favor of the
         passage of this bill, but, believing the objections of the Governor valid I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr MARSHALL: I voted for the bill, believing it to be a just one and believing that the
         people of the State desired that the militia of our State should stand alone side of the
         militia of Ohio and Illinois. I suppose, however, the Governor has examined the
         constitutionality of the bill very closely, and should be <choice>
          <corr>competent</corr>
          <sic>compitent</sic>
         </choice> to judge. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The Democratic Senators on this floor, who were the especial champions of
         the bill, seem to abandon it in its time of need. I do not know whether it is a
         constitutional measure or not, but as I give a great deal of weight to the opinions of the
         Governor, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD when his name was called, said: I am still in favor of a good militia, and
         the only reason that I now vote against the passing of the bill over the Governor's veto is
         that I believe the present bill unconstitutional. I vote "no."</p>
        <pb n="312" xml:id="VAA8558-22-312"/>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: The bill is a very lengthy one, and there was no discussion of its provisions
         in detail. I think the Governor's objections are well taken, and as we have no right to
         pass an unconstitutional law, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I voted for this bill on its passage, and should a proper militia bill be
         brought up, I should vote for it. The arguments of the Governor are insuperable, and I feel
         it is my duty to vote against the bill. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the Senate refused to pass the bill over the objections of the Governor.</p>

        <p>Mr. HELMS called up Mr. Pendleton's bill [H. R. 361] to allow John Martin a claim of
         $55,616.68 for brick work done on the Asylum for the Insane.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS opposed the claim. He did not believe that the State owed the money to
         Martin. There is no testimony to show that this claim is a just one. It has been said here
         that the reason that this should be paid was that a warrant had once been drawn for it.
         This warrant was issued under Governor Williams. John Martin's first claim was not for
         $45,000 but $10,000. He first presented his claim for $10,000, which was refused; he then
         secured a warrant by a mandate. A compromise was finally made between Governor Porter and
         Mr. Martin, and the suit was dismissed. This claim has been before the <choice>
          <sic>Generrl</sic>
          <corr>General</corr>
         </choice> Assembly several times, and has never yet been reported upon favorably. His first
         claim was $10,000, but since the death of Architect May he puts it at a much higher figure.
         A peculiar thing in the history of the claim is that two-years ago, Governor Porter
         delivering his message in this House recommended this claim, apparently reading from his
         manuscript, but when this message was printed that part was omitted from print, and it was
         never printed, though once ordered. After that claim was defeated, and when the specific
         Appropriation bill was on its passage, an attempt was made to insert this claim in it, but
         this was defeated. The same thing was tried in the Senate. My judgment is that if this
         claim for extra work is correct it would have so been decided long ago. It is shown that
         Martin had many contracts on hand, and was compelled to borrow money. Had his claim been
         just he would have secured the money due him at once, and not slept under it.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I hope the time will soon come when there will be other means of a man
         securing claims against the State than here. If a man has a claim he must give it
         attention, and thus he brings down on his head the criticism of a lobbyist. I was a member
         of the sub committee to examine witnesses relative to this claim, and after an impartial
         and thorough investigation I must say that I believe that the claim is just. Long before
         Governor Porter became a member of this Insane Hospital Board, the members of it then
         favored it. It is a strange thing to me that a single voice in this Legislature should be
         raised against the payment of an honest debt. It is the truth that, Martin's first claim
         was $76,000, but it has been cut down to $46 000. John Martin had a contract in writing,
         signed by Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks and other members of the Insane Hospital Board. It is no
         imaginary bill, but is for work actually done.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I occupy an opposite position on this from what I did two years ago. The
         gentleman from Knox (Mr. Williams) has referred to me. It was said to me this morning that
         if I would withdraw my amendments to the May claim that the gentleman from Knox would not
         speak against this claim.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: And it was said to me this morning that if I would withdraw my opposition
         to the Martin claim the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) would not oppose the May
         claim.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: This is not the question under discussion. Honors are even. The gentleman
         from Putnam will proceed.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: The reason why I opposed <pb n="313" xml:id="VAA8558-22-313"/> this claim two
         years ago was because I understood the contract was changed. The committee found that there
         had been an authorized measurement of that contract The committee believes that the claim
         is just. The contract was squarely made, and the bill should be paid.</p>
        <p>Mr PATTEN: I have been entertained by the learned gentleman from Putnam (Mr Gordon) We
         have been traveling along together for some time, but we have come too a parting place in
         the road. I do not believe that this claim is just - I believe like the gentleman from
         Putnam did two years ago. This investigation did not go far enough back into the records as
         I hoped that it would. They have not examined it upon the merits of the case. This contract
         is not, as claimed, a sufficient guaranty of the claim. You see this is written in a bold
         hand, and afterward interlined with a fine hand I do not believe that the Provincial Board,
         when this contract was signed, knew anything of these changes. They say these changes were
         made by Edwin May - but they never made that claim until he was dead and gone He was always
         opposed to this</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: If I thought that the State owed John Martin one cent I would vote
         cheerfully for this claim But I do not believe that the State owes him a cent The friends
         of the claim say that Governor Porter and others think the claim is just. Suppose they do.
         Does that make it so? If it is such an upright and honest claim, why did not Governor
         Porter, when he was in office, take steps to have it paid?</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I have no apology to offer for voting for this claim. Two years ago I made a
         thorough examination of this and found it to be what I believe a just claim. Because the
         claim is old is no proof against it It was squarely agreed by the State that if the suits
         against the State were dismissed the claims would be paid Where did the authori y come from
         that Governor Williams said the State did not owe this?</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: John W Graham told me that he heard Governor Williams say it</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: So it is all hearsay testimony? Are you going to rely on that? Are you going
         home to your constituents with that sort of evidence? Even the gentlemen opposed to this
         claim say that John Martin is an honest man. If he is an honest man, then be would not file
         a claim that is not correct. It has been said that the claim grows larger with time. I defy
         any one to show where it has grown beyond the original $46,000. We agreed to pay this if
         the suit was dismissed. Are we to turn our backs upon that? The claim is due and the
         service baa been rendered.</p>
        <p>Mr ROBINSON believed the claim unjust and that it should not be allowed. He demanded the
         previous question.</p>
        <p>The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the bill failed to pass - yeas,
         47; nays, 39.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE, explaining his vote, said: Two years ago two committees gave this thorough
         examination, and I was familiar with the testimony; because two able attorneys were
         employed to assist the Attorney General regarding these claims, and they, upon
         investigation, recommended withdrawing the suit on the ground that the claim was just, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr BARGES: I, being Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>, examined many
         witnesses upon this case, and among them was Mr. Adolph Shearer, the Supervising Architect
         of the State at present, who stated on oath before my committee that he made the
         measurement of the work in accordance with the rules of measurement by master builders of
         this city, which were the same as were set forth in the contract between Mr. Martin and the
         State, and there was, according to said measurement, due John Martin $46,736.45. I put the
         question to him, "Are you certain the measurement was in accord with the letter and spirit
         of the contract?" and the reply was, "I am positive that it was." I therefore vote in favor
         of the claim. I vote "aye "</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: Two years ago I made a thorough study of the claim, and believed it honest. I
         have learned nothing to change my mind, so I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: Believing in the honesty of Governor Williams, John Fishback and others, who
         concluded the claim was unjust, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I believe that Indiana should pay its honest debts. I am slow to support
         schemes of appropriating money, but believing this bill a just debt, viewing from every
         light, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON: Being a member of the <orgName>Claims Committee</orgName>, my investigation
         leads me to oppose the measure. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: For the reason that have heard no testimony justifying the claim, I vote
         "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: From what I can learn, taking the best testimony, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr KELLISON: As one of a hundred jurymen I have heard no conclusive testimony one way or
         the other which merits conviction of the mind. All the testimony is from hearsay and
         fearing that to vote for it, on the meager testimony, I might regret it, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I have given the bill considerable testimony and do not believe the claim is
         equitable. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: Believing that the measure is non partisan, and believing in the rule laid down
         by Mr. Browning that the claim, like Burboun, grows better with age I think it good enough
         to vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: As I do not know enough about it, and have been unable to learn, I would
         like to be counted among the absentees.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman must vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: Then I vote "no."</p>
        <pb n="314" xml:id="VAA8558-22-314"/>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The difference lies in the written and the unwritten rules as
         to the measurement. As the printed rules were adopted, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: For the reason that it is a plain contract I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I have never believed it just and do not now, therefore I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I voted for it two years ago under a misapprehension, and now I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the bill failed to pass.</p>

        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend the bill [S 178] allowing Mrs. Sarah May $10,000 for architect
         services by her late husband, the late Edwin, making the sum $4 000. He said he was not
         sure but $4 000 was too much.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: After the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) has secured testimony which
         says the just claim is $12,000, it looks bad for him to come up here and propose such an
         amendment.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr WILLIAMS the motion to amend was laid on the table - yeas, 57; nays,
         33.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD, explaining his vote, said: I am not in favor of giving even the $4,000,
         therefore I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend so as to divide the sum among the heirs. He said. The gentleman
         from Knox (Mr Williams) has stated that all the members of the State House Commission had
         stated the money was owing. The testimony shows the contrary. This testimony shows that the
         State House Commissioners paid Mr. May $5,500 more than due him. The State doesn't owe
         Edwin May, Mrs. May or any of the May heirs a cent, but if the money is to be paid, let it
         be given to the proper persons. It has been stated here that the May broker had assigned
         all their claims to Mrs. May. I have here a letter from E. F. May, who denies this I desire
         to have it read as a part of my remarks</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: If the gentleman will vouch for its genuineness he may have it read.</p>
        <p>Mr GORDON: I can not do that, of course.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: Then the letter can not be read.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: It the gentleman will allow me a suggestion, I will say that I have seen a
         letter from two of the May heirs substantiating the assignment of the claims to Mrs. May,
         and their signatures by a gentleman who, I believe - Mr. Herrod.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: General Morrs and General Nelson both declare that they believe that Edwin
         May was fully paid.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I think this procedure is unfair at this very late day - for the reason
         that it is too late to be sent back to other end of the Capitol. So far as claims against
         Indiana are concerned, this is the only tribunal for claimants against the State</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Do you on your honor as a lawyer, say that the whole claim should be paid
         alone to Mrs. May?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I do, because I have here a communication to the Senate from the May heirs
         assigning their claims to Mrs. May.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL moved to amend that the money be paid to the administrator of the May
         estate</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr DITTEMORE the amendment was laid upon the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING moved to amend that the allowance be $6,000 instead of $10,000.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr HARRELL, the amendment was laid on the table - yeas, 54; 30.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING moved to strike out the enacting clause: I don't believe that a dollar of
         the claim is just; and I want to bring this thing to a direct vote. We should not dally
         with it longer. We can not afford to give Mrs. May $10,000, or $6 000, any more than we can
         make such a present to any other needy woman.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: While the State House Commissioners say in a general way that nothing is due,
         yet take up their statements page by page, item by item, and you will find that they
         declare that the money should be paid to Mrs. May.</p>
        <p><choice>
          <sic>Tho</sic>
          <corr>The</corr>
         </choice> first thing a lawyer would ask a witness on this point would be: "Is the claim
         just?" Then there would be general questioning to show if the answer "yes" or "no" to this
         question were correct. Edwin May did the work, and his good wife stood by his like a
         ministering angel, and his two children come in with a recognition of her and say, "Give
         the claim to mother." The Senate Committee said it should be paid; as did the Senate, and,
         coming to the House, a <pb n="315" xml:id="VAA8558-22-315"/> special committee of enemies
         find no positive proof against it</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. McMULLEN the motion to strike out the enacting clause was laid on the
         table.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, asked to be passed until the end of the
         roll-call.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The rules say that a member shall vote when called.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I would like to ask the Speaker why I am thus singled out.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman is not singled out and is out of order. How does he vote?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Will the Speaker say why I am singled out.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman must vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I am ready and vote "aye;" but I want to know why the Speaker singles me out
         for this rule.</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN, explaining his vote, said as a doubt existed in his mind as to the justice of
         the claim, he would give the State the benefit of the doubt and vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion was laid on the table.</p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. BRYANT the resolution [H. R. 13 - see page 222] proposing an amendment
         to the Constitution increasing the regular term of the General Assembly from sixty to 100
         days, and the extra from forty to fifty days, was taken up. Amendments were offered to
         substitute a fixed salary for members in place of per diem.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to pay members $300, payable quarterly.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend the amendment by making it $500. He said: I believe the salary
         should be commensurate with the length of the session The State of New York pays her
         representatives $1,500 Every time that a fee and salary bill bill is attempted to be passed
         we find protests against it. I state that the average salary of the four principal offices
         in every county in the State is not less <choice>
          <corr>than</corr>
          <sic>thon</sic>
         </choice> $3,000, and yet these gentlemen have the opportunity of engaging in various kinds
         of business, and they always say it is little enough. Here once in two years gentlemen have
         to come to this city, practically abandoning their business, and devote their time to the
         State for the paltry sum of $6 a day. This is a constitutional amendment, and will go to
         the people and they can have the opportunity of saying whether it is too much or too
         little.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I don't think a man ought to become a member of the Legislature for the
         purpose of making money. In the English Parliament there is no money paid the members.
         There ought to be enough paid to the members to pay expenses and enable a poor man to come
         to the Legislature just as well as a rich man. I think that $300 will be sufficient to pay
         the probable expenses of any man who chooses to live with reasonable economy. We ought not
         to exclude a poor, deserving man from the Legislature on account of the expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: To pay legislators the pitiable sum of $300 would serve to procure the
         cheapest class of legislators Men would come here with no experience Men of experience
         could not afford to leave their business and come here to legislate. Every other State pays
         their legislators differently. I think that resolution ought to fix the salary at $1,000 or
         $1,500 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I generally stand opposed to all amendments to the Constitution. I think
         that sixty days is a sufficient time for us to legislate in behalf of the interests of the
         State, if, after we come up here, we attend to our business and accomplish it in the
         shortest time. My first experience in the Legislature was under the old Constitution, when
         the Democratic party came in under retrenchment and reform. By a joint resolution at that
         time we limited ourselves to six weeks of legislation, and we accomplished as much as we do
         now. At that time we received only $3 a day.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON of Tippecanoe: I think it would be proper to make the compensation $600 for
         the two years, payable at the time of the Legislature. It would enable the legislators to
         pay for their expenditures while here.</p>
        <p>The amendment to the amendment was rejected by yeas 19 nays 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE, in explanation of his vote said: I am opposed to the amendment and <pb n="317"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-317"/> resolution. There would be no occasion for the extension of the
         time to legislate any longer than sixty days if the members attended to their duty. The
         people will never vote to keep the Legislature in session 100 days, and then have them
         called fifty days longer. If the time spent on the Apportionment bill had been spent on the
         Appropriation bill and the Knightstown bill, we might be ready to go home. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>M. McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to amending the Constitution. But if we are compelled to sit
         100 days and then be called to sit fifty days more, I think $500 is about right.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I am opposed to the amendments and resolution. The people will vote this
         resolution down. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr RAHM: I am in favor of the constitutional amendment lengthening the session to 100
         days. I was a member of the session of 1881 end we sat 101 days and then did not get
         through with the business I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I am in favor of the resolution and amendments. Senators say all necessary
         legislation may be passed in sixty days but it has not been done. I believe the passage of
         the resolution will save the people of the State more money than the entire expense
         incurred by it. The matters will be more fully considered, and it will not be necessary to
         hurry through immature bills. I believe that the people will ratify these amendments and
         adopt them. I think everybody believes that the time is too short. I know from experience
         that the salary received will not pay the expenses of the members of the Legislature. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I intend to vote for this amendment because I think that $500 is small
         enough even if this resolution is adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Since 1852 the population of the State has more than doubled and the
         business of the State has more than multiplied ten times. We enacted the Constitution of
         1852 for a comparatively pioneer people. We now find ourselves toward the close of the
         nineteenth century with diversified industries, sitting only sixty days in two years. Other
         Legislatures sit three, four, five and six months. From 1861 to the present time no General
         Assembly has a General Appropriation bill in sixty days. It is false economy to continue in
         session only sixty days. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>An ineffectual motion was made to lay the amendment (Mr. Winter's) on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, moved to amend the amendment by inserting $400 for $300,
         payable annually. He said: There is a certain amount of gush that causes some men desire to
         work without a sufficient compensation. There is not a Senator upon this floor who has any
         valuable business but what absolutely loses money in the neglect of his business.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 222, see pp. 229, 251, 300] to abolish the office of Ditch Commissioner,
         a special order coming up -</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr, McCULLOUGH, the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole (Mr
         McCullough in the chair) for the consideration of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved that the committee rise, as it is too late in the
         session to take final action on this bill, and recommend to the Senate that it lie on the
         table.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to lay that motion on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr YOUOHE: No statute needs action more urgently than the drainage law, but it is too
         late in the session now, and since this needs careful attention, I think we had better
         postpone it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: With some amendments to the old law, we would have a suitable law in regard to
         drainage. In our county the old law has operated beneficially. I want to know how we can
         intelligently act upon this long bill before the close of this session of the Legislature.
         I favor the motion of the Senator from Hendricks.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERLS: There is no radical change in the law proposed by this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: It would be a radical change in the law to allow the majority
         to control the ditching. The minority might be drowned out at any time. I think the result
         would be that the majority might defeat a good object. I doubt very much whether any
         Senator has read the bill through.</p>
        <p>Mr BROWN: I think that the majority of the people affected demand a change in the
         obnoxious ditch law.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The law is iniquitous as it stands, but shall we pass this measure and let
         it go back to the House amended in a hurried way, or shall we lay it on the table and take
         it up at a special session? The absolute necessity of an appropriation bill has been shown
         during the past two years, and we will have to have an extra session.</p>
        <pb n="318" xml:id="VAA8558-22-318"/>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I am not in favor of going home without giving the people relief in this
         matter. I will vote to lay it on the table, and will insist on taking it up at some other
         time when a better opportunity for careful consideration shall offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill has been before the House Committee for weeks, and it now comes
         to the Senate proposing but a few amendments to the present law; and if the Senate can take
         the responsibility of establishing a just law it will meet the approbation of the House. I
         think we can safely pass upon this bill as it comes from the House, and with the Senate
         amendments proposed it will be acceptable to the House</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It is immaterial when this bill is considered. It is astonishing to see
         how this measure is pushed upon the Senate. My people are afraid we will change a good law.
         If it is forced upon us I want to be heard at length upon the question.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLARD the committee rose, reported progress, and asked and obtained
         leave to sit at 2 o'clock.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <head rend="center">A GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to suspend the regular order of business to enable him to introduce a
         general Appropriation bill. He said: As yet the appropriation bill has not been taken up in
         the House I think we ought to do the best we can to have the Appropriation bill passed I
         should dislike to have a collision between the two branches, but unless something is done
         the bill will not pass and we will have to have a special session I believe the blame ought
         to rest where it belongs</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: By passing on this bill we would do so without knowing whether it is
         economical or not. We would have to rush the bill through in order to get it to the House
         in time. I believe the passage of the Appropriation bill would not avoid the necessity of
         an extra <choice>
          <sic>sesion</sic>
          <corr>session</corr>
         </choice>. Would the House act on the bill after we sent it to them? I trust the order of
         business as agreed upon this morning will not be changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: It seems to me that the manner this bill has been treated by members of the
         House would relieve us from any scruples we may have upon the subject of considering the
         bill before they do. I do not believe in dictating to them, but I do not believe in their
         dictating to us. We have the plain constitutional right to consider and pass the
         Appropriation bill. I hope the motion will prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: There was under consideration, when the Senate adjourned, a bill of
         great importance, and I hope this motion will not prevail.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 21, nays 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't understand that there is any
         politics in this matter. The House of Representatives had ample time to prepare and pass an
         appropriation bill, and they did not do so, and it seems to me they are not going to do so;
         therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I desire to explain my vote. There is no man on this floor less desirous of a
         special session than myself, I think, as far as the Senate is concerned, we have done as
         much work as is usually done during a period of sixty days. Not only if the Appropriation
         bill necessary to be passed, but it is absolutely necessary to make a provision for the
         State House fund or work on that building will have to suspend. That bill has been
         introduced and been in the hands of the <orgName>Ways and Means Committee</orgName> for
         several days. If we do not pass the General Appropriation bill and the State House bill I
         can say with certainty that there will be an extra session. I would favor this motion if I
         could see any good results it would produce. But it would not induce the Home to recede
         from its action if we were to pass this bill. They would look upon it as dictation. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I deprecate the idea of a special session, but I feel that the passage of
         this bill would not in any way tend to prevent that. If the taking up and considering this
         bill would secure its passage through both Houses, I would cheerfully vote for it, but it
         is utterly impossible for us to properly pass through this House a general appropriation
         bill. We ought to have more time than one day to pass it, and we do not and could not
         expect the House to pass it this session. If there must be a special session on account of
         the failure of an appropriation bill, this Senate can not void it. And if there is not to
         be a special session, this Senate ought not to pass the balance of this day in a useless
         attempt to pass an appropriation bill. To spend time in considering this bill in order to
         send it to the House would be to spend time uselessly.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I have a word to pay in explanation of my vote. It is a very strange
         proceeding that some Senator should claim this morning lack of time to consider the
         Drainage bill, and say we hadn't time to give that attention and care that should be given
         to a bill like that, and then vote to take up a tedious appropriation bill without having
         it printed. I have not the slightest idea that the House would act upon this bill even if
         we did send it to them. Believing that some Senators desire to get some little "buncombe"
         out of the motion,I will support them in it, and vote "aye" to see how much they can make
         out of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS, when his name was called, said: I believe if we took up this bill and spend
         the afternoon on it, we would but waste that much of the people's time, therefore I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: Believing it a waste of time to suspend the rules I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I believe that <pb n="319" xml:id="VAA8558-22-319"/> even if this
         bill was passed to House it would not accomplish the desired results, but I am willing to
         give it a trial The Revenue bill, which must have its origin in the House of
         Representatives, has not yet been introduced. Also the Knightstown bill must be acted upon.
         If these two bills were passed the Appropriation bill might go where the woodbine twineth.
         I am willing to join anybody to assist in avoiding a special session. I desire to vote for
         any measure that will advance the business of the General Assembly and adjourn it at the
         earliest possible time I took that advanced step weeks ago. and offend to adjourn the
         General Assembly on the 2d day of March. Although I know the Senator can not accomplish any
         good by the introduction of the bill he proposes, yet I intend to vote to give him an <choice>
          <sic>opportuny</sic>
          <corr>opportunity</corr>
         </choice> to try it. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Delaware: I desire to assign a reason for the vote I shall cast as it will
         be against a majority of my political friends on this question I do not consider that the
         introduction of an Appropriation bill here will enable us to pass it. It will simply occupy
         time I am not in favor of establishing the precedent of allowing an Appropriation bill to
         originate in the Senate I do not believe since the organization of the Indiana Legislature
         an Appropriation bill has ever originated in the Senate, and being unwilling to assist in
         establishing a precedent, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion was agreed to and accordingly - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE introduced a bill [S. 347] to make general appropriations to carry on the
         State Government</p>
        <p>[A message announced that the House reused to concur in Senate amendment to the bill [H.
         R 400] authorizing colleges and universities to hold real estate, and thereupon, on motion
         of Mr. Day, the Lieutenant Governor appointed Messrs Day and Davis as a committee on the
         part of the Senate]</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. MAGEE the Senate resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole [Mr.
         Magee in the chair] to consider the Appropriation bill. [S 347]</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD moved to postpone the consideration of the Appropriation bill until Monday
         morning at 10 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am in favor of this motion. The truth is this bill is introduced in the
         Senate for the purpose of a little cheap notoriety - a little buncombe. We have carried the
         Senator along far enough with this Appropriation bill; now we ought to sit down upon it and
         go to business.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD the committee rose and the Chairman reported to the Senate the
         recommendation of the Committee of the Whole that the further consideration of the bill S.
         347 be postponed till Monday at 10 o'clock.</p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. SMITH, of Jay, the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole
         for the consideration of the bill [H. R. 222 - see pages 251, 300] the Senate had under
         consideration before the recess for dinner, the question being on the motion of Mr.
         Campbell, of Hendricks, that the committee rise, report progress, and recommend that the
         bill lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr YOUCHE: This has been called a Surveyor's bill, and I believe it is a Surveyor's bill.
         In order to amend the bill it will have to be materially changed</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I know of no case of hardship that amounted to a real hardship
         There is no reason why courts can not enforce the present law with right amendments and
         harm no one We are in great danger of doing injustice to many by hasty action on this last
         day of the session in the afternoon. Therefore, I think the consideration of this bill
         ought to be postponed</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I hope the motion will not prevail. Nearly all this bill is a copy of the
         old law - the amendments proposed are few and easily understood.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: This bill remodels this subject. It will change the method of commissioners,
         of remonstrances and the form of trial and the number of commissioners. It would be wrong
         to place in the hands of a jury decisions on points of facts.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I shall have to vote for laying this bill on the table. If I
         believed this was the last day I would vote to take up this bill. The people of my county
         desire some few amendments to the drainage law. The law that we now have has done so much
         good work that I am afraid to go <choice>

        <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>Pending the reading of the bill - </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SELLERS the Committee rose, reported progress, and asked and obtained

        <p>Mr. DAY, from the <orgName>Committee of Free Conference</orgName> on the bill [H. R. 400]
         to allow universities to hold real estate to the value of $500 000, submitted a report.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: If this law is passed there is no power granted that they have not now.</p>
        <p>A motion to concur in the report of the committee was rejected by yeas 18, nays 18.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I do hope the report will not be concurred in. The power <pb
          n="320" xml:id="VAA8558-22-320"/> to receive and invest real estate is too gigantic a
         power to grant to any corporation. Colleges can and should receive endowments in lands and
         money. Under this bill, when an institution acquires real estate, it acquires it forever,
         or until it dies. If we are to grant such powers to institutions it will not be long before
         the landlord system will be inaugurated. I can look far enough in the future when the
         people will recognize the true value of the votes against the bill. The peoples' rights are
         subservient to the railroad corporations in the West, and we would be proposing to create
         such a monopoly by the passage of such bills. It is proposed by this bill to create a
         monopoly as dangerous as monopolies created by acts of Congress whereby railroad
         corporations have taken possession of millions of acres of the best land ever given freemen
         to live upon. I appeal to Senators to let this bill go awhile, at least, and let us reason
         together and see if we can't agree upon something that will benefit the college and benefit
         the people of Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: This bill proposes to create a real estate monopoly among universities. If
         the bill provided for the university to acquire real estate only by devise no one would
         support it more heartily than myself. But it proposes to create a real estate monopoly
         among the universities of the State I agree with the statement that it is a vicious
         measure.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This bill creates no gigantic monopoly. It does not grant the land tn the
         universities forever. It allows them to hold real estate for only twenty years. If any
         future universities are organized for the purpose of making money, the power rests with the
         Legislature to restrain them. I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand being seconded by the Senate, under its operation the report of the

        <head rend="center">APAELLATE COURT.</head>
        <p>The House proceeded to consider the bill [S 45 - see pp. 195, 257, 275] to create
         Appellate Courts</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I desire to say something on the amendment. The bill provides that the
         Governor shall appoint three Judges from each of the three circuits of the State, and that
         one of the Judges of each circuit shall be of opposite politics from the other two. The
         pending amendment is to strike out that one provision. The amendment says we shall not
         dictate to the Governor. When the Republicans were in power they never thought of giving a
         Democrat an office, but now that they are going out they propose to divide the offices with
         us. If the Republican party was in power now it would not make such a provision for
         Governor Porter. They never did it. They did not in twenty years put a Democrat on the
         Supreme Bench of the United States. Then why should we favor them?</p>
        <p>In regard to the Board of Commissioners for building the Asylums for the Insane, some
         Democrats were put on, but that was done in order to carry it through the Legislature. Why
         should we dictate to Governor Gray in this matter? Are there Democrats or Republicans
         afraid to trust him? I am not in favor of the Governor making the appointment at all, but I
         have confidence that if he does it, he will do it right. The Democratic party is pledged to
         civil service reform - reforming the Republicans out and reforming the Democrats in Turn
         out the Republican dudes - clean out the Augean stable. The time has come for Democrats -
         they have walked through the wilderness for twenty-five years. If we are to divide the
         judges our Greenback friends should have a chance. They are far better than Republicans.
         Even the St John party might be remembered.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER (calling Mr French to the Chair) took the floor and said: This bill provides
         that the Governor shall appoint one Judge of opposite party - not that he shall appoint
         Democrat, Republican or any party man When it comes to the election of these Judges then
         the question of party in this bill has nothing to do with it In practice I am a Democrat,
         but here we are creating new offices and who says that if an election were to be held
         to-day that all of the nine would be chosen from the Democratic party? People often break
         from the party shackles. They did so when Thomas A. Hendricks was elected over Thomas M.
         Browne, when the remainder of the Republican ticket was chosen. So in the case of Milton B.
         Hopkins. The Supreme Court consists of four Democrats and one Republican. The proposed
         Appellate Court would make legislation cheaper, safer and speedier, and its provisions were
         eminently judicious and proper. He allowed no man to surpass himself in fidelity to his
         party, but he did not believe in carrying partisanship to the bench. The Democrats could
         not afford to say that the Republicans, with a vote of 240,000 in the State, should not
         have a representative in such a court. He was glad to <pb n="321" xml:id="VAA8558-22-321"/>
         know that in the present Supreme Court the opposite political party was represented, and,
         Democrat as I am, I say that as a jurist, an honorable gentleman and an impartial Judge no
         one stands higher than the Republican member (Byron K. Elliott). These offices are not
         political. To give the Republicans one-third the representation is fair enough, with nearly
         as many voters in the State as there are Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I believe that the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) aims to
         kill this bill by his amendment. When he charges the Republicans with always throwing away
         everything else for party's sake he makes a statement that is false in all particulars. The
         gentleman from Hancock is a political flea - when you put your finger on him he isn't
         there. Whenever, by political trickery or machinations, you make your courts partisan, that
         act is certain to be rebuked. I never asked, in voting for a Circuit Judge, about his
         politics. When I do I hope my constituents will keep me at home.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I favor the amendment for the reason that the bill is a direct insinuation
         against Governor Gray. I do not favor the amendment as Mr. Gooding does - for party
         reasons. The bill itself makes the Court partisan. It is a direct insult to the Governor. I
         favor civil service reform - not to turn competent Republicans out of office, but I do not
         favor putting more Republicans in. I do not see that we have use for this court anyway.
         Another thing against the bill is that men are leaving high places to lobby for it.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. McMULLEN, the amendment was laid on the table - yeas, 65, nays, 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON (explaining his vote) said: Believing that the courts should be kept
         non-partisan, and believing that Governor Gray or any other Governor would appoint one man
         of opposite politics, but to relieve Governor Gray of the weight of partisanship, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY (when his name was called) said: Believing that the Democrats should have a
         spirit of fairness, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: My understanding of civil service reform is that civil Republicans should go
         out and civil Democrats go in, but as I think courts should be non-political, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr PATTEN: The inducement to allow the Governor to appoint whom he chooses compels me to
         vote "no," and for the farther reason that there are enough good Democrats for the
         Judgeships.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: It a layman may be allowed to be speak on a question touching the State
         judiciary, I will say that, out of all deference to the gentleman from Hancock, I am not in
         favor of this amendment. I am willing to accept the bill just as it came from the Senate. I
         believe the nearer we can come making this Appellate Court as proposed to be formed,
         non-partisan, the better it will be. When our higher State Courts are composed in part of
         men from different political parties, the people generally have) more confidence in the
         decision of such courts. I think the people of the State favor the bill as it now is. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered to the third reading.</p>

        <head rend="center">SARAH MAY'S CLAIM.</head>
        <p>On the call for bills on the third reading, Mr. FISHER called up the bill [S. 178] for
         the relief of Mrs. Sarah May.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I think it proper and right that this money, if paid, should be paid to
         Mrs. May. Every man wants to vote on this case according to the evidence. You have called
         the witnesses, and had their evidence. Are you now going to throw off their testimony? We
         asked these witnesses what the State owed this for, and they said for the two extra plans
         Mr. May prepared and the percentage of the cost. The plans were to be the property of the
         State, and the State has them and has not paid for them.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: We made a contract with May that he was to make over to the State all his
         plans, and his price was paid. It was a square and fair contract. There is not a court or a
         jury in Christendom that would allow one nickel in this case.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by the House, and
         under its operations the bill passed - yeas, 53; nays 42</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNES, explaining his vote, said that if the money were paid it should go to the
         estate so that it might pay debts, and as it did not, he voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Believing that not a dollar of it is due, in view of the sworn statements
         of the State House Commissioners, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND, in explanation of his vote, said: Inasmuch as I find from the sworn
         testimony of General Nelson, one of the State House Commissioners, the following: "Mr. May,
         I think, is equitably entitled to all of $10,000," and inasmuch as I find in the testimony
         of General Nelson and Professor Collett, another State House Commissioner, that the estate
         of Edwin May is entitled to more than $10 000, and that it is a just debt and ought to be
         paid, and for the further reason that I am opposed to repudiation, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: In view of this testimony of the State House Commissioners, which declares Mrs.
         May is entitled to $10,000 or more, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: It is the province of this House to analyze as a jury the testimony of these
         witnesses. We are to take testimony, and not opinion; so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FISHER: I have read the evident carefully, and I believe the estate of Edwin May is
         entitled to the money, and shall vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: No member here has yet claimed this money is due under the contract, but that
         the money is equitably due. He who has equity must perform equity. If this money is given,
         it should be given to the children - or their share of it. To give it to her alone would be
         an inequity; therefore I vote against it "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I was not at first certain on this; but after an examination of the law, I
         came to the conclusion that if the money is paid it should be paid to the estate, that
         creditors might receive their due from it. If this money is paid to Mrs. May, it will not
         bar the creditors from filing claims against the State. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: On the principle that it is better that ninety-nine guilty men should escape
         than one innocent man should suffer; and although there may be no legal right to pay this
         claim, yet it does seem there if some claim in equity that it should be paid, and giving
         Mrs. May the benefit of the doubt, and believing it is better that the State should suffer
         rather than a widow be wronged, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: For the reason that I this claim careful attention and investigation two years
         ago and voted for it, and as I have seen or heard nothing during the investigation of the
         claim this session to change my mind, therefore, believing that this is a just claim and
         ought to be paid, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: To give Mrs. May the benefit of the doubt, her husband being gone the way of
         all flesh, and not able to appear for himself, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: Because I believe, that May was paid all due him, because I think Indiana
         should be just to the taxpayers rather than charitable to a woman, who, is said, stood as
         "a ministering angel" beside her husband's death bed: because the money must come from
         taxes of the laboring man and of the women who toil at the wash- <pb n="323"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-323"/> board, and because it is a glaring attempt to rob the State
         Treasury, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: One infamy follows another on the floor of this House. The people's money is
         appropriated too lavishly. First $55,000, then another, and here, on a technical claim, it
         is proposed to give away $10,000. On what ground is it to be paid? Who says that it is
         legal? If this claim is passed I shall, if ever I have opportunity, offer a resolution that
         the State House Commissioners pay every claim from their fund and not come in here and say:
         "Well, it isn't exactly due, but pay it for equity." If allowed it would be allowed to the
         estate. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Mr. Hendricks, attorney for Mrs. May, and Mrs. May herself claimed, as I
         heard myself, before a committee, that the only ground for the claim was that the State
         gained by the death of Edwin May; that by the ceasing of his plans money was saved. If the
         money is due it is due to the estate. This plea of equity is weak. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: For the reason that this claim has heretofore appeared before the Assembly and
         has been passed upon; because it has come before this session and has been carefully
         examined by a committee, who examined witnesses under oath, who testified that the lady is
         entitled to the claim; for the reason that the testimony of Professor Collett, who has been
         known from childhood as one of the most honest of our State's citizens, favors the bill;
         for the reason that I believe my constituents will bear me out in my action. I cast my vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: As the testimony shows that there is not a dollar due, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I yesterday thought that $6,000 was due, and I thought the other $4,000 was a
         gratuity. Yesterday we gave a man $55,000, which might be a steal. He was a man, and able
         to be here in his own behalf with a cloud of witnesses. My gallantry to a woman says that I
         shall stand by a woman. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: Because I think it should be paid to the estate I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I wish to explain my vote. Each person with knowledge of the facts who
         testified on this question says this claim is just, due and unpaid. The public records of
         Marion County show that the creditors of Edwin May have been paid, and the administrator
         discharged. The statement of the children of Edwin May is on file in the State Senate,
         showing that they desire the money paid to the widow. The Legislature two years ago [See
         Acts of 1883, page 211] allowed the claim. It is a just claim, and Mrs. May is the proper
         person to whom it should be paid. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>So the bill passed on the vote given above.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">THE COLOR LINE.</head>
        <p>On the regular order of reading bills the third time, Mr. Gooding called up the bill [S.
         43 - see page 173] regarding civil rights of citizens.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: The purport of this bill is that all persons shall enjoy the accommodations
         of public places - not private families. It is a complete civil rights bill, but does not
         change the law preventing intermarriage. It gives a person refused public accommodations on
         account of color the right to sue, or if they do not sue, the man thus discriminating may
         be prosecuted under the criminal laws. It seems that the colored man has his rights, but
         they feel that they are discriminated against. It will be policy to pass it.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: The gentleman says it is policy. Is it not justice?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Right is always policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Not always.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 81, nays 0.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY, in explaining his vote, said: I was reared to think that to give this right
         would be to send the country to the devil; but I left that opinion behind when I crossed
         the Ohio. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Wanting to give to the colored man what a Republican Supreme Court denied
         them, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Because this act is abreast of the spirit of the age, and
         because the author of this bill was once one of the grand Republican party, and in it was
         baptized into these great principles, and because the gentleman (Gooding) who championed it
         on this floor for a little while, went in and out within, and spoke lovingly of Lincoln and
         his great confreres, and in memory of the two companies of the Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth
         Regiments of Volunteers, who could not under the Democratic laws of Indiana enlist, were
         compelled to seek their country's service in another State, and went down in the terrible
         charge at Fort Wagner, where the storm and smoke and fire became their beacon and glory
         flame, and because it seems that our Democratic friends are joining in a millennium shout,
         and feeling that at the close of the roll call we should teach our opponents the grand
         strains of the doxology: "Praise God from Whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all creatures
         here below," etc.; therefore, Mr. Speaker, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I hope Democrats will remember that.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick, when his name was called, said: As a matter of justice I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I believe in exact justice. I am glad to see the race lines disappear. If
         these people are <choice>
          <sic>competant</sic>
          <corr>competent</corr>

         </choice> to be treated with equality. No class of people would ever have brought itself to
         the free front as this class have done. I hold the sentiment of every honest Democrat that
         all should be equal in the eyes of the law. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWSEND: I regret, sir, that the public sentiment of this State has been, and is
         still so perverted, that it became necessary <pb n="324" xml:id="VAA8558-22-324"/> for the
         General Assembly to step in and protect a docile, tractable and inoffensive class of
         citizens from outrages, purposely and maliciously practiced upon them by the prejudiced and
         the vile of every community. I repeat, that it is a sad comment upon the State of Indiana,
         in the light of the advanced civilization of the age in which we live, that the passage of
         such a law is made necessary; and because it is necessary, I therefore urge its passage,
         that citizens may be protected in the commonest rights guaranteed, not only by the
         Constitution, but by every consideration of equity and justice. The right of life, liberty
         and the pursuit of happiness are inalienable, and hence should be enjoyed alike by all on
         the same terms.</p>
        <p>The fact is, sir, that these infamous proscriptions stand at the gateway of every avenue
         to intercept the the colored man, and to prevent his entrance. What has the negro done that
         he should be thus treated? He is not an incubus on society. Colored people do not augment
         your pauper element. They are in the main law abiding. They are purely American. They
         accept at once your civilization, your education, and your Christianity. Your tastes,
         habits and customs are ours. Physiologically we are the same, the degrees of development
         only show a distinction; with equal chances we are equal. As citizens, we have ever been
         true and loyal to the flag of our country. No negro has ever committed treason in this
         land; 180,000 colored soldiers fought the battles of this country in the late war, upon 252
         fields of carnage and death. We fought to defend the honor of a flag and the perpetuity of
         a Union which never did, and does not now, secure to us protection and liberty. By our
         sweat and muscle and unrequited toil we have opened up and developed the whole southern
         half of this continent, for during all the past we have been the driven sons of toil, the
         "hewers of wood and drawers of water." I vote "no."</p>

        <head rend="center">A VETO MESSAGE.</head>
        <p>The Lietenant Governor laid before the Senate the Governor's veto of the bill [S. 325] to
         authorize the dissolution of the Eastern Agricultural, Mechanical and Trotting Park
         Association.</p>
        <p>The question being, "Shall the bill pass the objections of the Governor to the contrary
         notwithstanding?"</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSREET said: I can't say so much about the Governor's first objection until I hear
         the bill read. I am by no means satisfied, but the second objection is such I might
         respectfully differ with the Governor; that it would be unconstitutional to pass a law
         dissolving a corporation by a majority. I can't see what provision of the Constitution that
         would violate.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: Unless some Senator is prepared to antagonize the opinions of
         the Governor and show he is in error in deciding the bill unconstitutional, I shall vote to
         sustain the veto. It strikes me his objections are <choice>
          <sic>plausable</sic>
          <corr>plausible</corr>
         </choice> at least, and probably sound. The bill proposes to dissolve a particular
         corporation by name, which looks to me just about as much special <pb n="326"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-326"/> legislation as a bill to create a particular corporation by
         name, and hat is just one of the things a provision in the Constitution was intended to
         prohibit. In my present state of mind I shall vote to sustain the veto.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This bill was not discussed, but passed under a suspension of the
         constitutional rules. There is but one way to wind up the affairs of a corporation under
         the laws of Indiana, and that is by the appointment of a Receiver. The courts have decided
         that there must be some reason for she appointment of a Receiver, and as this association
         has ceased to exist there was no apparent reason for the appointment of a <choice>
          <sic>Reveiver</sic>
          <corr>Receiver</corr>
         </choice>. This bill was introduced to authorize it to wind up its affairs, as some persons
         interested desired to have and receive whatever interest they may have in it. Where a
         Legislature has passed a law creating a liability it can afterward pass a law limiting that
         liability or controlling it in any way I think the objections of the Governor are well
         taken. The title of the bill shows it to be special legislation.</p>
        <p>The Governor's veto was sustained by yeas 7, nays 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER (explaining his vote): In my opinion this bill is not unconstitutional.
         Therefore, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Subsequently Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, said: I was one of the majority voting on the
         bill [S. 325] which failed to pass over the Governor's veto a few minutes ago. Since that
         vote has been taken I have learned that the bill has been fairly considered by the
          <orgName>House Judiciary Committee</orgName>, and that eminent lawyers appeared before it
         on both sides If I had known that I should have voted differently. I therefore enter a
         motion to reconsider the vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I rise to a point of order. The veto was sustained, and that is the end of
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL: I understand any vote may be reconsidered if the Senate choose, and the
         motion is made by one voting with the majority. I propose to enter the motion and let it
         stand over.</p>

        <head rend="center">CONVICT LABOR.</head>
        <p>On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, his joint resolution [S. 8 — see page 135] for a
         constitutional amendment to prohibit the hiring of the labor of convicts was read the third
         time. He said: For the last eight or ten years objection has been raised against the
         present way of hiring convicts out to contractors. The manufacturers of our State say their
         interests are jeopardized and endangered by this system. And they have protested against it
         until, finally, both parties thought themselves compelled to put in their State platforms
         that this system of contract labor should be done away with. And now it remains for this
         Assembly to say - both Democrats and Republicans - whether these solemn declarations in
         their State platforms shall be carried out in good faith. State platforms should embody the
         opinions of a majority of the party, and if that party is in power after wards it should
         carry out the spirit of the State platform by its votes in the General Assembly. The two
         parties have gone on record on this question; also Governor Porter in his message to the
         Legislature recommended speedy action in this very matter. The question whether the present
         system is injurious to free labor and to the manufacturing interests need not be discussed;
         it to admitted to be so. The States around Indiana have enacted laws prohibiting this
         system, and I ask the Senate of Indiana to give its endorsement to my resolution proposing
         to abolish the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I am in favor of doing all that can be done to remedy the
         evil effects of convict labor upon the labor of the State, and to do all that can be done
         for our laborers, but there is no call and no need of a constitutional amendment. The
         Legislature has full power now to do anything that it will do on this subject. It can
         regulate or it can abolish, and a constitutional amendment merely proposes to pat off for
         at least three years what we have power now to do. Why not do it at once? Why put it off?
         What excuse for not now meeting the question? I introduced a bill two years ago, which
         passed this Senate but failed to pass for want of time in the House. I have a bill before
         the Senate now to regulate this matter, but it has not yet come up for want of time. The
         special session will give an opportunity to discuss and pass it. I am in favor of doing now
         all that can be done, not dodge for three years and leave it for some one else to do.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't agree with the Senator from St. Joseph. I believe a party haying once
         expressed an opinion in a platform ought to adhere to it. This question of convict labor
         has had the serious consideration of governments. In some of the old countries and in New
         York advanced steps have been taken on this question, and steps should be taken so that in
         two or four years hence Indiana should be prepared to advance in this matter. It would be a
         great deal better to keep those men by taxation than that 1,000 or 2,000 men should be out
         of work because of competition with convict labor. I believe if one of the punishments was
         solitary confinement it would be a deterrent. Is there any Senator who desires to defend
         the present system of convict labor? The prisoner's labor can not be let on a sliding
         scale. There is a ring in the Northern Prison that makes the lowest possible contracts, and
         the result has been to drive out of the cooperage business large numbers of honest and free
         laborers. Legislation should be so wise as to protect all classes of citizens I am for the
         resolution and against a statutory enactment because contractors would be here until they
         obtained such legislation as would suit them.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I will favor a law that would abolish the contract system, believing it wrong
         for prison labor to come in conflict <pb n="327" xml:id="VAA8558-22-327"/> with honest
         labor outside, but will oppose a constitutional amendment on that subject because I believe
         we should pass a law now that will bring about the very thing we desire; and it is not
         necessary to put it off four years in order to get a constitutional <choice>
          <sic>ame dment</sic>
          <corr>amendment</corr>
         </choice> on the subject. A proposition that is demanded by all parties in their platforms
         it is well to scrutinize care fully. This question has agitated the minds of reformers for
         many years. I don't believe in adopting a measure on this subject by Constitutional
         amendment. Let experiments come first and after the best system is found it will be time
         enough to engraft it in the organic law. As this matter is untried, wouldn't it be better
         to pass a law embodying the principles of the resolution, and try the system before fixing
         it in the Constitution? Otherwise, if put in the Constitution we would have cast iron rules
         from which we could not depart without great difficulty. The mass of the people have as
         little knowledge of the workings of the several systems of convict labor as members of the
         Legislature. It is wrong to have free labor interfered with by convict labor, but we should
         not rush headlong into a system we know little of.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: That there is some thing wrong in the present system of our State's Prisons
         I presume but few, if any, will deny. Hence the mass of the people say in the two party
         platforms "this thing is <choice>
          <sic>worng</sic>
          <corr>wrong</corr>
         </choice>." The prisoners are worked for the benefit of rings. If these men knew this
         Legislature were contemplating a change they would be here in numbers, and I would almost
         as soon see demons from Hades, for I have no respect for nine-tenths of them. I am far from
         believing because a man transgresses he is lost forever. The great point is to restrain men
         from crime, and, if that can't be done, to help to reform them. The man who never falls is
         not to be praised, but rather the man who falls and rises again. I trust the people will
         have an opportunity to vote upon this question.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The question as to whether this resolution should be submitted to the
         people has never been agitated. The legislation hinted at in the party platforms could be
         enacted without a constitutional amendment. Whenever any respectable portion of the people
         desire any question submitted to them for a constitutional amendment I will vote for it.
         There is no demand from any quarter that there shall be an amendment to that instrument on
         this question. This resolution is put proposing to dodge the question.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: It is in order to compel the Legislature to take action that
         I desire a constitutional amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Introduce a bill and see if your party will stand up to the plank in its
         platform. The planks do not imply a prohibition of convict labor, but such restrictions as
         the Legislature might think practicable. We have all the power we need. Let the Democrats
         introduce a proper bill and the Republicans will help pass it. We can now do all we desire,
         but put this in the Constitution and our hands are tied. This resolution is putting off
         four years what ought to be done before the close of the special session.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSTFN, of Dearborn, demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate and under its operation the joint resolution failed
         to pass for want of a constitutional majority - yeas, 17; nays, 16 (Mr. Campbell, of
         Hendricks, paired with Mr. Willard.)</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY, explaining his vote, said: I am very much in favor of this proposed
         constitutional amendment. It does not seek to keep convicts in idleness; it simply proposes
         to do away with a system which is bad, detrimental to prisoners and to labor outside of
         prisons. The system has been abolished in New York, Ohio, California and one or two other
         States. This ought to be viewed in this light, if the system is wrong it ought to be
         abolished, not by statute law which may ba repealed by any succeeding Legislature, but it
         ought to be prohibited forever by constitutional amendment. It seems to me this proposition
         ought to be submitted to the people. I am not one who believes the General Assembly ought
         to submit a proposition to the people in order to get their view alone. I believe the
         Constitution contemplates it most pass the scrutiny of our judgment. My judgment is this
         system ought to be abolished; therefore I am consistent in wanting the views of the people
         on this subject. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: Because there is no need of such a constitutional enactment;
         because I believe what ought to be done should be done at once, and because I believe it
         simply dodging to put off three years what should be done now, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Believing the Legislature has every power to provide what is <choice>
          <sic>ncecssary</sic>
          <corr>necessary</corr>
         </choice> in this matter, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: Believing this merely a dodge on the part of the Democratic party to put off
         what it ought to do now, and believing they never will do it until compelled to, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: Believing this is a simple matter for legislative enactment, and not a
         proper matter to be engrafted in the constitutional law, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr ZIMMERMAN: I know of only two propositions which would do away with the competition of
         prison contract labor as against home manufacturers. One is to keep the convicts confined
         without performing any labor and be kept at great expense of the taxpayers of the State.
         The other proposition is the adoption of the French exile system, by transporting our
         convicts to some distant island to be engaged in agricultural pursuits. I find both
         propositions highly impracticable and unprofitable. Our present <pb n="328"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-328"/> system of employing convict labor in our State prisons is
         satisfactory to my consistency. I shall oppose agitation on that question. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>

         with every one of you with the kindest of feeling, and I wish to return you my sincere
         thanks for the courtesy you have shown me on all occasions. And I say further that I
         believe this Senate will compare with any Senate that ever assembled in the State of
         Indiana, as far as intelligence and as far as labor is concerned. Although in some of the
         newspapers over the State it is said that the Legislature has done but little work, I feel
         that it has done a vast amount of labor. I know a number of the standing committees met
         three, four and five times a week, and have been up as late as 12 and 1 o'clock at night to
         do the public business. And for the purpose of making the statement to the Senate I have
         taken the pains to look over what you have done. The Senate has passed, during the
         legislative days, eighty-three bills; you have passed of House bills thirty-seven, and the
         House has passed twelve Senate bills, making forty-nine bills that have become laws during
         this session of the Legislature, or rather forty-seven - taking out the two the Governor
         has vetoed. I feel that no Senate that has met in the last twenty years has done so much
         labor as this Senate has done, and I feel that you owe an apology to nobody, but that you
         are entitled to the gratitude of the State for the business you have accomplished in this
         short space of time. Hoping and expecting to see yon all to-morrow morning in your places
         to renew your labors upon the call of the Governor of the State, if there is no further
         business I will put the motion to adjourn the Senate of this regular session sine die. You
         who favor the motion will signify the same by saying "aye," contrary "no."</p>
        <p>And so - at 4:30 o'clock p. m. - the Senate adjourned sine die.</p>

        <p>Mr. GOODING: The reporters from the Republican press have lost no opportunity to assail
         Democrats on this floor who have felt it their duty to espouse causes which did not agree
         with the ideas of these reporters. They have abused their places and should be expelled
         from the House. They have lost no opportunity to abuse their trusts. If they were worthy of
         notice I should have paid some attention to them. It takes about three of the little
         gentlemen to make one man. am told there is to be a special session; if so I shall, at the

        <p>Mr. BROWNING: Has any Democratic paper defended the member?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I am talking of Republican papers alone, I have an utter contempt for the
         little half bred, half idiotic reporters in this House. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I am disposed to thank the boys because they have done no worse. I shall note
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: Thinking that what they have said has come from the head and not the heart,
         and believing that these boys will like us better as they become acquainted with us, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: Having been a newspaper man for several years, and realizing the fact that
         editors and <choice>
          <sic>reportes</sic>
          <corr>reporters</corr>
         </choice> are not always under oath when writing, and that this is a free country, and that
         we may say what we please if it be the truth, I have no enmity toward any reporter, and
         therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: In view of the fact that I think the Republican press of Indianapolis has been
         kind and just, and in the face of the fact that the Democratic press, notably the Sentinel,
         has arrayed itself against the majority on this floor, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: Believing that the newspapers and reporters do not demand this, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: Because I believe in free speech and a free press I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN: Because I believe the half has not been told I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Life is a warfare and men differ. I have, it is true, had some trouble with
         reporters here: but when they were over all was past with me. I like a man better when I
         have had an old fashioned fight with him. I have no grievance now. I would not, had I a
         chance, vote a reporter from the floor. If what is said against a man is false, it will not
         hurt him. It is the duty of newspapers to criticise public acts. A personal fight should be
         below notice. We came from the same family, whether from the jungle or from the plain. If
         they accuse us of being hogs they are our kin. If I had a personal encounter with a
         reporter on this floor every day I should not vote to exclude a newspaper man. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: It you all knew how reporters have to draw on their imaginations at times
         as I do no one would say much. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: By the way some gentlemen on this floor have squirmed and twisted because
         of criticism, I think a great many things were true, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: Possibly in a small way I have as many grievances as any one - in my name
         being spelled wrong, speeches given me that I never said, and things I said have been
         omitted - still I am a member of the guild in a small way, and, as blood is thicker than
         water, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: Because I have a kindly feeling for the reporters I vote "no."</p>

         of Indiana has been reached. Before declaring the House adjourned without day, I desire to
         again express to you the thanks which I uttered on taking this chair at the beginning of
         the session. For the united support you have given to my efforts and the great charity with
         which you have treated my performance as Speaker, please receive my grateful
         acknowledgment. If I have been in any degree successful it is because of your intelligent
         aid when I was right and your generous forbearance when I was wrong. The first hour of this
         session I declared that, in my opinion, this House was, in point of worth, the peer of any
         that ever organized in Indiana. What was then an opinion is now a settled conviction. Day
         after day I have seen you diligently and intelligently discharging your duties as worthy
         representatives of those who seat you here. It were vain to hope that you shall now be
         fairly judged, for faultfinding is easy, and criticism is the chief accomplishment of every
         trifler. But I know you have been faithful, and for the confirmation of this I appeal to
         the sober second thought of your constituents. To the elective and appointed officers of
         the House, I also return thanks for their uniform courtesy toward me and their steadfast
         adherence to their several duties. To them is due the credit that no work has been
         neglected and that no scandal as to disposition of bills or the disbursment of money has
         disgraced the House. And now, in uniformity to the vote just taken I declare the House

       <p>Hon. CHARLES L. JEWETT, when elected Speaker of the House, on taking the chair, said:</p>
       <p>G<hi rend="center">ENTLEMEN</hi>: - I assume this station with sincere gratitude for the
        honor, and profoundly impressed with its responsibility. It is indeed an honor to be called
        to preside over this house, for I express but the common belief of those who are best
        qualified to judge, when I say never in the history of the State has a house of
        representatives been possessed of a greater wealth of ability, experience and personal
        worth. It is not the province of the speaker to suggest subjects of legislation; for that
        belongs to the Governor and it would be equally impertinent to suggest the extent of
        legislation, for that is a matter belonging exclusively to you, but the manner in which you
        are to discharge your duties may be properly touched upon. No bill ought ever to be enacted
        without careful consideration, and inconsiderate legislation, usually comes from an attempt
        to atone for indolence during the greater portion of the session by excessive industry at
        its close. In my opinion the time allotted us by the constitution is ample for the present
        needs of State, provided none of it is wasted. Every citizen of the State is entitled to
        respectful hearing and to have his proper request duly considered, but when any measure is
        urged upon you by interested parties, I beg of you to remember it is your duty to represent
        the great body of the people who have not been consulted and whose interest can only be
        respected by you. Happily, there are few political questions demanding our attention, and
        the party complexion of the house is so clearly defined that they may be disposed of without
        obstruction or delay. I beg of you therefore, without, regard to party, to address
        yourselves to the necessary legislation of the session, recognizing the fact chat your
        highest duty is to the whole people of the State. If you do this we shall succeed, if not we
        shall fail, and bear always in mind that for mistakes made here regrets elsewhere will be
        unavailing and corrections will be impossible.</p>

        <head rend="center">ELECTION OF U. S. SENAT</head>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I have the honor, on behalf of the Republicans of Indiana, to place in
         nomination their candidate for United States Senator, Governor Albert G. Porter. Indiana
         has been honored by many illustrious adopted sons, some of whom she has crowned with her
         choicest honors. But it is to the splendid achievements of her own sons - born on her own
         soil, educated in her own institutions and clothed with the panoply of citizenship within
         her historic borders - that she turns with peculiar pride. Her thousands of brave soldiers,
         living and dead, by their matchless heroism have made imperishable her fame for dauntless
         courage and sterling patriotism. - The intelligence and energy of her citizens have made
         her one of the brightest jewels in the great galaxy of States that constitutes the mightest
         and freest nation on the face of the globe. Her statesmen, by their broad ideas of
         philanthropy, inflexible courage and aggressive leadership as developed in the most
         perilous hours of the nation's existence, <pb n="332" xml:id="VAA8558-22-332"/> when the
         flame of secession scorched our temples of liberty with its hot breath of treason have done
         everything to win for the queen of States the unstinted plaudits of a <choice>
          <sic>greatful</sic>
          <corr>grateful</corr>
         </choice> republic. Recognizing that our State in the past has been represented in the
         Senate of the United States by able and eminent statesmen, among whom stood pre-eminently
         above all, that giant leader and towering intellect, the great Morton, Indiana's noblest
         son; and recognizing that our present senators are to-day the peers of any statesmen on the
         continent, we desire to nominate a man who will maintain the position we have already won.
         Remembering all these in the light of our past history, with an eye single to the rich
         possibilities that are unfolding in the sunrise of our future greatness, and in the name of
         all the Republicans of Indiana, reflecting their united voice, I nominate a man who needs
         no eulogy to endear him to the hearts of the people of this his native State. Coming from
         the reservoir of honesty and purity - the people - all his instincts, sympathies, interests
         and aspirations are in harmony with the great masses, whose favorite he has ever been. He
         has often been called by the voice of his fellow-citizens to assume high and important
         public trusts, and, in the discharge of his grave duties, he has always exhibited such
         honesty of purpose, fidelity to duty and inflexible purity as to win the friendship not
         only of his own political household, but also the commendation of the entire public. I
         nominate a man of the rarest talents and most commanding character; a man whose moral
         qualities are as faultless as his intellectual constitution is vigorous and brilliant; a
         man to whose acknowledged fitness for great public trusts and responsibility there is no
         limit but the Constitution of his country. He may not receive a majority of the votes of
         this General Assembly, but wherever the people have spoken they have declared for Albert G.
         Porter. I have heard much to-day of the "soldier's" friend from the other side of the
         House, and the more heartily do I endorse the nomination of Governor Porter, because in the
         trying hour of the Nation's struggle, he was the friend of the boys in blue when they had
         enemies and needed friends.</p>
        <p>Following Mr. Copeland, the nomination of Governor Porter was seconded by Mr. Adams, who
         said that Albert Gr. Porter was a man not known as seeking political honors - a man who had
         carried Indiana after such distinguished men as Thomas M. Browne and Benjamin Harrison had
         failed. He thought more credit was due to Porter for the election of the martyred Garfield
         in 1880, than to any one else. It would be fitting to send greeting to the Empire State
         that Albert G. Porter had been placed in nomination for senator from Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Mr. Speaker and fellow Representatives: - Were the law such that we could
         choose a senator from any portion of the American Union, my first choice would be Mr.
         Voorhees. He has at all times defended the interests of the people. When the Republican
         party demonetized the silver dollar, he used his talent and energy to have silver restored
         to its legal tender quality. When the Republican party passed the law requiring the
         greenback currency to be taken up and destroyed, he raised his voice in favor of its
         restoration to the legal tender currency of the country. In the struggle between labor and
         monopoly, he has at all times been the friend of the people - a man who believes that "a
         day, an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity of bondage."</p>

        <p>Mr. LOYD: I have often made the assertion, and urged it as a reason why Republicans
         should not be retained in power, that they would not reform their own wrongs and abuses,
         that gross revolutions of law and gross immoralities by those in high places in the
         Republican Party were matters of general comment, undenied, unrebuked and investigated.
         Great schemes and jobs have been investigated in the Republican party, the parties found
         guilty of the most shameful abuses of public trust, in many instances amounting almost to <choice>

         whitewashed. I have always insisted that the Democratic Party was capable of reforming
         their own party wrongs and for that reason should be trusted by the people. And as the
         Knightstown home was in the hands of Democrats and charges were preferred, the blame might
         attach to the party that put the officers of that institution in their places, and as a
         Democrat and chairman of this important Committee, I felt it my duty to fully investigate
         the whole matter believing that no party can better afford to reform its own wrongs than
         the Democratic Party, and feeling that the Democratic Party should have the credit of
         reforming any wrong that exists at Knightstown, I have worked hard and long to make this
         matter fair, full and impartial.</p>

        <p>Mr. PATTON, in explanation of his vote said: Honest people pay their taxes; unfortunate

         penalty over the required delinquent duplicate and withhold payment, as money is worth more
         to them,thereby creating a large delinquent list. But if the penalty was increased to six
         per cent on all delinquent taxes it would insure prompt payment and it will not in any
         manner increase the pay of County Treasurers, as under the present law they call in their
         deputies after the 3rd of November until the 1st of April and then send them into the field
         again to enforce collections and if this bill becomes a law those very taxes which are

           <p>Whereas, Section 3 of Article 10 of the Constitution provides that "no money shall be
            drawn from the Treasury but in pursuance of appropriations made by law," but to the
            legislative department alone is delegated the duty and authority to raise revenue by
            taxation and appropriate the same to the support of the State government and its
            institutions; that the disbursement of money from the Treasury, under the authority of
            the Executive and Administrative Departments of the State, in the absence of the regular
            legislative appropriations, is inaugurating a dangerous practice, unprecedented, and
            should not be resorted to except in great and unforseen emergencies, because it deprives
            the Legislature, as the representatives of the people, of its proper functions, and is
            contrary to the spirit and intention of the Constitution; that the Legislature should
            have a care and overnight in the expenditure of public money; and, whereas, the
            construction of the new State-house can not be continued without further aid from the
            State, and to discontinue such construction would entail a loss upon the State, at an
            increased expense to the people,</p>
           <p>Therefore I, Isaac P. Gray, Governor of the State of Indiana, do hereby make
            proclamation that, in my opinion, the public welfare requires a brief special session of
            the General Assembly of Indiana, and I do hereby call a special session of the present
            General Assembly to be held in the Marion County Court-house, commencing on Tuesday, the
            10th day of March, at 9 o'clock in the forenoon</p>
           <p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and cause to be affixed the seal of the
            State, at the city of Indianapolis, this 9th day of March, in the year of our Lord

           <p>Resolved, That the rules adopted as amended for the government of the Senate at the

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I offer the following amendment to the resolution:</p>
        <floatingText>
         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>I move to amend so as to require two-thirds of all the Senators present to dispense
            with the regular order of business.</p>
          </div>
         </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It seems to me that amendment is a very fair one. Of course if there was any
         political matter the majority wished to put forward they would want such a rule, but I
         supposed whatever was desired in the way of apportionment bills was passed at the regular
         session. We can get through I business promptly in one way and in no other, and that is not
         to spend half our time in suspending the regular order of business. If we come here at 9:30
         o'clock and stay till noon, come again at 2 and stay till 5 or 5:30 o'clock, we can get
         through all the bills possibly in a little less than forty days. This talk of getting
         through in twelve or sixteen days is nonsense; we can't do it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I agree with the Senators from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) and Lake (Mr. Youche), that
         these amendments ought to be adopted. This was a rule made for political legislation. The
         trouble has been in the regular session that we would proceed with the regular order a
         little while, and then turn to some other business desired by a particular Senator, and
         there was but little order about our business This amendment would require a two-thirds
         vote before there could be a change, and every one knows we would accomplish more
         legislation under it than to be changing from one thing to another. It has always been the
         rule, and has never been departed from except to advance some necessary political matter;
         and, as the Senator from Wayne says, we are over that, I trust. This special session has
         been called by the Governor because there is absolute need for certain legislation, and the
         quicker we get through and go home the better. This rule is in the interest of the speedy
         discharge of business, and I trust the amendment will be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: lam just as desirous as any Senator on this floor that the business we have
         to do shall be done expeditiously, but I don't believe the changing of that rule will
         affect it. Where it requires a two-thirds vote to suspend the order of business, when that
         motion is made the roll will be called clear through, and it will often be found that two
         thirds are not voting in the affirmative, and then the time is lost; while if it simply
         takes a majority to suspend the order of business it will be done at once, in all
         probability. I think it is in the interest of economy, and in the interest of the business
         of the Senate, that the rule shall stand as amended last session.</p>
        <p>Mr ERNEST made an ineffectual motion — affirmative, 14; negative, 22 — to postpone the
         further consideration of this matter till 2 o'clock Monday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">BALLOT-BOX PROTECTION.</head>
        <p>Mr. FLEECE called up the bill [S. 4 - see page 170 of vol. 22] to prohibit the buying <pb
          n="21" xml:id="VAA8558-22-369"/> and selling of votes, and prescribing penalties for the
         same.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: A man who would sell his vote should forever be disfranchised.
         One of the dearest rights is the right to vote. All rights pertaining to the ballot should
         be rigidly guarded.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: Two things should brought to attention. Buying and selling votes is one of
         the great crimes of the day, and how to prohibit it is a perplexing one The great trouble
         is that the buyer and seller stand together, and neither can be apprehended. The bill which
         will reach the buyer is the more important.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: This law says that "means" shall not be used to induce a man either to vote
         or refrain from voting. The word "corrupt" should precede the word "induce," as often a man
         may by legitimate argument "induce" a man to vote. We should all induce men to vote, but
         not corruptly induce them. The third section says that any one "suspected" of violating the
         law against inducing shall be, etc. Who will do the suspecting? The Grand Jury is organized
         to investigate violations of law. This "suspecting" puts too much power in the hands of the
         Prosecuting Attorney. The "suspected" may be, at his peril, brought before a Prosecuting
         Attorney for examination. The candidate who would, by any means but legitimate, induce a
         voter is unworthy of office. But the innocent should be guarded, as well as the guilty
         punished</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: This bill does away with imprisonment as a punishment for the crime of vote
         buying or selling, and in place of it punishes the guilty party by disfranchisement.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I am in favor of a law that imprisons and disfranchises a man who sells or
         offers to sell his vote. Any man who is a candidate for office should not be held to an
         account upon the simple sworn statement of a man who says he has been approached to sell
         his vote. In that case it is giving an unfair advantage; any man without character, enraged
         at a candidate, may swear falsely against a candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: This Legislature might experiment a little. The present law is a flat
         failure, and certain it is that a new law is needed. I can not see that this bill proposes
         hardships for anyone. If everybody connected with the affair is a criminal, you can get no
         one to testify. We want the system of turning State's evidence in it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: The objections of the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) ruin the present
         law. As a man can not be compelled to testify against himself, so you can not, under the
         present election law, compel a man to testify. If you relieve the man testifying from
         punishment, you have a chance to get at the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I do not believe the bill is as good as the present law. While I believe
         the man who will sell a vote is as vile as can be, yet I do not want every candidate put in
         the hands of every man in the country who wants to sell out.</p>
        <p>Mr. FLEECE thought the bill a great improvement over the old one. The growth of vote
         buying and selling is alarming, and something must be done to stop it. The bill is not so
         much to punish a man for selling a vote, but to restrain that crime. The bill passed —

         circuits was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: This bill will make one new circuit. It makes Martin and Daviess County one
         circuit, Knox one circuit, and Lawrence and Monroe counties one circuit. The dockets are
         badly crowded.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I am opposed to the bill because it makes a new circuit. At this <pb n="22"

        <p>Mr. GORDON: About 1873 the Common Pleas Court was abolished and the Circuit Court system
         adopted. There was more legal business then than now. There is no need of new circuits.
         More work is all that is needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I know that the business of Knox County demands this change. The business in
         that county is two years behind now, and the Judge is a good worker. He is painstaking, it

        <p>Mr. PASSAGE'S bill [H. R. 159] concerning the teaching of certain branches in the common
         schools, prohibiting the teaching of German, and prescribing who shall attend, was read a
         third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: This bill says that the schools shall be open to all of every color, and yet
         it strikes agains the colored race. I oppose it on both grounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: There are places in this State where the colored and white children attend the
         same school and sit in the same seats. I never heard of either being contaminated by it I
         am in favor of both colors attending the same school Anything else is a distinction without
         a difference. Keeping the schools separate is to have poorer schools for colored children.
         We passed the Civil Rights bill the other day. Let us see if that is meaningless. The time
         is coming when we will be broad minded enough and liberal enough to wipe out these color
         lines If you make the colored man a competent voter you must commence with the children of
         the colored people. It is a fact that a distinction is made in the schools against the
         colored children. The colored men should have their rights under the law</p>
        <p>Mr FRENCH: No country on earth has to advanced a race as this country has in the colored
         race You are always talking about the difference concerning the dealings with the whites
         and the colored. If there be any it is as much a discrimination against the the white as
         against the colored. The colored race has every advantage. In our county they have just as
         good an opportunity as the white They have their superintendent. I have never heard a
         complaint from them in my town of Mt. Vernon. In New Har- <pb n="24"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-372"/>mony they attend the school together - these two races. But let
         that feature in the bill go. Here is in this bill a stab at the Germans. In a great many
         districts is a strong German population where the German language is taught. This bill
         prohibits the teaching of German, save in the graded schools. Not one in a hundred in these
         schools ever reach a graded school.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe: The first clause of the 8th article of the constitution has the
         same meaning of this bill. I am just a broad enough American to want taught in our schools
         the English language - neither the French, the German, or any other. I see no reason why we
         should teach the German language and neglect the Dane and the Norwegian. I have it from a
         County Superintendent that in five townships in this State the English language was not
         taught at all. Every township may have graded schools. When a man pleads here for the
         teaching of his mother tongue, some contemptible reason or fling is brought to bear against
         it. I will not be placed at a disadvantage here. I am thoroughly American, but I mean by
         American every one who is here for a home. An adopted citizen is as much American as any
         one.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I do not see in looking over this that any change is made but in one
         particular. The law already says that the colored people shall have all the freedom of the
         schools they want. Here is the law. [Reads] It merely affects German teaching. If the time
         comes to discriminate against either the colored race or Germans, I shall discriminate
         against the colored, but there is no need of any discrimination against either, and as I am
         opposed to it, I shall oppose this bill, which proposes to discriminate against the
         Germans.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: You say that this law discriminates against German children entering public
         schools. Isn't it a fact that it does not affect their going to the schools, but merely
         prohibits the teaching of the German language?</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I say that it discriminates against the Germans by prohibiting the teaching
         of branches they desire to learn. The bill is an indirect attact at the Germans.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I move to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>
         with instructions to strike out the word "graded" wherever it occurs and insert in lieu the
         word "common." This amendment would put the bill where we could all vote for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES said that such amendment would put the bill in the frame shape as the present
         law. He moved that the motion to recommit lie on the table.</p>
        <p>A motion to lay the motion to recommit on the table was tabled by yeas 42 nays 38</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN, explaining his vote, said that he was in favor of the teaching of the English
         language only in the public schools. He did not oppose the attendance of colored children
         in the schools. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: All gentlemen who speak so much about discrimination against the Germans use
         it as a shield to vote against the colored men. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr PATTEN: In 1877 I was trustee of the schools at my home. We had a Democratic school
         board, and we put the colored children in the public schools. So all of us do not use this
         German discrimination to hide bekind as a shield. The law as it now stands does not
         discriminate against colored children, because they are now in the public schools. This
         bill, as a fact, makes no discrimination. I believe in the right of all children of every
         nationality to go to schools. This amendment ought to be tabled, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: Because the law is inoperative; because colored children are not admitted
         as they should be. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: While I think that the coupling of these two sections is unfortunate, yet I
         favor it. I think it better that German should not be taught in the common schools, because
         in German districts it will make them clannish and neglect the English language. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass - yeas 32, nays 49.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE (author of this bill) said: The bill does not curtail the rights of the
         Germans. It gives equal rights to all.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING, explaining his vote, said: Believirg this bill makes an unjust
         discrimination against the German population, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr DEEM, when his name was called, said: For the reason that it will destroy the
         employment of a large number of colored teachers, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I have made the best effort I could to get this bill in a good shape I have
         no desire to do aught to interfere with the Germans. They should have all the rights and
         immunities of the country. The bill says "graded" schools and I preferred it should say
         "common" schools. This bill denies no right of the Germans, but merely allows the teaching
         of the German language in the schools. In the hope that the Senate will amend the bill, and
         if not, with the hope that it is a good bill, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOWELL: If the bill becomes a law, it will open different constructions of the
         statutes and cause litigation, and for that reason I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: For the reason that I believe this will be of no good either to the German
         or colored race; for the reason that I believe that for the well being of the colored, and
         white races they should be sometime separated; for the reason that there is no
         discrimination or no separation unless there be a strong race prejudice, which is sometimes
         the case; and for the reason that I believe it better to let this color line die out than
         to legislate it out, I vote "no."</p>
        <pb n="25" xml:id="VAA8558-22-373"/>
        <p>Mr. KRUGER: We ask for no protection. We merely ask that the law be let alone. I
         understand that this law has been drafted by the State Superintendent of Public
         Instruction. I am sorry to learn this. In my city, which is largely of a German population,
         the Germans pay taxes to educate the English children in the English language, and pay
         besides to have their children educated in German in private schools. They do not want that
         interfered with As to the colored race, they go to our public schools as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD, in explaining his vote, said: I do not believe that colored children are
         discriminated against. In my county they are not. And in my county the Germans, largely in
         the majority, pay their taxes, and wish the law let alone. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: If this bill passes it will provide that if German is taught it must be in a
         graded school. If in a common school, the twenty five necessary under the present law to
         have German taught, could not procure it under this bill. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY, when his name was called, said: Because the Germans are discriminated against
         in it, and because the colored people have all our school privileges now, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY explained his vote: This State contains a large number of Germans. I share in
         the pride of teaching our mother tongue here. But so have the Germans a pride in theirs,
         and some attention should be paid to that. The colored people want no change in the present
         law. In deference to my constituency I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL, when his name was called, said: For the reason that no further rights will
         be given the colored race by this bill, and for the reason that it will abridge the rights
         of Germans, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN, in explanation of his vote, said: Making this distinction in favor of the
         Germans is making a distinction against all other nationalities not represented here -
         Italians, Danes, Norwegians, etc., and as I am opposed to such discrimination I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Believing this bill does not discriminate against the Germans, and believing
         that it will put colored children on an equality I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I am in favor at all times of the elevation of every race. I hope that the
         final action on this bill will leave it so that it can be amended. As it is I shall have to
         vote against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON, when his name was called, said: Believing in the broadest liberty and
         educational equality, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>M . SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Because this bill detracts nothing from any right of any
         person, race or color now enjoyed by any race in the land; because it does not affect any
         graded school; because this law will place all the citizens of this State on an absolute
         equality in the free schools, and because this bill will harmonize the school system of the
         State, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY, explaining, said: Because the Germans do not wish the teaching of the German
         language in the common schools, but wish to be Americanized, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND, in explanation of his vote, said: Gentlemen on this floor have argued that
         the colored children have equal school privileges with the white race This supposed fear of
         discrimination against the German children is a subterfuge to hide behind. I believe that
         if this Mil becomes a law it will enable the colored children to enjoy what the law has
         undertaken to afford them. Because I do not believe that it discriminates against the
         Germans, and because I do believe that it will be of benefit to the colored children, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON, asking that his name be again called, said: I believe that what is proposed
         here will come about in the course of events and better than what the law could accomplish;
         so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>

        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I have a petition of 6,000 people asking for the buildings. A legal
         opinion says that the city may go ahead and build this structure, but to satisfy all
         conflicting opinions the law is asked for. The city authorities favor it. The building of
         the structure will furnish a magnificent hall for the capital city of the State. Had we
         this hall last year we might have had one or both of the national political conventions.
         This law is asked on the ground that the opinions as to the correctness of donating the

        <p>Mr. JAMESON, when his name was called, said that as the authorities had a disposition to

        <p>Mr. Schley's bill [H. R. 152] concerning Building and Savings Associations - freeing them
         from taxation - was read the third time and failed - yeas, 50; nay, 30 - for want of a
         constitutional majority of 51 votes.</p>
        <p>Pending the bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE in explaining his vote, said: It occurs to me that this bill would be a bad
         law. If it passes it will release these associations from taxation, and a rich person might
         invest largely in one or in many of them, and thus escape the payment of quite a large
         tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN (interposing): He can't hold but $1 000 in one, and must be a borrower.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: Even $1 000 is too much to escape taxation on, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. JAMESON, when his name was called, said: For the reason that this bill does not
         release any one from taxation, but on the contrary releases from double taxation, really, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: If the members understood this matter, they would not impose a hardship on
         the stockholders of these associations. They are trying to protect poor men who are trying
         to build homes. If a man borrows money of them he does it in real estate. He pays taxes on
         his property and the association has to pay taxes on the mortgage, thus making a double
         taxation. Therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe: For the reason that this system is an encouragement for homes,
         and that I may not impose a burden upon the men struggling for a home and to release double
         taxation, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY, when his name was called said: If I were to vote against this bill I could
         not look a lab ring man in the face. For the reason that double taxes are paid on them, and
         I wish to release it, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON": It is true that this does exempt from taxation the laboring man, but it is
         right to exempt any man from legal taxes? It is a discrimination against one taxpayer and
         in favor of another. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr HOWELL, in explanation of his vote, said: I do not favor exempting shareholders in
         this kind of an association any more than I would exempt from taxation shareholders in any
         other corporation; therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: For the reason that I do not believe there is double taxation exscied; for
         the reason that these associations are not savings banks and property in them can not be
         listed as money in savings banks. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK, when his name was called, said: After careful examination of the bill and the
         law I am constrained to vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL, in explaining his vote, said: If a man puts a mortgage on his farm he pays
         taxes on the farm; and the one holding the mortgage pays taxes on that. This bill proposes
         a parallel case, and I would as soon vote to exempt the farmer as the shareholder. I vote
         "no."</p>

         the third time</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This bill is for work done on the Asylum for the Insane. It was before the
         Legislature two years ago, allowed and put to the specific appropriation bid. It originated
         this year in the Senate and easily passed that body. Too much time has been wasted already
         in these claims against the State; the way they are treated is bringing Indiana into
         disrepute It will come about that State contractors will put their bids together higher in
         fear that they can not secure their money without tedious delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I think this a lightening rod claim. The fact that the bill is of several
         years standing convinces me that it is a steal. The charge of $1 per foot assures me that
         it is a big steal.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: This bill came to us after having been passed upon by a cool and deliberate
         body. The Senate, I am informed, gave the bill a careful investigation.</p>

         rods on smoke stacks. That is what I thought He was talking of something he <pb n="27"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-375"/> knew nothing of. This rod was put on the smoke stack. It was
         imported under the eyes of the State officers, and if there was no order to put it up why
         did they permit it? The Senate has no right to use a man's property for eight years and

        <p>The bill [S 18 see page 163 190 of vol. 22] to regulate the practice of medicine was read
         the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: The State of Indiana has been made a central point to which have gathered
         all the refuse physicians and quacks from everywhere. It needs and demands at once some
         kind of legislation It is too late in the nineteenth century to talk about good physicians
         going from one place to another without a graduation certificate. There is no prescribed
         legal qualification now for a physician. Under this bill the attendance on a term of
         lectures is made a qualification, and this is better than nothing. This bill should be
         passed to elevate the profession and to protect the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: This bill gives some protection to the quack doctors; that is all there is to
         it. Some member of a medical college junior class who may have dallied around and then
         practiced three years in some out of the way place, comes up to the requirements of the
         case.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: AS Democrats we are opposed to any scheme that comes under class legislation.
         If this bill becomes a law a great many worthy, practicing physicians in the State would be
         thrown out, because they have not attended some high toned medical college. This bill is
         the outgrowth of a hitter contrast between two medical colleges. We can't afford to take up
         this fight. Physicians of my county say that the bill should not pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: I have been besieged by physicians of my county regarding this bill. I believe
         this matter will in time regulate itself. If my neighbor has a physician who has not
         graduated I see no reason why I should take such a physician away from him. If a man has
         practiced for ten years he may continue without molestation - graduation or no graduation;
         if a man has been quacking for ten years he may under this bill continue to quack A
         physician may as well practice without a license as a lawyer may. There are many
         pettifoggers in the legal profession, and I do not care to have lawyers who have no
         certificate of graduation licensed. All men who graduate as physicians are not competent
         and all physicians who have not graduated are incompetent. No man not a doctor is favoring
         this bill</p>
        <p>Mr. FRANKLIN thought the bill should not pass, as the people did not want it.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON. The people do not want this bill as it is. It is born of a wrangle among
         physicians. This bill proposes to license three kinds of doctors - one who makes affidavit
         that he is a graduate of a respectable medical college. Who is to decide this? Why, the men
         who makes the affidavit; and the Clerk is compelled to accept it. The man who would
         practice on the diploma of a bogus college would commit perjury. There are but three
         classes of persons in Indiana who are compelled to procure a license as to respectability
         and the like. They are the school-teacher, the saloonkeeper and the lawyer. To license a
         quack - and a quack to get a license - would be to put him on a level with reputable
         physicians. Another class of physicians under this bill is the man who has practiced ten
         years Yet some are never competent, in spite of experience. This bill will cut off the
         traveling specialists, some of whom have the finest educations. I believe the people are
         capable of deciding who they shall employ.</p>

         an interest in the case, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN, when his name was called, said: From the fact that I think this an unjust
         discrimination against certain worthy persons, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN: Not as to my personal views, but following the wishes of ninety nine out of

        <p>Mr. STALEY: Other States have medical laws, and as I do not wish Indiana to be the great

        <p>Mr. SEARS called up a motion entered some days ago to recall from the Senate the bill [H.
         R 377] to do away with certain fees of prosecuting attorneys, which bill passed the
         House.</p>
        <p>Mr.GOODING: It was passed here by a majority vote, and I do not see why it should be
         recalled. I know that prosecuting attorneys have been here to fight it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I voted for the bill, and I would like to know if this move is to reconsider
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: I understand that the gentleman from Marion County (Mr. Jameson) has given
         notice that he will move to reconsider it.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: I understand that prosecuting Attorneys have been fighting this bill and
         misrepresenting it in the Senate. This bill makes but one short amendment — that
         Prosecutors shall not receive the $5 fee where the defendant goes willingly before a
         Justice of the Peace and enters a plea of guilty. If the Prosecutor or his deputy is
         neither present, the Justice shall not send for him. If the Prosecutor has worked up the
         case, he may be present upon the calling of his case and claim his fee. But the Justice
         shall not, as now, when he taxes up the cost, enter a fee of $5 for the Prosecutor, when
         the latter may not be present or never have heard of the case. This bill is to check this
         practice.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I desire to make the point of order that the merits of the bill are not proper
         for discussion at this hour.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: Only in a limited decree — whether the House wishes to again take up the
         bill, having not fully understood it. I will say this much for myself: I voted against the
         bill, but with certain amendments I can vote for it. In its present language it is liable
         to defeat in the Senate. If the bill is so changed that any guilty man against whom a case
         has been made through the effort of a Prosecutor may not, to save costs, go before a
         Justice and thus keep the Prosecutor from fees that he may have earned.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: It is a little difficult to vote upon whether the bill shall be brought back
         or not unless we understand something of its provisions. The bill destroys certain fees of
         the Prosecuting Attorney. A law has been on our statute books for thirty years that if a
         man violate the criminal law he shall not be his own prosecutor. If he assault his neighbor
         he shall not go to a remote part of the county and there enter a plea of guilty and
         prosecute himself. This bill proposes just such a procedure.</p>
        <p>The motion to recall the bill was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, called up his motion, heretofore made, that the vote on the
         bill [S. 45 — see pp. 175 and 242, vol 22] creating an Appellate Court, be
         reconsidered.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN moved that the motion to reconsider lie on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table was rejected by yeas 37, nays
         40.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING, explaining his vote, said: Because the bill was thoroughly discussed when up

        <p>Mr. MOCK, when his name was called, said: Because an Appellate Court will create
         unnecessary expense, and because it was before fully considered, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I believe the court is needed, I
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr McHENRY, when his name was called, said: Before I voted for the bill according to the

        <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe, explaining his vote said: Without saying how I shall vote on the
         bill, and in order that it may be more fully examined, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table was tabled.</p>

        <p>Mr. PENDLEFON" submitted a resolution that it is the sense of the House that when it
         adjourn in the evening that it adjourn until Monday morning at 9 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: The House should not lose time as the Senate is far ahead of the House with
         the business of the session.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN said that, but two days would be lost, and most of the members had private
         business at home which demands personal attention. As an extra session was called, many
         have not their private affairs arranged.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: If you adjourn this evening until Monday afternoon, you lose three days —
         waste that much time; and that is the only thing you can make of it. I move to amend so
         that the House adjourn to meet on Saturday.</p>

        <head rend="center">TAXATION.</head>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN'S bill [H. R. 472] concerning taxation was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: If I understand this bill it proposes to tax the borrower for the money which
         he may be unfortunate enough to have to borrow, and it makes a lein on the property for
         these taxes. Foreigners who have money loaned in Indiana will compel the borrowers to pay
         the taxes upon it. They will do it in some way or manner. It is another system of doable
         taxation. Taxes are paid on the property and the owner will be compelled to pay taxes on
         the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: This bill is a stop toward equalizing taxation, which is not in this
         particular double.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: In cases of mortgage on real estate, deed of trust or other means by which
         a debt is secured, the bill says the value of the property affected by the mortgage shall
         be assessed and taxed to the owner of the real estate, may be taxed on $2,000, and if I
         make a loan the bill says I shall be taxed on the value of the real estate less the value
         of the mortgage. So I am not doubly taxed. This tax may, under the bill be paid by either
         the owner of the mortgage or by the borrower.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: The bill is in the right direction, but because it does not go far enough I
         think the bill should not pass. It works an inequality.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOOE: I hope this bill will not become a law for the reason that I believe it will
         debar to a great extent the men who desire to mortgage their real estate from doing so. It
         becomes sometimes an absolute necessity in business for owners to mortgage real estate, and
         under the bill the mortgagee pays taxes to the extent of his loan on the real estate. He
         has to contract for interest under the existing law, and out of that interest pay his
         proportion of taxes on the land Therefore, in the end the mortgagee will receive but a very
         small per cent, on his loan, which fact will drive money lenders to use their money in
         other ways, and the result will be that holders of real estate can not obtain money upon
         mortgages. I regard the bill as an obnoxious one; can not vote for it and hope it will not
         pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOWELL: I think the law as it stands is much fairer than the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. TIMMONS: The appraised value of 200 acres of land is, say $4 400, but it is sold for
         $7,000, on which there is paid in cash $1 500, and that leaves $5 500. Now take the
         appraised value, $4,400, from the $5,500 and there remains $1,100 exempt, by the parties
         making long time at 6 per cent. say for six years on the $5,500. The average appraisement
         on land is about $12 in the county of White, and the average selling price for cash and on
         time is from $25 to $35 an acre. This shows how the bill would operate.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: I think the arguments here against the bill are unanswerable. Indiana can not
         afford to adopt any fiat theory of this kind. If you tax a man in Ohio on mortgage he holds
         on Indiana land, you will drive the money lenders from Indiana. If this bill passes you tax
         a man on his real estate without regard to his indebtedness. If it pass it will exempt
         two-thirds of the taxble property in the State. Because a man has a mortgage over him it
         does not make him richer or poorer. I owe some debts for which I have not given a mortgage.
         Giving a mortgage for that will make me neither richer or poorer. If I borrow $1000 and
         give a mortgage for it, I have the money and I am no poorer, so I should not be released
         from taxation upon that.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD hoped the bill would not pass, as it was not effectual.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN: The bill may not cover everything. Some gentlemen think it does not <pb
          n="31" xml:id="VAA8558-22-379"/>go far enough, but it is far better than the old law It is
         intended to destroy double taxation. I had experience with California laws, of which this
         bill is a copy and it was found to work well there. The only class of men in Indiana I find
         opposed to this are lawyers, money lenders and backers. Farmers and business men now favor
         it This is the only bill I have asked for, and as I am by the Apportionment bill legislated
         out of office, and can never have an opportunity to present a bill at a subsequent General
         Assembly, I hope it will pass.</p>
        <p>The bill was defeated by yeas 34, nays 42</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call —</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNES, explaining his vote, said: My objection to this bill is that it will allow
         most of the railways to escape taxation. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY, in explanation of his vote said: As it will necessitate our sending every
         assessor to a law school before he is competent, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING, when his name was called, said: For the reason that I believe this bill is
         in the interest of corporations and against the common people, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. DONHOST, explaining his vote, said: For the reason that the bill will make necessary
         an increase of taxation in Indiana, and will exempt a large number of corporations, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GARRISON, when his name was called, said: For the reason that it will raise taxes
         where it should be and for the reason that poor men all over the State are calling for it,
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN in explaining his vote, said: It will lead to confusion, and while I believe
         that something in this direction is needed, yet I do not believe that this bill hits it, so
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, when his name was called said: I like this bill for its good intentions, but
         in its present form I think it should not become a law, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I like the bill and believe that
         it is demanded by my constituents, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES, when his name was called, said: This bill will relieve the burdens of the
         hard-working class, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON, explaining his vote, said: Believing that while all property should be
         taxed, none should be doubly taxed, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, in explanation laid: I do not believe that the bill will do
         what is claimed for it, but will lead to confusion, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick, when his name was called said: In view of the fact that I believe
         it will relieve the worthy, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SPEAKER, in casting his vote, said: I was first moved to vote against the bill, but
         after the final appeal of the gentleman from Lawrence (Mr. Overman), I shall vote
         "aye."</p>

        <head rend="center">ABANDONMENT OF OFFICE</head>
        <p>Mr. REEVS' bill [H. R. 528] concerning the abandonment of office and the appointment of
         an officer was then read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES moved to amend so that the bill shall not apply to any deputy who may have
         been appointed prior to the passage of this bill, and that the bill, with the amendment be
         recommitted to the <orgName>Committee of the Judiciary</orgName> He said: I want the bill
         to exclude the Deputy Recorder of Johnson County. The Recorder (J. B Clemmer) ran away,
         heavily involved, and his brother, taking hold of the office, has brought the chaos of
         trouble into shape. I have here a long petition from people, irrespective of party, who
         oppose the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: I think the bill should not pass. As a fact it looks to me to be
         unconstitutional. However, to recommit would give time to examine the case from Johnson
         County</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: This certainly is a Democratic county and the successor, if any to the
         Recordership, would be of the same politics. This man, said to be deputy, is not a deputy,
         nor never was. In two or three weeks after the Recorder disappeared this man, now in charge
         of the office, offered and took the oath of office - some twenty five days after the
         Recorder was gone. It was no genuine appointment.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Pending which - </p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe by consent, offered a resolution that when the House adjourn it
         adjourn until Saturday noon, to save a constitutional point.</p>
        <p>The motion was adopted.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">THE OFFICE VACANCY.</head>
        <p>The House then took up the unfinished business, the question being on the motion of Mr.
         PATTON to indefinitely postpone the bill [H. R. 528] to declare a Recorder's office
         vacant</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: There is no way under the law, as it is, that an office can be declared
         vacant. If any officer runs away his office can not be declared vacant. So the bill is not
         local in its character. If a man is elected to an office he should attend to it or vacate
         it. The effect of this bill is to put upon county officers greater vigilance in the
         discharge of their duty. There is a quo warranto proceedings in which a deputy may be cited
         to appear and show by what authority he acts, but that is the end of it. <pb n="32"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-380"/> If he acts from no authority it can not be Helped. If a man
         should lock up his office and leave you can not under the present law declare the office
         vacant, for the reason that yon nave no defendant to serve in the case. You can not put up
         a strawman as defendant and try the case. I do not know a thing about the Johnson County
         case. I am not trying that. I favor only a general law, I want to protect people there in
         the record of their deeds, if the present incumbent of that office has not the proper
         authority</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I will interrupt the proceedings for this statement. I wish to withdraw from
         the House now to catch my train for home, and I will call the gentleman from Dearborn (Mr.
         McMullen) to the chair. I would advise that you discuss this question at will and then
         adjourn until Saturday. I I see that there is not "sufficient number of members" to give
         the bill a vote.</p>
        <p>Mr DEEM: It has been sought to kill this bill by recommittal. I submit that the office
         ought to be declared vacant. The Commissioners of that county should have the right to
         appoint a man to that office, to save all questions as to legality.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: It is said here that you can not declare an office vacant, when an officer has
         absconded, because you can not have personal service. The law says that personal service
         may be had by leaving the summons at his last place of residence. To be an officer, a man
         must be a resident of the county. This is a proposition for special legislation — for if
         the bill is passed, it goes through with the express purpose of accommodating Johnson
         County. Under the present law the Court may vacate the office. The people of Johnson County
         want this case left where it is in my opinion. I have heard nothing, but I so judge because
         the bondsmen are not complaining of the man who is now serving.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: In regard to those bondsmen, I am informed that they did undertake to
         surrender the office, and the Judge, as able a man as there is on this floor, and he in
         open court did not find authority to remove the incumbent. In regard to the people, I
         represent them, and they want the office vacated. If some other gentlemen here represent
         Johnson County more than I. I propose to go home and remain there. If the measures proposed
         by this bill are already on the statute, why oppose it?</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: If the gentleman will allow me a word: Some of the provisions are in the
         law, but not all, and some of those not in the law we oppose.</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: That Treasurer has been gone four months. I believe he is dead. I have been
         told that there is not a man in Johnson County who can locate the last residence of
         Clemmer.</p>

          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Whereas, Occurrences of a grave character conclusively show that the consolidation of
            the Soldiers' Orphans' Home with the Asylum for Feeble-minded Children at Knightstown,
            and the management of these two institutions by one and the same Board of Trustees are
            incompatible with the purposes for which they have been established, be it</p>
           <p>Resolved by the Senate of the State of Indiana, the House concurring, That a special
            committee composed of three members of the Senate and three members of the House of
            Representatives be appointed to report to both Houses of the General Assembly a bill
            under the provisions of which said two institutions may be separated, and to rebuild
            them, and to report in time for this General Assembly to act upon and pass such bill.
           </p>
          </div>
         </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I don't see that there is any use in continuing to introduce bills and
         resolutions for the purpose of dividing these institutions and putting them under a
         different management. There is a bill now introduced for that purpose. It is known to every
         one who has taken the pains to read the history of both these institutions that they are
         practically separate, but one management, and I can't see for my life what objection there
         would be to that. Consequently I think the concurrent resolution ought not to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: I think great injustice is being done the children of dead
         soldiers by treating them the same way as the feeble minded children. If those soldiers who
         have given up their lives for their country could have a word to say, I think they would in
         the most energetic manner object to this way of caring for their orphan children. As long
         as the management remains the same there is no practical separation of the two
         institutions. I think the people of the State and the Legislature should see to it that the
         separation is made.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: It will be remembered that the Senator from Miami (Mr. Adkison) <pb n="36"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-384"/>introduced about the same resolution, and it was referred to the
          <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName>, and that committee reported
         almost unanimously against taking such action. These institutions are now practically
         separate. I can not see why it is that there should be so much contest against these poor
         unfortunate feeble-minded children. I can not see why this warfare should go on against
         these children. Is it for the purpose of putting the State to the expense of building
         another institution for the purpose of moving these feeble minded children into it? I don't
         believe the Grand Army of the Republic or the friends of the soldiers' orphans, if they
         understood the truth, would have any objection; but it seems to me that the false
         impression that is going abroad from the continual introduction of these resolutions and
         bills, tends to get up an unsatisfactory feeling among the soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I understand a bill has just come from the House of Representatives which
         has something to do with the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, and I move that this resolution be
         referred to the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName>, so that we may
         have a chance to see what is in that bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON: I move to amend so as to refer the resolution to a special committee of
         three.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINIOSH: I hope the Senate will not do that. The <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
          Institutions</orgName> will give satisfaction to the Senate. I don't see why it should be
         slighted by thus changing the ordinary routine of business.</p>

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that the bill be ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The Senator moves to engross the bill without a quorum being present. We are
         here as a Senate under pure fiction. I don't think a bill ought to be engrossed in the
         absence of a quorum, because when the bill goes to the engrossment there is an end to
         farther amendment of it I don't know that there is any particular objection to this bill,
         but I oppose the engrossment of bills when there is no Senate present.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: I think the Senator should have made that point long ago. There have been
         several bills ordered engrossed here this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I withdraw the point of order on your bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: This is a very lengthy bill. There are some features in this bill I don't
         approve of, but the Senator from Hendricks says if the bill is not right we can beat it on
         the final vote. I don't want to obstruct it now, but I don't see any necessity for haste
         with this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: I only want to say that under this bill it will take a majority of the owners
         of the acres of land returned by the appraiser; and it requires that the roads shall be put
         in good repair before being turned over to the county. In my county there hes been turned
         over to the county a half dozen gravel roads in very bad shape.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Henricks: After the bill passes to the engrossment if there is any error
         or defect in it. I will not ask the Senate to vote for it. It is intended to perfect the
         present law. The bill originated to the county from which the Lieutenant Governor comes.

        <p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANSON: I wish to make a statement to the Senate. At the organization
         of this Senate I appointed three boys pages; and I want to say, I am delighted with the
         manner in which they performed their duty. If it was left with me, I would be glad to
         continue them during the special session. But an old friend of mine - an old army friend,
         who lives on the Ohio River, made application to have a son of his appointed. It was
         impossible for me then to appoint his son, but I promised in case there was an extra
         session (but I didn't then, at that time, think there would be), I would appoint his son.
         Therefore, I appoint Montgomery Bemis, of Perry County, as one of the pages. And I have a
         petition, signed by a majority of Senators, asking the appointment of Harry Hathaway as a
         page. I think the President of the Senate ought to be governed as far as possible by the
         wishes of the Senate, and I will appoint him, to take effect from next Monday. I regret
         very much to part with Walter Taylor, for he has done his duty very well; but the Senate
         has signed a petition to appoint another in his place. And if there is no objection on the
         part of the Senate George A. Russ and Harry Fritz, the two boys who have served - one half

         same allowed from $66 to $42.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: In relation to this report I will say that the amendment allows to the
         Doorkeeper of the House (Mr. Frye) the same mileage allowed Sheriffs by law. The Grand
         Hotel charged for more days than we occupied the room. I move that the amendments be agreed
         to and that the report of the committee be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSTON, of Dearborn: I think this report ought to be concurred in from the fact
         that they have charged us from the 5th of February for the use of that room, and we did not
         occupy the room till the 10th as the notes of the Secretary of the committee show, and we
         abandoned the room on the 22d of Februarv. Including these two days it only makes fourteen
         days, while the Bates House has us charged with twenty-three days occupancy of that room. I
         think the report of the committee ought to be concurred in.</p>
        <pb n="39" xml:id="VAA8558-22-387"/>
        <p>The report of the committee was then concurred in.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MACY, the resolutions as amended were each adopted by a separate

        <p>The bill [H. R 137] for an act to prohibit the sale of dangerous toys.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: It would seem that there was a difference of sentiment in the committee on
         this bill; and it would probably not be right to concur in this report until the minority
         of the committee be heard from. I move that further action be postponed.</p>

        <head rend="center">JURORS' LOSS BY FIRE.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Jay, his bill [S. 331] to authorize Boards of County
         Commissioners to audit and allow claims in certain cases — losses by fire while serving on
         a jury — was read the second time with a committee amendment. He moved that the report of
         the committee be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I hope that will not be. It seems the entire committee does not concur in
         that report. I should like to hear from the minority.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Jay: This is a local bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I know it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: A gentleman who was summoned as a juror, and while serving in the jury room,
         had a fine horse burned in a livery stable. He supposed his horse was out, and everybody
         else supposed the horse was out, but the horse was burnt up. This bill is to authorize the
         Board of Commissioners in any county, under similar circumstances, to audit and allow a
         claim of this kind. This claim amounts to $200 I think there is nothing unreasonable in the
         bil. It was true there was not a full committee when the bill was considered, and the
         reason was because we could not get a full committee; but all the members of the committee
         present agreed that the bill should become a law.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I regard this kind of legislation as vicious. While this bill is intended to
         be local in application, in terms it is not local, for it applies to every county in
         Indiana. It simply creates each county in the State an insurance company to insure property
         against loss by fire. It is a bad precedent for a Legislature to set in pressing a bill of
         this character.</p>

          <sic>SMILH</sic>
          <corr>SMITH</corr>
         </choice>, of Jay: Will the Senator have any objections to the committee amendment being
         acted upon favorably, and let the bill be argued at the time of its passage? I am not
         interested in the bill at all</p>
        <pb n="40" xml:id="VAA8558-22-388"/>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I understand that, but I don't think any bill ought to be placed in a
         condition where it can not be amended without a quorum present.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I am aware there is considerable opposition to the bill. I don't see why
         this should be pushed to a vote on concurring in the report of the committee For my own
         part, I know several Senators who are not here who think this is a dangerous piece of
         legislation. Whether the report could be concurred in with a full Senate is a auction I
         consider doubtful.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: The report of the committee will not stop any amendment that may be
         offered to the bill. I desire to advance the bill as far as I can because it is a bill in
         which there is some merit.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It is generally used as an argument for the passage of a bill that a
         report favorable to it has been adopted.</p>

        <head rend="center">ABSTRACTOR'S BOND.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BRYANT, his bill [S. 335] to require abstractors of titles to give bond,
         was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I move to refer this bill to the <orgName>Committee on the
          Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Mr. BRYANT: I hope the motion made by the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) will fail.
         This is a good bill. It is in the interest of the people. It is a bill requiring
         abstractors to give bond against mistakes. There are abstractors all over the State making
         abstracts of titles to lands who are not responsible. They furnish parties abstracts and
         certify that they are correct, when in fact they are not, thereby causing the loss of money
         to the parties depending on the correctness of the abstract. Just a short time ago, in one
         of the counties I represent (Boone), a party lost $500; and such losses are occurring all
         over the State. The motion ought to fail, as it will retard the passage of the bill, and it
         has been passed on favorably by one committee, which should be sufficient.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I think this bill would have the effect to place the abstract; business of
         the State in the hands of a few men, who will charge a great deal of money for making
         abstracts. This bill provides that there is to be a civil liability, and it also provides
         further that the person violating its provisions shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, uniting
         the civil and the criminal law in one bill. So I think the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName> should consider that question.</p>
        <p>The motion to refer was agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE introduced a bill [S. 356] to provide that no person shall be confined, as an

         licensed by the Board of Trustees of the State Hospital for the Insane, and that said board
         shall visit such asylums at least twice a year, and shall appoint, in each county, a board
         of three or five visitors, whose duty it shall be to inspect the asylums at frequent
         intervals. One provision of the bill allows all persons confined in asylums to consult or
         communicate with any friends or advisers, medical or otherwise, outside, and shall be
         allowed to write such letters as they desire.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This bill prescribes the proceedings which shall be taken to declare a person
         insane before committment to an insane asylum. I move it be referred to the

        <p>Mr. FOWLER offered the following Senate concurrent resolution:</p>

         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the

            Martin for $58,000, be, and it is hereby, authorized to employ a stenographer to take
            and report the evidence in said claim at a compensation of not to exceed $ - per
            day.</p>
          </div>
         </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The Chair will remember, the other day he made a motion to have the bill to
         pay this claim referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, with power to send
         for persons and papers. It was stated at that time that the evidence taken by the House
         Committee in this case was either stolen or lost, I presume the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName>, in order to understand itself, ought to take evidence, and to do that
         they should have a stenographer.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If it is expected that this testimony, when taken, is to be left with a
         committee, I can not see any propriety in having it done. We have been paying some
         stenographers, and I have never heard or seen any of the testimony they have reported. It
         is not essential to have testimony written down for the benefit of a committee, because
         they hear the witnesses. If it is contemplated, when the testimony is taken, that it shall
         be read a part of the report of the committee, then I do not object.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, did not think it necessary to retake this testimony, and opposed the
         resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I presume the committee would not find it necessary to retake all this
         evidence reported they might hear, but the important part of the evidence ought to be taken
         down. There are a good many Senators who would like to know what that evidence is. There is
         a great deal of the evidence which it is necessary to reduce to writing.</p>
        <pb n="41" xml:id="VAA8558-22-389"/>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Where a stenographer is employed the result is the testimony is always so
         bulky that it is never read A clerk who is a rapid writer can put on paper enough testimony
         to enable a committee to form a conclusion quite as correct, and it can be taken down so
         that somebody can read it. We don't employ a short-hand writer in our courts We can employ
         rapid writers who take notes more satisfactory than short-hand writers. I think a clerk for
         $2 or $3 a day can propably do as well as a stenographer for this committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER asked and obtained consent to withdraw his resolution.</p>

        <p>Mr. SELLERS made the point of order that this amendment should have been proposed as an

        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to reconsider the vote by which the report of the committee was
         concurred in, in order to enable the Senator from De Kalb (Mr. Ensley) to offer his
         amendment.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENSLEY now offered his amendment as an amendment to the report of the committee. He
         said: I hope that this amendment will prevail. This bill now provides that by a petition of
         a majority of the tax payers of such county, the County Commissioners may appropriate money
         out of the county revenue, etc. I think that if this bill passes, as it now is, it will
         prove a dead letter and be inoperative. I think that the counties of this State should
         build their soldiers a monument. And there is a strong and fast-growing feeling throughout
         the State in the various counties that they should build a monument for their soldiers.
         Believing that after the State had furnished 200,000 soldiers, the life of the State at
         that time, of which thousands died on the battlefield and in the hospital, on the march
         under the bleaching sun of the South and the cold winds of winter, and in the Southern
         prison pens of Andersonville from starvation and brutal treatment, a horror to history
         without a single grave marked as far as Indiana is concerned. All such sacrifice (which
         never can be repaid by the people of the State) was for a united country, which the living
         of this State is now enjoying. The State has increased in wealth and population and
         prosperity at least double, all of which the State ows to its soldiers. And now we should
         give the counties of this State a law granting County Commissions the power to appropriate
         money for the erection of such monuments. The General Assembly appropriates annually here
         hundreds of thousands - yes millions of dollars - to run the various institutions of the
         State and its State Government; and when a bill is presented to build a monument to brave
         soldiers who died for the protection of our institutions it is crippled by the words, by a
         majority of the taxpayers. I hope the amendment will prevail, and I want to see the day
         when the proud State of Indiana will erect one grand monument at the capital of the State
         in commemoration of its soldier dead that will stand and tower high toward the skies,
         splitting the clouds as they pass swiftly by, with a soldier statuary on its top at order
         arms, as a warning to all future generations of the price of war, which would be a monument
         of beauty and an honor to the State, and which would tend to spread patriotism and loyally
         all over Indiana. I hope my amendment will prevail</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: It is always safe to leave such questions to a majority of residents. He
         opposed authorizing such an additional tax levy in addition to prevent burdens.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The author of the bill states that a majority consent would be difficult to
         obtain. Yet there are petitions signed by majorities in favor of the Legislature voting
         money to relieve officials who have lost money belonging to the public, and certainly a
         petition as large would be obtained for more meritorious cases</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: This is a question of some importance. The committee recommend
         that such appropriations shall not be made without a petition of a majority of taxpayers.
         He favored the amendment. He moved the farther consideration of this matter be postponed
         till 2:30 o'clock, and made the special order for that hour, as it is desirable there shall
         be a full Senate present when a vote is taken on this matter.</p>

        <p>A Senator: A senate resolution has dispensed with all committee clerks.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD thought the statute could not be abrogated by a resolution. The statute
         allots clerks for committees.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ did not think the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> needs a clerk.</p>
        <p>Mr MAY insisted that committees under the statute can appoint clerks, and he made that
         point of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM moved the resolution be referred to a select committee of three.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: The statute provides certain clerks may be appointed by certain

        <p>The recommendation from the Chairman of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> was
         concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY offered a resolution authorizing the Doorkeeper to appoint a paper folder whose
         pay shall date from the first of the session, in order to settle the question raised just
         now.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH raised the point of order that this resolution is out of order.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER overruled this point of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH insisted there was no need of this employe.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY: If this employe is not needed then repeal the statute.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If there is no need for an employe such an one can be discharged or not
         employed. The statute does not compel the employment of any officer or clerk. There has
         been a resolution passed by the Senate discharging all these employes. There are but three
         officers fixed by law, the Principal and Assistant Secretary and the Doorkeeper. The rest
         are employes. Unless there can be a necessity shown for restoring them they should not be
         re-employed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It seems the statute is susceptible of easy construction. In regard to
         committee clerks the standing committees can not employ any more clerks than the statute
         entitles them to. In regard to the paper folder, the Doorkeeper has the right to employ
         that employee among others, according to the statute; the Senate only having control of
         those employes as to the pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend the resolution by so changing it that the Doorkeeper may have
         the right to appoint.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAY accepted the amendment.</p>

        <p>Mr. BENZ when his name was called, said: I was opposed to any employes, but as the

         I think Doorkeeper ought to have a paper-folder, I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to strike from Section 3 all after the words "unmarried women."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE opposed the amendment. The object of retaining the words proposed to be

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE opposed any clause that would give the bill a retroactive application. If such
         a bill is passed applicable to the future it can be productive of no harm.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This objection would apply as well to any part of the bill as to the part
         proposed to be stricken out. There is no reason for striking out those words.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: The amendment would lead to some trouble; while the bill as

        <head rend="center">TAX SALES.</head>
        <p>Mr. SMITH'S, of Jennings, bill [S. 143 concerning the sale of real estate for delinquent
         taxes, and providing for the redemption thereof, and declaring an emergency <pb n="45"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-393"/> was read the second time, with committee recommendations far
         amendment.</p>
        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR this vote was reconsidered. He insisted the penalty was too high
         and the time for redemption too short as fixed by the committee amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE referred to objections made before the committee, and believed the amendments
         proposed were of so great value that without them he could not vote for the bill. It is
         necessary to have a stringent law for the collection of taxes. If the law is so lax that it
         pays a man to let his taxes go delinquent many will do so, while the man who acts honestly
         with the State is more heavily burdened. The man delinquent has a longer time to pay up
         than debtors usually have. Small delinquent land titles will not be purchased unless there
         is a penalty sufficient to reimburse for what is paid out, and also for what the purchaser
         may have to pay an attorney. Compound interest can not be collected — the court has so
         decided.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: It looks like it works a great hardship, but I would vote for the bill as
         originally introduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I have made examination of existing laws, and this bill will
         operate beneficially to all classes. I had better take a half loaf than get no bread. I
         contend that on land sold on execution the owner should have the equitable right to redeem
         by due course of law. The kind of laws we have in reference to sale for delinquent taxes is
         class legislation — a specific kind of laws reaching a certain class of people, and a more
         able class reap the benefits. There should be a right to redeem in one year, but the
          <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> compromised by putting the time at six months. It
         is conceded the right of redemption is inherent. Rather than have no law on the subject I
         consented to the six months redemption clause. There should be no exception, but the law
         should be to give the right to redeem in one year as in other cases. I find Senators who
         were opposed to this bill early in the session are now convinced of its equity and
         right.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to concur in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved to concur in the committee amendment which proposes to
         make the bill prospective and not retroactive.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The committee has acted wisely in proposing these amendments There should be
         no law retroactive if there could be. The State must provide means to to enforce collection
         from taxpayers. This law provides for 20 per cent; probably this is too high, but who would
         be so foolish as to invest his money for only 10 per cent in such a way? With the committee
         amendments bidders may be secured for most of tax sales. All the committee amendments are
         salutary.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend the report of the committee by providing in Section 2 that the
         owner shall have the right to redeem by paying in six months the full amount paid by the
         purchaser, with 8 per cent. interest.</p>
        <p>The motion to amend was rejected upon a division.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH moved to strike out of the report of the committee the repealing clause.
         It is a dangerous provision; at any rate, it would lead to a great deal of litigation.</p>

        <head rend="center">SOLDIERS' MONUMENTS.</head>
        <p>Mr. Ensley's bill [S. 148], considered this forenoon, was taken up as the special order
         for this hour, and read the second time, with a committee report recommending an an
         amendment, inserting the words "upon petition of a majority of the taxpayers," the question
         being on the pending motion to strike from the report those words.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I hope the amendment will not be adopted. The people themselves should be
         consulted as to the levy of taxes otherwise than those needed for the necessary carrying on
         of the Government. Were this bill passed the County Commissioners in every county in the
         State would be called upon to build such monuments.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENSLEY: I have had experience in getting up petitions of this kind. Unless the
         soldiers care to take interest enough in this matter to do so, it would not be done. This
         bill now would allow the counties to erect monuments in commemoration of the valiant deeds
         of these soldiers. I think the County Commissioners are endowed with sufficient
         intelligence and business qualifications to be trusted.</p>
        <p>Mr.FAULKNER reminded the Senator that the Government furnishes a tombstone for the graves
         of dead soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENSLEY: The Government furnishes a slab, but the day would soon come when a monument
         should be erected in each county of the State. I am surprised that any Senator should
         oppose this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH, as Chairman, said the committee carefully considered this bill and came to
         the conclusion that the taxpayers should be consulted before such an expenditure shall be
         ordered by the County Commissioners. The taxpayers are already oppressed, and without the
         committee amendment the bill should not be passed. At home, after the passage of this bill,
         if it should pass, I would sign such a petition.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I should be most willing to show, in all proper way, the debt, this Republic
         owes to its dead soldiery. But such testimonials, in order to be a real tribute, should
         come from willing hands. County Commissioners should not be allowed to divert from the tax
         moneys without the con- <pb n="46" xml:id="VAA8558-22-394"/> sent of taxpayers, either by
         petition or at an election. I think evils might creep in which would do more discredit than
         the monuments would do honor. This bill would be giving to County Commissioners a very
         dangerous power.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I shall vote far the amendment. I am not afraid that County
         Commissioners will be unduly extravagant in the erection of monuments. The amendment of the
         committee will practically render the bill inoperative The people are now a new generation
         — many from the South and from other States — and it might be very difficult to secure a
         majority petition. I would like to see one grand monument here at the capital, and will
         support the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved a substitute for the amendment by adding the word "resident" before the
         word taxpayers in the committee report.</p>
        <p>The substitute was adopted.</p>
        <p>The report of the committee as amended by the substitute was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE moved to refer the bill to a special committee of three with instructions to
         consider the propriety of amending so as to provide for an election to decide the
         question.</p>

        <p>Mr. MARSHALL hoped the majority report would be concurred in; and made that motion. The
         object of the bill is to avoid getting two ballots from the same person in the ballot-box.
         There is no way of determining who put in the extra ballot. There is a way of doubling
         tickets together so when they are put in the ballot-box they fall apart. It has been a
         custom in some towns to blindfold an Inspector and have him draw out of the box the extra
         ballots, but that is unfair to the honest voter. The object of the bill is that every man
         shall have one ballot and shall have that ballot counted. It is in the direction of an
         honest and fair ballot. Suppose it takes an hour longer to count out the tickers, or
         suppose it takes two hours, how often has it occurred that one ballot decides an election?
         Where it is a close vote one vote counts for a great detail.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I am friendly to the bill, but will move to recommit it, with

        <p>Mr. REEVES said: There is no disguising the fact that this bill is meant solely to apply
         to the Recorder's office of Johnson County. The office there was vacated, the Recorder
         leaving for parts unknown The law already provides a means for removing a deputy if he is
         not there lawfully; so that there is no need for a new law. If a man has taken charge of an
         office unlawfully he may be removed under the law; if not unlawfully he should serve. There
         is no necessity for further legislation on this question. I am not here to violate the
         wishes of a county I do not represent. As it has been stated here that the bondsmen of
         Jefferson B. Clemmon were not willing to continue while the deputy, George B. Clemmon,
         served, I desire to have a memorial read from them. [The memorial was here sent to the

        <p>Mr. Foulke's bill [S. 359] coming up with a majority committee report recommending a $20
         000 limit and a minority report recommending a $100 000 limit - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE explained: It is intended to restrict large expenditures by County Com
         missioners without the consent of the tax-payers.</p>
        <p>Mr OVERSTREET: All buildings necessary to the carrying out of the business of the county
         should not be delayed till an expression of the people can be obtained.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY opposed the majority report on this bill. He moved to substitute the minority
         instead of the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr McINTOSH: I had no idea when the bill was introduced but that it would pass
         unanimously. I am in favor of the bill as originally brought in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jay, made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 18; nays, 20 - to lay the bill on
         the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to amend the report of the committee so the limit shall be $50,000</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It should be a rule when a public building is erected at the expense
         of the taxpayers that it should be built with a view of two or three generations ahead of
         the times. This bill would result in putting Boards of Commissioners at the mercy of those
         who would not look far enough in the future. The advanced idea now is to put up good
         buildings and build substantial bridges. With all the safeguards now on the statute book
         this bill would prove vicious.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: In a good many counties there has been a disposition on the part of County
         Commissioners to expend a vast deal more money than is desirable on the part of the
         taxpayers, frequently a large portion of them. An excellent Court-house can be built for
         from $40,000 to $50,000. The one in Wayne County only cost about $20,000, and is ample for
         that large county for years to come. Tens bill proposes nothing but what is just and
         right.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I am in favor of the amendment. There are sometimes large expenditures made
         by County Commissioners which are unwarranted, and in opposition to the wishes of a
         majority of the taxpayers. There is a principle involved in this bill, and that is to put a
         proper check upon the servants of the people, by the people themselves; and that is right.
         It gives the people of any county the right to build as fine buildings as a majority may
         desire. It is beat for the people to regulate such affairs as they seem right.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved the bill and amendments be printed and made a special order Friday at 2
         o'olock.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected upon a division - affirmative, 17; negative, 19.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Any action taken in this direction would embarrass any county desiring a
         public building. An officer should not be afraid to move until instructed; if it were
         otherwise he would not amount to much. Commissioners will not be extravagant more than
         necessities require. The statute requires they shall provide a Court house and a place for
         all the county offices. A fire proof Court-house can not be built for $50,000. Such a bill
         would <pb n="49" xml:id="VAA8558-22-397"/> accomplish nothing. Commissioner should have the
         discretion to act in such matters.</p>
        <p>The $50,000 amendment was amended to by yeas 24 nays 14</p>
        <p>The minority report as amended was concurred in</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOULKE the bill was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH moved that the bill be ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I hope the motion will not prevail. There are bad features in the
         bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I understand in Ohio the Commissioners are not allowed to tax the people
         for an expenditure of over $10,000 without first obtaining consent of the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR opposed the motion.</p>

        <p>On motion of Mr CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, his bill [S. 164] concerning the hiring of
         convict labor was read the second time, with a committee amendment changing the hours for a
         day's work from eight to nine hours. He said: After two years of careful study on this
         question I have embodied my conclusions in this bill. The object of eight hours for a day's
         work is to cut down the product of convict labor about 20 per cent The free laborers of the
         State do not have an opportunity to produce more on an average than would amount to what
         could he done in eight hours a day. This bill is an effort to help free labor as much as
         possible. The man who once gets a contract in these prisons has a monopoly forever, under
         what is called the lapping co tracts; so there is no competition as between those desiring
         to employ prison labor. Section 6 of this bill is intended to open competition for convict
         labor. The question is how best can this labor be regulated so as not to come into
         injurious conflict with free labor. This bill does this as far as practical by limiting
         amount of product, and putting it in such competition as to bring the highest price.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend by striking out all except Section 6 of the bill, which is
         intended to prevent the lapping of contracts.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The committee report as amended was concurred in.</p>

        <head rend="center">INTEREST AND USURY.</head>
        <p>Mr Smith's, of Jay, bill [S. 179] to fix a penalty of five times the usurious interest
         bargained for was read the second time. He explained the penalty is now so small for the
         exaction of usurious interest that the law is practically inoperative. The bill simply
         re-enacts the law in operation previous to 1881.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Every county and every business man would be seriously injured by this bid,
         which prescribes penal offense. The penalties do not accomplish the purposes designed.
         Wherever a contract of this kind is made the subject of a penal statute the contract is
         void. The bill would be simply for the protection of scoundrels. A law of this kind would
         cast suspicion upon all commercial paper. The bill has no merit of any kind. He moved to
         lay the bill on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 13, nays 23.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, voted "aye" for the purpose of moving a reconsideration of the vote
         just taken, that he might reply to the objection made against this bill that it would
         injuriously affect commercial paper. The bill is just. No person should be protected in
         charging usurious interest. If there is to be no penalty for usurious interest, then do not
         enact a law fixing any rate of interest. The bill ought to pass, and should become a
         law</p>

        <p>Mr. Foulke's bill [S. 122] to remove disabilities of married women, coming up as the

         "and that all disabilities of coverture shall cease."</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE offered an amendment entitling the husband on the death of the wife to the
         same interest she would have were he to die first.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to amend by adding to Section 1 the following: "Provided that no
         married woman shall become surety for her husband or any other person "</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am opposed to this amendment. The old law proceeded upon the idea that a
         married woman was sui generis - she could not act in any capacity separate from her
         husband. There is still a remnant of that old idea in the law which now exists. In
         accordance with the spirits that pervade our American institutions to-day, she is as
         competent to manage her own affairs as she was before marriage. The only way to protect her
         is to allow her to protect herself. The bill is right in principle, and I <pb n="50"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-398"/>should regret to see this amendment incorporated in it</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: While many do not need that protection, yet many are dependent on their
         husbands for the management of their business. The law ought to protect her from becoming
         security, not only for strangers, but her husband. This bill ought not to pass without this
         provision.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 18, nays 23</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. MAY, when his name was called, said: I oppose the bill, but believing it less

        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET, in explanation of his vote, said: This amendment in no sense differs from
         the present law, and therefore I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, when called upon to vote, said: I am against this bill, but if it

        <p>Mr. WEIR, in explanation of his vote, said: I am opposed to the bill, but if it should

        <p>So the amendment was rejected.</p>

         shall ever be made liable for damages for any breach of such covenant.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 17; nays, 24 - to lay the amendment
         on the table.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS moved to amend so that a married woman shall have no right to encumber land by
         mortgage. He said: I believe the disposition of lands should not be made without the
         consent of both consortors.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I believe the time has come when litigation will be saved by putting
         married women on an equal footing with their husbands. We have complications in law growing
         out of the statutes of 1879 and 1881, and the sooner we put married women, so far as the
         management and ownership of property is concerned, on an equal footing with men, the better
         it will be for all concerned.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 16, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe the

         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELEY, when his name was called, said: I am opposed to this bill and shall vote

         on execution was read the second time, with a favorable committee report.</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to concur in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKIS0N explained: The bill is in the interest of the poor man. It proposes a
         freehold homestead, but does not change the present law in regard to the exemption of
         personal property. It is not exempt for purchase money or for material purchased or labor
         done thereon. The bill is almost a literal copy of a bill introduced in the House of
         Representatives (by Mr. Linsday). It behooves to afford that relief to our citizens which
         States around us have. The bill gives no chance for a fraud. It is only the industrious,
         honest and economical man that can hold a homestead under this bill. I hope the bill will

         execution and the owner shall encumber it in no way. It is for the protection not only of
         the man, but of his wife and children also. As the bill stands it is no exemption, because
         homesteads would be encumbered with mortgages and in a short time would be lost.</p>

        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I am apprehensive the Senator and some other Senators do not understand
         what this bill is. There is a provision in the law that any toll road ma be purchased where
         an affirmative vote is had. This bill provides where the vote is negative a majority of all
         were assessed for its building may petition for the renewal of a charter running not to
         exceed twenty years, with a restriction that the tolls shall be one-half authorized under
         the original charter. All we ask is to have our roads kept up. I insist the bill is a good
         one, and ought to become a law if it is proposed to keep up gravel roads at all</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Delaware: It seems to me the argument is not consistent with the object of
         the bill. It decreases the rates of toll so that but few roads could maintain themselves in
         my opinion. The roads in my counties barely pay with full rate tolls. I do not think this
         is a good bill. The bill proposes an unjust and unwarrantable discrimination against a
         certain class of roads and ought not to pass</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas 5, nays 21.</p>

        <p>Mr. JOHNSTON, of Dearborn, when his name was called, said: I have not taken up much of
         the time of the Senate in explaining my votes this session, but I will take this
         opportunity to consume a few moments time, as the Senate seems to have plenty of time to
         bestow on foolishness this afternoon. I therefore wish to say to the Senate that we passed
         a resolution a few days ago dispensing with a great many clerks and doorkeepers, and the

        <p>The SPEAKER: I want to say this for the first and last time and forever. There has not
         been fifteen minutes of necessary work done in this House since last Thursday afternoon.
         The time has been occupied in the offering of useless resolutions and with talk. Here we
         sat during yesterday wait log for a quorum that did not arrive, and unable to transact
         business. The matter bas become ridiculous, or fast traveling in that direction. And
         although he did not say they might not yet justify themselves, but he would say that so far
         as he was concerned he would use every possible effort to stop this thing of wasting time.
         He would add that without desiring to become offensive he would much prefer to leave the
         chair and leave the House than to see the time wasted as it had been the last two or three
         days. He had felt it his duty to say this much, and to call the attention of the House to
         the fact that their constituents expected them to work, and not to adjourn over for three
         or four days and then nave no quorum when they reassembled for the transaction of business.
         And now if the House did not choose to heed his suggestion he promised the House that he
         would say no more about the matter until the crack of doom.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN offered the following resolution:</p>
        <floatingText>
         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>Resolved, That the Speaker is not justified in his criticisms upon the members of this
            House, as it is not the province or duty of the presiding officer to formulate policies
            or dictate the conduct of members, or impair the dignity of the chair by delivering
            curtain lectures therefrom upon the conduct of the members,</p>

        <p>Pending the roll call -</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM, explaining his vote, said: The Speaker does not indulge in many lectures, and I
         believe that the criticism was in some measure merited. I vote "aye."</p>
        <pb n="53" xml:id="VAA8558-22-401"/>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I think that the remarks of the Speaker were well timed and in proper place,
         so I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I feel that the Speaker's remarks were certainly uncalled for. It is hardly
         the place of the Speaker to lecture the members on this floor. His duty is that of a
         presiding officer and not a censor. As a fact, he has many times himself held back the
         business of this House. His criticism, if criticism it may be called, of the members was
         indiscriminate. As for myself, I have been at all times in my seat unless sick. While I do
         not like the wording of the resolution, yet the remarks of the Speaker were unauthorized
         and out of place. The lack of a quorum was the result of circumstances and the fault of no
         one intentionally. As to rejecting the resolution I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY. I believe I never cast a vote which perplexed me as this. While I do not think
         in was the province of the Speaker to indulge in the remarks he did, yet I do not like the
         wording of the resolution. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: As I don't regard the Speaker's words a lecture, but advice which he was in
         place in giving, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: This resolution does not refer to advice, but a lecture on the part of the
         Speaker, his criticism of the conduct of members Every member has come here to do his duty.
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I do not regard the remarks of the Speaker as personal. It was advice for the
         future guidance of members. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS: The remarks of the Speaker were directed toward those only, I believe, who
         make long winded speeches. As for myself I do not believe that I was included in the
         remarks. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I believe that here the powers and responsibility go together. I belong to
         that class having no power and therefore no responsibility. The remarks of the Speaker were
         certainly directed to the majority and were well timed. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I regret exceedingly that I am in a position to vote on the
         merit of the resolution. I would vote to table it, but it now stands upon its merits. The
         resolution is tr angular. It refers to the Speaker, the resolution maker and the press.
         Scattered as it will be by the latter the remarks of the Speaker will be taken in a bad
         light. As for myself I can not see that the remarks can apply to me. I have been here two
         terms. I have never been absent save when sent away by the House, have dodged but two
         votes, and my only failure has been to talk a little. However, upon the resolution I shall
         have to vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: No one has a higher regard for the members on this floor than I. I think the
         criticism of the Speaker was eminently just. It is much better that it came from him than
         from the public or from our constituents. I regret only that the Speaker was compelled to
         do it.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: There is no one here who has a higher regard for the Speaker than I; but I
         must say that this lecture or criticism of his was not deserved. Had he said that we as
         members should proceed more rapidly or better, then he would have been in place; but to say
         officially that our conduct has been wrong, is beyond his bounds. If my friend should do
         wrong I will be the first to tell him, and on that principle I would say as much to the
         Speaker, but not on this floor. I would fell him without publication It should nave been
         the same with the Speaker. We are not school children, that we are to be chastised by the
         man whom we have put in that Speaker's chair. We are accountable only to our constituents -
         only to them, and not to the Speaker nor to the members on this floor. I stand here as a
         man, a freeman. I like to see men stand here as freemen. I know of men here who think as I
         do, but who, from abject weakness, have voted against this resolution. I remember when
         Governor Williams essayed to read a lecture to the General Assembly. Although a personal
         friend and neighbor of the Governor, I resented it. As to the Speaker, I believe that
         officially he has done wrong; personally he has not. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I do not believe that the Speaker has said more to us this morning than the
         people, our constituents, have. It is our duty to forward business. It is charged that we
         are here for the per diem. For myself, my record shows me clear from that. I may not agree
         with every word of the Speaker, but in the main he was correct. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I do not understand that the remarks of the Speaker were either reprimand or
         criticism, but advice to get down to business. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the resolution was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr ENGLE offered a resolution to censure Mr. Patten (or the resolution offered against
         the Speaker.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I hope the gentleman will withdraw the resolution, so that this matter will
         cease.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: If any member of this House thinks that I deserve censure I will resign and

        <p>Mr. MOCK said that the bill would fall far short of its intention to prevent the illegal
         sale of intoxicating liquors by druggists.</p>
        <p>Mr FRENCH: I do not see how this law will prevent the sale of liquors by druggists. A man
         who would violate the law by illegal selling would violate it in other ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: There is either some mistake in engrossing this bill or it is very peculiar. I
         think the bill is a very bad one on general principles.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: In our county of the hills, in my town are two stores and neither of them
         sell liquor illegally. I do not now propose to come up and give them the trouble proposed
         in this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: I believe that the drug business is an honorable one and that honorable men
         engage in it We have no right to undertake to drag them down.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS: Our most respectable druggists ask the passage of the bill. It can do harm
         to honesty.</p>

        <p>Mr. ADAMS: This question of the removal of county seats is a harassing one and should be
         dealt with carefully. This bill is not satisfactory.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNING: This bill is meant solely to affect the county seat of Greene County. It is
         desired to change the county seat there. It should not be done for the reason that such
         procedure would take away the value of property at the present county seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: There is war in my county over the relocation of our county site, I am pledged
         to not vote for this bill, but am not pledged to vote against it. Therefore, in justice to
         my constituents on both sides of the question, I ask this House to excuse me from voting on

        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR the bill [S. 324] to pay Matthew M, Campbell for extra and other
         services as a teacher in the Indiana University - $1,700 - with a committee recommendation
         that it lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON moved that the bill be recommitted.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR inquired if there was any additional evidence - if not, it would not be
         necessary to recommit.</p>
        <p>Mr OVERSTREET: I have been watching for this bill I hope it will be recommitted I don't
         undertake to say there is a legal right to recover; but if there ever was an equitable
         claim this is one. I was in the institution at the time of the service referred to and
         there never was a more faithful Professor. I am informed that he is now in quite destitute
         circumstances. If that were not so, it is probable he would not ask this pittance. At the
         last session this bill was put in the specific bill, and, I think, passed the Senate. We
         frequently hear of claims being allowed here on the ground of equity; this certainly is one
         based on equity. If this claim was ever before the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> I
         have no recollection of it</p>

         </choice> this claim to a select committee of three, and that my name be left off the
         committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: While investigating; this claim two years ago Senator Johnson, who was
         chairman of the committee, said there was no claim and no pretension there ever was a debt
         on the part of the State. The Senator is mistaken about the result of the claim. I think it
         was defeated. It also came out; two years ago that the claim does not belong to the old
         Professor, but it has been farmed out.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I am in favor of the special committee. No harm can come of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have the understanding the Professor was paid every dollar, and if he
         gets anything more it will be a gift or a donation. I heard this claim discussed four years
         ago and two years ago and I think the Legislature has spent two dollars for one on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware: I was on a committee four years ago, which examined this claim,
         and I went to Bloomington and examined into it and found there was no claim except an
         equitable one; we found there were here in the city lawyers who would have received the
         money, and in consequence of that we did not report it back. I am in favor of the motion
         for a special committee.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill, by implication, repeals the other section of the code which

        <p>On motion by Mr. Hilligass the bill S. 170; concerning liens and mortgages, was taken
         up.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: I represent a loan company that has perhaps loaned as much money in Indiana
         as any other company. We have never charged any more interest on account of this law. We
         take an affidavit that they have not executed or permitted to be executed any deed or
         incumbrance in the past fifty days. The people have got used to the present system. It
         seems to me such a law as this bill proposes would be to open the door to fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE. There are several reason that satisfy me this is a good bill. No possible
         fraud can be perpetrated under it that can not be guarded against. We have been advancing
         in the direction of this kind of a law for many years There is not a State I know of but
         what has not adopted a role that priority shall date from the time of putting on record.
         This bill is in the direction of preventing fraud, and the bill ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: If this bill is passed it seems to me there would be a greater temptation
         to commit fraud. I would be willing to bring the time for recording mortgages down to ten
         days - the time for <pb n="57" xml:id="VAA8558-22-405"/>
         <choice>
          <sic>chattlel</sic>
          <corr>chattel</corr>
         </choice> mortgages. I fear this bill would lead to more frauds than we now have; yet the
         principle looks to me not far from wrong.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: In the interest of honesty and fair dealing, I hope this bill will not pass.
         It is a snare. To say the one that gets into the Recorder's office shall have priority over
         all others, seems a wrong principle. I move to recommit this bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
          Committee</orgName>, with instructions to amend by loaning the time ten days.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I hope the bill will pass The practical effect of it would be very
         different from what some Senators think A man loaning money and taking a mortgage may
         frequently require an affidavit, but as a general thing the word of the borrower is taken
         in ninety-nine cases out of 100 If the law is changed as proposed by this bill it may be
         known in a very few days whether there was a mortgage executed before his and put upon
         record The opportunities are greater for fraud under the present law than they would be
         under this bill. The very fact that a man knows he has forty five days time in which to put
         a mortgage on record, is a reason for carelessness. The law ought to educate parties in the
         the necessity of putting such instruments on word. The more populous a State or county or
         city becomes, the more must records be relied upon. I believe the time has come in this
         State when the law ought to be changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations - </p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 20; nays, 25 - to order the bill
         engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I know the great real estate interests of New York could not be carried on
         under our law. I know large amounts of capital have been kept out of this State for »h«
         reason that titles are not to good. This bill can not work harm to a single man on earth.
         It is the man who has his mortgage recorded early that is protected and not the man who
         sleeps upon his rights</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The great real estate interest of Indiana has been very well carried on for
         many years, and I have never heard of any frauds. It may be there have been - it would be
         wonderful if there had not been. We are not here to legislate for insurance or loan
         companies but the people of our own State. I believe this bill would be dangerous and
         prolific of fraud</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The Senator who has just taken his seat has but little understanding of
         the provisions of this bill. The present statute gives much more opportunity for fraud You
         make these transactions rest upon the day they are made, and there are transactions brought
         to daylight. This bill is legislation in the interest of the people; and the statement that
         it is in the interest of insurance or loan companies is an appeal to prejudice that is not
         warranted in this case. This bill ought to be passed, and in doing so we would but be
         keeping pace with the great States of this Union. There is merit in this bill, and Senators
         should give it a fair chance. I hope it will be recommitted and put on the same plane as
         chattel mortgages.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The theory of law is to protect the diligent man. At first I did not look so
         favorably upon this bill, but now I am in favor of the bill and hope it will not be
         indefinitely postponed.</p>

         While reasonable law on this subject would fee a proper one, this bill makes a most

        <p>Mr. ADAMS made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 31; nays, 63 - that this motion lie on the
         table.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, explaining his vote, said: I am in favor of tabling this motion because we can
         reach this bill as soon, or sooner, without it. I understand the gentleman from Tippecanoe
         (Mr Smith) will bring up the bill on the call of his county, which is now at hand.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman has named that bill on the call of his county.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLELLAND: My county is the first to be called this morning, and,unsolicited, I had
         selected the bill. Sol vote to table the motion.</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above. So the motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>The motion to make the a special order for 10:30 o'clock was agreed to by yeas 88 nays
         0.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, when his name was called said: Two years ago I had the pleasure of voting
         against making this man Goar aa Trustee, and also in voting against taking the government
         of the institution from the hands of the Governor. I have all along kept my faith regarding
         this regular order but for some reason - public counsel or private twitting of conscience -
         members here have decided to take the matter up now. I want to oust every scoundrel from
         that institution at once, so I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. KELLISON, explaining his vote, said: As this motion implies that the House will
         remain in session after its legitimate business is done, and as I do not believe the would
         continue after the business is done, I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: This special session was called to transact the necessary business, and I do
         not believe that it will remain longer than to do that, so I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: This House, I believe, adjourn when the necessary business is done. This motion
         is made only to put us on the record and I vote "no" anyhow.</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Inasmuch as I believe that this House should work diligently until necessary
         business is done, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr RIVERS: Believing that this House will adjourn as soon as its necessary business is
         done, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This session was called by the Governor to pass the
         appropriation bill, the State House bill, and necessary legislation. The Knightstown matter
         was not mentioned in the proclamation. The Senate has passed a resolution to adjourn on the
         25th, and now this resolution proposes the 26th. That means that we <pb n="59"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-407"/> are to be at loggerheads. This motion means to put as in a box,

        <p>Mr. SAYRE moved that the bill [H. R. 527] relative to the Knightstown Benevolent
         Institution, which was made a special order for this hour, be read, under a suspension of
         the rules, a second time by title, considered engrossed, read a third time by sections and
         put upon its passage.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 65, nays 23, two-thirds failing to vote
         affirmatively.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM, explaining his vote, said that he was opposed to considering the bill
         engrossed, as be had an amendment to offer, and the motion would shut oft any
         amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved to amend so that two of the Trustees be honorably discharged Union
         soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, moved to amend the amendment that all the parties to honorably
         discharged soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr BOYD moved a substitute for both amendments that all be honorably discharged
         soldiers</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I am opposed to the substitute only for this reason - that I would I like
         one of the Trustees to be a woman.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: As author of the bill, I am in favor of the Trustees being honorably discharged
         soldiers, but I do not, as a result of my investigations, favor a woman for Trustee</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: Was not John M. Goar an honorably discharged Union soldier, and did he
         protect the institution?</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I do not think that the soldiers ask for the management of the institution.
         We should not be first to take this step.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I think you will find that the soldiers desire to care far the
         institute where are the orphans of their comrades. I do not say that all soldiers are good
         men, nor that all good men are soldiers, but I do say that the Governor can find capable
         men who are soldiers to manage that institution. I am willing that two good Democratic
         soldiers should be there. I want one trusty Republican to make it non-partisan.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: Every man claims to be a soldiers' friend - especially when stumping the
         State. Now is our time to show our hand. The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) thinks we
         should not take this step, as it is not observed elsewhere. It is time for Indiana to step
         to the front in this direction.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I do not believe the gentleman from Morgan (Mr. Adams) is sincere in his
         utterances concerning love for the Soldiers' Home. Four years aero, when a gallant soldier
         was before the Republicans for their votes for the Presidency, that hero of Gettysburg was
         not - </p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND (interrupting): Where was General Garfield - was he not at Chicamauga?</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: He took to the rear with Rosecrans then.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I do not see what the battles of Gettysburg have to do with the Knightstown
         institute.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I was at Chicamauga fighting for my country, and I did not see the gentleman
         from Morgan, who claims this love for the soldier, there, either.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman from Morgan was in the Mexican War with me, though.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: The Grand Army of the Republic does not demand this. The Republican party has
         not done anything that it should step in here as the soldier's friend. Even your President,
         who was commander and chief of the G. A. R., when he had power - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe (interposing): I hope the gentleman will not attack a
         distinguished soldier, especially when he is dying.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I am as good a friend of General Grant as the gentleman from Tippecanoe. I
         soldiered with him. The G. A. R. stands as an organization for its own protection. I has
         never asked the Republican party for a thing It does not ask special legislation in its
         behalf. The soldiers do not want special benefits. This move is all for buncombe by
         Republicans. The greatest friend the soldier had for many years is the Democratic chief,
         Hon. D. W. Voorhees. [Applause] He has done more for them than all your Grants or
         Garfields.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: He called them "Lincoln dogs."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: No, he never did. That was an infamous lie.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: Then your own citizens are liars.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: None of them have ever said that Voorhees said that thing. It was concocted
         by newspapers, and is false.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: A very small matter has here grown to large proportions. Let me remind you
         that whatever profession the members here may make, the public will go back to the record.
         It will be remembered that nowhere save in this Democratic House is Daniel W. Voorhees put
         above General Grant and James A. Garfield as the original friend of the Union soldier. That
         grand Union soldier who has received the honors of all civilized nations, as the greatest
         of all living soldiers, is put second to D W. Voorhees as a friend to the <choice>
          <sic>solder</sic>
          <corr>soldier</corr>
         </choice> - put there to suit the exigencies of the Democratic party - a party which by its
         blunders and incompetent legislation has made the damnable things which have transpired at
         Knightstown possible [Applause.] The soldiers may not demand the management of that
         institution, but they are modest; but they have the right to it. There are Democratic
         soldiers worthy of the place. Talk about political clap trap! <pb n="60"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-408"/> What is it, if it were not uttered by the gentleman from
         Sullivan (Mr. Patten)? And he comes here from the battlefield himself and belittles the
         soldiers of this State. You have tried that Knightstown Institution as a political
         institution and have failed. Let the soldiers govern it awhile. That infamy at Knightstown
         has gone on two years, yet no Democratic hand was raised against it. The Democratic
         damnable practices went on - by Democrats alone, and you can not get around it. It is fair
         and just and right that we turn over that institution to the soldiers. [Applause] I dare
         you to vote it down, and thus to say that the soldiers are not competent to manage it.
         Politics were lugged in here and had no place. The attempt to belittle James A. Garfield
         will be regarded with contempt by all decent men in Indiana. [Applause.] The criticism of a
         pigmy to a large brain, a grain of sand to the ocean, a man without color to a man who will
         live in all time - and this charge, too, against a man who sleeps in the earth. It is a
         triade against a man who has a higher place in the American heart than any other man. Drag
         down his name thus and then make a place for some ward bummer or some camp follower. Can't
         we, in God's name, find other sources for political capital? I move the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>The previous question was seconded by the House and the substitute to the amendment that
         all the Trustees be honorably discharged soldiers was agreed to by yeas 46 nays 41.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOOE, explaining his vote, said: Because I believe that it is outside the soldiery of
         Indiana and because I do not want to handicap the Governor, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: The proposition is to give the Governor the power to appoint, yet some propose
         to dictate to the Governor; and the gentleman from Grant (Mr. Brownlee) after making a mean
         speech, has very coolly moved the previous question Is that bravery? So we are to be cut
         off without a word. My friend from Tippecanoe (Mr. Smith) criticised the removal of a blind
         man from the Superintendency of the Asylum for the Blind. He claims that the blind should
         lead the blind. By the same process of reasoning he would have an insane man Superintendent
         of the Asylum for the Insane. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr HOBAN: My reason for opposing this amendment is that I think the Legislature has no
         right to discriminate between soldiers and civilians. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits
         it. We have no right to make distinctions. Every man should, under the law, be entitled to
         manage this trust. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr KELLISON: For the reason that over one half of the soldiers are Democrats to day, and
         were during the war; for the reason that in my county over one half of the soldiers are
         Democrats; for the reason that they are not asking this; for the reason that the
         institution is supported by men of all parties and for decency's and humanity's sake I
         think one of the Trustees should be a woman. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Warrick: For the reason that the soldiers are not demanding it, and for the
         further reason that I have confidence in the Governor of this State, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: For the sole reason that I think a woman should be selected as one of the
         Trustees, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the amendment that the Trustees be soldiers was agreed to.</p>

         </choice> an amendment to the bill that one of the Trustees be a woman.</p>
        <p>The Speaker ruled it out of order, in view of the amendment just adopted by the House
         that all the Trustees shall be honorably discharged soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS moved to amend that the Superintendent be an honorably discharged soldier.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLIS0N moved to amend the amendment that the Superintendent be a woman and the
         widow of an honorably discharged soldier.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I hope the amendment to the amendment will not prevail. A live business man
         should be Superintendent there.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WYNN the amendment to the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 63,
         nays 22.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. LOYD the amendment that the Superintendent bean honorably discharged
         soldier was also laid on the table by yeas 45 nays 38.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON moved to amend so that no two Trustees can be of the same political
         party.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 42; nays, 43 - that the amendment be
         laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr GOODING, explaining his vote, said he was opposed to dictating to the Governor; but if
         it were found necessary to divide, he was in favor of the Green backers (represented by Mr.
         Robinson) rather than Republicans. He voted "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN moved that the bill and pending amendments be recommitted to a select
         committee of three, to be appointed by the Speaker, with instructions to report it back to
         the House at 2 o'clock to-morrow, and that it be made a special order for the hour.</p>
        <p>Mr KELLISON: I hope the motion will not prevail. All the defect cited by the gentleman
         can be overcome by amending the title.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: This outrage has gone far enough. It is time now to take up the bill and pass
         it. The regular order of business was suspended for that purpose. Let the matter now go
         through. To-morrow afternoon some of the Democrats may move to further commit. No further
         delay should <pb n="61" xml:id="VAA8558-22-409"/> be tolerated. When it became known that a
         Republican would call up this bill the Democrats rush in, propose to take up the bill and
         then postpone it.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I can not see how this bill can be helped by postponing. As an humble
         Representative of this Assembly I profess to represent the Democracy. The Republican
         members are on record as opposing bringing up this bill, having voted against it during the
         regular session, claiming a contract for a regular order. What has come over them now that
         they propose to break the alleged contract? Some action should now be taken. I am not a
         stickler for this bill because I am its author Some prefer the Senate bill. Let it pass -
         anything to wipe out the disgrace.</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The gentleman who has just spoken, at one time said that he
         regarded the Senate bill an insult to the committee which had investigated the Knightstown
         trouble. All the records made here will amount to nothing - nothing more than to encumber
         the journal. I am opposed to recommitting the bill</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I oppose recommitting the bill. The only objection to it is the title, and we
         can correct it by simple substituting the title of the Senate bill. One hour and all
         trouble can be corrected.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. Gordon the motion to recommit was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>The amendment that no two of the same political party be selected Trustees was agreed
         to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BARNEY the salaries of the Trustees were fixed at $400 instead of $500
         per year.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DEEM the bill was further amended so that the salary of the Trustees
         shall cover all traveling expenses, and that no further money be allowed them.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. GORDON the title was amended to conform with the bill as amended.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved that the bill be considered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS moved to amend that the bill be ordered engrossed and be made a special order

        <p>Mr. BROWN'S bill [S 145] to amend Section 4,998 of the code concerning elections - the
         polls may be opened at 6 o'clock in the forenoon upon petition of twenty voters and
         freeholders - coming up in regular order, it was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I believe that provision would be injurious. It would lead to trouble. If
         persons want to practice deception they would be apt to do so before substantial men could
         get to the polls, and then get in their dirty work.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: This is an exact copy of the present law down to the word "provided." The
         object is to give opportunity for laboring men to go to the polls, and not have to lose a
         day's work by so doing on election day. It is a pretty general rule in all manufactories
         that men must lose all day if they lose an hour or two in going to the polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: This bill is for the convenience of workers in large manufacturing
         establishments and for railroad men. It is a bill that will give great relief, and is not
         open to the objection urged by the Senator from Johnson (Mr. Overstreet). It is also a copy
         of the law in Ohio.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: The bill is unnecessary and dangerous There are no
         manufactories, as far as I know, but give their employes time to vote. The bill proposes
         undue haste, when we consider the dignity of the voting privilege.</p>

        <p>Mr. SCHL0SS Metropolitan Police bill [S. 175] coming up as a special order on the second
         reading with a committee report favoring an amendment making it applicable to cities of
         12,000 instead of 16,000, and a minority report recommending that the bill lie on the table
         - </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, spoke in favor of the bill. Had it not been introduced he
         would have brought forward elicit a measure. At his suggestion an amendment is now proposed
         to reduce the required number of inhabitants of a city to which its provisions shall apply
         from 16,000 to 12 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: A good deal has been said about this being a civil service reform measure. I
         am ardently in favor of civil service reform in every case; if it is a good thing for a
         policeman it ought to be a good thing for a fireman. But I am opposed to the Metropolitan
         Police bill because it violates the principle that each city and community should manage
         its affairs in its own way and should have the right to determine whether or not each city
         desires to leave its police system in the hands of its council, which costs nothing, or to
         Police Commissioners who will cost $3 000 or $4 000 per annum or more To say they shall
         necessarily have a Board of Police Commissioners they do not want and that a majority of
         the people are opposed to is a thing I do not believe we have a right to force upon them.
         In Richmond there is only one dissenting voice against 9 000 who say they do not want such
         a Metropolitan Police bill. The principle is wrong.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to amend by appropriately inserting the words "less than 25,000"
         in the first section.</p>
        <p>Mr NULL made an ineffectual motion - yeas 19; nays, 22 - to substitute the minority for
         the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON in explaining his vote, said: I was very much opposed to the Metropolitan
         Police system when first introduced, but it has worked so well that I am in favor of it
         now, and shall vote for its introduction elsewhere. The minorities of all cities should
         favor the Metropolitan Police system. Strangers and all classes of people should be
         protected, and in my opinion you can not get a local police that will do justice on
         election day. I have seen the police arrest men in this city and keep them in duress for
         hours simply to influence elections. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to amend the majority report by substituting the words "Board of
         Alderman and Common Council of said city," instead of the words "Governor, Secretary and
         Auditor of State," and providing for the election of said Commissioners by the Alderman and
         Council, and fixing the number of inhabitants at 29 000 to which the bill shall apply. He
         said: I concur in the statement that the people of every local- <pb n="64"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-412"/> ity should decide for themselves what is best for their own
         good. I am utterly opposed to the Metropolitan Police hill being extended to a single city
         in its present form. My amendment only applies to the two cities now provided with a
         Metropolitan Police system. Under my amendment the minority in the Common Council can
         designate their representative on the Police Board.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: In principle I am opposed to this kind of legislation. Matters of
         local importance should be controlled by the people of each particular locality. I
         challenge history to show where local self government has ever been denied the people
         except by Republican legislation. We do not have to go far back to find acts of Congress
         that have disfranchised whole States, and the inhabitants thereof have been ruled by those
         who were not inhabitants of those States. And it was a question whether free government
         would live or would perish at the hands of eminent civil service reformers like the Senator
         from Wayne. Home rule has been adhered to by the Democratic party since America took her
         stand among the nations of the earth. You gentlemen who talk about home rule and self
         government are from that party which has denied the people self-government. In the days of
         reconstruction negroes fresh from slavery were put in legislative halls at the point of the
         bayonet. U. S troops armed and equipped marched into the legislative halls of Louisiana and
         installed usurpers in the place of duly elected representatives of the people. You have
         been in favor of local self government when it would make votes for the Republican party
         and opposed to it when it would lose votes. I sat in this hall two years ago when it was
         full of policemen, armed with revolvers and sand bags, kept here by the Republican party
         represented by the then Lieutenant Governor, when the friends of the civil service reformer
         was trying to talk time to death. The necessity of a Metropolitan Police bill in
         Indianapolis grew out of the condition of affairs because of mis-management of the
         Republican party. Matters got so corrupt an election was known to be a Republican election,
         and every Republican policeman was understood to be worth twenty-five votes. There never
         was a city so badly disgraced by a police force as was the city of Indianapolis. It was
         that there should be a change for the better that the people of Indiana demanded there
         should be a police bill for the city of Indianapolis. It was not an appeal far relief from
         Indianapolis alone; I saw appeals from papers outside, stating that unless better
         government was had country merchants would not come here to buy their goods. If localities
         will not protect the people, a power above it must do so. The Metropolitan Police bill was
         a godsend to relieve them from the bonds of tyranny and corruption that held them down to
         the ground No citizen of Indianapolis who pays a tax and has due regard for his rights
         would come in here and ask for the repeal of that law. The Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter)
         desires by his amendment to pass these good results to the cesspool from which they sprang.
         I hope the amendment will be defeated and because I do not see the necessity for any more
         Metropolitan Police bills in Indiana I hope the bill will sleep the sleep that will know no
         waking till the gavel falls at the last hour of this session.</p>
        <p>Mr MARSBALL: I think the amendment is fair and just, and hope it will be adopted As a
         Republican among the other fifteen on this floor, we have been continually hearing from the
         Senator who has just spoken that the Republican party have been preventing the people from
         governing themselves. I deny that, if the people have I ever been denied self-government,
         it has been done by the Republican party. As a Republican, young in those days, I find
         nothing in the history of that party where it has disfranchised the people on any occasion.
         The whole trouble of the election in the Southern States must have been committed by
         Democrats, because I have heard on this floor the statement that the majority of the
         soldiers were Democrats. Talk about taking the rights of the people away! by, when the
         colored people were knocking for admission a Democratic Senate in Indiana broke a quorum
         and went home in order to defeat a measure to enfranchise them. The resolutions and
         platforms of the Democratic party about 1860 and after stated the war was a failure and
         they wanted peace. I would as soon expect to find reform in the Democratic party as to find
         an iceberg in Florida or an orange blossom in Iceland. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr SELLERS moved a substitute for the amendment by inserting "and less than 26,500, and
         in all cities having a population of over 29 000," and demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to second the demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I have peculiar ideas upon the organization of the police force, and I
         believe the State should make it a creature of law. But I see a disposition to exclude some
         cities and include others. This proposition dues not meet my approbation. I am not in favor
         of either amendment but would prefer the one offered by the Sector from Marion (Mr Winter).
         I move to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>

         orphans are to be kept separate from the feeble-minded. The appointment of Trustees is left
         with the Governor, without confirmation by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: When I came here, six weeks ago, having just recovered from
         an illness which had prostrated me for months, I found among the bills warmly advocated by
         my Democratic colleagues the Metropolitan Police bill, introduced by the Senator from Vigo
         (Mr. Schloss) If it had been possible for me to be present here at the opening of the
         session I should myself have introduced a bill establishing a Metropolitan Police and Fire
         Department of a non-partisan character, merely aiming at the greater security of the
         persons and property of the inhabitants of our cities; but since illness prevented my
         presence I was glad to find upon my arrival here that my attention had, if not fully, at
         least in part, been carried out by the introduction of the bill we now have under
         consideration. I expressed this pleasure to the author of the bill, and Senator Schloss
         seemed to be highly pleased in having found in me a new advocate and friend of a measure
         from which he anticipated the best results for his own city, as well as for the other
         cities of the State. He even seemed to be willing to adopt my plan of extending the
         provisions of the bill to the Fire Department of said cities, and to make other changes
         which I suggested and <choice>
          <sic>wich</sic>
          <corr>which</corr>
         </choice> I propose to offer as amendments. I was in favor of the bill because I knew that
         a very large number of my constituents, both Democrats and Republicans, are in favor of a
         non-partisan police force and Fire Department, and I think this bill, if properly amended,
         will effect it. I was also pleased to find that a majority of the committee to whom the
         bill had been referred favored its passage, only two members dissenting from the majority
         report. This was the condition of affairs until, a couple of weeks ago, a sudden and most
         unexpected change took place in the minds of the advocates of the bill. The unfortunate
         Metropolitan Police bill, which until then had been praised and applauded as one of the
         truly good and important acts to be passed by this Legislature, became all at once a kind
         of bugbear and fright, from which all turned away, not so much with disgust as with fear
         and awe; the much-admired pet child of the Senator from Vigo had all at once become "un
         enfant terrible," a disowned child, which neither its father nor its godfathers wanted to
         recognize and protect. To me, who had favored the bill from the very first from principle,
         because it promises to give greater efficiency, value and character to an important
         department of city administration, this change appeared incomprehensible. Possibly some
         great and unforeseen revelation, duly apportioned in Congressional doses - and in
         administering them the Ninth District, I am afraid, got an overdose, from which it will not
         easily recover - had enlightened the minds of my Democratic friends, and changed their
         admiration to aversion and dislike. However this may be, and whatever causes may have
         brought about this very remarkable phenomenon, I for one deem it my duty to give the
         reasons which induce me to still advocate a measure which, in my opinion, recommends itself
         to out favorable consideration, from the fact that it is strictly non-partisan in its
         character and introduces a most desirable and salutary reform in an important branch of the
         public service.</p>
        <p>Two years ago the General Assembly passed a Metropolitan Police bill affecting only the
         two largest cities of the State, after a long, bitter partisan struggle, which led to some
         most disgraceful scenes on the floor of this Senate. The Republicans then, as they are
         doing to-day, most bitterly denounced the measure and heaped insult on the Democratic party
         for pacing it. And yet, looking at the provisions of the Metropolitan Police bill, as it
         has been in force in this State, or rather in the two largest cities of this State, and
         judging it in the light of strict impartiality, I consider it an act deserving the praise
         and commendation of every well-meaning citizen.</p>
        <p>Now what is this Metropolitan Police bill; what does it intend and what is its effect? It
         intended only one thing - to take the police force in the two largest cities of Indiana out
         of the hands of politicians and make it entirely independent of parties and party politics,
         and as a necessary result, more efficient and reliable. The police force of a city is there
         to protect the parsons and the property of citizens; and the faithful and efficient
         performance of this duty should be all that ought to be demanded of a policeman. Now this
         is exactly what the Metropolitan Police bill does; and it seems to me that in nearly every
         city of this State there is a great necessity for such a law as we have now under
         consideration. Our public officers in cities, especially the members of the police force,
         instead of attending to their official business and duties exclusively, have but too often
         been used as willing tools and arrogant, bulldozing electioners in the interest of the
         party which put them into power. Before the election they influence voters by either
         promising them official favor if they will vote for their party ticket or by threatening
         and intimidating them with official persecution if they dare vote against the policeman's
         party. Their acquaintance with saloon keepers and the proprietors of gambling roams, who
         are more or less dependent on the good will and friendliness of police officers and who
         dare not provoke their hostility for fear of being prosecuted for any little violation of
         the law they may have committed or might commit, <pb n="66" xml:id="VAA8558-22-414"/> make
         there officers a real power, and their abuse of their official authority largely influence
         the result of elections. At every city election the candidates for the Council are besieged
         by a crowd of loafers and idlers, who offer their votes and influence, whatever that may
         be, for an appointment on the police force and the fire department. Those candidates who
         are too honest and too respectable to promise these appointments to worthless and unfit
         applicants are spotted and butchered at the polls, and nine times out of ten their
         opponents who are less candid and less scrupulous concerning their promises of appointments
         are elected. In this manner, frequently, men utterly incompetent and unfit to sit in the
         Council were elected, and on the other hand, the protection of the persons and property of
         our citizens was more than once entrusted to unworthy, and sometimes dangerous,
         individuals. On election day you often could see this police force, no matter whether
         Republican or Democratic, surrounding the polls, challenging legal voters, rushing in and
         trying to swear in illegal votes; loudmouthed, blustering and swaggering, and by their
         insolence and overbearance rather creating a disturbance of the peace than preventing and
         quieting it. Now it was this pernicious system of interfering with the political rights of
         voters, and by the abuse of official authority, practically exercising a system of
         intimidation and terrorism fully as bad, and in our larger cities fully as effective, as
         the much complained of intimidation of Republican voters in some localities of the South. I
         say it was this pernicious system that the Metropolitan Police bill of two years ago was
         intended to break up in Indianapolis and Evansville, and I understand it has been eminently
         successful in doing so, and that a great many citizens of these two cities to-day,
         irrespective of parties, heartily indorse and approve it. And why should they not? Every
         provision of that bill tends to divest the police force of their partisan character which
         so seriously interferes with their efficiency. The composition of the force must be equally
         divided between members of the two leading political parties, and no man can be removed or
         discharged for any other reason than unfitness for the position. Now this is evidently much
         better and a far greater protection to a city than the frequent changes, merely for
         political considerations, which take place under the present mode of having the police
         force appointed by the City Council. Under the present system it occurs but too often that
         in consequence of a change in the political complexion of the City Council, suddenly the
         entire, efficient, well tried and experienced police force of a city is turned out of
         office, and that an entirely inexperienced and inefficient set of men are appointed in
         their places. What is the result? Crime increases and goes unpunished, and a general
         feeling of insecurity and apprehension pervades the community. This is certainly a great
         wrong; but it remains a fact, nevertheless, that, just on account of the partisan spirit of
         Councilmen, frequently elected by the influence of these men, this deplorable condition of
         affairs prevail in all those cities which often pass from the control of one party to that
         of another. Now, Mr. President, the Metropolitan Police bill will do away with this
         outrage. It will not only create a better, more efficient and impartial police force, but
         it will also elevate the character of the City Councils of the cities.</p>
        <p>If this bill becomes a law it will give the same chance to both parties; if the voters of
         a city prefer a Republican administration of their municipal or county affairs they can say
         so at the polls, and they will have it. If a majority is in favor of a Democratic
         administration, their will and intention can no longer be frustrated by overbearing
         policemen overawing them with their stars and maces. The strictly non-partisan character of
         the bill, which I wish had also included the Fire Department of these cities, with the
         additional feature of creating a greater efficiency in a public service, upon which, to a
         large degree, depend the life, prosperity and security of the citizen - these are the
         reasons which, above all others, recommended this bill to my favorable consideration and
         induce me to vote for it.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR the report of the committee was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I think it would be wisdom to have this bill printed. It is an important
         matter, and we can't afford to pass it through in such haste, I move the bill be printed
         and made the special order for to-morrow at 10 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: There is an urgency for the passage of this bill now. I would
         like to see it it printed, but I think the urgency for passage will overbalance that
         convenience.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: A man can not get a good understanding from the reading. The amendments
         should be printed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have seen bills run through in double-geared lightning time, and this is
         a very important bill, one that ought to be well guarded and we ought to have it printed.
         You can't get any bill up for the protection of soldiers' orphans but what I would vote for
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: This bill has been referred to a committee, and I believe it a disgrace for the
         Indiana Senate to delay a bill of this kind. The bill is short, the amendments are easily
         understood, and I believe in passing the bill to-night and let it go to the House
         to-morrow. It is a disgrace to allow that man Goar to remain a Trustee any longer.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Senators have been waiting for days, and I might say weeks, for this bill to
         come in here, and I for one am opposed to delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON favored the motion to print.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: I can not see why there is so much hurry about this bill. I would <pb n="67"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-415"/>like to see the connection of these amendments with the original
         bill. It becomes us to act coolly and with judgment in this matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: The House has spent considerable time on this bill, and I think we should
         give the House a lesson on this matter. Without reflecting on the House, this bill should
         have been passed long ago, and we ought not to delay an hour till we place this matter in
         the hands of the Governor, and let him appoint Trustees to go down there and wipe out the
         disgrace on our record.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: There is no reason why we can not dispose of this bill to-day, and I am opposed
         to the delay the printing will cause.</p>

        <p>Mr. BENZ, in explanation of his vote, said: I am not in favor of taking up this bill till
         the House send over the General Appropriation bill. They will send over a bill to get their

        <p>Mr. LOYD'S bill [H. R. 527] concerning the organization of the Knightstown Institute,
         being a special order for this hour, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>The previous question was demanded and being seconded by the House, under its operation
         the bill passed by yeas 87, nays 0.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD said: At this time I shall not refer to the investigation or the abuses at that
         institution, but will confine myself to a comparison of this and the Senate bill. This bill
         cuts down the salary of the Superintendent from $1,500 to $1,200. The Superintendent has
         board for himself and family, and $1,200 is enough. The Senate bill provides <pb n="68"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-416"/> no salary. Another thing this bill does is to oat down the
         salaries of Trustees from $500 to $400. The Senate bill does nothing of the kind. This bill
         also provides that a code of laws shall be drafted and frequently read there. Such a
         measure will check the mutiny there. Another thing, as you will remember, when the G. A. R
         visited this place they asked for a separation of the feeble-minded children, and this bill
         provides for that. It is a necessary provision, and the bill expressly says they shall be
         separated. And this bill says that failure to observe the order to separate shall be cause
         of removal.</p>
        <p>Mr. FLEECE, explaining his vote, said that he had in hand a communication from a post of
         the G. A. R., asking that the children be separated.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said he would vote for the bill, but entered his objection to the
         qualification of the Trustees - that of being honorably discharged soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGOVENEY, when his name was called, said: There are objections to the bill. It gives
         the Superintendent the right to employ teachers arid takes it from the hands of the
         Trustees. This is dangerous one-man power. There are other objections to the bill, but I
         will vote for it, however.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON, in explanation of h:s vote, said: Because I believe that all benevolent
         institutions should be non-partisan in their character I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I here hold a communication from Post No. 3, G. A. R, of
         Lafayette, which demands a separation of the children. There being objection, of course I
         can not read it. The post desired that two institutions be made, but as this bill is the
         best we can do at this time I vote "aye."</p>

        <head rend="center">MR. PATTON AND THE JOURNAL.</head>
        <p>Mr. PATTON. I arise to a question of personal privilege, I call the attention of the
         House to an article in the Indianapolis Journal of this day. In its report of this House
         that paper says that I said that General Garfield took to the rear with General Rosecrans
         at the battle of Chicamauga. I think that is a mistake. I believe that I said no such
         thing. It is all an error in making me make such a statement. Further on I am reported as
         saying that the G. A. R. does not demand that <choice>
          <sic>honoraby</sic>
          <corr>honorably</corr>
         </choice> discharged Union soldiers be made trustees of the Knightstown Institute, and I am
         quoted as saying that the Republican party when it had power made this move, and that when
         General Grant was Commander-in-chief of the G. A. R. did what he might for the soldier. I
         said that General Grant did not do for the soldier what was in his power when he was
         Commander-in-chief of the soldiers, and not as Commander-in-Chief of the G. A. R. I said
         yesterday, and I say to-day, that no man has a greater military record than General Grant.
         I did not say one word against his military record. As President and Commander-in-Chief of
         the Army he vetoed the bill to equalize soldiers' bounties, and that is what I said. And
         further on the gentleman from Grant (Mr. Brownlee) is quoted as saying that I came here
         from the battlefields to belittle soldiers. I believe I said no such thing, and I think he
         will bear me out in this. I did not say one word against the soldiers. No man can say that
         I did. I was a soldier myself. I was one of the first at the call to enlist under the old
         flag. I remember in 1861, when I enlisted for the Union, when I went out to old Camp
         Morton, that newspaper was supporting secession, saying let the South go. When I came here
         on my way to fight, when Fort Sumter was fired upon, when the old flag, the Journal was
         advocating the division of the Union. That is the same paper that attacked old soldiers and
         advocated disloyalty. I would like for the gentlemen of the press to take down my words as
         I say them. I am not acquainted with John C. New, and hold no personal acquaintance with
         him However, if I live long enough, I shall have a personal acquaintance with him. I do not
         want this Mr. New to get scared at this remark. And as to Garfield - he is dead, and as a
         man his name is dear to not only the Republican party, but to all. But as to Garfield as a
         soldier - we are charitable always and let a man's evil deeds go with him at his death. I
         did not drag Garfield's name in here. It was forced upon me. An attempt was made to compare
         the name of Garfield as a soldier to that of Hancock. I then spoke plainly and I speak so
         of the living or dead.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: I arise to a point of order. I have sat hear and listened to the abuse of the
         illustrious dead until I desire to hear it no longer.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I think that the gentleman (Mr. Patten) exceeds the bounds. He has a right,
         as a privilege, to say that certain statements are not true. I regret to make this point
         especially against the gentleman as it might indicate that I spoke directly against his
         right of defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I speak in justice to myself. I have been attacked and am here to defend
         myself. I have the right to defend myself against all attacks. I do not see that I should
         stand here and be criticised with no word of reply. The gentleman (Mr. Adams) can have the
         floor after me. This article says further: "A man with no more sense of honor than wantonly
         to attack the fame of the patriotic dying and dead is unfit to mingle with honest men. Such
         a man is fitted best to plunder the wounded and dead upon the field of battle after a
         struggle in which he was too dastardly to take part "He is the Thenadier of his day - a
         buzzard among eagles. He is beneath deserving to be abused. Away with him to the man who
         takes charge of carrion; he is a stench in the nostrils of decency." I suppose this article
         came from a man who deals in carrion, taken charge of by a man who knows more about carrion
         than anything else. It cuts me to the quick to be assailed on my record as a soldier. I
         remember when the country was shaken the morning we left for the field of the South; the
         old cabin where I lay unconscious for sixteen days; the five years that I was engaged in
         defending the flag; when I went to the ranks with a broken arm. I guess I have said enough
         to be understood. This, I believe, is all that is necessary for me to say at this time. I
         believe I have made my remarks so they can all be understood.</p>

         the motion to reject was rejected, by yeas 41, nays 51.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE said that it was not a gerrymandering scheme. It was intended solely as a
         measure of economy. The Legislative sessions were by many regarded as a calamity. He had
         heard it 250,000 times that the gentleman from Hancock (Mr. Gooding) was a friend of the
         economy, and here he was opposing this system to economize</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, explaining, said he hoped that the bill should pass, as a matter of business
         and the saving of expense. It was in the interest of the taxpayer. He voted "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: Early in this session high authority said that this session was to be in the
         interest of retrenchment and reform. He favored such and would vote "no."</p>

        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: The Republicans have got so far away from the public crib that they now
         propose to keep us out. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: Every gentleman on this floor will seriously think the measure should pass. So
         will their constituents. It should not be disposed of thus. If a little wrong it should go
         to a committee for correction.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: If this bill was seriously introduced I might consider it. The Republicans
         have been in the majority many times and never introduced such a measure. It is now offered
         for political capital, so I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: When there was plenty of time for this bill it was not brought in, but is
         now thrust upon us. It is deathbed repentance now for the Republicans to urge this measure.
         It could not pass the Senate, and would be a waste of time. So I vote to reject.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: If the gentleman from Wabash (Mr. Sayre) were serious I might look at it, but
         during his five terms here he has not introduced such a bill before. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYWORTH: As I think the smaller number of representatives would do better work, I
         vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS: For the reason that I advocated a measure of this kind during the recent
         canvass, and it met with the approval of my constituents; and for the reason that I believe
         a bill of this kind would ha a step in the proper direction, and a great saving of money to
         the people, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: If we go to reducing in this ratio, in ten years we will have only one-man
         power. It is easy to have economy on paper, but the Republicans had time to pass this
         measure and did not. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I can not believe this bill emanates from a sincere motive. It is too late in
         the day now for the Republicans to be serious in this.</p>

        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: As it is a cheap buncombe measure, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I hope I will be excused forgetting in bad company. Were the Republicans in
         the majority they would not propose this, but do so because they are in the minority. I do
         not favor the bill as it is. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: There are good provisions in this bill, no matter the motive. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: We have plenty of time to pass the bill. We have yet at least thirty-one days.

         it. The measure should pass. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMIIH, of Tippecanoe: I believe this is a movement in the right direction. Half the
         number of the Assembly could do the business half as quick. It has been a pet measure of
         the gentleman from Wabash (Mr. Sayre.) I know he is serious about it, One Democrat here
         said - and probably because he handled language badly - that no Republican ever originated
         an honest thing. I would not say that about a Democrat for $1,000. I have more than $1,006
         self respect than that. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: As this bill would be the entering wedge to break the villainous
         Congressional apportionment of my district, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: Not that I would vote for the bill, but because I would not treat a member so
         discourteously as to reject his bill without consideration, I vote against the motion to
         reject.</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: Believing that the principles of the measure are right, that the people
         demand it, and that there is time for it, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The reason why I vote as I do on this bill is because I do not believe in
         the discourteous treatment of any bill that is courteous in language and apparently
         constitutional. I do not say I favor the bill. I do not know how many Senators there should
         be; but in looking over this House I do not see that we could spare any of them - not even

        <p>Mr. Engle's bill [H. R. 71] concerning the fencing of railways was read the third
         time.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: The law as it is does not require railways to fence their tracks, but
         permits them to do it. In case they fence they are not liable, except for negligence or
         wilfullnes. Under this bill the farmer is required to do nothing, the railway company all.
         If the railway fail to build a fence the farmer may do so and charge the same to the
         railway.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON believed that the law is needed by the people. This law ought to have been
         passed thirty years ago. It is high time to pass it now.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE: Small losses by railroads are serious injuries. For instance, a sheep or a
         hog is killed; a farmer can not afford to enter suit for so small a loss, yet it is a loss.
         But so long as nine-tenths of the members of the Legislature and Judges of the courts carry
         railroad passes, where is the farmer to get justice?</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: The bill is due the people. Here is a duty that the railway company ought
         to perform, and this bill gives them plenty of time.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE offered the following:</p>

        </floatingText>
        <p>The resolution was ruled out of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: It has been asserted here that the railways pay more now for stock they kill
         than New York butchers. The condition that farmers should come to Indianapolis to enter
         suit is an inconvenience that should not be countenanced. I have a railway pass, and have
         used it, and will do it again; but that will not deter me from doing my duty. The bill is a
         good one and ought to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: I introduced this bill as the first one I brought forward. It was delayed by
         the committee, but finally came up here. This bill is drawn after a law in Ohio, Illinois
         and Iowa. By recommendation of the <orgName>Railway Committee</orgName> I have stripped

        <p>Mr. HUSTON explained: This is a substitute for his bill on the same subject. It excepts

         on Saturdays, but under the County Superintendent's control, who shall fix the times of

        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I appeal from the decision of the Cha r.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: It being well understood that agreement has been made to adjourn till Monday,

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH, changing his vote from "no" to "aye" because of a decision of the then

        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Willard): I believe that motion is in order.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: If I had been here when the order was made I should have voted against it,
         but it would not be treating certain Senators fair, who have obtained leaves of absence on
         the faith of that order, for us to rescind it now. And now because of that action other
         Senators have hurried away to catch the 11 o'clock trains.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware: It would place these Senators in the position of being absent
         without leave.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I voted against the motion to adjourn over, but as since then some
         Senators have gone home, I think if we stayed here and spent the time as we are now

        <p>Mr. HOBAN called up Mr. Moody's bill [H. R. 291] to pay John W. Pullen $750 for services
         in guarding prisoners during the war.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN said: The record will show that Mr. Pullen did the service and that he has
         never received his pay. He is needy and the claim should be paid at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY: I am not here to advocate the claim on the ground of sympathy, but because it
         is a just claim. I know it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I introduced this bill at the request of Mr. Pullen himself, and I know
         nothing more about it than the testimony sub mitted to the committee appointed to
         investigate the claim. It was found just. When the law was enacted allowing these claims,
         Mr. Pullen was in Illinois, and his claim was not audited. This act allowing the Indiana
         Legion claims, of which Legion Pullen was a member, was passed in 1881. [Reads] The
         evidence of his Captain is that the claim is just, and is here presented to the Clerk, who
         will read.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I do not see that under this law it is necessary for the bill to pass. The
         law already appropriates the money to pay these claims. No evidence is here presented that
         he was ever mustered in the service. Let him get that and also his discharge. This bill if
         passed would upon the door so that every man who drove a team for a quartermaster will be
         here with a claim.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: The argument of the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patten) is suicidal. If a
         record of a muster and a discharge is all that is necessary, why was the law of 1881
         necessary? If this bill is not passed this feeble old man can not get his pay. The money
         can only be paid on the certificate of the Adjutant General. The record is lost, but his
         services for the country were not lost. To refuse to pay him is grand larceny.</p>

        <p>MR. LOYD: I arise to a question of privilege. My attention has been called to an article
         is the Indianapolis Sentinel, of this morning. It is from Knightstown, and says:</p>
        <p>KNIGHTSTOWN, Ind., March 18 - We, the undersigned, teachers and employes of the Indiana
         Asylum for Feeble-minded Children and Soldiers' Orphans' Home, unwilling to longer see a
         faithful and conscientious officer slandered in the public prints, take the privilege of
         saying, in answer to Mr. Loyd and Mr. Boyd, who are reported as saying, "The teachers are
         being discharged and the children abused who testified against Dr. White in the late
         investigation," that this is unqualifiedly false. The teachers are all in their places and
         the children are receiving the same good care and attention that they have always had.</p>
        <p>This is done without the knowledge or consent of Dr. White.</p>
        <p>Alice Brant, Matron; Sallie Egbert nurse of hospital; Kanna Texton, Anna Brayery, Mary L.
         Longwood, M. Elma Talbert, governess; Mrs. Alice Beltz, teacher Asylum school: Maggie
         Texton, Mary Avela, governess; Lucien E. Sample, attendant boys' division; Robert H.
         Hazleton, William M. Perky, baker; Marcy C. Cary, Nelly M. Strode, governess; Mary E.
         Pfarrer, Ella O'Connell, Lizzie Terry, John Harrison, Mary L. Bundy, cook; Rea B. Cochran,
         help in dining-room; Ellen Brannenburg, Michael Dewine, Mrs. Bringnorth, James Daugherty,
         Mrs. L. M. Walker, William Bresland and Maggie Clark.</p>
        <p>This is signed by a number of the attaches of the institution. Now I want to say
         something concerning some of these names to this paper. Miss Elma Talbert, whose name is
         here signed, is the sweetheart of the son of Dr. White. This Mrs. Alice Baltz is a relative
         of Dr. White. Mrs. Ames, the governess, does mostly sewing for Dr. White, and most of her
         time is employed in White's family, although she is paid by the State. Others are - </p>
        <p>Mr. CORY (interrupting): I do not see how the dignity of this House is affected by all
         this reference to those parties.</p>
        <p>The Speaker: This is out of order beyond doubt.</p>
        <pb n="75" xml:id="VAA8558-22-423"/>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I will then conform to the ruling of the Speaker. Miss See Ray Wilson was
         discharged. She took a part in the investigation and was released soon after that. As soon
         as the statement was made to this House by me that Dr. White was discharging employes, he
         saw the statement in the newspapers and at once went to Miss Wilson and reinstated her, on
         condition that she would claim that she had never been discharged. And this bully, Robert
         Hazleton, whose name is to this paper, is the same one who so mercilessly strapped those
         little boys and was never taken to account by Dr. White or John M. Goar. I have further
         testimony against others who have signed that statement. In this House at this very time
         stands a man who was one of the most useful employes of that institution, who was
         discharged because he took part in this vindication. He lost his place for the part he
         took. I say this in justice to myself and Mr. Boyd, who were in that investigation. This
         Dr. White stood by and knew of this Hazleton strapping the inmates - cruelly punishing
         them. He knew of children being starved. All this could emanate only from the heartless
         individual that Dr. White is.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD referred to a letter he had received from Miss Susie Ray Wilson and handed the
         same to the reporter. One paragraph referring to Dr. White, reads: "Since the morning
         papers came he has been raving around the house - says he did not discharge me, etc. But on
         last Friday, previous to my dismissal, he wrote to Mrs. Laura M. Walker, telling her to
         come at once, as he could give her a teacher's position. She is now in the house, but has
         taken no position as yet. * * * My discharge was the topic of conversation throughout the
         Home, the different ones telling the children that Mr. Walker was coming to be their
         teacher." Near the end of the letter, the writer says: "Dr. White was here just now and
         wanted me to make a statement that I had not been discharged. I told him I could not say
         that, but I would make one stating that I had been, but was not now. He would not accept
         such, and says that he intends to refute these charges."</p>

        <head rend="center">THE KNIGHTSTOWN INSTITUTE.</head>
        <p>A message from the Senate announced the passage by that body of the bill [H. R. 527]
         relative to the Knightstown Institute with amendments that one of the Trustees be a woman,
         and that the salaries of certain officers be increased, etc</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE: I move that the House do not concur in the amendments from the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I call for a division of the question, so that we may vote on each amendment
         separately.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The chair will so direct. The first amendment provides one member of the
         Board of Trustees shall be a woman, and, plainly, that one shall be a Republican and one a
         Democrat.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas 52, nays 37.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD, explaining his vote, said: I have no objections to a woman on the board, but I
         am especially anxious that a Republican and a Democrat should serve on the board. I know
         that the man who outraged the little boys was kept there for two months that he might
         vote.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: I do not say this as a reflection on Democrats. Both parties are too prone to
         shield their party men. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: If I thought that a lady would exert any good influence on the board I would
         vote for the measure; but I have no such faith. And as a woman whipped the soldiers'
         orphans with a rawhide I am compelled to vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: As the Democrats have to bear the responsibility of the government of this
         institution I think they should have control of the institution. I do not want to make it a
         political institution, but, as the responsibility rests on the Democrats, I think they
         should govern it. So I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I am an Andrew Jackson Democrat and believe that Democrats should control.
         So I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I believe that a woman is more competent to take care of these children than a
         man is. I therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: For the reason that I believe in purging our benevolent institutions from
         politics, and for the reason that I believe that woman is the friend of the homeless, the
         weak and the friendless, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: So far as the non-partisan part is concerned, I favor it; but I do not favor a
         woman on that board. Women govern the children now, but as I believe the Trustees should be
         live business men, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOUK: As I do not think that the best interests of the State demand a woman on the
         board I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: I do not like the language of the amendment, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: There are more women there now than there ought to be; so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I am in favor of three women on that board; but that we may have a conference
         committee, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: As I do not favor the minority in tine Senate dictating to the working
         members here, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: Believing, as I do, that the institution needs the care of a good, motherly,
         virtuous woman, I think the Senate did right. I think the presence of a woman would avoid
         scandal. No one can sympathize with the unfortunate like a woman. I vote to concur.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I remember that during the war the women were ministering angels to oar
         soldiers, and believing that all <pb n="76" xml:id="VAA8558-22-424"/> our institutions
         would be better in the hands of women. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I believe that our institutions would be better in the hands of women - even
         all the Trustees should be women. I most cheerfully concur in the amendment and vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I heartily believe a woman should be a Trustee. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: That we may settle this at once, I change my vote to "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: For the reason that we may have this matter settled at once, I also change my
         vote to "aye."</p>
        <p>The result was announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the amendment was adopted.</p>
        <p>The remaining amendments to increase the salary of the Superintendent from $1,200 to
         $1,500, and the salary of the Trustee from $490 to $500 per year, were then severally
         agreed to.</p>

        <p>Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, said: I voted for this bill when it passed the
         House under the belief that it was proper and just. The amendment now proposed is that
         neither the Prosecuting Attorney nor his deputy shall have fees unless they render some
         service in the case. If a Prosecuting Attorney renders no service he should have no
         fee.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER Pro Tem (Mr. Gordon in the chair): The gentleman is making a speech, and will
         take his seat until permitted to proceed by the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: Has that been the practice here? I suppose the Prosecuting Attorneys are
         here - </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER pro tem.: It is the rule.</p>
        <p>Mr GOODING: Then this ruling will come home to roost. I shall see that it is enforced. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN, when his name was called, said: I voted for the bill when it was up here
         before. I think it is right to recommit the bill that it may be corrected.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order. He is making a speech and not explaining his
         vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: I insist that the rule be enforced, and that the gentleman sit down.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I will vote differently from the way I did before, and explain why. I think
         the amendment will materially help the bill, so I vote "aye" to recommit.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON, in explaining his vote, said: At the time the bill was up before I thought
         that some members were not serious. Now I know it.</p>
        <p>Mr BEST made a point of order that the use of this language is unparliamentary.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The language is unparliamentary, but I think the gentleman does not mean
         exactly what he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS, when his name was called, said: The gentleman from Clay, Putnam, and Hendricks
         seems to doubt the sincerity of those who voted to have this bill returned. I made the
         motion to recall it, and I did it that the bill may be killed. I am willing to bear the
         responsibility of this. The best thing to do with the bill is to kill it quick.</p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
        <p>So the motion to recommit was rejected.</p>

        <p>The regular order being now reached for bills on the the third reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN called up the bill [H. R. 479] making general appropriations.</p>
        <p>On his further motion the House resolved itself into a Committee of the whole (Mr. Adams
         in the Chair) for the consideration of the bill.</p>
        <p>The question being upon an amendment by Mr. GOODING to an amendment by Mr. SAYRE
         concerning the removal of officers of the Knightstown Institute -</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD said: As the bill concerning the <choice>
          <sic>Knightown</sic>
          <corr>Knightstown</corr>
         </choice> Institute has passed, I think the amendments unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING withdrew his amendment to the amendment, and on his motion the latter was
         rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD offered an amendment that the item for repairs at the Knightstown Institute be
         $3 300 instead of $2 000.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>

        <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY.</head>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved an amendment to strike out the item giving $24,000 to Purdue University.
         He said: I move to strike this out and leave it blank, so that it may be filled by a
         smaller sum. If there is one single good reason why the appropriation for Purdue should be
         increased, I would like to know it. There has been a standing together here for legislative
         log-rolling.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY: This standing together of rival State institutions is good for them, but
         death on the taxpayer.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) should be generous enough to say what
         there should be, if too large. It may be that by cutting off these State institutions, that
         sectarian institution will be helped. There has been a question raised that Purdue
         University is not a State institution. If so, this appropriation should not be given. But
         the history of Purdue show it to be a State institution. Two years ago President White
         wanted $25,000 from the State, and when this was refused, he resigned <pb n="79"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-427"/>and turned it over to the State. Professor James H. Smart was
         then chosen President. It is not strange that upon the growth of the institution that more
         money should he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: I firmly believe that if all these members had visited Purdue, and had seen the
         progress there, they would not object to this item. I was prejudiced against the
         institution before I visited it, but soon changed my opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRANKLIN: We need the sciences as taught at Purdue University. The science of farming
         is successful at this day. Machinery has so been applied to agricultural pursuits that men
         should know the underlying principles. We need schools to discover these principles. Purdue
         University does that to a certain extent. The members on the floor should see to it that
         these institutions are protected.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: The point has been made that Purdue University is a State institution, not
         whether Bloomington is a State institution or not, but from Ripley County the idea looks to
         us that to pay these large sums for the education of the small number of students that
         annually <choice>
          <sic>atttend</sic>
          <corr>attend</corr>
         </choice> these institutions is not just. Fifty counties are not represented in these State
         institutions and it is unjust that all the counttes should be taxed for the support of
         these institutions. Until I see the time that the industrious people of Ripley County, who
         are always able to pay their taxes and send all their children to the common schools -
         until I see the time that children all have sufficient clothing through a long winter like
         this - I am not in favor of supporting these supposed State institutions. It is not worthy
         of men to come here in the garb of protecting education and ask for money for these
         institutions under the plea that tuition is free. If these institutions can not live
         without these large sums let them die, and the sooner the better. Suppose, to put it at the
         best, that every county in the state is represented by the few pupils in these
         institutions, are the colleges then worth the sums they cost? It is a popular idea to
         foster these institutions under the garb of upholding education. It is time to throw away
         such tactics.</p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. REEVES the House resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole (Mr.
         Adams in the chair) for the further consideration of the bill [H. R. 479] making general
         appropriations for the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: The <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> visited the State institution
         and found them in good working order. For one, I am not in sympathy with the spirit to
         check these institutions until every child in other counties may be provided with text
         books or shoes by the State. These institutions 0f the State are free from religious bias.
         They are in accord with the Jeffersoian idea. As friends of mechanical art we can not
         afford to withhold our help, though we have the power, from these institutions. We know the
         management of Purdue University is composed of men in whom we all have confidence. If we
         can not support it properly, let us go at its throat and kill it at once. I, for one, am in
         favor of liberal donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: The Government of the United States and the State of Indiana have entered
         into a compact to support Purdue University. The State's honor is pledged to the United
         States that Purdue shall be sustained. However I might wish to economize, the fact is I
         feel that we cannot afford to break that good faith. Fidelity and good faith with the
         United States forbid it. Refer to the act of Congress and you will see that I am correct. I
         will not presume to think that any member here will think of breaking this faith. The only
         question is, how much money is necessary to carry out this obligation? As a State we can
         not afford to sully our honor by breaking our obligation. It is not a question whether we
         shall sustain Purdue. We are bound in honor to do that. The only question is, is this much
         money needed? In Indiana, the great agricultural State of Indiana, the farmers have no
         other institution. The mechanics have no other college. It is the only institution for
         them. While we are voting large sums for other institutions is there a man on this floor
         who says there is to be no institution for the farmer or mechanic? There is not a member on
         this floor dare oppose it and then vote to donate only to institutions to educate lawyers
         and gentlemen of leisure and <choice>
          <sic>pleesure</sic>
          <corr>pleasure</corr>
         </choice>. Probably some may call this humbug; if so, God give us more humbug. Let us have
         colleges for workingmen as well as Latin and Greek to turn out lawyers and doctors with.
         When you teach a young man in theology you make one to teach others. So <pb n="80"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-428"/>in teaching farmers and mechanics. I am for economy, but I do not
         believe in straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel. Let us keep faith with the General
         Government</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: It delights me to hear that horny-handed farmer of Hancock (Mr. Gooding) here
         speaking for the farmer. He is here preaching economy and voting against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I call the gentleman to order.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: There is another geraniun who speaks for economy and votes against it. Here
         is the gentleman from Hancock speaking for the people. The Government of the United States,
         had it known what disposition would have been made of its allowance in this direction,
         would never have made it. This is simply class legislation - this proposition to educate at
         Purdue. Very few farmers' sons have been educated there. Three from my county have gone
         there. None of them were farmers' sons and none of them are farmers. President Smart says
         the mechanical shop is not half large enough, and he wants a new one. Farther, the farm
         should have more stock; a new carpet is wanted; the library is not adequate, and thousands
         of dollars are wanted for it. Here I hold the tenth annual register of the institution. I
         want to call attention to the buildings Here is shown where $4,000 was paid for stock, and
         yet these gentlemen want further appropriations to buy some blooded stock. I will read
         further items of expense. [Reads] The enormous amount of $148,500 has been paid to Purdue
         University besides what it receives from its endowment fund, which pays 5 per cant. The
         State has already given Purdue $7 000 for stock, and they want more to experiment with. Is
         this what is to be done with the farmer's hard-earned moneys? I suppose that it is an open
         secret that these Professors there have been down with a microscope examining which end of
         the crawfish is the front end. [Laughter.] They also have prepared treaties on the clinch
         bug. President Smart knows no more of farming than my nine year old boy, and not as much.
         He is a school teacher. All this argument here is made by those who undertake to ingratiate
         themselves in the good graces of the farmers. No one ever heard of a farmer being benefited
         by Purdue University. The farm boy knows much more from experience than any one about the
         colleges.</p>

        hearts of those left behind. We ask Thy blessing to rest upon all the inhabitants of our
        State. Bless all our presiding officers and those in authority over us, and make them men of
        clean hands and pure hearts. Grant O God to lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
        evil, and grant O Lord that while we sojourn in the world, may we so act that at the time of
        our departure shall arrive, we can realize as did one of old that we have fought the good
        fight, have kept the faith and are ready to be offered. When this life with all its labors
        landed receive us to Thyself in glory, and Thine be the praises forever and ever. Amen.</p>

        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I will appoint as the committee Mr. Duncan, of Brown; the

       <p>O God, our help in ages past, our hope in ages to come: our shelter in the stormy blast,
        our strength in the hour of adversity. We come this morning into Thy presence, the only
        source from which life and strength come, the only source from which an Allwise, unfailing
        guidance can be vouchsafed to us, from which comes the only balm for our aching hearts in
        times of our sorrow and bereavement, and by whom all our afflictions are made light We have
        come and gone through this session, and over us the dark wings of death have not rested
        until to day. Thou art allwise and good, and the ways of Thy unscrutable providence are past
        finding out. And today we are called, after the pale horse with his rider has passed. Our
        band of 100 is broken, and from the ninety and nine of us that are left, one is called to
        that bourne whence no traveler ever returns. And it saddens our hearts and says to us, as he
        sleeps, so shall ye also sleep. May it be the happy lot of us to sleep as peacefully as he
        sleeps - blessed are those who sleep in Jesus. Help us bow to Thy will, and held us send
        forth our sympathies to those more closely united to him than we and whose hearts are more
        deeply wounded than are ours. There is a home in deep sadness, a wife stricken with sore
        sorrow, and the one who calls him father - his listening ear will never hear it more. May
        the afflicted family, and all of us, find consolation in the hope of a happy eternity. May
        we be in our hearts more closely united in the friendships felt here, and may we at the end
        of our lives be as he was - an honest man and one of God. And in this hour of sorrow help us
        to say and feel: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy
        will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us
        our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; lead us not into temptation, but
        deliver us from evil, and Thine be the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever.

        <head rend="center">A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE.</head>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND said: In view of the fact that I, as a member of the <orgName>Committee on
          Federal Relations</orgName>, refused to favor the resolution to eulogize Lieutenant Frank
         L. <pb n="83" xml:id="VAA8558-22-431"/>Denny, I ask a word for personal explanation. I have
         long since yielded to the firm belief that the dark races of the world have a future in
         this country, the islands of the sea and upon the dark continent. The Egyptian, the nomadic
         desert tribes, the inhabitants of the east lines as well as those of Central Africa, have
         for ages been the victims of the avarice of every civilized power in the world. I do not
         favor murder, arson and the like yet it often becomes necessary to resort to extensive
         measures in order to prevent encroachments, defend one's native land against intruders and
         preserve liberties which are dear to the people. The native people wear a hue akin to mine.
         I am an American by birth and in sentiment. I nevertheless entertain the same feeling for
         the land of my ancestors that the Irish American holds for the beautiful Emerald Isle,
         cursed as it is by British tyranny and thieving landlords. It was charged that these dusky
         worriers were but fanatics, dogs, etc., but while they may have been mistaken they were,
         nevertheless, fighting for a principle. They were captives, no doubt, in the meshes of
         dominating influences, but they disdained to whine over their condition, and I think they
         were right; for I dispise the doctrine of the "slave's allowance." Petition and complaint
         are to me the language of imbecility and cowardice. The "Uncle Toms" and the "Topseys"
         everywhere ought to die. Ignorance is their inspiration, fear their ministering spirit, and
         beggary their inheritance A godlike man is fair to fellow-men; virtue is his religion;
         liberty his shrine; honest contentment is the sum of his happiness and life, he aims to be
         in nothing excellent save that which makes men free. Whatever part Americans took in that
         affair, it is for you to condemn or justify. As an American officer Lieutenant Denny did
         his duty to his country and his flag. He obeyed orders, and therefore deserves this praise
         at the hands of his countrymen. While I, as an American citizen, commend his faithfulness
         and heroism, as an individual my sympathies are with those who suffered at his hands.</p>

        <head rend="center">DEATH OF MR. BROWNING.</head>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: A member of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly has been
         taken from us. I deem that it is in accord with the custom of all legislative bodies, and I
         believe my heart is in sympathy with every other member on this floor, that it is not
         proper for us to-day to continue the discharge of ordinary business. I think that we should
         take appropriate action in honor of the dead. This House should assemble in the afternoon
         and in a body attend the funeral cortege. A committee should be appointed to attend the
         body of the departed one to the grave. I have expected to hear of the death of another
         member of this body, but I was shocked to read in the press this morning of the death of
         Representative Browning, from the counties of Brown and Monroe. I move that such action be
         taken by the House.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I do not know what action the Senate may desire to take, but as that body
         does not meet until 2 o'clock this afternoon it will be best that the House now take
         action</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: Inasmuch as the Senate does not meet until this afternoon, I move that the
         members of the House accompany the remains to the depot, and that a committee of six be
         appointed to accompany the body to the burial ground.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: Mr. Browning was a Mason - a Knight Templar - of Columbia Commandery, and
         that body will officiate at the funeral. He was an ex-soldier, a Captain, a brave and
         efficient officer, and for that reason I shall appoint on the com - the committee
         ex-soldiers. I take the liberty to make the committee consist of seven, appointing as
         Chairman Mr. Adams, whom Mrs. Browning desires to accompany the remains to the burial
         place, and for others of the committee I select Messrs. Patten, Medcalf. Barney, Helms,
         Linnville and Mosier. If any of these gentlemen can not serve, they will so state, and
         others will be appointed.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I should like to serve on the committee to accompany the remains of my
         deceased brother and comrade, but the condition of things forbids it. In the hard days,
         when the country was aroused by war, the deceased went out for his country. He saw many
         soldiers' eyes closed in death, and saw them buried with no tear of home ones for the dead.
         To day this is changed, and he lies himself in death, away from his home. He was a gallant
         soldier, an honorable man. There are many gallant ex-soldiers here, any one of whom can
         serve in my stead.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: For the reason given I appoint in place of Mr. Patten, Mr. Loyd.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. SEARS, a committee of eight, consisting of the following gentlemen, was
         appointed to draft suitable resolutions of respect and condolence: Messrs. Sears, Twineham,
         Smith of Tippecanoe, Copeland, Staley, Pleasants, French and Eley.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved, out of respect to the memory of the dead, that the House adjourn
         till 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, with the understanding that members meet here at 2
         o'clock and proceed in a body, to escort the remains of the late Representative from Brown
         and Monroe (Mr. Browning) to the depot.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Accordingly the House adjourned till 9 o'clock to morrow.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. FAULKNER the bill [H. R. 172] to prevent gambling on county fair grounds
         was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, insisted this bill should be considered by a committee. Not much
         evil grows out of this class of so-called gambling on fair grounds - base ball and horse
         races would be effected by this bill as much as anything else. He moved to refer the bill
         to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This bill seems to be loosely drawn. He favored the motion to refer.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER objected. The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> are composed of
         lawyers, and they know too much about gambling already. [Laughter.] He moved to change the
         reference to the <orgName>Committee on Agriculture</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I see no necessity for referring this bill to any committee, but do see a
         necessity for its immediate passage.</p>
        <p>This bill is a stroke against schemes opened up at almost every fair ground that are
         leading away from correct paths the farmer boys of our State and robbing them of their
         money. It is not open to the objection urged that it would apply to races or base ball
         playing. This bill is proper and right in every particular.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I think this bill should be referred to a committee. The first section
         should become a law, but the second section should not, for it would subject, an officer to
         a fine for something that officer might not be able to correct or control.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: It seems to me there is no necessity for this bill. The present statute <pb
          n="85" xml:id="VAA8558-22-433"/>on the subject is sufficient, if enforced. We have law
         enough on this subject. There is no condition of gaming that can be imagined, but if
         complaint be made, can be stopped at once under legislation already enacted.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to amend so as to refer the bill to a special committee of five to be
         made up in part of lawyers and in part of agriculturalists.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER accepted this amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 5: nays, 35 - to lay the bill on the

        <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, the bill was referred to a select committee of five,

        <p>Mr. Overstreet's bill [S. 127] to extend powers and franchises of plank, McAdam and

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: If this bill becomes a law it will extend the charters of the gravel
         roads incorporated in 1865 for twenty years longer, when it was understood they were to
         become free in twenty years.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The provisions of the bill can not apply only in cases where the county
         refuses to purchase toll roads. The permission to extend the charter comes from a petition
         from a majority of all the land taxed to build the roads. Unless the road has been kept up
         up to the time the application is made, this bill will not apply.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: There is one objection I have to this bill, and that is it creates, in
         terms, a perpetual incorporation of these gravel roads or turnpike companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am opposed to the passage of this bill. This bill proposes to extend the

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, would vote for the bill. Border countie's Senators desire
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I can't see that this bill can do any good, and it may do harm. It would
         be imposing a large expense on the counties.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: This bill is wholly unnecessary. The statutes already
         sufficiently provide for the punishment of public offenses. In many instances the Grand
         Jury system is objectionable. It would be better for the people were that system abolished.
         There is a an odium in every county attaching to the Grand Jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ gave reasons why his bill ought to pass: There is trouble in his county, which
         is on the border, to get witnesses before the Grand Jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I see nothing in this bill that will work hardship to anybody. I don't
         believe much in a Grand Jury system where applied to misdemeanors, especially.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: If crimes misdemeanors are stricken out and make the bill apply to felonies
         only I would vote for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE: I am in favor of the bill just as it is. We who live close to the line know
         the difficulty of breaking up a gambling house, or a place where liquor is sold to minors,
         and the only chance to make successful prosecutions in such cases would be under such a law
         as this bill would be.</p>
        <p>The bill failed for want of a constitutional majority - yeas, 20; nays 17.</p>

         to an applicant. The bill has not an objectionable feature that I can see.</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH explained: This bill seeks to fix a penalty for usurious interest. It will
         relieve the people from charging usurious interest. No business can afford to pay a greater
         rate of interest than 8 per cent. The present law is inoperative because there is not a
         sufficient penalty affixed. All the value money has is what is given it by law. Money is a

         to affix a greater penalty. This bill is a righteous and just measure.</p>

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: This bill provides that upon presentation of a petition of
         land owners and stockholders the County Commissioners shall appoint receivers to assess
         benefits on land owners who are to be benefited by the conversion of a toll road into a
         free road. To avoid having a poor road turned over to the public there is a provision that
         it shall be turned over in good ordinary condition.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It seems this bill is designed to have all the property of the county
         taxed to keep up free gravel roads. That is the present law, but it does not seem

        <p>Mr. MACY: The present law allows roads to be turned over in bad condition, while the bill

         that this money still belongs to the State-house fund, while the Auditor of State claims
         that because it was not used it goes into the general find of the State. In order to get
         out of this wilderness, this bill is proposed. It puts the money into the general fund and
         then merely appropriates a sufficient sum to carry on the State-house work.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. REEVES, the two bills [H R 480 and H R 529] both relative to the State
         house funds, were made a special order for 3 o'clock to morrow afternoon.</p>

        <p>Mr. MURPHY'S bill [H. R. 268] was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: On account of the already large and increasing use of steam in the State,
         this office, for the sake of safety, should be created. In our section of the State and
         everywhere else, I believe, there is a desire to have the most competent engineers in
         charge of them. The bill provides that the Stale shall be districted and local deputies
         scattered over the State, so that a deputy will be convenient to any one who will require
         his services. In regard to the licensing of engineers our people are unanimous as to
         that.</p>
        <p>Under the operations of the previous question the bill was defeated - yeas, 34; nays,
         39</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I was desirous of being beard on this bill, but as the previous question
         has been demanded and all debate thereby cut off, I shall give the following reasons in
         explanation of my vote: First, it is in the interest of protection to employes whose lives
         are necessarily at the mercy of defective boilers: second, it is in the interest of
         protection to competent engineers as against incompetent and inexperienced engineers;
         third, it is in the interest of workingmen who desire and should receive first class living
         wages. I therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: This bill is against the principles of free government in one sense of the
         word. The office will be worth from $75 000 to $100,000 per year. The Inspector can inspect
         as <choice>
          <sic>oftan</sic>
          <corr>often</corr>
         </choice> as he chooses. He is a court within himself. Every boiler throughout the State of
         ten-horse power must be inspected. It is not so much who handles a boiler as to how it is
         kept. The owner of a boiler has an interest in seeing that a boiler is well kept.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I do not see how this law will bring about good results. Competent men shield
         care for engines. Improper care of the best boiler will explode it, and inspection one day
         will not prevent the explosion another. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: This will give the Inspector right to inspect all boilers, little ones in the
         country sawing wood or big ones in buildings. Some Inspector who knows nothing of boilers
         might in testing a stationary boiler blow up a building. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: I believe that this bill is, well intended, but in its construction it is so
         faulty that I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: If parts of the bill were stricken out I could support it, but as it is I
         shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: This bill may have some features that are faulty, but it is to protect the
         people. We should have our river boilers inspected the same as the United States have the
         boats on National waters. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Boiler explosions are scarcely ever due to defects, but to carelessness. This
         is a bill against the many to create a fat office. The fees will come largely off the
         farming community. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: The bill has many good features, but it is seriously faulty. Boiler accidents
         are mostly due to carelessness, and not to defects. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Because I do not believe in measuring life by money, or shekles
         of gold by ounces of blood, I favor the bill. There are some objections to it, but for
         protection I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Perry: Because the bill is so faulty I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: If a boiler were to explode in my county with serious loss of life - an
         engine having been left in the hands of boys, for instance - I would never forgive myself
         should I vote "no." I vote"aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I have seen at my home the frightful results of a boiler explosion. I have
         carried from the ruins the remains of five neighbors so charred that we buried them in
         unknown graves - unable to recognize them. I have seen also another catastrophe of that
         character. In both cases the accidents were the results of defective boilers. In protection
         to the laboring man who may be exposed to these dangers I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: In protection to the laboring men I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I believe in licensing engineers, while I do not exactly favor the boiler
         inspectors. I vote "aye."</p>

         pleads guilty, and I renew my motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The bill is in a peculiar position. It is a question whether, having been

         I hope some further action will be taken now.</p>
        <p>The motion to reconsider was rejected by yeas 34, nays 35.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND, explaining, said: I before voted for this bill, and shall now vote against
         it. Statements or insinuations have been made here that members who change their votes have
         been influenced by Prosecuting Attorneys. I want to say that so far as this relates to me
         it is wholly erroneous I voted for it before through ignorance. That bill was forced
         through the infamous gag law. I shall vote as I do for three reasons: First, it cuts down
         fees of Prosecuting Attorneys, who at present are only half paid; second, it will encourage
         lawlessness, because fighting will cost less; third, it will be in the interest of
         violators of the law and against the interests of the State of Indiana. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr HOBAN: I voted for the bill before, but I find now that attorneys <choice>
          <sic>themselvfs</sic>
          <corr>themselves</corr>
         </choice> do not agree on the matter. I oppose burdens, but I believe in salaries which are
         not so small as to cause men to steal. We must pay men to enforce the laws. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. KRUGER: I voted against the bill before and shall do so again, but because I do not
         believe we should tie up the bill as it is, I now vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I voted for the bill before at the request of a very zealous advocate of it.
         Since I have examined it thoroughly, and find it vicious in the extreme. That a man can not
         be his own prosecutor is a law as old as Blackstone.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: Believing that the Senate will cure the defect in the bill, I change my vote to
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: Believing that there is no merit in the bill whatever, I vote "aye" to
         reconsider, so that the bill may be voted down. It is a vicious bill.</p>
        <p>So the motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table was rejected.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The question is, shall the vote by which the bill passed be
         reconsidered?</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: The present law states already that the Prosecuting Attorney is to have fees
         only for labor. No defendant can be robbed under the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved the previous question.</p>
        <p>The demand was seconded by the House; under its operations the motion to reconsider was
         agreed to by yeas 45, nays 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I have voted for this bill at every stage and would gladly see it become a
         law, but I see by the roll call already had that it is hopeless; so I move that the bill be

        <p>Mr. MOCK, explaining, said that he thought that the law being so severe would be

        <p>Mr. McMULLEN said that this law was drawn by the Horse-thief Detective Association, and
         they had experience to know what they wanted. He voted "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: In my county the farmers have been sorely harassed by horse
         thieves We have sent horse thieves back the third time, and the penalty should be made sure

        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: If this bill would catch horse thieves instead of assessing punishment, I
         would vote for it. As it is, I do not see good in it and vote "no."</p>

        <p>Mr. MOODY: The principles of this bill have for many years been demanded by the employes

          <sic>alll</sic>

         almost, if not absolutely, impossible for an employe to recover a judgment against a

         There is no good reason why an employe of a railroad company should not, if free from
         negligence stand on the same footing, his rights measured by the same rule as those of

         bills there are forty-three. While there has been much said about one house considering the

         move to take up House bills on the third reading. This action would satisfy the House that
         the Senate is ready to do its part to the utmost.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: The regular order calls for House bills on the first reading. We have been
         following the regular order and have been making excellent progress, and I am in favor of
         proceeding with the regular order of business.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: We have reached the order of business which enables every measure from the
         House to be considered in regular order. What is the use of commencing at the bottom
         instead of the top? The only true method we can pursue is to follow the order which is
         proven by past experience to be the best.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I favor the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I hope this motion will not prevail. Under the regular order all bills

        <p>Section 1, The proper local school authorities shall, on and after September 1, 1885,
         require all pupils in all schools supported by public money, or under State control to

         books selected by the State Board of Education, which was ruled out of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: The decision of the Senate on this matter has already been
         made - that this bill shall be rejected. No set of men can define the true effects of

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH read from a school book in support of his argument in favor of the proposed
         amendment of the bill offered by the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke). Among the best, if
         not the best, medical minds in the world have condemned alcoholic stimulants.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIVELY: I can not see why the amendment proposed should not be incorporated in the
         law and made part of our common school education. As there are public acts and laws which,
         if observed, promote the health of communities, so there are rules of living and habits of
         life taught and inculcated by competent observers, by attention to which the health of the
         individual may be preserved. Therefore I think it of paramount importance that it should be
         taught in our common schools. For many years I have been a close observer of the effects of
         stimulants and narcotics upon the human system, and my observation has satisfied me that
         their regular use has a tendency to deteriorate the blood and to weaken and debilitate both
         body and mind consequently disease and death frequently follow. Therefore I can see no good
         reason why such facts should not be made known and taught in our common schools. In fact, I

        <p>Mr. MARSHALL called up his bill [S. 173] which was read the third time. He said hundreds
         of men at every election vote two ballots on purpose, and there is a way of so folding two
         ballots that they will fall apart after being deposited in the ballot-box. The object of
         the bill is to secure a proper count of the God given right to cast a ballot. In this State
         there were 2,000 more votes put in the ballot-box than there were men voting.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Instead of having more machinery, we ought to have less attending our
         elections. A corrupt man can take money from a candidate and place sealed ballots in the
         hands of voters without giving them or anyone else an opportunity of knowing what ticket
         they vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I am opposed to this bill because the more machinery there is about the
         casting of the ballot the more abjectionable it is. This bill would be surrounding the
         ballot box with that sort of formality that may be the means of securing a contrary
         expression of opinion which an honest count would show; it might produce new rules in the
         way of a fair count and an honest ballot.</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: This bill is surely in the right direction to purify the ballot-box.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. COPELAND the bill [S. 323] to pay $7 650 to members of the Indiana
         Legion was read the second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: Why is it that these regiments of the Indiana Legion have not been paid before
         this? Why does this come us after fifteen or twenty years? It looks like a money-making
         scheme. It looks like something is rotten in Denmark</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: This money for the Legion was appropriated in 1862 and most of it was paid.
         The remainder has since been in the State Treasury and this bill is to pay it to those men
         who have just proved that they are entitled to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The bill mentions several regiments. I move to amend by
         including any other regiment which did State service.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Further legislation on this subject is unnecessary. The law of 1883 says this
         money shall be paid to men who were enrolled. If men have not been enrolled, it is their
         duty to go the Adjutant General and have their names enrolled.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: After twenty years it has been discovered that some men did service for the
         country and their names have never been enrolled. Men who were "home guards" - who never
         dreamed of pay, under this amendment, which proposes to make it general, can draw pay for
         that service. Many years ago a commission was appointed to consider all this class of
         claims, and under its action Congress allowed several hundred thousand dollars, which was
         disbursed to the claimants according to the allowance of this commission, as payment in
         full for such services.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: Any amount of men who did service for the State have not had their names put
         on this muster roll by the commission appointed for that. Men were out of the State at that
         time and were overlooked.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This money was earned by members of the Indiana Legion, and should be
         paid.</p>
        <p>Mr GORDON: I move that the bill with amendments be recommitted to a special committee of
         five.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I hope the gentleman will not insist on that motion. The money must be paid
         before next January if at all.</p>

        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: We have in Wayne County several little incorporated towns. They ask that
         they may guard their ordinances by the Justices' Court.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: The only change made to the present law is that if there is no Justice of the
         Peace in the towns the Justice nearest the town shall have jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: This bill amounts to practically nothing. Under our criminal code there is no
         ordinance of any value under which a man may be arrested which the State laws do not
         embrace.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: As every town has already by law a right to a Justice of the Peace, I think the
         bill unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Under the operations of the previous question, the bill was defeated by yeas 25, nays

        <p>Mr. FRAZEE: The objectionable figures to this bill having been removed, I hope the House
         will pass it.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: Many gravel road charters will soon expire. Then the roads become free and
         there is no provision to keep then in repair. This law provides a means to keep them in
         repair.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 67, nays 6.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY, explaining, said: There is still one feature in this bill to which I object.
         The charters of some gravel roads are perpetual. Men who live along them pay toll <pb
          n="93" xml:id="VAA8558-22-441"/> to keep them up. Now under this bill people living in the
         poorer localities will not only have to pay for their own roads, but must also pay tax for

         their employes for hospitals, reading-rooms and the like, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I do not know what other railways do, but the Wabash Railway retains from the
         wages of employes 50 cents per month when they receive $50 or more per month, and 35 cents
         when they receive less than $50 per month. The pretext is that the money is taken to build
         a hospital for the injured or sick employes. The total sum thus retained amounts to $800
         per month. It so happens that the employes are always able to care for themselves when sick
         or hurt. The railway company has no contract with the employes, but merely keeps back this
         money.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This same corporation is a grasping monopoly, pulling down
         workingmen, and I favor the bill. We passed a bill the other day to protect employes
         against just such corporations, and I see that the Wabash has entered suit in the United
         States Court against the State of Kansas for enforcing the law we passed the other day,
         that of liability to employes who are injured.</p>

        <p>Mr. GARRISON'S bill [H. R. 200] was read the third time. He said: This bill provides that
         a man shall not be taxed for portion of his land used by public roads</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: It is no more than equitable to make this deduction. If a man owns 1,000
         acres of land much of it is taken up by roads, which he should be relieved from paying
         taxes on, because the public have the benefit of the land.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILS0N: I see no use of this. It will only burden the statute books. On investigation
         we find that one two-hundredth part of the land of the State are highways, and that
         two-thirds of taxation comes from real estate. If you deduct roads from taxation it will
         only increase the rate of taxation.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: As a man has no returns from lands used as highways I think he should not
         be taxed for such.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I believe that it would equalize taxes. One man might own a large estate on
         one side of the road and his neighbor on the other side a small estate. Still, the man with
         the small estate might have land in a narrow strip lying along the road. He would then be
         taxed as heavy for the road land as his wealthy neighbor. So I think that it will equalize
         taxes to exempt the roads</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas 47, nays 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNES, explaining his vote, said: Now that Assessors never fail to deduct the roads,
         creeks and cliffs, he regarded it as unnecessary legislation, and voted "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: Believing this to be in the interest of farmers - believing that they
         desire it, and as they have taken up little time of this House, and as very little has been
         done for them, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM. Believing that farmers are already well enough protected, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. LINNVILLE: As a general rule, roads are a benefit more than an injury, and I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN: I am surprised that any fair-minded man can vote against this bill. Every
         measure to relieve the burdens of farmers has been voted down here. You might as well tax
         lot owners for lands of the streets as to tax farmers for roads. I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 480] relative to funds to complete the new State House being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I move to amend that the money ($350,000) heretofore appropriated, and now in
         the Treasury, be appropriated to the State House fund. When this money, collected $150,000
         in 1879 and $200,000 1883, was not used it went into the general fund in conformity to the
         views of the Auditor of the State. The State House Commissioners claim that this money
         should go toward the State House completion. There has been a controversy between the State
         House Commissioners and the Auditor of State, and this amendment will stop it.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: It is not necessary to be scared about these funds. They are safe and have
         not, strictly speaking, been misappropriated. This amendment will decide where the funds
         belong</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: This money - the $350,000 - was turned over to the general fund without
         authority of law. There should be no controversy over this. This was done over the opinion
         of the Attorney General. The State House Commissionees were right and we should not sit
         here and say that the Auditor of State turned the funds over to the general fund by
         authority of law.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: We should by all means provide the State House Commissioners
         with the money to complete the State House. We should confine ourselves to that and not
         talk about was right and who <pb n="94" xml:id="VAA8558-22-442"/> was wrong about the fund
         to which this fund belonged.</p>
        <p>Mr McMULLEN: No one has taken the money away. The State House fund must have the money
         (the $350,000) and the amendment should prevail.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOUK moved to amend further that as there is no money in the general fund of the
         State Treasury, that the Governor, Auditor of State and Treasurer of State be authorized to
         make a temporary lean of $500,000, of which $350,000 is to replace the like amount
         appropriated to the State-house but used in the general fund, and $150,000 is to be used in
         the furniture for the building.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE moved to amend by inserting the proviso that no more than $2,000,000 be used in

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I am opposed to the passage of any penal statute containing an
         emergency clause. I move to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out the emergency
         clause and report back the bill at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS moved to instruct the committee to insert the words "where an admission fee
         is charged," and also the word "base." The bill as it is would subject boys to prosecution
         in every township in the State where they may be found tossing a ball on Sunday
         afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: This bill is rather broad in its terms.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: The farmers' boys can take care of themselves; it is the city boys who play
         base ball and every other kind of a ball on Sundays, gathering a large body of people
         together and disturbing those religiously inclined.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: A bill with the amendment proposed would amount to nothing. The farmers'
         boys are not the ones to violate such a law.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS opposed the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I think the bill should pass as it is. It would not be applied to small boys.
         It is just as much of an evil to play a game of ball where a large crowd is gathered
         together on Sunday, whether an admission fee is charged or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The amendment proposed would destroy the effect desired by the bill. I
         concur fully with the remarks of the Senator from Jay. Where boys toss a ball between
         themselves it is not a game. This kind of Sabbath amusement has grown to be almost
         infamous.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The more legislation enacted to compel the observance of the
         Sabbath day the more irreverence is inspired for it. He would not have so much objection to
         the bill if amended as proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I would not restrict harmless enjoyments on Sunday if it did not disturb the
         people. I shall never vote to restrict individual liberty on any subject. Cities can pass
         ordinances to prevent lawlessness that will result from playing base ball on Sunday.
         Morality must come from the fireside and schools, and not from legislative enactment.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I am told that at a preacher' meeting some one (I don't care to
         give his name) stated that the Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate informed
         a committee of minis- <pb n="96" xml:id="VAA8558-22-444"/>ters that this bill had passed
         the House, but it would go no farther. I wish to say that I never stated that to any
         minister or to any-body else. I have been for this bill from the beginning, and am for it
         now. I have never proposed to state what the Senate is going to do, for I don't know. And I
         don't know because a man is a preacher that he is at liberty to tell a lie deliberately.
         [Laughter]</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: I have been informed that the other ministers were very much mortified over
         that statement. The idea they received was contrary to that expressed, inasmuch as the
         House had already passed the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: No law should be put on the statute book that will not be respected. The
         fine imposed in this bill would not deter the game. I favor very large latitude on the
         question of Sunday laws. If such a law as this is enacted the penalty should be enforced
         against the employers of these base ball players as well as the players themselves, or
         against the ticket seller or those who attempt to take gate money, otherwise the company
         could pay the fine and continue the Sunday games. You might as well say it was unlawful to
         play marbles or to go in swimming on Sunday. A bill to stop money making by such games on
         Sunday would be much more effectual than the provisions proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, moved to amend the amendment by striking out of the
         amendment the word "base."</p>
        <p>This motion was rejected upon a division - affirmative, 19; negative, 23</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 7] to amend Section 1,464 of the code was read the third time with a
         Senate amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER explained: The party shall state additional proof will be required, and that
         they can not produce that proof at the time in order to secure a continuance.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 35, nays 2.</p>

        <p>The bill H. R. 16, with the Senate substitute adopted yesterday, was read the third
         time</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jay: The bill as amended by the Senate is directory, and the result of its
         passage would be the common schools will be harassed by any person who may fall out with
         the school teacher. We ought to look beyond the question of temperance and consider whether
         such a statute would not lead to confusion and to the breaking up of many schools</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill till it comes up in
         the next order on the third reading of House bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to amend by indefinitely postponing the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: The bill does not mean anything impossible - neither does it mean that
         physiology shall be taught to the A B C classes in the schools. The fact is demonstrable by
         medical science that alcoholic stimulants are injurious in this climate and in so far as
         science has demonstrated that fact, just so far will this bill propose to have the science
         taught.</p>
        <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ, explaining his vote: I think this bill is proposed for buncombe.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I warmly supported this bill when it came from the House, but now, for the
         reason as amended it would compel the teaching of physiology and hygiene to children of six
         years of age, I am opposed to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I do not think it will hurt any boy to teach him the harmful effects is of
         alcohol on the human system, even though so young as six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The child can easily learn that fact without teaching in the schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The Senate amendment makes the House bill more mild. It is an accepted fact
         that the effect of alcoholic is stimulants is injurious to the human system. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Had this bill been amended as I desired I should have voted for it. As it
         stands I vote "aye" on this motion.</p>
        <p>So the motion to postpone indefinitely was agreed to</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that motion on the
         table.</p>
        <p>The latter motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 19</p>
        <p>Mr SHIVELY, explaining: In order that the time of the Senate may not be taken up any more

        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I offered the amendment so that, if the bill passed, it would be as little
         objectionable as possible. I shall vote against the bill, believing existing statutes are
         sufficient to suppress any nuisance in any locality.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I am sorry the amendment has been engrafted on the bill, and heartily favored

         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Believing the present statutory law is sufficient to suppress anything of this

         to work their men seven days in the week I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and lay that motion to re-consider

        <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved to concur in the majority report, it recommending its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: This bill is entirely unnecessary, and would but encumber the
         statutes. He moved to substitute the minority for the majority report, which recommends
         indefinite postponement.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: Some agricultural fair associations have derived as much as $3,000 a week
         from men who bought the privilege of gathering from the people money without giving
         anything in return. This bill proposes to say that such persons shall not be allowed to go
         upon the fair grounds and practice their various swindling games.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend by striking out the word or "skill" and the words "for the
         purpose of wagering money or any thing of value."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: There is no need of going a step farther with legislation of this kind in the

        <p>Mr. WINTER: This bill in its present shape I would not be willing to support. It can be

        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS explained this bill is to authorize the publication of ditch notices, or
         rather to make the statute certain. The bill failed the other day for want of a
         constitutional majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: It inserts the words "in some newspaper" in section 4 293.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: These words were probably left out purposely. Newspaper advertising is very
         expensive.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill proposes to put it out of the power of any scoundrel who may
         follow the Sheriff and pull down the three notices that officer may post up. Information is
         what is sought to be gained. I hope this bill will be passed in the interest of men who are

         <body>
          <div type="resolution">
           <p>In private life, he was strictly honest, upright and conscientious, a member of the
            Methodist Church, and for years a traveling preacher in that connection. In public life,
            he was an earnest advocate of the strictest economy and most unfaltering fidelity to the
            rights of the people. A man of strong convictions, he fearlessly defended them. His
            ability on the floor of the House was marked by readiness in debate and the advocacy of
            what he deemed the right, with fervor, earnestness, and often with, skill and power. His
            heart was carried in his hand, and if in the heat of extempore debate he wronged any
            one, he was more than ready to right the wrong. His advocacy of the great educational
            interests of the State was marked and conspicuous during the session of the Legislature.
            Because he was an intelligent, incorruptible and faithful legislator, we honor his
            memory. Because he was a patriot, and counted his life as nothing in the <pb n="98"

            enduring than brass and more majestic than the royal sight of the pyramids. Because he

            he was cut down in the midst of life and its full measure of labors, we mourn his loss

        <p>Mr. GORDON called up his bill [H R 168] which heretofore failed to pass for want of a
         constitutional majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) claims that the merits of this bill
         consists in this, that it requires the County Clerks to furnish a list of all the guardians
         and their bondsmen Section 2 221 of the code provides for the keeping of all records
         necessary to enable the Judge on the beach to know all the Clerk of the Court, if this bill
         passes, can furnish him. I am well satisfied this proposed law will simply pay the clerks
         for doing what the law now requires them to do without any pay. I think that if we pass no
         law reducing fees and salaries of county officers we at least should go slow in enacting a
         law to increase their pay. I am satisfied this bill is not what it is claimed to be, and
         ought not to pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: The gentleman misrepresents the bill. There is no statute now on the book as
         provided for by this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr KELLISON: I am unable to see the merits in this bill. The great difficulty connected
         with estates now is not with the Clerk's reports. It is now the duty of the Judge to
         investigate the solvency of estates. This bill is only to increase fees.</p>

        <p>The bill [S. 111] to allow David R. Munson $5 115 69 for, lightning rods for the Asylum
         for the Insane, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This is a just, undisputed claim. It does not embrace interest, and
         interest has been allowed other claimants. There is no need of argument here. The money
         would have been paid without question had there been money in the treasury when the work
         was done.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I have here the testimony taken. Dr. Jameson's testimony here shows that
         "Munson put up the rods without having the contract, though I warned him against
         proceeding." Governor Williams was indignant when the bill came, as well as were other
         members of the board. Here is a sample of the persistence of the lightning rod man. Give
         them an opportunity and they cover your property with rods and charge a heavy price. There
         is undoubtedly something due Munson, but not this much.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I move to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Ways and Means
          Committee</orgName> with instructions to amend so that the bill be reduced to $2,500.</p>

        <p>Mr. French called up his bill [H. R. 543] to allow County Treasurers 6 per cent. for
         collecting delinquent taxes, the same having heretofore failed for want of a constitutional
         majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: I wish to call the attention of the House to the present condition of the
         delinquent tax lists of Indiana. Section 6,427 of the Revised Statutes says that the County
         Treasurer shall make diligent search for such delinquent taxes. The next section puts the
         duty of collecting these taxes on the Treasurer without this extra pay. He must show that
         he can find no personal property which he can seize for delinquent taxes. The law makes him
         liable on his bond if he does not collect these delinquencies. Treasurers are not well paid
         for their services, and their duty is clearly defined. This proposition is a disguise to
         increase the fees of County Treasurers, and will do it at the rate of $1,000 for every
         county in the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: There is no disguise in this bill. It means just what it says. It was drawn
         in its simplest shape so that all could understand it. It is not to merely increase
         salaries of Treasurers. The law of 1879 allowed County Treasurers to go out and collect
         delinquent taxes six months in the year and he was allowed 6 per cent. This bill simply
         allows the Treasurers to collect the delinquent taxes twelve months in the year instead of
         six months. If there is any reason why they should go out six months of the year instead of
         twelve I fail to see it.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 55, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGOVENEY, explaining his vote, said: I think that a great many are making a mistake
         on this, and it will cost us but $6 on the hundred to collect this. It will be a relief to
         our school fund. So I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: It is not difficult to find men to fill the offices at the present salary.
         Those now delinquent in taxpaying are not so with choice, but of necessity. It will only
         increase their burdens. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the bill passed as noted above.</p>

        <head rend="center">PURDUE UNIVERSITY.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the House resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole, [Mr.
         Adams in the chair] and proceeded to consider the bill [H. R. 427] making general
         appropriations.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I favor the motion to strike out the item to appropriate $24 000 to Purdue
         University. If I fail to convince the <pb n="99" xml:id="VAA8558-22-447"/> House that this
         item should be struck out it will be because of my inability and not be cause my cause is
         not just. My opposition to this is that Purdue University is not a State institution. In
         such institutions as the prisons and benevolent institutions of the State the land, every
         item of furniture and fixtures belong to the State. Not so of Purdue University. Neither
         the land nor any of the property belongs to the State. The claim that this State entered
         into a compact with the United States to preserve Purdue can not be substantiated.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: Section 862 of the statutes says that the State shall observe the
         stipulations laid down by Congress. What was that?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: That the State should take care of the principal of this money, that the
         State should pay the interest. Some have an idea that this appropriation is to be $24,000
         for two years. This is erroneous It means plainly $24 000 per year John Purdue did not ask
         money from the State, but said he would support this institution himself. All he wished was
         to call once in a while at Purdue and examine the books. I wish that John Purdue could
         examine those books now and make a report here in place of the one presented by President
         James H. Smart Now is it a State institution? Two years ago President White, when a
         question was raised here regarding secret societies in that college, claimed that Purdue
         University was a private corporation and sent here through the Representative from
         Tippecanoe (Mr. Smith), who is still on this floor, a remonstrance against the Legislature
         meddling The gentleman from Tippecanoe presented the matter to this body.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: Don't misquote me about this. I made no such claim.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I guess I must resort to the official record. I will read from the Brevier
         Reports of the session of 1883 [Reads from Volume XXI.] This idea of a State institution is
         of recent origin. This communication of President Smart intimates that there was no
         opposition to an appropriation to Purdue University two years ago. But there was. The
         Honorable Speaker of this House was then Chairman of <orgName>Committee of Ways and
          Means</orgName>. That committee then reported an appropriation of $2,000 for Purdue. Mr.
         Smith moved to increase it to $25,000, and this was laid on the table by 48 yeas and 28
         nays.</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: If it is not a State institution why does the Governor appoint the
         Trustees?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: The Governor appoints but two, and others are chosen by the State Board of
         Agriculture, and so on. Even if a State institution it would be held to a strict
         accountability as to its finances. All the State Institutions are compelled to cover back
         into the Treasury all unused money. When has Purdue even turned back a single dollar? If
         you can find the receipt for such I would like to see it and frame it that the public may
         see it. Every boy who goes there, President Smart to the contrary, pays $15 per year
         tuition, no matter whether he be sent by a county or not. This institution is kept up for
         Tippecanoe County. There are 176 enrolled there. Their first names are not given, so we can
         not tell how many are girls. As near as I can guess there are thirty-seven girls. But forty
         counties are represented. Tippecanoe County has eighty seven members. The claim is made
         that Purdue is young. It is as old as the Valpariaso Normal School, which has 1,600 <choice>
          <sic>stundents</sic>
          <corr>students</corr>
         </choice>, and some of them are from Tippecanoe County. The expense of that is not as much
         as Purdue. The gentleman from Tippecanoe says that Purdue University has a capital stock of
         $560,000 It is a private corporation. The claim is made that it is an Industrial College:
         that it is to make better blacksmiths and better mechanics.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: How much money does it take to run this?</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: No one can tell. President Smart, in response to this Legislature, says the
         salaries amount to $24 500; another time in his annual report it is given at $18,OOOr
         another time he puts it at $20,000; but I find the Lafayette Sunday Times gives an itemized
         statement which puts the salary figures at $28,000.</p>

       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS resumed (in Committee of the Whole House): The report of the farming
         occupies but ten lines Let the man who goes to the County Treasurer's office to pay his
         taxes read this. There are many farmers in Indiana who never heard of Purdue University,
         who raise better crops than these ten lines show. "Corn, fifty bushels to the acre,
         although the crops had not been gathered or weighed." How is this? Then the crops were let
         out to farmers to gather. Some swivels were made by them, and the only thing curious about
         them was that it was hard to tell whether they were patterns of harrows or patent churns.
         The President of the University speaks of their blacksmith shops, yet his report shows an
         indebtedness to a blacksmith at Lafayette.</p>
        <p>And here is more information from that agricultural college - that they have found that
         you can dig post holes in compact as well as loose earth; and the only recompense they have
         for this information is to give yon the name of the firm manufacturing these post holes.
         And another thing they tell us is of a system they have of keeping hairs from blowing into
         milk. What a beneficial thing! Now if they could only extend the same invention to boarding
         house hash. [Laughter.] It costs the best you can make of it $500 per year to a boy. Your
         son could attend Heidelberg for that. I am not favoring strangling Purdue, but I want it to
          <pb n="100" xml:id="VAA8558-22-448"/> take care of itself. If you vote $24,000 to Purdue
         in this body you place a millstone about your neck and of course I expect the gentlemen
         from Tippecanoe to vote for it. I would not blame them for it. But others should not. I
         have no persona], animosity. I speak as a matter of justice and right.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: It seems to me that the amendment to strike out this appropriation resolves
         itself into this thing: Shall Indiana support Purdue or let it die? and shall Indiana see
         fit to withdraw its support from educational institutions? The labor of an educated man is
         worth more than the labor of an ignorant man. This is acknowledged everywhere. It is our
         duty to educate - it is our patriotism. The gentleman refers to certain colleges which are
         doing great work. Still these colleges are no part of the State. Shall the State entirely
         cease educating. The gentleman refers us to Valparaiso? Valparaiso is in my part of the
         State, and I ought to be proud of it. But I must say that pupils attend that because it is
         a continuous picnic. Paying board and tuition is about all there is to that. We must not
         judge Purdue farm by the amount of grain grown, but the experiments made there. There were
         fifty-one kinds of grain grown there last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: To the proposition to strike out this item I can not agree, I have heard
         the speech of the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Williams) It was eloquent, sarcastic and
         carefully prepared. If this college is not sustained, as the State agreed with the United
         States, then John Purdue's heirs may come in to reclaim the property. The college is not so
         much to put boys to the manuel of farm labor, but to teach them about it. It was never so
         contemplated in the founding and endowment of the college; but it was founded to teach the
         mechanical arts. They gentleman says that if they undertake to teach the mechanical arts to
         ladies they violate the contract. That is his idea, but is not mine. When the State may
         tire of this property, then the Legislature, by an act, can give back the property to John
         Purdue's heirs. There may be some doubt if Indiana can keep three half-starved
         institutions; it may be better to have only one; but so long as we keep possession of the
         money of John Purdue we must keep faith with the college. I am not in favor of $24,000, but
         I am in favor of giving a reasonable appropriation. Better have no State institution of
         learning than a starved one. This opposition comes from one or two gentlemen - led by the
         gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon.) He has assaulted the State University, Purdue
         University, and we may look for him to charge on the State Normal School - all in the
         interest of monopoly of the DePauw University, named after a man who can not write a
         grammatical sentence.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I do not see why a rider should be put on this bill. The committee has
         decided that the institution shall have $18 500. There is no reason to say that they are a
         set of thieves at Purdue. By this system the college must necessarily be run on credit.
         Treat Purdue as you do other institutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Seriously I do not see why the amendment should not be adopted. It is shown
         that the income of this institution is sufficient to pay the faculty. The President of that
         institution by his manipulations of the trustees of Purdue draws a salary of $3 000 per
         year, which is more than he ought to have. His salary is higher than other educators of
         equal capacity in the State. Two years ago when this matter was up before this body the
         President came here to lobby for the appropriation. He boarded with the member from
         Tippecanoe and was without expense, but when he went home he presented his bill and drew
         $150 for expenses, though he came here on a railway pass. That is why we ask a rider on
         this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: The report of the President of the college shows that the cost of the
         instructors - for instructing seventy-three students outside of Tippecanoe County - was the
         enormous sum of a little over $17,000. The salaries of the librarian, janitor and others
         run the bills up so that it is proper for us to put a rider on this bill.</p>
        <p>The amendment to the <choice>
          <sic>amendmet</sic>
          <corr>amendment</corr>
         </choice> was rejected.</p>
        <p>The amendment was also rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. PLEASANTS offered an amendment that the money appropriated shall embrace the interest
         on the State bonds held by the university.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD moved to strike out the item to appropriate $25 000 for new buildings, shops,
         etc., at Purdue University.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 35; negative, 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON moved to insert $15,000.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 33; negative, 32</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON moved to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The question recurring on the amendment to make the sum $15,000 - </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON said that the full amount, if any, should be allowed. The object is to
         enlarge the building. The ambition of Professor Smart is to build that institution so it
         will tower above all others. We should not make an appropriation, however, now; wait until
         we find whether the people desire to continue all these institutions separate or as one</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: How long shall we wait until we know this? Does the farmer wait
         to build his house and barn until he knows whether he will succeed with his crops?</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: There can be no half way place. If the building is constructed it <pb n="101"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-449"/>must have the $25,000. The catalogue says that the work of the
         mechanical department was highly satisfactory. Why do they now ask for this sum? After we
         gave the sum which they said they must have to run the college, the next minute they ask
         for this enormous sum. There are shops all over this country that are not experimental. We
         can not afford to pay this sum for an experimental one for Purdue.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOM: When I arose this afternoon to vote on the proposition to give Purdue
         $15,000, some one said: "Sit down, McBroom." That raised my Irish blood some, but it has
         gone down. I was in favor of giving Purdue enough to run it, but I do not want to impose
         the tax for this new building. We do not propose to build a wall around Lafayette for the
         sake of experiment.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE the committee arose and reported progress.</p>
        <p>And then the House adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This is a very important bill and should be considered by sections and

        <p>Mr. FOULKE: Under the Senate rules no amendment by way of rider can be made to a bill on

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION</head>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD contended that bills can be amended on the third reading. [Reads from page
         901. Cushing's Manual of Parliamentary Law, Sections 2,326, 2,327 and 2,328.]</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: This bill is here on the third reading To amend it would be contrary to the
         practice in this body for many years. If the Senator presents a correct parliamentary rule,
         his course would lead to such amendment as may defeat the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: The rule of the Senate clearly indicates the course to be pursued. [Reads
         Rule 39 ] That rule clearly indicates the time for amendment is before engrossment. [Reads
         Rule 45 ] The latter park of this rule applies to all bills, whether in Committee of the
         Whole or in the Senate. That bill can not be amended at this time.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Campbell, of Hendricks, in the chair]: I don't think the
         question of amendment can be considered until an amendment is proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I amend the first section so that the duty imposed upon the Board of
         Commissioners shall be devolved upon the Judge of the county.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER: I shall hold that the amendment is in order, as I have heard no
         rule of the Senate or parliamentary law cited that prohibits the amendment of a bill at
         every stage</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH read from page 117 of Wilson's Digest of Parliamentary Law to sustain his
         position that amendments on the third reading are not in order.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE read from Cushing's Manual, Section 2,128; the rule is if amendment would
         require the bill to be re-engrossed, such amendment could not be made. When any course of
         proceedings has been taken for <pb n="[103]" xml:id="VAA8558-22-451"/> a long course of
         years it becomes a rule for that body.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: No authority has been cited that contradicts that read by the Senator from
         Lawrence (Mr. Willard), which (Cushing) is the best on parliamentary law. No rule prohibits
         amendment after engrossment.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: We are about to confirm a usage that has been established
         here for a quarter of a century or we are about to depart from that It is desirable that at
         any stage the Senate should have the power to amend a bill, and the rules of the Senate
         provide amply for that. [Reads Rule 41.]</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS reads from page 234, Congressional Digest. Upon the third reading it is a
         plain proposition no amendments can be offered Rule 39 of the Senate settles this
         question.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: While it appears to be an extraordinary proceeding to amend a bill on the
         third reading, still it may be done [Reads from Cushing's Parliamentary Law.]</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH reads from 234, Congressional Digest, Rule 22. On the third reading a bill
         is not subject to amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Page 200, Rule 22, clause 1, does not carry out what is there stated in the
         Digest.</p>
        <p>Mr McCULLOUGH: The section, 2,326, in Cushing's Manual, read by the Senator from
         Lawrence, has no reference to the situation of the bill before the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: This is a vital question; as to whether the Senate can at all times control
         any measure before it, and every part and portion of it. In no parliamentary digest can
         there be found a word that will tend to overthrow this proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: This is a question whether a precedent that has been established here for years
         shall be overturned and a new rule made.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Every single authority quoted here today shows that bills are subject to
         amendment on the third reading. The rules of the Senate show it and the Constitution of the
         State testify to the fact that amendments, except by way of rider, are permisiable on the
         third reading.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Chair understands the almost universal rule is that after
         engrossment the question is "shall the bill pass?" The Chair is of the opinion that rules
         of the Senate leave the logical inference that other amendments than those by way of rider
         are in order. The decision of the Chair is that the amendment is in order.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE and Mr. SELLERS submitted an appeal, to-wit:</p>
        <p>The President of the Senate having decided that engrossed H. R. 222 can be amended on
         third reading without recommitting and over objection, we, the undersigned, respectfully
         appeal from the decision of the Chair.</p>
        <p rend="right">E. B. SELLERS,</p>
        <p rend="right">J. W. YOUCHE.</p>
        <p>The question being "shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the
         Senate?</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to sustain the Chair by yeas 12. nays 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, explaining his vote: I did not agree with the decision of the
         Chair. I believe that our rules by implication and our practice did not permit amendment on
         the third reading, but as I have just found an authority that seems to make it clearly
         parliamentary to amend, I shall vote to sustain parliamentary law as against our custom. At
         the bottom of Page 227, Jefferson's Manual, I find a discussion of engrossment and this
         statement: "But the Senate of the United States is so much in the habit of making many and
         material amendments at the third reading that it has become a <choice>
          <sic>pratice</sic>
          <corr>practice</corr>
         </choice> not to engross a bill till it has passed." With such authority as the custom of
         the United States Senate I shall vote to sustain the Chair.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS (explaining): My personal views would be, as a matter of propriety, that
         amendments should be allowed upon the third reading of a bill, without requiring unanimous
         consent or reference to a committee. But this Senate has decided in a number of instances
         unanimously, and in cases where it would have been eminently proper to have a bill amended
         on the third reading, that it could not be done; and I believe to allow amendments on the
         third reading, without the guard of engrossment and with the thin showing of authority on
         the journals that such amendments were made, would, perhaps, in manv instances give
         opportunity to pass bills finally in an uncertain and ambiguous way. I am constrained to
         vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: It has never been held since I have been a member of the Senate or of the
         other House that a bill can be amended on the third reading, exempt by unanimous consent or
         sending the bill to a committee, so I shall vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Believing that the best interests of legislation requires that we should
         adhere to the rule heretofore adopted in passing bills I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: I have come to the conclusion that it would be dangerous policy to adopt a
         rule now to amend a bill on the third reading, without unanimous consent or reference to a
         committee. Therefore I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Of all the arguments made, I think the little speech of the Senator from
         St. Joseph (Mr. Campbell) the most conclusive. In giving his reasons for changing his mind
         and voting to sustain the Chair, I think he voted wrong. We have ordered this bill
         engrossed, and I think the Senator was mistaken in his application. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: It has been held here on several occasions that a bill could not
         be amended on the third reading. I didn't think that was a very fair way to get a bill
         through, because you can not at all <pb n="104" xml:id="VAA8558-22-452"/> times get
         unanimous consent to amend, and it is not always convenient to recommit a bill with
         instructions. I have never been satisfied with former rulings of the Senate on this
         question. I believe a bill ought to be subject to amendment up to the very time the vote is
         taken upon it. Therefore I vote to sustain the ruling of the Chair.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Whenever I find authority absolutely against me I yield to the
         authority. I find the following. [Reads]. With this law in my hand I don't see how I can
         vote any other way than to sustain the Chair. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I have frequently heard this question decided at this session contrary to the
         decision just rendered The Senator from Cass, while in the chair the other day, so decided
         this very question. Taking all things into consideration I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the Senate refused to sustain the decision of the Chair.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER: The amendment proposed by the Senator from Cass is ruled out of
         order in accordance with the decision of the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved that discussion on this bill shall close at 10:30 o'clock to-morrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: Every Senator has the right to express his views and have them go upon the
         record. This motion will not give time. By the time prayers are offered and the journal
         read as far as it is usually the hour named in the motion will nearly have arrived.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: In the debate this afternoon it was stated by the friends of the bill that
         it should be discussed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: Some amendments referred to this committee were not incorporated in this
         bill, and I would like to know why.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I insist upon my motion, that debate shall cease at 10:30 o'clock
         to-morrow.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HILLIGASS this motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to make this bill the special order for 9:30 o'clock to-morrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE signed this report, at the request of other members of the committee, in order
         to get the bill before the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. BRYANT: The present ditch law is a good law, but if it can be made better he would be
         in favor of such an amendment. The people are dissatisfied with the present law because of
         the expense.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved an amendment that the vote shall not be taken before Monday at 2
         o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>The motion, as amended, was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The Senate adjourned till to-morrow.</p>

        <p>Mr. STALEY: The bill makes no exception as to manufactories. For the reason that many

         kinds of labor at certain times, it would do. I would rather see children at work eight or
         ten hours a day when not at school than idle. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: For the reason that every labor organization and Trades Assembly in Indiana
         asks this bill, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: If the bill prohibited heavy labor or that dangerous or injurious to bodily
         development, I should support it. Idleness enforced by failure to find work is bad enough,
         but idleness enforced by law it worse. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: I voted for this bill under the impression that it was to prevent labor under
         ground; but as I find it has no exception, I change my vote from "aye" to "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: For the reason I believe that children under the age of twelve years should
         be in school; and if the parents are unable to send them to school the State ought to
         provide the means, I therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: For the same reason given by the gentleman I change my vote to "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: As the bill is too broad I change my vote to "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: For the reason that <pb n="105" xml:id="VAA8558-22-453"/> our State
         platform is pledged to this bill; for the reason that the labor organizations demand it - </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: Does the gentleman wish to change his vote?</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: No, sir; I was going to say that I voted "aye" and would vote "aye"
         again.</p>
        <p>So the bill was defeated as noted above.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. GORDON the vote was reconsidered and the bill was referred to a select
         committee of three with instructions to amend so as to prohibit the employment of child
         labor in coal mines, iron and steel manufactories, and such other establishments as would
         be deleterous to their health, and that they should not be compelled to work more than
         eight hours a day.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD made a motion, which was laid on the table by a vote of 9 to 17, to instruct the
         committee to report in favor of the indefinite postponement of the bill, the committee
         being composed of Messrs. Gordon, Williams and Hopkins.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMAN made an ineffectual motion that the age be ten instead of twelve years.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: This bill ought not to be recommitted, but defeated at once. It is not the
         province of this Legislature to say what kind of work children shall do. In my county are
         300 orphans who are engaged in wood carving, manufacturing on a small scale. They do work
         that men would not do, and support themselves, dress better and look better than idlers. I
         am in favor of keeping children in school, but the only way to bring that about is by
         compulsory education. This bill is nothing of the kind. It is class legislation.</p>
        <p>Several Senate bills provoking some discussion on their second reading - </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER said: I thought it well to have these Senate bills read the second time, and
         then if they were good they might be passed, or if bad defeated. But for the reason that so
         much time is taken up in discussion on the second reading, I find it impractical, and I can
         not longer push them and stand in the way of the Appropriation bill, So this order will not
         be pursued this afternoon. I hoped to have disposed of them all, but this could not be
         done.</p>

        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: I move to take up the bill [H. R. 476] to compel railways built within the
         past five years, to make crossings where the road runs through a man's real estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I do not believe this is right. I called up this appropriation under the call
         of my county. It has been hanging fire since Friday last. It should in justice to ourselves
         and the people be completed.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I move that further consideration of this bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 7, nays 77.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNES explaining his vote, said: In view of the fact that a great many have very
         small tracts of land near the railway, say a quarter of an acre, and as this would compel a
         crossing to be built there, I vote "aye" to postpone</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY: I understand that the bill affects only where railways have been built is the
         last five years I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Section 1 of the bill contains an error in a word being omitted or something
         wrongly worded. I think it should be postponed, and I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>So the motion to postpone was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE moved to recommit to the Committee on Railroads, with instructions to amend
         the bill so as to embrace railroads built within the past twenty-five years</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: The reason why I put it five years is because roads built before that time
         have adjusted this matter with farmers whose lands are occupied. I had no object as to
         time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL believed that the bill should be recommitted with the instructions.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend to embrace all railways.</p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was then withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY: The bill is now before the House, I believe. We have one railway passing
         through our entire county. Along its line are many small pieces of land - mere patches. To
         build a crossing for each one of these patches will be an enormous expense. It will cost
         $500 to build these crossings. Then would you put a $500 crossing on a patch not worth
         $100? The railway of that county makes no money - scarcely lives. The men who own it keep
         it up merely to save what they invested in it. While railways are servants of the public,
         they should be permitted to live. We don't want to drive out men because they have invested
         in railroads. This bill should be killed in its present shape; at least it should be
         referred to a committee that it may be corrected.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. KELLISON the bill was recommitted to a special committee of three,
         consisting of Messrs Kellison, Frazee and Cory, with instructions to include all railways
         and report a 3 o'clock to-day.</p>

         the committee will came at once to a vote.</p>
        <p>It was so agreed.</p>
        <p>The motion to strike out the item of $24,000 was rejected upon a division - affirmative,

        <p>Mr. GORDON: I move to amend by making the sum donated to Purdue University $l0,000
         instead of $24,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD offered a substitute to make the sum $20 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON proposed $23 000</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD proposed $12 000 He said: I am not in favor of giving a cent, but this is coming
         half way and compromising.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, proposed $21,000.</p>

        <p>Mr. HAYWORTH proposed $15,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe A few thousand dollars from Indiana is not much to an
         institution whose life depends on the money. This is not a money-making institution, and
         your votes to-day are to say whether it shall live or die. In the name of Indiana, don't
         cut its throat. We need $24 000 - at least $20,000.</p>

         of the Auditor of State as to what it was [Reads]</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: Yesterday I opposed Purdue University and was in favor then, as now, of
         cutting off all appropriations for that institution, hoping to kill it outright, and I
         voted on the motion to strike out the $24,000 appropriation. But as the House has refused
         to strike out the whole amount asked for and as the attempt now is to starve it to death by
         degrees instead of killing it openly, I now stand ready to vote for the full amount
         asked.</p>
        <p>The motion to substitute $15,000 was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY proposed $8 000. He said: I am no enemy to Purdue. I helped to create it. It is
         no life or death matter with Purdue. It is rich and will live.</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE proposed $16 000</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH proposed $17,747.39.</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: I am a firm friend of Purdue University. I do not want it crippled James H
         Smart has the confidence of every man in Indiana.</p>
        <p>Let us give according to the dignity of the State. Give it what it deserves, or cut it
         off and let it go.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY offered a substitute that the sum be $18,500.</p>
        <p>The substitute was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 46; negative, 34</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD offered an amendment that after the word dollars be added the words: "Provided,

         draw all its money at once, after being allowed. The money should be left in the Treasury
         until needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: A great portion of this money will be needed to lay in winter
         supplies</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: The amendment should not prevail. It will only make it necessary for the
         college to be continually buying on credit.</p>
        <p>Mr GOODING: We have made no such requirement in regard to any other institution, and we
         should not discriminate against President Smart, than whom no man in the State has more
         confidence in the people than he.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: This is all duly met in the bill, and the amendment is unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS offered an amendment to the amendment, that none of the money be applied on
         salaries. He said: It has been said here that there is enough money there to pay salaries.
         Now let this money be given to the college.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The law says that the salary of the trustees must be paid from
         the appropriation. No riders should be put on this bill.</p>

         on the bill [H. R. 480] authorizing the continuance of the new State house tax levy of ten

        <p>The only way a State debt can be created is under Section 197 of the Constitution
         [reads], which makes at least one of the amendments proposed by the committee absolutely
         necessary.</p>
        <p>In order to conform to the requirements of the Constitution, the temporary loan should be
         for the purpose of covering a "casual" deficiency. He recommenced an additional change by
         making the interest on the bonds 4 per cent annually, instead of "4 per centum, payable
         semi annually." The language of the bill might also be interpreted as including the
         $150,000 for the improvement of the grounds and the appropriation of $350,000 for the
         completion of the building.</p>
        <p>On his further motion the report of the committee was concurred in, the bill read the

         of money has failed during the session. We have already passed a bill for a loan of
         $600,000, and this bill is for a loan of $500,000 more, when we were told it would not be
         necessary to make another loan. This is an increased burden. The State is being plunged
         hopelessly in debt. Taxation will have to be increased, and somebody will have to answer
         for it. Bat as the bill is necessary, I am compelled to vote "aye."</p>

        <head rend="center">CIRCUIT COURT DITCHING BILL.</head>
        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order, being the bill [H. R.
         222] to abolish the office of District Commissioner, on its third reading.</p>
        <p>Mr SELLERS: This bill is a new law embodying many of the provisions of the act of 1883
         and 1881. The first section is similar to Section 4 273 of the Statutes of 1881, the only
         difference being that by this bill the Board of Commissioners shall appoint a Drainage
         Commissioner to hold office for two years, and who shall be acquainted with the wants and
         wishes of the people of the neighborhood. Section 2 is almost verbatim the act of 1883.
         Section 3 changes the law of 1883 (Section 2) with regard to notification by serving on the
         owner or occupant a written or printed notice in the same manner as summons are issued. A
         further provision allows notice to be served on agents of railway companies - the companies
         not owning land but only the right of way. As to non-residents, the old form of notices are
         to be given. The bill gives ten days in which to remonstrate against the petition. The law
         of 1881 gave no time - the law of 1883 gave three days. This bill changes the law of 1883.
         At the time set for docketing, if two-thirds of the owners remonstrate, the petition shall
         be dismissed so that no one man can force upon the community a burdensome and unnecessary
         proceeding. The bill authorizes the court to appoint a third disinterested commissioner in
         each particular case, thus giving to all interested a fair hearing; thence down to line 67
         of the printed bill, Section 3, is similar to the old law. There the County Surveyor is
         required to note the lay of the ditches, the grade, etc., and turn over the notes to his
         successor. He shall give bond and be under oath. The bill provides that the notices shall
         be at the cost of petitioners. In Section 4, ten days is given to remonstrate, in every
         respect similar to the provision on page 176 of the acts of 1883 A person may sometimes
         find but one to join in making a drain, when a proceeding in court must be had. Where all
         interested agree, there is no necessity for court proceedings. The remonstrator should pay
         the costs. Section 5 materially changes the law: "Including reasonable attorney's fees" are
         new. The cost of serving notices may be avoided by the petitioner serving the notices
         himself. The attorneys' fees must be submitted to the court, who will adjudicate the amount
         to be allowed No costs or expenses, except on contracts, shall be paid until allowed by the
         court; that is a new provision. In the item of assessment there will be a greater saving
         than by reason of any other change, as but one notice is required where five notices were
         required formerly. A new provision is: The land owner assessed shall have the privilege of
         doing the work on contract at the same price as the lowest and best bidder, who can only
         bid by stations. There are some sixty executions in Jasper County now in cases where there
         are no bidders of sums sufficient to pay the assessments against the lands.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS (resuming) The provisions of the bill are intended to prevent delay in the
         construction of the work. The next amendment to the old law commence at line 68, page 10,
         of the printed bill. These in default should pay the additional expense. This was added by
         the Committee and is one of the best provisions of the bill. It has frequently been found
         that the land will not sell for the assessments made for the improvement, so everything the
         owner may have may be swept away in order that the wet land he once owned maybe improved.
         This can not happen under this bill. Section 6 is a copy of the old law down to line
         sixteen. There a new provision is added. In many counties persons are <choice>
          <sic>abliged</sic>
          <corr>obliged</corr>
         </choice> to go to a great deal of trouble in order to get rid of such liens, although they
         have been paid. If this bill does not pass another ought to be passed to obviate this
         difficulty. Section 7 materially changes the law of 1883. The first three lines are
         similar. Under the old law a great complaint was that Commissioners got in too much time;
         in some instances charging a day for any part of it spent on any one drain, and they
         frequently had quite a number to superintend. This is an advantage to be derived from this
         bill; so that each work can have a superintendent that will give a sufficient time to the
         work not to cause delay. This section also fixes the per diem at $3 per day for the time
         actually and necessarily employed. In many counties they have heretofore been paid $5 per
         day. Section 8 is an exact copy, as I recollect it; it is an exact copy of Section 6 of the
         act of 1883 Section 9 distinctly states who should pay the benefits assessed. Section 10
         provides the work shall be under the control of the County Surveyor, the sum necessary to
         be paid out of the county funds to be reimbursed by those benefited, and also provides for
         appeals. Section 11 allows Surveyors $4 and Commissioners $3 per day. At the end is added a
         provision for pay to <pb n="109" xml:id="VAA8558-22-457"/> the Surveyor of $3 a day when
         his work shall be mainly clerical. If he works on two or more drains in one day, he must
         charge only for the time employed. Section 12 exempts from the provisions of this bill
         commenced heretofore. Section 14 is the emergency clause. A great many petitions are now
         being filed, and if the operations of this bill are delayed until regular publication of
         the laws, it will give the people no relief, because they will thus be relieved from the
         provisions of this act. I have conceded many minor matters in order that this report may be
         unanimous. The Committee took into consideration all disputed questions of which we had any
         knowledge and attempted to cure them in this bill. There are several important measures in
         this bill that should commend it to Senators, and all interested. I promised I would only
         explain the changes made in this bill from the present law. I may have overlooked some, but
         I have endeavored to refer to them all. It has been suggested that the appeal should be in
         the county where the land lies, but it ought to be under the charge of the Surveyor at the
         head or source of the ditch, as that is the place where proceedings must first be
         instituted; that is the place where the appeal should be taken if any is provided for. The
         object of the law is not only to give the people the relief of drainage, but also to
         provide for keeping the drain open. If the County Surveyor at the beginning of action is a
         competent person he will continue to keep the ditch open. After the work is completed
         nobody but the County Surveyor acts.</p>

        <p>Mr. KELLISON moved that the Senate concurrent resolution that an expert be employed by
         the Senate committee to compare the measurements of the walls of the Insane Asylum,
         relative to the Martin claim, lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON, explaining his vote, said: I have been opposed to this claim from the
         first. I do not believe in appointing a man to further the claim. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY, when his name was called, said: The resolution does not appoint an expert to
         go out to the asylum and measure the walls, but to compare the measurements heretofore
         made. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON made an ineffectual motion to amend so that the expert be employed to
         measure the walls.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES believed that the resolution proposed no advantage.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: I believe that the claim is a just one, and am heartily in favor of concurring
         in the resolution. I believe that it will result in allowing the claim.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr WILLIAMS an amendment was adopted that the expert be allowed no more than
         $50.</p>
        <p>Mr. BUTZ: I move to amend that the expert employed be a resident outside of Marion
         County.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: I do not favor insinuating that the men of Indianapolis or Marion County are
         not honest The pay to be allowed is but $50, and to select a man outside will exhaust all
         the money allowed</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: I fully appreciate the compliment paid Marion County by the gentleman, but
         I hope the amendment will prevail. Any man in Marion County will come here under a cloud.
         We ought to adopt the amendment that the expert should come from outside the State.</p>

        <head rend="center">THE APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN, the House resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole (Mr.
         Adams in the Chair) for the consideration of the bill [H. R. 527] to make general
         appropriations for expenses of the State government.</p>
        <p>The question being on the amendment by Mr. REEVES to allow Purdue University $l for new
         buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN said: We are here talking to save the people's money. Here we have from the
         catalogue a description of the present buildings. [Reads.] This shows that the present
         capacity of the buildings is abundant. They have plenty of room and enough of tools. I am
         not in favor of giving $1, but $1 is easier to pay than $25 or <pb n="110"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-458"/> $25,000 Give them money; money is all they want. And then on the
         banks of that classic Wabash will spring such an institution as was never known in the
         State. Think of giving them $40,000 a one time! Who owns Purdue? Does the State or do the
         Representatives from Tippecanoe and Clinton own it? Why, along the banks of the limpid
         Wabash even the catfish become more active as they pass Purdue. After awhile there is no
         telling what Purdue may turn out. There is no telling. Even the willows that bow themselves
         along the Wabash will even have intelligence. Why, even down in Sullivan County, along the
         Wabash, the inspiration seems to reach us as Purdue University is enlightening the world
         This institution is a robber, and when I say it, I say it in no unfairness to Purdue. I do
         not mean it individually, but as an institution it is a robber. Money is asked for
         continually to sustain this fraud. Why do the men stay there but if for money? We are to
         legislate in the right way, and not for favoriteism. We have already appropriated $40,000
         to Purdue Those buildings have been erected at a large expense to Indiana. Of course, the
         people of Tippecanoe paid something for the institution; but they did that to get it, and
         they have the students to make money out of. They have sent their greatest man here, and he
         has voted for every measure on this floor, I suppose, to keep the good feelings of the
         other members that they might all vote for Purdue. But this is the last year for Purdue. It
         will die, and never to rise again. The farmers and mechanics do not favor this. Whoever
         heard of the gentleman from Tippecanoe (Mr. Smith) or the gentleman from Clinton (Mr.
         Staley) raising their voices for the grand old college at Bloomington?</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN: The gentleman has gone far enough. The gentleman is out of order, and can
         not longer impugn the motives of the two gentlemen. The gentleman will proceed.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: The rule says the gentleman shall not proceed.</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN: As soon as he is in order.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: The rules say he shall take his seat, and may not proceed without the consent
         of the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: I move that the gentleman be allowed to proceed.</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN: The gentleman is granted the floor if he will keep in order.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: That is fair and well enough. In eleven years Purdue has cost the State
         $7,000 for agricultural implements. And it is not an agricultural college nor is it a State
         institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This gentleman talks as if no one outside the State could enter
         this institution, but residents of Tippecanoe County. Of course this is not true. The
         $25,000 asked for is to construct buildings and to provide them with tools. In all the
         history of Purdue, every single item of expense has been open to the world. I propose to
         state facts every time, upon the honor of a man. Tippecanoe County has done not only nobly
         by Purdue, but has given $77,000 to Asbury University. I think as much of De Pauw
         University as any man in the State. It you donate this money the building will be
         constructed, and you may rely upon it. You say that if we need $25,000 we are not in
         earnest if we take $15,000. However if we secure the $15 000 it may be invested in the
         buildings, and then if you give us the tools we can use them.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE moved as a substitute that the sum be $17 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: Gentlemen come here and ask for various sums to support the State
         institutions. We have met their wishes. We may have said that their expenses were high, but
         we have never before said that they needed nothing at all. The intimation back of this is
         that the State will abandon Purdue Any party or clique which may do so to go before the
         people of Indiana on that issue will go down. Purdue University constitutes an important
         part of the educational system of the State, though the youngest. When it comes to make
         appropriations for the State educational institutions the people are always ready for it.
         In our county the people are almost ready for prodigality; so are the people of the State.
         The educational institutions are for the common people; they are for the poor man. The
         people demand all the State educational institutions. We must give liberally - we can not,
         we dare not oppose it.</p>
        <p>The substitute to make the sum $17,000 was rejected by yeas 34, nays 35.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES withdrew his amendment to make the sum $1.</p>
        <p>The amendment to make the sum $15,000 was rejected by yeas 34, nays 36</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM offered an amendment that the sum be $12,000.</p>
        <p>This amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. GORDON the committee then proceeded to the next item.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.</head>
        <p>Mr. DEBS moved that the item appropriating $7,000 to the State Normal School at Terre
         Haute be $10,O0O He said: This school ought to be generously supported by the State. This
         money is needed. The State Normal School educates teachers for the Common Schools. The bill
         in the Senate to make the tuition fund $25,000 failed, and the extra $3,000 is needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I hope this amendment will prevail The State Normal School is a part of our
         Common School system. It prepares teachers for our Common Schools. We ought not to fail to
         sustain it liberally. It has a reputation not confined to Indiana. While others are here
         lobbying for their institutions, no one is here in that capacity for the State Normal.</p>
        <pb n="111" xml:id="VAA8558-22-459"/>
        <p>Mr WILLIAMS: As one citizen of Indiana I am proud of the Common School system, and as a
         part of our Common School system I favor the State Normal School. I think this sum is
         moderate enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I believe the State Normal School is a creditable institution and should be
         supported. The Trustees, however, did not ask for the sum of $10,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST: The people of Steuben County are hard pressed, but they are willing to give to
         our educational institutions what is right.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Give the $10,000 to the institution, for it needs it, and
         repair the wrong you have done to education by refusing Purdue. I am in favor of the State
         Normal with its 1,100 students, and am for Bloomington. I am no dog in the manger.</p>
        <p>The amendment to make the sum $10,000 was adopted by yeas 39, nays 23</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. DITTEMORE the committee arose, reported progress, and asked leave to sit

        <p>On motion of Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe, the resolutions on the death of the later
         Representative Browning were taken from the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said that Mr. Browning was an honored citizen. He had buffeted
         with the cares of life, but he had played life's part well. It was a pleasure to remember
         Mr. Browning as the speaker remembered him. There had been excitement of debate, but this
         was all forgotten. He was a representative man, a patriot, and in the days that a cloud
         rested upon the country he went forth to fight the battles of his country. Patriotism is
         the highest type of manhood, and the deceased was indeed a patriot. We shall not meet our
         friend again, for he has passed to another land. Patriots of old may have died with but
         imperfect ideas of a future state, but it was not so with the man whose life is
         commemorated by these services, and we all feel that he has gone to tha rest which awaits
         those who follow the dictates of conscience and discharge their duties with honor and
         fidelity.</p>
        <p>Mr. HELMS said that it had been his lot to know the deceased as a neighbor, as a soldier,
         as an officer of the law, and as a legislator. As a neighbor he was kind and good to all
         alike. He was an earnest advocate, and he never saw a case of any importance tried in the
         Brown Circuit Court but he was on one side or the other. As an officer in the army he was
         faithful in the discharge of his duties, kind to his men, and certainly no braver man was
         in the service. He was wounded in the fight at Rasacca, Ga., and incapacitated for further
         service. He was elected Prosecutor, and no man can say that he ever prosecuted a man in a
         spirit of revenge. He was a minister of the Gospel for the past sixteen years, and was a
         devoted Christian. He leaves a wife and daughter and a host of friends to mourn bis loss.
         "Although we differed religiously and politically, I feel that I have lost a friend who can
         not be easily replaced."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING said he felt that Mr Browning had been a useful and honest Representative;
         always faithful to his trust.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS remembered him as a Union soldier, and he gallantly defended the flag of his
         country. For the past twelve years he had known him quite intimately, having frequently met
         him in court. He had also known him as a minister. Mr. Browning will be missed by his
         people. No man could have fallen in the community that would be more missed than he. He was
         dear to all his people, and especially to the young, with whom he was a general
         favorite.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOMS had known the deceased from the assembling of the Legislature, and had been
         impressed with his course. Death is a fearful thing, but we have a panacea in the knowledge
         that there is a future state which possesses none of the cares and grave responsibilities
         of our sojourn here.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said that he knew but little of the deceased before the meeting of the
         Legislature, though he had met him in conventions. He found him always earnest and bold in
         presenting his <pb n="112" xml:id="VAA8558-22-460"/> opinions, and zealous in his zeal for
         the rights of the people.</p>
        <p>Speaker JEWETT said: "It were idle to expect that any word of mine could add to the
         fullness or merit of the tributes already tendered to the memory of our late companion,</p>
        <p>"My opinion of this man who has gone from among us was wholly made up from his bearing
         and action as a member of this body. So I first met him and last saw him. As such I learned
         to admire the rugged honesty of his speech and the absolute integrity of his motives and
         acts. These latter are now the subject of Omnipotent judgment, and our weak comment thereon
         can neither please nor vex the dull ear of the dead. The death of this man or of any man
         has, it seems to me, no value or importance to those of us who yet remain save this, that
         it reiterates and emphasizes the truth that all who live shall die. So regarded such an
         event admonishes us to look upon each succeeding day as an added and perhaps a last
         opportunity to discharge the obligations of the present and the neglected duties of the
         past. Thus warned we may, in a spirit of self-sacrifice, hail each of the mornings yet to
         come with the brave thought - </p>

        <p>Mr. BAILEY introduced a concurrent resolution to instruct Senators and request Indiana
         Representatives in Congress to use their influence for the most strict enforcement of the
         National eight hour law, and to amend said law so that eight hours shall be the measure for
         a day's labor in all mechanical and industrial employments except agriculture.</p>
        <p>He said: This resolution is similar in terms to the joint resolution which was introduced
         here some time ago, but lost. I will ask now its adoption. I move it be adopted.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">SCHOOL FUND LOANS.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. ZIMMERMAN the bill H. R. 481 was read the second time, with a favorable
         committee report.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: A great amount of money is lost to the school fund because the Auditors are
         not compelled to collect interest promptly on loans made therefrom; when a bad loan is made
         the county is compelled to make up the loss. This bill is proposing to take away some of
         the safeguards thrown around the school fund. It provides that loans may be made outside of
         the county. The purpose of the present statute is that loans may be made in small amounts,
         while this bill proposes to admit of loans to one person in the sum of $5,000. Such
         borrowers compel their friends to appraise the land high. We should not depart from the
         long established principle to loan this money to small borrowers. Then it is not a correct
         principle to allow the funds to be loaned outside of the county; so that the people of each
         county may have the benefit of the fund, which was the evident intent of the laws. I see
         nothing in this bill desirable. Where money is not loaned, it is only temporary, in a short
         time the demand for these funds come.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: The merits of this bill ought to be discussed before a full Senate. There
         should be some amendment to it. I move its reference to a select committee of three, with
         directions to report to-morrow.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to and the President pro tem. appointed Messrs. Weir, Youche and
         Zimmerman.</p>

        <p>It would be difficult to depict the manifestation of approval of Hon. Rufus Magee's

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, offered the following:</p>

           <p>Resolved. That the Indiana Senate congratulate President Cleveland for his good

        <p>Mr. YOUCHE expressed gratification at the appointment.</p>
        <p>He was followed by Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, and Mr. CAMPBELL,
         of Hendricks, who <pb n="114" xml:id="VAA8558-22-462"/> declared that the Democrats, in the
         measure of their enthusiasm, did not exceed the Republicans.</p>
        <p>The resolution was adopted by a standing vote.</p>
        <p>Tears that could not be concealed attested Mr. Magee's feeling, and, in response to
         repeated calls for a speech, he bespoke a few words of appreciation of a tribute so cordial
         and sincere. His heart was too full to say much.</p>
        <p>After a short recess, during which Mr. Magee's hand was shaken in hearty congratulation,- </p>
        <p>Speaker JEWETT spoke, alluding to the fact that he and the gentleman this day honored,
         something over twenty years ago, were students together in the State University. "Then, as
         now," continued Mr. Jewett, "young Magee was noted for his industry and truth, and his
         aversion to every character of artifice and chicanery. The integrity that has characterized
         his action in this body won the friendship of his fellow students."</p>

        <p>Mr. WEIR returned from a committee his bill [S. 236] with amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr YOUCHE: This bill is a very important departure from the law heretofore, and it should
         be printed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: All along the Kankakee hunting clubs from other States have purchased wet lands
         by the thousand acres, they have stretched one wire around the land, and now say to
         everybody else "stand off." There are but one or two sections in this bill and it is easily
         understood. There is no need of printing it. The bill only refers to untillable lands.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It is not right to allow aliens to come in the State and buy up lands
         in large bodies for sporting purposes and exclude therefrom citizens of the State of
         Indiana. This bill ought to pass without question.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: Where a club, so called, comes from other States, it should not be allowed to
         say to all the people of Indiana, "Keep off, these are our hunting grounds." It's the duty
         of the Legislature to say that our citizens shall not be guilty of a trespass by going on
         such lands. The bill provides it shall not be lawful to hold untillable lands for hunting
         purposes exclusively, whether enclosed or not. The more I reflect upon it, the more willing
         I am to consent to the printing of the bill, and that it be made a special order for
         to-morrow at — o'clock.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

        <head rend="center">GAMING ON FAIR GROUNDS.</head>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved to take up the bill [H R 172] to prevent gambling in county fair
         grounds.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 2.</p>
        <p>A majority report of a special committee recommended its passage with amendments, and a
         minority report recommending the adoption of all the committe amendments except Section 2
         were read.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE favored striking out Section 2 because it gives any person who notifies any
         President or Secretary that any game is being carried on in a fair ground, and if the
         officer does not remove the offender a fine is imposed on the officer, and it makes the
         notifier the prosecutor and the accuser. It puts too much power in the hands of any one
         person who thinks he has discovered a violation of the law. It gives extraordinary power
         and jeopardizes the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: If there is no gambling there nobody will be hurt. When the officers of the
         fair are notified there is gambling going on they ought to put out these gamblers. I move
         to substitute the minority for the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: I think Section 2 is plainly in conflict with the Constitution of the State.
         This bill gives an apparent sanction or authority to any officer to summarily destroy
         property. This provision is clearly obnoxious. I am in favor of some law more stringent and
         effective to prevent blacklegs from swindling the farming community at these fairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: This section has no parallel on the statute books. Any one
         person may constitute himself a judge and determine that some gambling apparatus is in the
         fair ground which should be destroyed. He makes his report and is required upon information
         to execute the law, destroy the gambling apparatus and expel the owner from the ground,
         without even making a record of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: This is a terribly de- <pb n="115" xml:id="VAA8558-22-463"/> moralizing
         evil attendant upon fair grounds all over the State that ought to be eradicated.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: If this bill was passed it would be the first time in the history
         of criminal jurisprudence when a man would be made criminally liable just because he had
         notice that another man is engaged in the commission of a crime. That kind of a law would
         be unconstitutional because it authorizes destruction of property without process of
         law.</p>
        <p>The motion to substitute the minority for the majority report was rejected upon a
         division - affirmative, 10; negative, 18.</p>
        <p>The majority report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved that the constitutional rule be suspended, the amendments be
         considered as engrossed, the bill read the second time by title, the third time by sections
         and passed</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: If ever there was an instance of fool legislation it is certainly in this
         bill. Every man that desires the penalty for gambling at county fairs shall be brought down
         from $500 to $25 should vote for this bill. There are instances in which $25 is an utterly
         inadequate fine, and Senators opposed to gambling at county fairs should vote against
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: The penalty in the bill is not less than $25 nor more than $100.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The lowest amount is $10 and the highest is $500 under the present law.
         [Reads Section 2 079]. It is nonsense to bring up a law for every different exigency you
         can imagine. We are not here to stultify ourselves by any legislation such as that. We do
         not want separate and new laws to re enact the statutes we now have.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I am surprised at the Senator. He can not show me a single case where any
         of these gamblers have been punished under the $500 fine law. I hope this bill will
         pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The people do not prosecute such cases, and they will not if
         forty such laws are passed. There never was a failure made in a case of prosecution for
         gambling, because they will not prosecute a man for gambling on the fairground. This bill
         comes from the House, introduced inconsiderately, and is now in charge of the Senator from
         Ripley, who is no lawyer. The criminal laws of Indiana is a better code of criminal
         jurisprudence than than this Legislature can make. I think this bill ought to be
         defeated.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: There is no statute direct upon the question applicable to these cases.
         There are statutes touching the leasing and renting of houses for gambling purposes. As the
         bill is amended, striking out the second section, I think it ought to pass, to we can say
         to officers of agricultural grounds that you shall not rent your grounds for gambling
         purposes, just as we lay now to owners and agents of houses.</p>
        <p>The motion to suspend the constitutional rule was agreed to by yeas 34, nays 8. The bill
         was read the second time by title, the third time by sections, and failed to pass for want
         of a constitutional majority by yeas 24, nays 16.</p>

        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to recommit with instructions to amend so as to provide for three judges
         is three districts. He said three judges would be sufficient to do all the work. I have not
         been favorable to the creation of any court of this kind but if we are to have another
         court there should be but three Judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: An investigation has satisfied me a larger amount of business
         would come with the location of this court. A very small percent of appeals amount to over
         $1,000. We have passed a bill giving the Supreme Court jurisdiction in cases of claims
         against the State, and if that passes the House the Supreme Court will have a large class
         of cases. I am now in favor of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I hope the amendment will not be adopted. I call the attention to what the
         Governor says in his message in relation to the commission [Reads - see Brevier Reports,
         vol. xxii., page 35] This bill will not increase the expenses, because these Commissioners
         have been receiving $4,000 a year. The judiciary of this State cost the people less than
         that of any other State in proportion to population and value of property.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I realize the Supreme Court needs some relief. The amendment comes nearer
         to my views than anything which has been proposed, and I hope is will be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I would favor an intermediate Appellate Court rather than an increase of the
         Supreme Judges.</p>
        <p>The motion [Mr. Fowler's] was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 18; negative,
         13.</p>

        <p>Mr. PASSAGE'S bill [H. R 368] to allow children to go and return from school in
         conveyances on toll gravel roads free was read a second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN moved that the enacting clause be stricken out.</p>
        <p>Mr. HENRY: This bill simply allows children in the county to go to and from school in bad
         weather, for instance, in conveyances without paying toll. Many poor children live a great
         distance from the school house who can not walk in bad weather and can not afford to pay
         toll.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I do not think the bill is constitutional. We have no right to say who shall
         or shall not pay toll</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: Poor men are taxed arbitrarily to support these school houses, and free
         access should be had to them. The bill is in the interest of humanity, in the interest of
         poor children and their education. Funeral parties are freed from toll; certainly school
         children can be given the same freedom.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I do not believe that this Legislature can make this law. It is taking property

         from one and give it to another; that if this toll be paid it should be done by a tax on
         all, and believing that every one who votes for this will soon be ashamed of it, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Believing that nineteen-twentieths of the gravel road companies of Indiana
         are a little better than a band of robbers, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: In view of the fact that the bill will be just and fair, and that since 1885
         we have had on our statute books a law exempting funeral parties from toll, and this would
         be but just to school children, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: I believe that we have the constitutional right to make this law. We have
         passed one or more similar - notably the Railway Traffic bill. I vote "no."</p>

        <p>The question being on the amendment to make the item appropriating money to the Northern
         Prison $75 000 instead of $85,000 -</p>
        <p>Mr. Mc MULLEN: The Prison North in 1884 more than paid for itself by the labor of
         convicts, still that does not relieve the State from making the necessary
         appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. KRUEGER: There is no doubt in the world, and I say it without fear of contradiction,
         that there is not so well a managed prison anywhere as the Northern Prison. It seems to me
         there is no statesmanship in this. Nothing is to be gained by cutting this down. The prison
         more than pays for itself, and the surplus goes into the State Treasury. It is only a
         matter of form, this making an appropriation. This thing of cutting down the amount is only
         cheap buncombe to make the Appropriation bill seem smaller than two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I am in favor of the bill just as it stands. Because we are cut
         off in Tippecanoe County does not prompt me to oppose this bill. Nothing will be lost in
         making this appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARR: I am opposed to cutting this down. The sum is based, per capita, on the
         prisoners. The number is constantly increasing. The only means to draw the money is by
         appropriation. The prison supports itself and cost the State not a dollar. The item should
         stand as it is.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I do not want to make a fight on any necessary appropriation to the State
         institutions. The report of the Prison South contains a recommendation from the Board of
         Trustees that a firm be paid $6 000 for a building they built to replace one burned. This
         firm employed 300 convicts, and they make a speculation from them. There is a crying demand
         by laborers all over the State against all convict labor. Again another frame building is
         reported burned down, and this firm replaced it and want pay for that.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARR: I desire to make the point of order that the gentleman is not discussing the
         general but the specific appropriation bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: We must get our figures of the firm through the Board of Trustees. I desire to
         offer the amendment that the sum be $60,000 That is quite enough.</p>
        <p>The amendment and the amendment to the amendment were severally rejected.</p>
        <p>The question being on the amendment by Mr. KRUEGER to build a work-house and bath-room,
         library, etc. - </p>
        <p>Mr. KRUEGER: The officers can not go on and improve without the consent of the State, yet
         this will not cost the Treasury $1. The bath-rooms and the work-house are <pb n="117"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-465"/> needed. Every member of the committee argues as to that.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE: We need all of these, especially the library. The library will make it what
         we want it to be - a reformatory institution. The convicts are shut up there many hours
         while not at work with nothing to occupy the minds of the prisoners. The library ought to
         be bought at once and additions made to it yearly. Every prison should have a respectable
         library.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Perry: There are five different items in this appropriation. I think we
         should vote on them separately.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I do cot care to antagonize this, but I do not think best to put these items
         in the general appropriation. We ought to place these items in the specific bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: I think the things asked /or in this amendment are really necessary. It is
         very important that the prison is kept in a good sanitary condition and that the prisoners
         should have access to a good library. The amounts are not so important, as the prison is
         self sustaining.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: I was a member of the <orgName>Committee on Prisons</orgName>, who had the
         honor to go out and visit the prisons at my own expense. I was also on the sub-committee to
         examine the books. The prison authorities did not ask for more than $60,000. They asked
         that the gate money - that taken in from visitors - be used for library purposes. The bath
         and wash rooms are badly needed. I am willing for the $85 000, but I do not favor any
         addition. We have heard of money not used being refunded, but have never seen any of it. It
         was our business to form ourselves into a committee and interrogate those prisoners. The
         unanimous verdict was that their wants were universally attended to.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: We should correct or reform the bad as well as punish them.
         They have five hours for meals and reading, and they should have books for employment in
         idle hours. Our laws must not be unnecessarily severe. Do not build palaces for prisoners,
         but give them that food and care that will give them good health and insure an effort to
         reform them</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: The authorities of the prison said that $60 000 or $70 000 would be sufficient
         to run the prison; but the bath house and library were not counted in that.</p>
        <p>The amendments were adopted.</p>

        <p>Mr. STALEY moved an amendment to the item making the appropriation to the Reform School
         for Boys and the Reform Institute for Women that the trustees of the Female Reformatory be
         allowed a salary of $300 each. He said: This provision is simply a copy of that

         at the creek.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: I understood at first that the cost of getting water from Eagle Creek to the
         Asylum would not be more than $7,000 or $8,000. If that be the case, I would not favor this
         proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: I join in the opinion that these items should be considered not in the
         general appropriation bill, but separately.</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I am not so certain that we need to expend this sum, as wells could be built
         there, quite sufficient, and at less cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: At the last meeting of the committee on this question we requested Dr.
         Fletcher to examine as to the feasibility of bringing water from Eagle Creek. He replies
         here in a letter, which he says that water can be brought from the creek at a cost not to
         exceed $15 000, and that it can be done quickly and surely. I am of the opinion that the
         Eagle Creek scheme is the best; but I have no personal reasons. If you think best to change
         it to tapping the city mains the committee will not fight it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I do not favor acting hastily in this matter. Let us go ahead with the bill

        <p>Mr. CORY: Let the $15,000 be appropriated as the Superintendent suggests, and then if not

        <head rend="center">APPELLATE COURT.</head>
        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the Five Judge Appellate Court bill [S. 373], the
         question being on the motion (Mr. Fowler's) to recommit with instructions, pending it the
         adjournment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE resisted the motion, and contended that five Judges for such a court as the one
         proposed is none too many. Upon general principles, all agree there should be another
         Court. If this bill passes it will be eminently satisfactory to the Bar of the State, while
         the Supreme Court Commissioners have not been, because an intermediate court is
         imperatively demanded.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Realizing that the Supreme Court needs some relief, I should regret to
         vote against any such measure; but I think three Judges will be sufficient, and do more
         business than has the Commission of five Judges. I have no doubt but in a few years the
         number of the Supreme Court Judges will be increased to seven, and if this Appellate Court
         is made to consist of three we will have ten Judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I insist three Judges are sufficient. By sitting in bank they can do about
         the work of five Judges, and that is what this bill provides for. I think it was a stretch
         of constitutional power to create the Supreme Court Commissioners. No Appellate Court will
         ever be on a plane with the Supreme Court, even were equal talent on both. It is the
         experience of legislation that when an office is created it can not be dispensed with. I
         will not vote for any court bill of this kind, but if this bill must pass let it pass with
         but three Judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: We are proposing to establish a court to mete out justice as between citizens
         that has no more stability than a statute of the State. When it comes to the courts there
         should be a firmer foundation than a mere statute. A resolution has been introduced to
         increase the number of Supreme Judges, and if it passes the relief can be had in a little
         over two years. The pressure upon that court has been relieved, and we can well afford to
         wait two years more. The fact that this would be a statutory court is sufficient reason for
         me to vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected by yeas 16, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I am opposed to the passage of the bill, but will vote "no" on this
         amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I am opposed to this bill, but if we have to have it let us take it in as
         small doses as possible. A few years ago Judge Berkshire did the business of the courts in
         three counties for $1 500, and now it costs some $7 500,and Judge Bicknell did the business
         of ten counties that now cost $10 000. The increase in population and business does not
         justify this I vote "aye" now, but will vote "no" on the whole business.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE also would vote "aye" now, but "no" when the bill came up on passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Before discussion I was in favor of but three Judges, after the speech of
         the Senator from Cass, I was almost inclined to favor five Judges, but after the speech of
         the Senator from Lake I doa't know but I am opposed to the bill. I vote "aye" on this.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: Judges are the guardian angels of the property and liberty of the
         people, and are the most poorly paid of all <pb n="120" xml:id="VAA8558-22-468"/> public
         servants. On the amendment I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: Should vote against the bill but for this amendment.</p>
        <p>So the motion to recommit was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR the bill was ordered engrossed by yeas 29, nays 13.</p>

        <head rend="center">HUNTING ON UNTILLABLE LANDS.</head>
        <p>The Senate proceeded to consider the special order - Mr. Weir's bill [S. 236], the
         question being on the motion (Mr. Macy's) to strike out Section 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR was willing this amendment shall be made, as the second section was sufficient
         to accomplish the purpose desired.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, regarded the bill as unconstitutional and in derogation of the
         rights of property.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I think the first section ought to become a law. It is not the policy
         of the State to allow clubs or any person to hold large bodies of land to the exclusion of
         citizens of this State. I am in favor of a bill that will prevent the purchase of large
         tracts of lands to be held exclusively for hunting purposes. I think it would be
         constitutional and a proper statute.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The principle of the bill is correct, but we ought not to apply that
         principle to take away rights already acquired and in my opinion we can not do it. This
         thing has gone too far, and should be stopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. WETR: The people of my county are being frequently arrested because they have hunted
         on grounds belonging to a Chicago, Pittsburg or New York Club, or some gentleman of great
         fortune. This demands some remedy at the hands of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: It seems to me the object of this bill is to permit hunting
         on enclosed lands owned by others I shall vote against this bill, but would vote for an
         amendment to the statute so as the principle may apply to lands not used for agricultural
         purposes. The owner of lands can use it for any purpose that is not immoral.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This bill would affect my county very largely. I have my doubts about the
         constitutionality of this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: I don't think this bill can be amended so that the Legislature would or
         ought to pass it. The land up there is fit for nothing but duck and muskrat. I think when
         we come to the secret of this bill it is to protect sporting men in hunting on other men's
         land. They had better remain at home attending to business. It seems to me this bill ought
         to be voted down at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to add a section excluding from the provisions of this bill all lands
         heretofore purchased.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: I regard this bill as vicious and pernicious and move to indefinitely
         postpone it and everything connected with it.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 11, nays 32.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell, of Hendricks, voted "no" that a chance may be had to amend as he
         suggested.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I don't think this bill ought to pass under any consideration. I think a
         man has just as much right to buy land to raise ducks or fish on as to raise anything else.
         I have a fish pond, and am afraid this bill would allow any one to take fish from it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I am opposed to this bill, but refuse to vote for the indefinite
         postponement.</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jennings: I think the principle of the bill is right, but I think it is
         unconstitutional. If the statute of 1881, Sections 2.110 and 2.111, were amended the whole
         subject could be covered. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN: In order to give the poor man a chance to hunt and fish, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the motion was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY offered a substitute bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The substitute does not reach the question, but virtually leaves the law
         as it now stands. The bill is the kind of law that ought to be passed.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR the bill and substitute were recommitted.</p>

        <head rend="center">CIRCUIT COURT DITCHING BILL.</head>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, said there were provisions of the bill that he would like to
         support, but as the bill now stood it had contradictions and ambiguities and impractical
         features that would make it the cause of litigation and inoperative in its object of
         ditching. He thought that as the Drainage Commissioners are entirely under control of the
         Judge of the Court he ought to appoint and not the Board of County Commissioners. Section 1
         provides removal by the Board of Commissioners, while Section 7 permits the Court to
         remove. The two Commissioners first appointed shall give bond and may be objected to for
         cause, but no provision is made for the third Commissioner to give bond or to be objected
         to, yet this Commissioner may have charge of the work and handle money. No provisions are
         made that assessment shall be ratably on the assessment as were the provisions of the old
         law. The provision requiring the contracts to be in divisions of not more than 100 feet is
         impractical and burdensome. Ditching must begin from the lower end. If a contractor must be
         impeded every 100 feet by some one who is slow, it would be very great detriment, it ought
         to require representation of at least one half the land to set aside a ditch by
         remonstrance. When an engineer other than the surveyor is appointed he should be required
         to turn his notes over to the surveyor for preservation. In keeping ditches open ten days
         is not long enough to give the surveyor, especially as he might have other work to do and
         could not get to the ditch, and the bill made him finable besides, to pay the attorney fees
         of the plaintiff; and showing cause for neglect did not constitute a defense. He called
         attention to the ambiguity as to who should make assessments for clearing a ditch, and as
         to who should determine whether obstruction was the fault of the owner, and that the forms
         for application were left out of this bill which would compel the employment of an
         attorney.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOON spoke in favor of the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This is in the nature of a domestic bill. It authorizes taking private
         property for public uses. Such a law must be arbitrary, and made so it can be enforced
         against any one individual who may object. There are some provisions in this bill I feel I
         must condemn by my vote. It is the duty of the Legislature to adopt laws that will develop
         the resources of the State. The great objection to this bill is that it will require an
         adjudication of every question that will come up under it. It is bad policy to change laws
         that the Supreme Court has adjudicated upon. Every question that could grow out of the
         present ditch law has been settled, and the friends of the bill have not known where it is
         superior in all respects to the present law. It would incur a great expenses to the people
         to litigate these new questions. If the present law is disturbed except to amend it where
         experience has shown it needs amendment, the whole system will be upset. These drainage
         laws have done more than any other to add to the wealth and prosperity of the State. The
         people have become familiar with them, and if another law is enacted the many questions
         will have to be readjudicated.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I am heartily in favor of this bill Its object is to provide a better and
         an equitable system of drainage. But one objection has been made to this bill, except a
         general one. The interest of the people in the northern part of the State require the
         passage of this measure, as the present law has proved to be unsatisfactory.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I signed the committee report with the statement if a bill must pass I would
         rather see this one, as amended, than the one that came from the House, but I should oppose
         this. The most serious objection is that a two thirds remonstrance would defeat a ditch,
         though their aggregate amount of assessment may be only $50, and while the aggregate amount
         on the other side may be $5,000. There seems to be as dangerous notice required as
         possible. If by accident all lands are not included in the petition, the petitioners must
         again pay for serving notice. There are other objections to this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph, moved that the bill be recommitted with instructions to
         report the present law, with the provisions in this bill for appointment by Commissioners,
         for service of notice, and four others.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I hope this motion will not prevail. I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the motion to recommit was
         rejected by yeas 13, nays 29</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 32 nays 11.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of St Joseph: I believe the drainage of this State would be in a better
         condition if the present law were repealed than were this bill to pass</p>
        <p>Mr DRAKE: I concede there are two or three objections to the present law, but this bill
         is so unjust and so unfair I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr MACY: I am satisfied that this bill would encourage litigation, and therefore I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>So the bill passed.</p>

        <head>PURDUE UNIVERSITY.</head>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The unfinished business is the consideration of the amendment by the
         gentleman from Tippecanoe (Mr. Smith) that there be added to the appropriation bill $14,750
         for new buildings for Purdue University</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: I move to amend by <pb n="122" xml:id="VAA8558-22-470"/> adding the words
         that no part of the money shall be used for salaries for the faculty.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I accept the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: I offer as a substitute for the amendment that the sum be $12,500 instead Of
         $14,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I have been consistent on this floor in standing by all the
         State institutions. Long before the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) had completed his
         college education Tippecanoe County had given more to Asbury University than any other
         county I represent a noble people, who are no beggars. They had a proposition and submitted
         it to the State, and it was accepted It has been said here by the gentleman from Putnam (Mr
         Gordon) that he would be willing to vote the whole property to Tippecanoe County. That can
         not be done, for the State is pledged in its compact to the United States to support Purdue
         as an educational institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: I think too much time has already been taken up on this - nearly four days.
         If there is a man in Indiana who can make a success of Purdae, Professor Smart is that man.
         Connected with him is a competent set of men. A vast amount of money has already been spent
         there and the ability of the faculty should be continued Professor Smart said to me that
         the new buildings were needed. As it is, the students are compelled to work in the
         cellars.</p>
        <p>The previous question was moved by Mr. HAYDEN, and being seconded by the House, under its
         operations the substitute for the amendment was adopted by yeas 68, naos 22.</p>
        <p>Mr. CORY, explaining his vote, said: I was in favor of giving Purdue $14750; but as those
         nearest the institutions seem willing to take $12 000, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GARRISON: Of all the State institutions Purdue University is foremost. I vote "aye"
         on this proposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN: The friends of the University are willing to take $12 000, so I vote
         "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: The money seems to be needed, and it would not injure the State's Treasury to
         give this sum. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: The substitute was thrust upon me without my foreknowledge But we will accept
         the sum and Tippecanoe County will meet it. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: I wish to change my vote, and doing so will explain As some seem to be afraid
         that Purdue is likely to get a little money, and are fighting every inch to prevent it, I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: After that remark I shall explain my vote, and I shall vote "no" on the
         proposition. If those buildings are needed the State should pay all of it. I am not an
         enemy to Purdue University. I do not believe in this thing of the State making an
         appropriation to extort money from any locality. It should pay the whole sum or none.</p>
        <p>So the substitute was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend the substitute that the money should, if secured at all, be
         taken in 100 days</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FLOYD the amendment was laid on the table by ayes 18, nays 23.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS, explaining his vote, said: This is a scheme to defeat the appropriation. An
         idea prevails that Tippecanoe County can not raise their part of the money in 100 days.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: This amendment is unfair and I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe: If Purdue should not get a cent I will oppose this. I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: That I may be recorded as not favoring a single dollar or a single cent to
         Purdue I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe, I move the adoption of the amended substitute.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 68, nays 24</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING, explaining his vote, said: Because of the compact between the State and the
         United States to support this institution; because it is a college for farmers and
         mechanics I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: Because there is no compact between the State and the United States regarding
         this; because it is not an agricultural college, I still have the courage to vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: Because the reports of the institution show that the management is violating
         the compact in not sustaining it as an agricultural college; because this money is wanted
         to extend an institution not an agricultural college, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: Because I do not believe it is the province of legislation to go beyond the
         common schools, and because I believe this unjust to a majority of the taxpayers, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: Because our people do not want this money appropriated, and because, though
         Warren County is within ten miles of Tippecanoe County, yet our children go to other
         colleges, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McGOVNEY: Because the people are already overburdened with taxation, and because this
         is not just, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: I see a chance to give Purdue at least a scant allowance. The educators are
         looking, not up to us, but down upon us. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: This is not a question of sentiment but of the taxpayer. It is an outrage
         on the people of Tippecanoe County and of the S ate at large. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr TOWNBEND: Because I believe that the strength of a people depends upon its education,
         and because I believe that the more money we spend for educational insti- <pb n="123"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-471"/> tutions the less we will spend for prisons, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: There are many reasons why I vote as I do. One reason is that the advocates
         of Purdue have defeated the amendment prohibiting the use of this appropriation for the
         payment of salaries to professors. I believe a part of this appropriation will be used for
         that purpose. They first told as that $31,500 was the least amount they would accept for
         building purposes, yet it is developed that they will take anything they can get. They want
         it for salaries, therefore I vote "no"</p>
        <p>So the substitute was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON offered an amendment that the salaries of the President be $2,500 and that of
         the Professors $1,500 per year.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, the motion was laid on the table by yeas 54, nays
         29</p>
        <p>Mr. HAYDEN, explaining his vote, said: Because the trustees should regulate the salary,
         and not the State, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: Though the salary of $2500 is reasonable enough yet the trustees should
         regulate the salary. So I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: Because the trustees should by all means regulate the salary, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>So the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. McMULLEN the bill was ordered engrossed.</p>

        <head rend="center">OLEOMARGARINE.</head>
        <p>Mr. SCHMIDT, from the <orgName>Committee on Manufacturing</orgName>, reported back the
         bill [S 271] prohibiting the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine, recommending that it be
         indefinitely postponed</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES moved to lay the report of the committee on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected - yeas, 43; nays, 43</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, explaining his vote, said: It has been claimed that it is unconstitutional to
         prohibit the manufacture and sale of liquors; I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: For the protection of those who are imposed upon at hotels by this I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. KELLISON: For the reason that not one in a thousand would use oleomargarine, if they
         knew it, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: Because I "think that the bill can be so amended that it can be passed, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I do not believe in destroying one industry to build up another. But as I think
         that oleomargarine not healthful, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr MAUK: Because oleomargarine is as healthy as butter and as healthy as beef, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr MURPHY: Because bad butter is worse than oleomargarine, and because the latter is
         healthful, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McGOVNEY: Oleomargarine is next to and as pure as your beefsteaks. You can not tell
         it when properly made. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: In the northern part of the State is an important manufactory, which makes
         the best quality of oleomargarine. I do not believe in destroying that industry. I vote
         "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: It is made of putrid stuff, mostly, and is unhealthful. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: Because there is a general demand for it, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: Because we have a statute which says that no man shall sell it unless it is
         properly labeled and because I believe in letting a man buy it if he chooses to, I vote
         "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: For the reason that a large number of my constituents have petitioned for the
         passage of this bill, and for the further reason that it is favorable to the farmers,
         dairymen and the sanitary interests of all the people, and for the further reason that
         oleomargarine is often manufactured from rotten tallow, rancid mutton suet and dead cholera
         hogs, impurities which no chemical analysis can determine, I most emphatically vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: I do not much like the bill as it is, but in response to the petition of my
         constituents I vote "aye"</p>

        INDIANA LEGISLATURE.</head>
       <head rend="center">IN SENATE.</head>
       <dateline rend="right"><date>WEDNESDAY, April 1, 1885.</date></dateline>
       <p>On motion by Mr. HILLIGASS, the bill, H. R. 518, was read the first time.</p>
       <p>He explained: The bill prohibits assessments by railroad companies of employes, without
        their written consent, for the purpose of supporting reading-rooms, hospitals, etc. Oat of
        the three States of Indiana, Ohio and Illinois, one railroad company withholds about $30,000
        a year to found a hospital in Missouri. I move to suspend the constitutional role that the
        bill may be read the second time by title, the third time by sections and put upon its
        passage.</p>
       <p>Mr. WILLARD: I move to strike out the emergency clause. I don't think any penal statute
        ought to be passed with an emergency clause.</p>
       <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: It is probable these statutes will not be published till along in August or
        July. I can't see anything wrong in this emergency clause It would save to hundreds of men
        in Indiana hundreds of dollars. Employes jeopardize their employment by resisting this
        wrongful demand.</p>
       <p>Mr. SMITH of Jay: I want to vote for this bill, and <choice>
         <sic>unles</sic>
         <corr>unless</corr>
        </choice> the emergency clause is striken out I will not vote for it. It has been the rule
        from time immemorial that laws shall be published before they go into effect.</p>
       <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: That rule may be a good one where the penal part of the law will effect all
        the inhabitants of the State, but as far as we know it will effect now but one corporation
        in the State, though it applies to all.</p>
       <p>The motion to strike out was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 19; negative,
        15.</p>
       <p>Mr. WINTER: The bill in its present shape I don't think ought to pass at all. It may be
        that railroad corporations have a contract with their employes that they shall make a
        certain contribution for the building of a hospital, and I don't think we can afford to pass
        a law proposing to disturb such a contract. I move to amend so that the bill shall not
        affect such contracts. Then this bill requires a written agreement "in each and every
        instance." I move to strike out these words.</p>
       <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The amendment would destroy the object of the bill. It would enable the
        railroad corporation to continue the levy to maintain this hospital in Missouri. The
        railroads would declare they had an implied contract.</p>
       <p>Mr. WILLARD: The amendment will permit the railroad to go on with the assessment. If this
        bill is for the purpose of protecting the employe it should remain as it is. I trust this
        bill will be amended no farther.</p>
       <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph: It is impracticable to require a written content on every pay
        day. If consent has once been had that is enough. The other part of the amendment ought not
        to be tacked on to the bill. I move to strike from the amendment the proviso, leaving only
        the words "in each and every instance."</p>
       <p>Mr HILLIGASS: It is as easy to embody the agreement in the monthly receipt as it is to
        embody the amount receipted for. The entirement is objectionable.</p>
       <p>Mr. McINTOSH: There seems to be a fear that the employes will get some advantage of a
        great corporation. I am opposed to all amendments.</p>
       <pb n="125" xml:id="VAA8558-22-473"/>
       <p>Mr. THOMPSON: There is a meanness about the withholding of wages in this way that is
        repulsive to us, and I will take pleasure in voting against the amendment.</p>
       <p>The amendments were severally rejected.</p>
       <p>The bill was read the third time and passed by yeas 36, nays 4.</p>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">A NEW JUDICIARY CIRCUIT.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. ERNEST the bill [H. R. 402] defining the tenth (Monroe, Lawrence and
         Orange Counties), twelfth (Knox) and forty-ninth (Daviess and Martin) coming up on the
         third reading - </p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: This bill creates a new circuit. I have voted against every new circuit,
         but I have a petition in favor of this bill which I desire to have read. [The clerk reads.]
         There are about a dozen names signed to it. I know them and believe what they say, I shall
         have to vote for this bill and I hope it will pass.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 32, nays 13.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Dearborn, explaining: I have decided convictions against creating new
         Judicial Districts, and believing the State can be redistricted so that the present number
         of Judges can easily do the work, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I have been unsuccessful in opposing the creation of new
         circuits, and this, coming from my own neighborhood. I will now vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I have voted for all these bills for the reason this Legislature has no means
         of finding out the necessity, except the statement of members interested, and upon their
         statement I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have voted against every one of these new propositions, until I have
         almost come to the conclusion we had better make a circuit of every county. I understand in
         a term of five weeks in one if these districts they have never reached a dril case. So I
         vote "aye."</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. JOHNSTON, of Dearborn, the bill [H. R. 267] to suppress horse stealing
         was read the second time. He explained: It makes horse stealing grand larceny, it creases
         the penalty to imprisonment from five to ten years for the first offense, and from ten to
         twenty years for the second offense:</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I am afraid the effect of the bill would be to repeal all former statutes. I
         am in favor of the principle of the bill, but it contains a new definition of grand
         larceny. I would not care if the third offense were punishable by capital punishment. I
         move that the bill be referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>

         explained, the bill simply provides for the education of pauper children. It is especially
         intended to apply to the county of Hamilton, which has an Orphans' Home, located at

        <p>Mr. Weir's Five-judge Appellate Court bill [S. 373] was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS moved to refer the bill to a select committee of three, with instructions to
         reduce the salary of the Judges from $4,000 to $3 500. He said: One of the objections urged
         to this bill has been its expense, and this amendment proposes the same salary paid to
         Superior and Criminal Judges. It is conceded this Appellate is an inferior Court, and the
         salary proposed is in accord with the grade. These Judges are not required to live in
         Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I hope this motion will not prevail. The Judge must come here to discharge his
         official duties, though required to reside in the district from which he is elected. The
         side show (Commissioners) to the Supreme Court receive $4,000 each.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: There ought to be some difference in the salaries of the Supreme and
         Appellate Court Judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: These Judges will be put to considerable expense, in that they can not remove
         their families to this city. A lawyer in full practice, fit to occupy a position of this
         kind, can not afford to give up his practice for a four-year term at $3.500. Then there is
         a statute prohibiting any Judge from practicing law in this State. The proposition to
         reduce the salary should not prevail, but a a provision should be made that the salary
         shall be paid quarterly. I move to amend by striking out all but the words "payable
         quarterly."</p>
        <p>This amendment to the amendment was rejected by yeas 20, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: If I thought it would increase the popularity of the bill, I
         would vote to reduce the salary, thinking we might get competent men to serve for two years
         at $3,500, but as it is I will vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: I feel that first class legal talent can be secured for
         $3,500. I know competent gentlemen are working hard for less, and on that account I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I don't think the State of Indiana ought to require any competent
         lawyer to leave his practice for less than $4 000.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Davis') was agreed to by yeas 38, nays 7, and the Lieutenant Governor

        <p>Mr. WEIR, the special committee thereon, returned his Appellate Court bill [S 373]
         amended as directed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, moved to recommit the bill with instructions to so amend as
         that the Judges shall be elected by the State at large instead of from districts.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: If the bill is so amended it will certainly lose one vote. It
         is desirable that this Court should be non-partisan. It was the unanimous expression of the
         Committee and also the Supreme Court Judges. A non-partisan court would be more desirable
         to the bar of the State and the people at large If the Judges are elected by the whole
         State of course the Judges would all be of one party. The Judiciary should be kept free

        <head rend="center">MUNSON'S LIGHTNING ROD CLAIM.</head>
        <p>The bill [S. 177] to pay David R Munson for work done by him in putting lightning rods on
         the Asylum for the Insane.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This bill as amended makes a loss to Mr Munson of $1,300 but he is willing
         to accept it and stop further trouble.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: A fashion here is if you have a claim make it very large - or, for that
         matter, no claim at all - and then wait for it to be cut down, generally above what it
         should be. That is about the condition of this claim. In order to incur a debt there must
         be a contract for the work and an acceptance of the work when it is done. I submit that the
         evidence shows that there is no contract, nor never has been concerning the putting up of
         these rods. That Provisional Board, as a board, never contracted for this work. One member
         of the board permitted a rod to be put on the smoke-stack. That is the extent of it. This
         is the only testimony in its favor. Other testimony shows there was no contract, no order
         made by the board. The board even ordered some taken down - there was too much up.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: This subject has been thoroughly and fairly discussed. It passed the Senate as
         $5,100, came here and was cut down to $2 500, recommitted to a committee with instructions
         to cut down.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: Great stress is put upon Dr. Jameson's testimony. The gentleman who has so
         much quoted from Dr. Jameson did not read the part where he says that Mr. Munson should be
         paid - that he has already been bid out of his money long enough. The bill has been cut
         down until there is no question about it.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority by yeas 46, nays 33.</p>
        <p>Mr. BEST, explaining his vote, said: This bill is tainted with the same old taint. These
         men were like the lightning rod men usually are. They were not satisfied to go and get this
         contract of the proper authorities, but like the style of lightning rod men, even went
         ahead and did more work than was necessary. Because of the Court of Claims, just
         established, where this case may go, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: I can come to no other con I elusion, after reading the testimony, than that it
         was a swindle perpetrated on the people of Indiana, and I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: For the reason that I believe the claim just beyond a reasonable doubt; for
         the reason that the Court of Claims may not be constitutional; for the reason that if I
         were a juror sitting in this room I would allow it, therefore I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: If this case were in law it would not be allowed. There is absolutely nothing
         in law to support the claim. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: While the State may not be bound by contract, yet it is given out that there
         was a consent to the erection of these rods. I vote "aye."</p>

        <p>Mr. BOYD: I was not on the committee, but I read the testimony and must vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM: Believing that to support this claim would be offering a premium for the
         introduction of unjust claims against the State by pretended contractors, and believing the
         claim, if founded upon a contract, is exorbitant beyond reason and because I believe the
         demand is unjust and should not be allowed, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr ENGLE: For the reason that this is not the place to settle claims, and that most of us
         are voting in the dark, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: Having confidence in the committee which examined this, and believing that this
         is the shortest way out, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAUK: Because I have confidence in the committee, because I do not believe that any
         man would be fool enough to make the expenditures thus without some order, and because I
         because we owe something, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: This matter was up two years ago, and I have never yet said a
         word about if. My prejudice against lightning rod men is intense, but it is the higher duty
         of manhood to pay any and all just claims of the State. Any higher court would allow this.
         The State has had the benefit and use of it, and my sense of right and justice says I

        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to suspend the order of business and take up the gravel road bill [H.

         which can not be without the passage of th s bill. It is one of the most important bills
         that has come to the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKIS0N: I hope the motion will prevail, as it is calculated to assist counties who
         have already exceeded the limit of bonds in the construction of gravel roads.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: This bill will allow counties to go beyond the constitutional limit to
         construct gravel roads. A bill of that kind should not be passed under a suspension of the
         rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill does not repeal, modify or change any law upon the statute book.
         It does not seek to create a county indebtedness, but it grants privileges to those who
         construct a turnpike to issue bonds - it is their debt and not the debt of the county It is
         a cumulative statute.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 30, nays 11.</p>
        <p>On the further motion of Mr. Sellers the constitutional rule was suspended by yeas 37,
         nays 8 and the bill was read the second time by title and the third time by sections.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Jay, opposed the passage of the bill pointing out objections Under this bill
         any man with a forty acre tract that may be assessed would have hanging over his land, as a
         first lien, a certificate due in six, twelve, eighteen, twenty-four and thirty six months,
         and if payment fails when the first is due the whole becomes due and payable. The limit of
         1 ½ per cent. placed as the limit of county indebtedess in the Constitution does not
         satisfy these gentlemen, <pb n="130" xml:id="VAA8558-22-478"/> but they propose to wipe out
         the little forty acre tracts of land.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This bill is in accordance with statutes that authorize a majority to
         project a public improvement. It provides that if an error is committed no man not
         interested shall take advantage of that error. The interests of all parties are protected.
         Objection has been made to the provision authorizing donations but that is copied from the
         present law The bill is based upon the principle that the people within two miles on each
         side shall have the right to tax themselves to build a good road, making it an indebtedness
         on their lands.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: This bill prohibits the issue of county bonds for these improvements, but,
         instead, certificates are issued similar to a provision in the ditch laws, which save many
         items of expense incident to the issuing of county bonds. In one county the expense of the
         Auditor, Treasurer and another amounted to $3 000 That is the difference between the old
         law and this - the contractor is to collect from those assessed at his own expense.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 33 nays 8.</p>

         contingent fund from $2 000 to $1,000 and the military fund $500 - in accord with the
         recommendation of the Auditor of State</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: The sum as proposed in the bill is less than a Republican Governor was allowed
         two years, and for one Mr. F. was willing to trust these expenditures to a Democratic
         Governor</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>The committee amendment increasing the amount allowed the Secretary of State for the
         distribution of public documents from $250 to $600 was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> recommended an additional amendment for clerk of
         the Auditor of State $1,000.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 25; negative, not counted</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS moved to reduce the salary of the clerk of the insurance department from $1,200
         to $1,000. The bill of 1881 made this salary $1,000, as also does another; and still
         another bill $800.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS also made the same motion for the same reasons as applying to the land
         department clerk.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: No man of family will have one cent over and above his living at such a
         salary, and they both should be left as they came from the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I hope this amendment will prevail. In the first place the Auditor gets
         every dollar of that insurance money, yet he charges the State $600 for postage. It is a
         perfect nuisance from beginning to end</p>
        <p>This amendment was also agreed to upon division - affirmative, 21; negative, 17.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to increase the salary of the Deputy Attorney General from $600
         to $1 000 There is no competent person in the State can <choice>
          <sic>aford</sic>
          <corr>afford</corr>
         </choice> to take the position for that salary.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The statute fixes the salary of the Attorney General's clerk at $600.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: The Attorney General's office is better than the President's office. The
         salary put on here is only a sham. He goes over the country and takes out his 16 per cent.
         for collecting There was one case in Batholomew County where he took $750, and did no work
         for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The reason the committee left this as it is in the bill that came from the
         House is that the statute fixes this salary for the Attorney General's clerk at $600.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN moved ineffectually to strike out the $200 for office expenses of the State
         Librarian.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS moved to add as additional to Item 9 "for messenger of the Supreme Court,
         $360." That is what was allowed in 1881.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 22; negative not counted</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, made an ineffectual motion to reconsider the action of the committee
         allowing a salary of $1 200 to the Adjutant General.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: There are additional appropriations on pages 17, 18 and 19 amounting to $80
         000 as to the necessity of which the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> is not informed.
         We find these items here. The members of the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
          Institutions</orgName> ought to be able to explain them. This bill is different from any
         General Appropriation bill I ever saw I presume the reason is that since 1879 no General
         Appropriation bill has been passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks and Mr. McCLURE: These matters have never been referred to the
          <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName> of the Senate, and the Committee
         is unable to furnish any information on this matter.</p>
        <p>Mr ADKISON: Inasmuch as these two committees have confessed they have no knowledge of
         these expenses I think these items should be referred back to the <orgName>Finance
          Committee</orgName> with instructions to examine into these additional appropriations</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: This bill raises the items <pb n="131" xml:id="VAA8558-22-479"/> for repairs
         some $55,000 more than usual, and there certainly should be some explanation. I move that
         item eleven be passed over till to-morrow and that the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>
         be instructed to examine and report thereon.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It this is referred to the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>, and it
         is required to ascertain the facts in reference to all these institutions, it must either
         visit the several institutions or take the word of the <orgName>Ways and Means
          Committee</orgName> in the House as to the necessity of all these appropriations.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved as a substitute that the specific appropriations on pages 16, 17 18 and
         19 be stricken out, as this bill will have to go to a conference committee anyhow.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: Here is a proposition to appropriate over $60,000 that no light can be thrown
         upon.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: Upon whom does this responsibility rest? Is it not upon the
          <orgName>Committee of Ways and Means</orgName> in the House?</p>
        <p>The substitute motion to strike out was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HILLIGAS8 a proviso was added to item eleven.</p>
        <p>Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, moved to amend item twelve by inserting for the State University at
         Bloomington an additional sum of $30,000 for repairs of building, museum and library
         destroyed by fire. At the regular session there was a bill passed appropriating $3O OOO.
         The fire of 1883 entailed a loss of $135 000. There was about $100 000 to be applied by the
         State to make good the loss by fire.</p>
        <p>Monroe County has generously donated $50,000. There is nothing in the $30,000 to supply
         the loss of the library. Buildings have been constructed, new grounds have been purchased,
         and the property is now securely in the State of Indiana. It ought not to be necessary for
         Trustees to come here and urge the appropriation they recommended in their report. It ought
         to be granted without questioning the motives of these institutions. This $20 000, in
         addition to the $30,000 already appropriated, will place this institution on a proper
         footing.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: At the time the $30,000 was appropriated one of the Trustees claimed that
         was enough; yet now they come here desiring $20 000 at one lump. At the close of the next
         fiscal year there will be shown a State deficiency of $320,000. There is one way to help
         reduce this, and that is to raise the amount to 6 per cent for County Treasurers'
         delinquent collections Will you pile up these appropriations with the knowledge that there
         will be a deficiency at the close of the fiscal year of over half a million dollars? With
         this in view, the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> should cut every appropriation they
         could consistently.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The amendment ought to be adopted. The institution ought to be generously
         supported. This is what the Trustees thought they ought to have. They asked $50 000, and
         they ought to have it.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, moved to increase the appropriation to Purdue from $18,500 to
         $24,000 in the interest of that class of education of which Purdue University is the best
         representative in the State of Indiana. He spoke at length in favor of this amendment. When
         he concluded - </p>
        <p>The Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. SHANKS the bill H. R. 26, concerning fees and salaries, was read the
         second time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: This is a substitute bill, and is well known. I move that the bill be
         ordered engrossed, and on that I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>The House refused to second the demand for the previous question.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. ENGLE the motion to engross was laid on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr SEARS moved that the bill be referred to a special committee of three to report on
         next Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. GOODING: If we are to pass such a bill we should not refer it, as that will be the
         death of it, as a bill reached on Monday will never see passage. Those who want to pass
         this bill, not as a perfect bill, but as the best thing that can be done here, should vote
         against the motion to refer. A great many people of Indiana are expecting a fee and salary
         bill to be passed. Let us treat them fairly. If this bill is better than the present law
         let us pass it. Let us have a square and fair vote on it. I do not pretend to know the
         force and effect of this bill I understand it will reduce fees and salaries of county
         officers. Let us not refer it to a committee to be defeated in a round about way. Meet it
         squarely.</p>
        <p>The previous question was demanded, and, being seconded by the House, under its
         operations the motion to refer to a special committee was agreed to by yeas 54, nays
         36.</p>
        <p>Mr. CARTWRIGHT, explaining: I know that this bill was very carefully prepared. I know
         that it will reduce salaries in Indiana to the amount of $100,000. Therefore I <choice>
          <sic>vate</sic>
          <corr>vote</corr>
         </choice> "no"</p>
        <p>Mr DEEM: I understand that this bill in entirely different from the one that was read, so
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: For the reason that a reference means a defeat, and for the reason that it has
         already been examined by a committee; for the reason that this is a fair bill and will
         reduce salaries, and for the further reason that I am in favor of a reduction of salaries,
         I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON: I have examined the bill carefully, and after eight years' experience <pb
          n="132" xml:id="VAA8558-22-480"/> in the Auditor's office I can not see a reduction in
         anything, but an increase, at least in one instance I must, with due deference to my friend
         Cartwright, who was in the same position, vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr HARRELL: The bill is manifestly unjust and unfair. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: For the reason that a reduction in fees and salaries is demanded; for the
         reason that I believe that to refer the bill will kill it, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOSIER: To refer the bill will be to kill it. This bill needs amending, but if not
         amended is better than the new law, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: Being opposed to this bill on general principles, and believing that to have
         good officers we want to pay good salaries, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMICHAEL: As the present bill will save a great deal of money and work no hardship,
         and as I am opposed to strangling it in this way, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: The bill does not cut down salaries, but fees, which are paid by everybody.
         It is a measure for political effect, and I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr SAYRE: This bill has been for six weeks on the desks of members of this House. We
         might not expect a Democratic Legislature to take action on this. The fact is that this
         bill will reduce the salaries from 25 to 33 per cent. With one or two amendments it should
         pass. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SEARS: Representing one of the smallest counties in the State. I cannot vote for a
         measure to impoverish the officers, by reducing their salaries, which are now low enough. I
         vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr SHANKS: I see no reason why this bill should be referred. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I have no desire to conceal the fact that I am opposed to any other bill
         that makes any reduction in the fees and salaries of county officers. I would much rather
         kill the bill for the following reasons:</p>
        <p>First. In my county the county officers do not receive too much for their services.
         Second. The people of my county do not desire to reduce the fees and salaries of our county
         officers for we have as capable and deserving officers as there are in the State, and they
         are as poorly paid. Third If the people generally understood that in a county the size of
         Jefferson the Treasurer who gives a bond of $250,000 realizes only about $2,300, and in a
         county like Switzerland the Recorder realizes only about $600 per year they would not
         demand that the fees and salaries be reduced. I therefore vote to recommit this bill.</p>
        <p>So the motion to refer was agreed to, and the Speaker appointed as such special committee

        <head rend="center">LICENSING ENGINEERS.</head>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY'S bill [H R. 268] to license engineers, came up from the special committee
         appointed to strike out that part of it which relates to a boiler inspector</p>
        <p>Mr. DEBS: I am heartily in favor of the bill and hope it will become a law. It will not
         only better the service but will throw around all the boilers a safeguard. This bill will
         not cost the State one cent - merely a slight fee from the engines examined.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE: Notwithstanding the amendments there are some objectionable features in the
         bill. The first is that it does not apply to portable engines, and again it makes necessary
         an examination once per year. If a man pass an examination and then have a year's
         experience, there is no reason that he should pass another and have to pay a fee of $5 for
         it.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOWELL: The bill will do more harm than good. I doubt its legality. You can not say
         what kind of a man a farmer shall hire to drive his wagon or run his engine This bill will
         throw into the pockets of this Board a large amount of money.</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I think this is a good bill, and I am heartily in favor of it. It is asked
         for by a very large and intelligent association in this State, namely, the Stationary
         Engineers' Association. For the purpose of protecting men who work in the factories under
         which are large boilers, and to protect children, this bill should be passed. It will also
         protect property For the farther reason, as stated by the gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Debs) -
         than whom I think there is a no more competent man in this Assembly especially as regards
         the wants of the laboring man - that this will elevate labor, I must give it my
         support.</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: This bill should be passed because it is in the interest of manufactories. It
         gives them competent engineers; it elevates labor, and it protects the public - those who
         work in large factories where an accident would have dire results This bill divides the
         State into districts so that there is no hardship for those who may pass examination. A man
         is always under the supervision of this board. The object of <pb n="133"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-481"/> yearly examination is to exclude those men who may have
         contracted bad habits. There are are between 3 000 or 4 000 boilers which would come under
         the provisions of this bill in Indiana.</p>
        <p>The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority - ayes 47; nays 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY (explaining): I vote as I do because I think the fees too high. The sum of $5
         is too much for examination. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr GOODING: I will have to vote on a venture I vote "yes."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I would like to help my friend Murphy in this bill, but I see that twelve
         house powers is not included. Now twelve horse powers are as likely to explode as are
         twenty-horse power. It is something of class <choice>
          <sic>legislaton</sic>
          <corr>legislation</corr>
         </choice>. I shall have to vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: If a man is once competent for engineering he most become so after years of
         experience, and examinations every year are useless. I therefore vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: This bill will affect ten or fifteen engineers in my county - men who have
         held their places for ten or twelve years; perhaps they may not stand a technical
         examination. And for the reason that this bill tends to one particular class I vote
         "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Perry: In the belief that if this bill becomes a law the Examining Board
         may refuse to license every engineer, and there is no right to appeal. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: Before I voted my conviction on this; but as I live in a large
         manufacturing city, and as some of the engineers there are opposed to some of the
         provisions of the bill, I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: It seems that a large number of engineers in the State demand this, and as we
         can try it and repeal it if a failure, I vote "aye"</p>

        <head rend="center">SUPREME COUET JUDGES.</head>
        <p>Mr KELLISON'S joint resolution [H. R. 2] to amend the State Constitution being read the
         third time, Mr Kellison said: Five judges of the Supreme Court are wholly unable to
         transact the business of the State The number must be increased, or we must have an
         Appellate Court. The object of the amendment is to make the number of judges either six or
         nine, and to divide them into benches, so that there will be more working boards. We are
         now paying a commission $20,000 per year to help tine Supreme Judges, and this is regarded
         by the Governor and State officials as unconstitutional Our Appellate Court will be an
         elephant of expense on the hands of the State Since I have introduced this I have heard
         favorably upon it from many of the leading lawyers of the State, and I am told that the
         opinion has come from the Supreme Judges that it would be a good movement. The plan is to
         divide the court into two groups, so that we can have business progressing quite as
         rapidly, and the most common sense way of disposing of appeals is by this plan. We have
         five judges; by this plan the number may be increased but one member - only $4 000 per year
         additional - while you may have two benches of three members each and work going on twice
         as rapidly. On one bench two will constitute a quorum and there will be three benches of
         three each. On important questions all can sit upon it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I am in favor of this resolution because it will avoid the necessity of an
         Appellate Court. Four years ago, as I understand, the Supreme Court was some two years
         behind with the business. The Supreme Court Commission was created in 1881, consisting of
         five members whose labor has been equal to that of three Supreme Judges, and in four years,
         with the assistance of the commissioners, the court is within less than six months of being
         up with the business. It is believed that seven Supreme Judges can do the business of that
         court if the Constitution shall be amended as proposed by this resolution, and then we will
         not have two sets of reports, other Court Houses, libraries, etc, and will not have one
         court for the man or corporation who has $1,000 involved in litigation or the man who
         commits a felony and an inferior court for the man who has a less amount involved or who
         commits a misdemeanor, as would be the case with an Appellate Court. It is conceded that
         five Supreme Judges can not do the business of the Supreme Court, and that some relief must
         be given, and I think this resolution will meet the demands.</p>

        <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole [Mr.
         Magee in the chair] and resumed the consideration of the bill H. R 479, the question being
         on the motion to increase the appropriation to Purdue University from $18,000 to
         $24,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: If I were to consult my own personal feelings I should vote for the
         amendment, but there is now outstanding nearly $1 500,000 of delinquent taxes in this
         State, and unless a law is proposed to aid in the collection of these taxes not another
         cent should be appropriated than is absolutely needed. In February there were eighty seven
         students in this institution from Tippecanoe County alone and only (seventy-seven from
         other counties in the State. Of the eighty-seven from Tippecanoe County seventy are from
         the city of Lafayette.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: There have been some thirty-eight students enrolled within a week, and there
         are now fifty-four counties represented. That institution educates in a short time in the
         mechanic arts what otherwise would generally take a life-time to acquire. I believe it is
         doing a great and good work, and we ought not to give an institution of that kind a
         half-way support.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: Until 1881 there never was a dollar appropriated for this institution. An
         institution that has only 160 students and that pays its officers and employes $28,900, is
         taxing the many for the benefit of the few. It was an understanding when the institution
         was first founded that it should not be an expense to the State - Senator Dice, from
         Fountain County, so stated, as the Brevier Reports show.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The Senator referred to my opposition to this bill two years ago. I then
         stated at a night session that I was in favor of a liberal appropriation, but pupils had
         been excluded on account of their connection with a Greek fraternity, and it was intended
         to starve out offending officers. Indiana is a State of abundant resources with a small
         debt. It is not a credit to the State to treat her institutions with neglect. The State can
         not go too far in doing the right thing toward her educational institutions. It is objected
         that the young men of Tippecanoe County are the only ones educated. If it be so, what of
         it? Others are permitted to go, and if they do not it is not the fault of the
         institution.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: While I can not vote for the motion I do not propose to have it stated that
         the first appropriation for this institu- <pb n="135" xml:id="VAA8558-22-483"/> tion was
         made in 1881. In 1879 I was a member of the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>
         in the House and we made an appropriation for Purdue University. There were appropriations
         made in 1879, and from the time since the State accented the grant.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I believe I have never spoken in favor of giving these institutions so much
         money, but as this is the only institution in the State that proposes to do anything for
         the farmer, though they are doing it in a sly way, and, as these lawyers have given large
         appropriations to all the others, now I want you to vote in favor of increasing this to $24
         000.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: On account of the speech of the Senator from Ripley (Mr. Falkner) I intend
         to vote for this amendment.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, the action of the committee yesterday afternoon,
         striking from the bill certain specific appropriations for the benevolent institutions, was
         reconsidered.</p>
        <p>The committee took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, in behalf of the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
          Institutions</orgName>, explained that the $30,000 for boilers and boiler houses was to
         buy sixteen boilers at $1,000 each. The $20,000 is to repair damage by fire this winter. A
         laundry machine will cost $2,000.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the item for the maintenance of the Blind Asylum was increased
         from $25 000 to $27,000, and the item for repairs decreased from $4,000 to $2,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL explained the boilers now in use at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum are dangerous,
         and the heating apparatus worn out.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> recommend an increase from $12
         500 to $25 000 for completion of buildings and workshops, and purchase of machinery for
         Purdue University; and also striking out the proviso "that no part of this sum shall be
         drawn from the Treasury until the people of Tippecanoe County shall have expended a like
         sum toward the erection of workshops and buildings" Why should the State make such a
         contract wish Tippecanoe County? There is no obligation upon the citizens of that county to
         thus support that State University. That proviso practically kills the appropriation The
         entire art work of that institution is done and the students are forced to pursue their
         studies in damp cellar rooms.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, o St Joseph: The Senate should adopt this suggestion made by the
          <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: I desire to point out some objections to the allowing or this item
         Each county is allowed to send two students to Purdue University free, but the State at
         large is taxed for every expense connected with it, and it is proposed to maintain and
         build up this institution at the expense of the entire State, which does not seem to be
         fair.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: This institution is the only place a farmer or mechanic can go, even if
         there are but two allowed to go free from each county.</p>
        <p>Mr McCULLOUGH: I am opposed to this allowance. Under ordinary circumstances I would not
         be in favor of such an arrangement as is proposed in the bill, but with the present
         surroundings it is nothing but fair that Tippecanoe County should bear an equal part of
         this expense. Monroe County expended $50,000 for the rebuilding of the State University,
         destroyed by fire, because as a money proposition it was worth more to the county. For the
         amount of money expended on this university, it is a failure. I am in favor of the State
         building up educational institutions, and would much prefer to see Indiana have her
         educational institutions all together. How came it this institution was located in
         Tippecanoe County? For days and days the people of Tippecanoe County were here begging for
         the institution. I have the debates here. The State made a great mistake when it gave the
         name of "Purdue" to that university. We are told we are continually in debt to an
         institution with a name that is not intended to carry weight with it. Forty-two thousand
         dollars is already appropriated to be expended next year in that institution, and now this
         bill proposes to add $12 500 more.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: Speaking not only as a Senator from Tippecanoe County, but as
         a citizen, I would be humiliated if the State were to carry out each a proposition as is
         contained in the provisions in this bill It is unbecoming a sovereign to make such a
         proposition for the support of a State institution. It was not a mistake that the State
         named a great educational institution for one of her most generous citizens, who gave a
         large sum of money to help establish it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Willard having the floor - </p>
        <p>The committee rose informally to receive a message from the House embracing a concurrent
         resolution that this General Assembly adjourn sine die on Tuesday, April 13.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOULKE, the resolution was concurred in, and the Secretary was directed
         to notify the House at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD resuming (the Senate in-formally resolving itself again into a Committee of
         the Whole) spoke in favor of the proposed committee amendment.</p>
        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to reduce the item for the Normal School from $10,000 to $5,000.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe, the $10,000 item was allowed to stand.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr WILLARD, the vote of yesterday on the item of $360 for a messenger for
         the Supreme Court was reconsidered. He read a letter from the judges <pb n="136"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-484"/> stating the services of such a messenger as they desire con not
         be obtained for less than $600.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS put the amount at what had heretofore been appropriated, and would heartily
         concur in this amendment.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD $600 was substituted for $360</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HILLIGASS, the vote of yesterday reducing the salary of the insurance
         and land department clerks in the Auditor's office from $1,200 to $1,000 was reconsidered.
         The salary is fixed in the statute at $1,200 The receipts in the insurance department are
         over $137,000 per annum and the salary ought not to be curtailed. The business has
         increased over $20,000 in two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: The State Auditor gets 25 percent, of every dollar of this sum he collects,
         and he can afford to pay these clerks.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: The acts of 1881, page 75, show the salary of these clerks
         under the statute is $1,000 each.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: In the Auditor's report of 1884, on page 75, he recommends the salaries be
         $1,200 but the Legislature of 1881 fixes the salaries of these clerks at $1,000. He opposed
         a change in the statute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilligass moved to make the salary $l,200</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected on a division.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WEIR, the vote of yesterday fixing the salary of the Adjutant General
         was reconsidered and the salary increased from $1 200 to $1 400.</p>
        <p>Mr DAVIS: The statute says the salary of the Adjutant General shall be $1,200</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKIS0N made an ineffectual motion to make the salary $1 500.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> amendment striking out of the State Board of
         Health item the words "including publication of report" was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> has no information respecting the
         appropriations for the State Prisons</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, of the <orgName>Prison Committee</orgName>: As to whether the
         laws are right I don't know, but as to the necessity for the bath and wash houses there is
         no question. There is also a necessity for the construction of a hospital for insane
         prisoners.</p>
        <p>On motion the committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit again at 9:30
         to-morrow morning.</p>
        <p>The report was concurred in by the Senate, and then the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <head rend="center">TELEPHONE RENTS</head>
        <p>The SPEAKER: The unfinished business is the further consideration of the bill [H R 44]
         regulating the rental of telephones. The question is, shall the bill pass?</p>
        <p>Mr. FRENCH: We should not make an unjust discrimination against the telephone. I am not
         here to champion telephone companies. I do not know a man in the State who I know has
         telephone stock. All I say is strictly upon the merits of the bill. Many telephone
         exchanges in small places are wholly long lines, connected with those at a distance. Then
         why should we say to them that they should charge only fifteen cents for a short
         conversation, while the Telegraph Company charges twenty-five certs for only ten words?
         This is unjust. We may safely let this go as it is for two years, for improvement of the
         telephone will go rapidly on until then. Every one knows the benefits of the telephone, and
         we can not afford to lame it in this way. We should vote down this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: There are two branches to this - city telephones and country
         telephones in the small towns. Take Lafayette for a standpoint. About it are a number of
         small towns, Delphi, Mulberry, Fowler and many others, which are connected by telephone.
         This bill will destroy the lines to those places. Men do business for money, and as this
         will render it a loss it will destroy the systems. Men do a large amount of business over
         them - talk five minutes for twenty five cents. The company can not afford to do this for
         fifteen cents. As it is it is much cheaper than telegraphing.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: The telephone in this State, it is true, is new. It is a wonderful
         invention and convenient. But we should open no door that we can not close There is no more
         profitable business than the telephone. Nothing pays so largely as stock in them. Men who
         operate them do not own them, but pay a royalty to the inventors. But the royalty is
         regulated by the amount of income from the lines. It is nonsense to say that this bill will
         cause the lines to cease operations. This is a fair bill, and the price a fair and
         reasonable price.</p>
        <p>Mr GORDON: The only objection waged against the bill is that it will drive the telephones
         from this country. One that is only a hypothesis My opinion is that this legislation will
         double or treble the business on the lines. It has been said that the royalty on these
         instruments is $20 per year Do you not know that such is exorbitant? Money could be made on
         a royalty of $5 per year. I hope the bill will pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. TOWNSEND: I desire to give a little history of this telephone as we had it in
         Richmond. The telephone company there undertook to raise the price from $3 to $6 per month.
         The citizens rebelled and two rival companies appeared and offered to give bond to furnish
         telephone for a smaller rental, and stated that they would have plenty of margin at that.
         Taking their statements I think the bill is reasonable.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: As to the expenses and profits of telephones, at Vincennes the operating
         expense for a year was $824 and the receipts for rentals $4,230, I have this from their
         books. The Indianapolis News had <pb n="137" xml:id="VAA8558-22-485"/> the other day an
         interview with a telephone man of this city, who said they had $40,000 worth of property,
         but I went down stairs and found that the company paid taxes on $l0,000 The subscriber does
         not own the instrument, and those little boxes cost about $1 65 each. The royalty paid is
         also but $15 per year and not $20. All but three of the exchanges of Indiana are owned by
         foreign companies.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by yeas 66 nays 9.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP explaining: I believe this is a more of the telegraph company to strike down the
         telephone company -a monopoly trying to crush out the business. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: I am in favor of the provisions of this bill, but believe there is a
         constitutional objection to it; but in the hope that the Senate will remedy it I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I objected to this solely on the ground of destroying the
         service of the small towns; but sounding a note of warning to you, and that you may see how
         it operates, I vote as you vote and vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I think that the American people should protect a patentee in his rights, and
         on general principles I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the bill passed as noted above.</p>

         seat in the Lieutenant Governor's chair, but I followed him, as a boy, in the history of
         Indiana. He was a patriot who did not falter in doubt as to the spoils. There is no office

         "Family Physician" and the shorter catechism, but it has not been so amended. However, it

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: The bill will create confusion in the township business, will

        <p>Mr. ENGLE: The provisions are good. In some townships dogs are raised, in others sheep.
         The sheep townships have a small dog fund, but the dogs from the one township go over in
         the other and kill the sheep. The object of this bill is to make the fund a county fund so
         as to equalize it in all townships.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLIAMS: One bad provision is that if a farmer has a lot of sheep killed and is the
         first to report to the township Trustees he would receive his pay in full and others would
         not get their pay for sheep killed by dogs.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMULLEN: It provides that this registery shall be had so as to learn of this

        <p>On the motion of Mr. WILLARD the Senate resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole (Mr

         prison appropriation being and - </p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: As the earnings show sufficient moneys this proviso says to the management
         instead of paying to the general fund, make your drawings out of the funds you have in
         hand. There is now no law requiring the turning over of the products of the State Prisons
         to the treasury This committee amendment would require to turning over of the balance after
         paying for these specified improvements.</p>
        <p>The committee amendment - the proviso at the close of item 12 - was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foulke moved to add an item of $400 for the State Horticultural Society. The
         information that body furnishes to the State is very desirable, is of a local character,and
         can not be obtained in any other way.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER questioned whether the closing paragraph in item 13 would affect unexpended
         balances of other funds or appropriations</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD thought not.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to add the words "made in this act" after the word "appropriating"</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Would that cover the 2 per cent State house fund?</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend by excluding from the appropriations to be paid in the fiscal
         year ending in 1887 the special appropriations of $25 000 for Bloomington and $20 000 for
         Purdue University.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. BRYANT moved to amend by adding $15 000 for additional water supply for the Hospital
         for the Insane.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: Estimates were made for this purpose and that $15,000 is the
         estimated cost of getting the supply from Eagle Creek.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCLURE: It will cost $35,000 to get a supply from the city water works, while from
         Eagle Creek a supply could be had for $15 000.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: I am informed there is a sufficient water supply there now, and this was
         voted down by the House.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to on a division. Mr YOUCHE moved to amend so that this
         appropriation shall be excepted from the appropriations from the year ending 1887. This
         amendment was agreed to. On motion by Mr. WILLARD the committee rose, reported progress,
         and was discharged from the further consideration of the bill.</p>

         second times by title, the third time by sections, and put in on its passage. The bill
         simply proposes to incorporate in the law governing incorporated towns the section of the
         law governing cities which restrains the running at large of cattle, sheep, horses, swine,
         etc. - Section 3,333 of the Revised Statutes of 1881. It is intended to protect towns from
         the raids or cattle. At present if a man allows his cow to run at large in a town any
         person may make an affidavit against him and have him fined from $3 to $10 and the costs
         will amount to $15 or $20, while under the city law the animal is taken up and may be
         recovered by paying from fifty cents to a dollar pound fees.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, of Dearborn, the bill [H. R. 401] concerning the duties of
         cities and their Common Councils was taken up He said: It provides that assessments for
         street improvements may be paid in four annual installments instead of all at once The city
         can execute its bonds to pay for improvements and place the charges for as segments against
         the property on the duplicate as other taxes, and charge the owner of the property 6 per
         centum interest on the money advance, and allots the owner of the property to pay in
         installments, or he may elect to pay it all at once, as the law now is</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I think the bill ought to be printed.</p>
        <p>Mr YOUCHE: I hone that motion will not be made, because of the danger in delay. The
         author informs me there is but one change in the law, and that is to enable a person
         against whom an assessment is made to have four years in which to pay an assessment for
         street improvements by paying 6 per cent. interest. The purpose of the bill is to give men
         who have acquired little homes by making small or monthly payments a chance to pay the
         assessments in easy instatments, so they may not have to mortgage their properties in order
         to pay at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: It seems to me it amounts to this: When work is done streets the city has
         to pay the contractor, and then the city takes the chances of the assessments, which is
         sometimes connected with lawsuits, and then who is to pay the expense of the lawsuit? It
         seems this bill is of too much importance to pass through in a hurry.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOULKE the bill was ordered printed and made the special order for
         Monday at 3 o'clock p. m.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. McINTOSH, the bill [H. R. 124] was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER explained: It amends the section of the civil code which enumerates cases
         where service of publication may be made, and adds cases where the object is to obtain a
         review of judgment; to procure a new trial; to set aside a judgment; to enforce

        <p>The SPEAKER: The special order for this hour is the bill [S. 145] regarding the times of
         holding open the polls at elections - that they may be opened as early as 6 o'clock in the
         morning.</p>
        <p>The bill was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SAYRE: If I understand this bill, I think it should not become a law, as it gives us
         opportunity to defraud the ballot. It opens a way for the worst sorts of corruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This bill is to give laborers a chance to vote - those men who labor for
         less than $1 per day for instance. If they take the time to vote they lose their wages.
         This bill opens the polls before working hours. I think the idea that it gives an
         opportunity for fraud, because the polls open earlier in the morning, is an error The
         officers are there to guard the sancity of the polls.</p>
        <p>Mr ENGLE: The election laws now on our statute books are uniform. The passage of this
         bill will make them otherwise. The bill provides that when twenty or more cities petition
         to have the polls open early, it must be done. This will create confusion. The hour of 6
         o'clock in the morning in November is an early one for the polls to open. That hour will be
         the hour for evil work. I must not be understood as saying that I believe the workingmen
         will do this fraud. They are the honest yeomanry; but designing politicians will be on hand
         for it. I do not charge that this bill will affect one party more than another.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: I know it to be true in my own city that a great number of laboring men,
         notably railway men, are compelled to go out of the city before the polls open. They can
         not afford to lose their day's work and possibly their jobs. The present law practically
         disfranchises them. The poll-, under this law, can not be oped surreptitiously. If there is
         danger of fraud it will be no trouble to get men of all parties out early. As it is the men
         work at the polls are up early. The circulation of the petition shows whether or not the
         voters want the polls opened at 6 o'clock</p>
        <p>Mr. SPEAKER JEWETT: In the little city where the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Hanlon) and I
         live a large number of men ask this Personally, I have no interest as I am scarcely ever
         out of bed by 6 o'clock. In our town hundreds and thousands who earn their bread in the
         manufacturies, are compelled to go to their work early in the morning. Many of them go to
         Louisville to labor in the manufactories there. These men by the present law are
         practically disfranchised They are good citizens of Indiana and are about divided equally,
         politically. No harm can come of it to any party. Three car loads of laborers leave New
         Albany every morning at 6:44 for their work at Louisville. There are 1,800 men in the
         DePauw glass works whose hour for beginning is early in the morning. It should be the
         policy of us all to induce every man to take an interest in the affairs of the nation and
         vote. It is enough for us to ask these laborers, who scarcely ever hold office, to vote,
         much less to lose a day's work. In behalf and on behalf of thousands of laboring men of New
         Albany I ask that this bill pass.</p>
        <p>Mr LOYD: I find, by looking at the calendar, that the sun rises in November at 6:34
         o'clock in the morning, and it is not, therefore, too dark to open the polls. It will check
         scheming politicians and remove temptations of undue influence over voters. As it is, men
         who can not afford to lose their day's work are paid for it on election day by politicians
         who use this as an influence.</p>
        <p>The bill passed - by yeas 51, nays 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM, explaining his vote, said: For the reason that my constituents do not demand
         nor require this measure, and for the reason that I believe it would lead to fraud and
         corruption, because it proposes to open the polls at an hour when honest men do not wish
         to, and in most cases will not attend the polls, I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. FARRELL: Because it is in behalf of the laboring men, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON: Because all men, if they have an interest in the affairs of the country, can
         get up at 6 o'clock in the morning as well as the laborers can get up at 5 o'clock in the
         morning, I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. LINNVILLE: Because I believe the aim of the bill is for fraud and corruption, I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Perry: I believe that it is in the interest of all laboring men, and vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: I do not know that this bill will have much effect in our city. There are,
         however, no less than eight gangs of section hand who are compelled to leave early in the
         morning. These men are always under a boss, who may permit them an hour off to vote if they
         vote his way. I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: When this bill was read and the hour given as 6 o'clock in the morning, a
         cold chill crept over me But when I heard the Speaker and the gentleman from Putnam (Mr
         Gordon) early birds, advocate it, I thought I could stand it if they can, so I vote
         "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: The bill is in the interest of fraud and corruption. It will open every
         ballot-box in the country by 6 o'clock a m., and will give the Kentuckians an opportunity
         to cross the line and do our voting for as and them go home. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr HARRELL: This bill puts too much power in the hands of twenty men. I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. BOYD: For the same reason I vote "no."</p>

        <p>Mr. COPELAND: This bill provides for the payment of all regular and independent companies

         thereafter no warrant should be drawn to pay any claims of said companies, except upon the
         certificate of the Adjutant General, indexed by the Governor; that the amount thereof is
         shown to be due by the rolls deposited in said Adjutant General's office, so that no
         company whose pay-rolls were not placed on file before the act of 1867 took effect can be
         paid under the present law although there remains for their payment about $16 000 out of
         the $30 500 appropriated in 1867; which amount under the amendatory act of 1883 will be
         covered back into the treasury after the 18th day of January, 1886, provided this bill
         should not become a law. In 1862 a company of the Ninth Regiment, Second Legion, known as
         the North Madison Rangers, commanded by Captain Samuel Steinberger, acting under orders of
         the Governor of the State, performed service for over five months, for which they have
         never received a single cent, while nearly all the other companies of the entire Legion
         have received their pay After the war and before any steps were taken to pay the members of
         the Legion, the Captain of the company went to the State of Alabama without filing the pay
         rolls of his company with the Paymaster in the Adjutant General's office and in his absence
         the act of 1867 was passed, which provided that no claims shall be paid unless the pay
         rolls had been filed before the passage of that act, and upon his return it was too late to
         file them. Captain Steinbarger, than whom there is no more honorable gentleman in the State
         of Indiana, has ever since been embarrassed from the fact that members of the company feel
         that if he had done his duty they would have received their pay long ago. Had he been in
         the State at the time the other companies filed the pay rolls he certainly would have done
         his whole duty I have in my possession a letter from at Adjutant General Carnahan to
         Captain Steinbarger saying that these claims ought to be paid, but until there is specific
         law for that purpose nothing can be done. I have recently talked with General Kountz, the
         present Adjutant General, and he says that these claims ought to be paid provided the
         claimants can establish their claims.</p>
        <p>Mr MOODY: I hope the bill will pass, as it is extensive and covers the whole case.</p>
        <p>The bill was passed by yeas 68, nays 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY, explaining his vote, said: I hope the bill will pass It should have become a
         law in 1867. The claims, which will be about $10 for each man, are already made out for
         those whom the money is due</p>

        <p>The bill [S 349] to prevent telegraph and telephone companies from discriminations in
         business and prices, was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. MURPHY: This bill should become a law because its provisions are such that it will
         make competition practicable between the Western Union Company and competing lines of
         telegraph. This Western Union Company now enjoys such a stupendous monopoly that the B. and
         O and other companies which are struggling for a living are only permitted to exist for the
         mere matter of appearance, to delude the public into the belief that competition actually
         exists, where in fact there is none. As matters are now if you send a telegram over any
         line which requires transference to the Western Union it must be prepaid in order to induce
         the Western Union to take it, and an additional ten cents is charged by the Western Union
         for extra words written on the margin of this telegram, which are of no practical value to
         the other company or the sender. On account of the extraordinary advantages possessed by
         this gigantic monopoly, the Western Union Telegraph Co., they occupy a similar attitude
         toward the public and other companies as a despot does toward his subjects. The company
         combines with railroads and practically excludes all competition by its facilities for
         getting right of way over principal railways and securing offices in their depots, while
         other companies of such magnitude as could hope to compete can not be organized This law
         will compel simple justice to be done to competitors and the public. This company is an
         illustration of the power and greed of organized capital, and convinces us of the <pb
          n="143" xml:id="VAA8558-22-491"/> necessity for the enactment of laws that will restrict
         those soulless corporations in their exasperating demands.</p>
        <p>This Western Union Company has combined with the Bell Telephone Company, another monopoly
         that has succeeded in gaining extraordinary privileges on account of the power of wealth.
         This law will invite competition, thereby promoting the interests of the public by
         weakening the power of this great monopoly, and will give employment to those who are
         forced into idleness that great profits shall accrue to these monopolies This bill will
         benefit the public as well as employes and competing companies, and should therefore
         pass.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. ENSLEY his bill [S 329] to prevent the adulteration of food, drink or
         medicines, was read the second time, with committee amendments and on his further motion
         the report of the committee was concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: We have passed a law this session prohibiting the manufacture of oleo
         margarine, one of the articles mentioned in this bill.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. ENSLEY the constitutional rule was suspended that the bill may be passed
         to the final vote now.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to add to Section 4 that nothing in the bill shall prohibit the
         manufacture of oleomargarine provided it is stamped as such and contains no substance
         deleterious to health.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: I knew of no establishment manufacturing oleomargarine in the State when the
         bill was passed with only five negative votes, which this amendment will defeat.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The bill which passed the Senate, should it become a law, would drive out of
         the State several large manufactories of oleomargarine. I trust the amendment will not
         prevail, because the industries of the State should be protected.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: As has been said, a bill has passed the Senate prohibiting the manufacture of
         oleomargarine. The amendment does not protect the class desiring protection. The question
         has been left where it should be left. The people injured are not the purchasers - not one
         family in 10,000 purchase oleomargarine knowingly. It is the hotel keepers who purchase it.
         When the bill prohibiting the sale of oleomargarine was passed, it was understood to be in
         behalf of the traveling public It is said to be impossible to detect oleomargarine without
         chemical analysis. This amendment will reverse the previous action of the Senate on this
         question.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: At the time the bill was passed prohibiting the manufacture of
         oleomargarine, I did not know its effects, but seeing everybody voting for it, I voted
         "aye" with the rest. Now I desire to see this amendment passed, that we may be put right on
         this subject. The Supreme Court has held as unconstitutional an act to prohibit the
         manufacture of alcoholic stimulants. We have no more right to pass a bill saying that
         oleomargarine shall not be manufactured than we have to pass a law prohibiting the
         manufacturing of intoxicating liquors. The Constitution secures to every citizen in the
         State the right to engage in any business that is not deleterious to public health. Section
         4 permits the sale of oleomargarine if the parties are informed of its contents. If it is
         legitimate to sell it I see no reason why we should say to our citizens, "you must go over
         the line to manufacture," and say to everybody "you may sell it in the State."</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: This subject by itself has been presented in the Senate, has passed the
         Senate, and is now in the House. A similar bill passed in New York in 1881 and has been
         held to be constitutional. This substance is deleterious to health and has been so
         determined in Rhode Island, where one of the largest manufactories is located.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR favored the amendment.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. Faulkner opposed the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: The manufacture and sale of oleomargarine break down the price of genuine
         butter. There is a prohibition in our laws against killing and offering for sale any animal
         that is injured, yet the beef would not be injurious or deleterious to health. It is a
         fraud upon the public, is the why the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine should be
         prohibited.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I didn't know that oleomargarine was manufactured in my county then I voted
         for the bill prohibiting its manufacture, and I did not take the time to investigate the
         subject. Then I had an idea that it was a deleterious substance, but I find it is made in
         connection with large slaughtering establishments, and an establishment not manufacturing
         oleomargarine as an incident to the slaughter house can not compete with one which does.
         They can pay from $2 to $3 a steer more than though they did not make oleomargarine. After
         the animal is killed the beef tallow is put through four different waters to take the blood
         out Then it is put in a machine called a hasher, which cuts it finer than a sassauge meat
         Then it is put into sacks the size of a shot bag, placed in layers between perforated iron
         plates until a large stack is made, when it is pressed by hydraulic pressure gradually and
         the oil from the tallow oozes out. Then fresh milk is bought and about seventy parts of
         this olione is mixed with ten to fifteen parts of fresh milk and the same proportion of
         lard, and that is the way oleomargarine is made. It is colored with the same material that
         dairymen use to color their butter. It is as little harmful or deleterious as about
         articles of food. If you take away the privilege of making oleomargarine it would interfere
         with the slaughter of beef on a large scale in this State. As healthy an article of food
         this we have no right to prohibit the manufacture of.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENSLEY: This amendment should not prevail, but the bill as it stands should pass.
         Nothing is of more importance to people than good health Many common articles, especially
         in the confectionary line, are so adulterated that they are injurious to health.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: It seems to me when this Senate has decided to give protection to the
         farming community by prohibiting the sale of a fraud it should stand by that action. We
         have said the quality of the butter from Indiana shall not be run down in the Eastern
         markets by the manufacture and sale in this State of oleormargerine At this late day the
         session we should not nullify that action by adopting the amendment, which practically
         destroys the operation of the bill heretofore passed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: It is an absolute infringement on personal liberty to interfere with the
         manufacture of anything that is not noxious or injurious for which there is a demand on the
         market. The amendment does not interfere with the law requiring oleo-margerine to be marked
         as such, and punishing its sale unless it is so marked.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL; The bill is fair enough. If oleomargarine, as has been claimed, is better
         or as good as butter, then the bill is proper, anyhow. There has been a bill passed the
         Senate that prohibits the manufacture of oleomargarine I believe the Constitution will
         uphold such a bill. I believe we have a right to say a bogus article shall not be imposed
         on the people as pure food. I don't believe it will interfere with any manufacturing
         establishments, but if they are manufacturing <choice>
          <sic>unwholeome</sic>
          <corr>unwholesome</corr>
         </choice> food we had better stop them.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: The bill will have the opposite effect of what it intended. Under the law
         of 1883 oleomargarine can not be sold unless so branded or marked. If the present bill is
         passed without the amendment, oleomargarine can not be manufactured or sold under the bill
         heretofore passed the Senate if it passed the House. But this amendment will expressly
         legalize the sale. If this bill becomes a law it is express legislation permitting the sale
         of oleomargarine. The result will be to drive men out of the State who are doing a large
         business in the slaughter of beeves. It seems to me nobody wants such legislation as
         that.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 19, nays 22</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY (explaining): It seems to me this is a strife between the farming interest of
         the State and a large corporation in Lake County. I am informed that the statement that the
         price of cattle is increased is not the fact; if it makes any increase it could not but be
         very small.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I am in favor of this amendment, because I doubt the constitutional authority
         of the Legislature to prohibit the manufacture of any article of food or drink not
         deleterious to health when used temperately. I am opposed to any act of legislation which
         destroys vested rights and which confiscates property without compensation. Regarding this
         amendment as upholding the personal right of the citizen of the State to eat, drink, wear
         or manufacture what he chooses and as not interfering with the public interests, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I think the amendment is entirely foreign to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I think it is one of the greatest swindles perpetrated on the people, as
         well as on the cows [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr. <choice>
          <sic>FGULKE</sic>
          <corr>FOULKE</corr>
         </choice>: I believe the cow is fully able to stand on her own merits without legislation.
         I am in favor of having the price of butter as low as possible in the interest of the
         poorer class.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I am in favor of the amendment, otherwise we would drive out of the State many
         respectable and energetic business men engaged in an honest industry. The bill prohibiting
         the sale of oleomargarine passed without due deliberation, and is an- <pb n="146"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-494"/> other evidence that there is not enough time allowed in this
         State to properly mature legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOCH: My constituents will sever ask for a law to legislate other men out of
         existence in order that they may not have competition. I am opposed to class legislation of
         any kind</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: I understood when the bill was passed prohibiting the sale of substances
         for butter that there was no manufactory of that kind in the State, but I understood we
         sought to prohibit this substance from being sent into the State As I believe that bill is
         in the interest of the farmers and dairymen of Indiana, I still stand by it, and vote "no"
         on this amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHLOSS: Two years ago the Democratic party opposed the prohibition of the
         manufacture of certain articles, because it was said it would destroy the property of
         brewers and distillers. This bill would destroy the property of another industry, therefore
         I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>So the amendment was rejected and failed by yeas 19, nays 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOCH: We expressly authorize the sale by this bill and prohibit the manufacture
         of oleomargarine by the other bill which has passed the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I can't believe this Legislature will enact a law that will say to citizens
         of our own State, "you shan't manufacture oleomargarine," as in the bill already passed the
         Senate, and then in this bill say that citizens from other States can come in and flood the
         State with it.</p>
        <p>So the bill was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to reconsider the vote of the bill just taken that the bill may be
         referred to a select committee of three with instructions to so amend as not to seriously
         affect any business interest in the State.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion - yeas, 7; nays, 3 - to lay the motion on the
         table.</p>
        <p>The motion (Mr. Foulke's) was agreed to and the Lieutenant Governor made the committee to

            "an act authorizing persons having claims against the State of Indiana to bring suit in
            the Supreme Court of the State, and authorizing persons to bring suit in the Circuit
            Courts to quiet title to real property in certain cases, prescribing the duties of the
            Attorney General and Prosecuting Attorneys in such cases, and declaring an emergency,"
            which was presented to me for approval, is respectfully returned to the House in which
            it originated with my objections.</p>
           <p>It is not a pleasant duty for me to interpose my objections to the legislative wisdom
            of the General Assembly, and I would not do so were I able to convince my judgment from
            any view that I might take of the bill that it should become law. If the Legislature
            upon a reconsideration of this bill shall deem it a proper and necessary measure, the
            way is open for its enactment into a law without my approval. I fully recognize the
            importance of establishing some tribunal for the adjustment of claims against the State,
            and a law making provision for the same, with proper safe-guards, would meet my
            approval.</p>
           <p>Section 1 of this act provides that any person having or claiming to have a money
            demand against the State may bring suit therefor in the Supreme Court by filing a
            complaint and calling summons to be served upon the Attorney General.</p>
           <p>Section 3 of the act provides that upon the final decree or judgment of the Court
            finding any sum to be due to any person or persons from the State, the Auditor of State
            is directed to draw his warrant upon the Treasurer of State for the amount of the
            judgment, including interest, in favor of the claimant, his heirs or assigns, which
            warrant shall be paid by the Treasurer out of such funds in the Treasury as the Court
            may direct.</p>
           <p>This is a most extraordinary provision as far as I am advised, without precedent in
            any State in the Union. The United States Court of Claims at Washington passes only upon
            the justness of the claim, and possesses no authority to order payment of the judgment
            which it renders, its action is only advisor. With Congress is still left the authority
            as to the correctness of the claim, or to make appropriation to pay it. But this bill
            makes the decree of the Court final, and directs the payment of the judgment rendered by
            the Court.</p>
           <p>It is provided in Article 10, Section 3, of the Constitution that "no money shall be
            drawn from the Treasury but in pursuance of appropriations made by law," but this bill
            makes it the duty of the Auditor of State to draw his warrant on the Treasurer for the
            payment of the judgment out of any funds in the Treasury designated by the Court, and
            thereby raises a grave question as to the constitutionality of the bill. It virtually
            repeals all the laws now on the statute books, authorizing the State-house Commissioners
            and other provisional boards to determine their contracts, adjust allowances and
            expenses, by giving every person or persons who may have a claim against the State
            arising out of contract with such Boards of Construction, or Trustees of the various
            institutions of State, the right to ignore said boards, with whom the contract may have
            been made, and sue in the Supreme Court for the claim.</p>
           <p>This bill is objectionable in another feature, that no legislative appropriations
            could be made with any degree of certainty to meet the wants of the State institutions
            because the same would be subject to the order of the Courts well as the proper boards
            of any such institution. One judgment of the Court, might exhaust the appropriation and
            leave the institution in no better condition than if no appropriation had been made.</p>
           <p>The bill ma es no provision for obtaining testimony and procuring the attendance of
            witnesses, it loads the Supreme Court with additional business not justly judicial, and
            to some extent changes it from a judicial court of supreme judicature into a court of
            original jurisdiction for the investigation of claims without regard to the amount in
            controversy It does not authorize the employment of additional counsel by the State, <pb
             n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-22-495"/> but leaves the State with no legal advice in its
            defense, except that which the Attorney General may be able to give in connection with
            his other official duties. The State will always be at a disadvantage in every suit, and
            I think I can safely say that if this bill becomes a law a very large number of suits
            will be instituted against the State at once.</p>
           <p>The State Treasury is the great heart of the commonwealth, from which comes the blood
            that gives life to all the institutions and machinery of the State, and it should be
            well protected and the approaches to it guarded with care The State, at least, should
            have all the opportunities for its protection that an individual possesses in his
            defense.</p>
           <p>Section 3 of this bill provides that in all cases where the owner of real estate,
            purchased from the State, and the same has been paid for and no patent or deed has been
            issued and recieved therefor, such owner may bring his action in the proper Circuit
            Court, where such real estate is situate, to quiet the title thereto, and may make the
            State a party thereto the game as an individual. Under this section many suits may be
            pending at the same time in as many different counties, and it is, therefore,
            questionable whether the ordinary service of ten days would not be too short to allow a
            full investigation and examination of the record, referring to the sale of land by the
            State, now preserved in the office of the Auditor of State. In most cases, if not in
            all, the business between the Auditor and the proper Prosecuting Attorney will of
            necessity be transacted by correspondence. It would seem proper, in case of a suit of
            the above character, that the bill should provide suitable means for the State to
            procure any necessary testimony and allow the benefit of an appeal without giving a
            bond.</p>

        <p>The Senate took up the special order, being the General Appropriation bill [H. R. 479],
         which was read the second time with the amendments adopted in the Committee of the
         Whole.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN moved that the committee amendment to increase the Adjutant General's salary
         from $12,000 to $14,000 be rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, resisted the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The Adjutant General has not been paid $1,400 as I understand. The law of
         1879 fixes the salary at $1 200. I am opposed to raising the salary. There is nothing in
         Indiana that requires either an Adjutant General or a Quartermaster General. And this
         salary certainly ought not to be raised. I hope the motion will prevail. In accordance with
         the strict terms of law an officer can not draw more than is provided by statute, no matter
         how much is appropriated.</p>
        <p>Mr WEIR: I hope the amendment of the committee will be concurred in. I learn by inquiry
         of the Auditor of State that the Adjutant General has been paid $1 400, and I see no reason
         why the present Adjutant General should not have as much as his predecessor. There is to be
         a new enrollment made out and many other things to do under the Military bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: The other day I made a motion to increase this salary to $1 500. In frequent
         conversations with the former Adjutant General he favored the $1 500 salary to the present
         incumbent. I am opposed to the motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: I trust the motion will not prevail. No man can live in this city and
         entertain as an officer should for $1 200.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ: The Republican party made salaries extravagant, and I am not going to follow
         them up. I am opposed to the amendment and in favor of the motion to reject it.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. YOUCHE the committee amendment was concurred in - yeas, 30; nays, 11 -
         fixing the salary at $1,400.</p>
        <p>And then the Senate adjourned</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRELL the House went into the Committee of the Whole, for the
         consideration of the Specific Appropriation bill, and upon his further motion, Mr. Adams
         was called to the Chair</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. JEWETT an amendment was adopted allowing Thomas F. Davidson $290 for
         services as a special judge.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DEEMS, an amendment was adopted allowing Simon P. Thompson $750 for
         legal services for the State in Newton County.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. STALEY an amendment was adopted appropriating $3,000 for a hospital at
         the Reformatory for women and girls.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES moved to amend the bill allowing Marion County $3 000 for rental of rooms for
         the use of the Legislature by reducing the sum to $1,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. JAMESON; The sum of $3 000 is a low price, it is not put in here with the expectation
         of being cut down, but because the rental is worth that sum.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: Marion County should be paid the full $3,000; but as a compromise I offer a
         substitute making the amount $2,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: The County of Marion <pb n="148" xml:id="VAA8558-22-496"/> should be paid in
         full every cent the State owes it.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARNES: An investigation will show that fuel and rental and all is worth fully the
         sum asked. I have taken some pains to investigate, and find that the item of fuel alone
         amounts to a considerable sum.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: Marion County pays one-eighth of the taxes of the State. If it
         rents to the State it should have the full amount of its rental value.</p>
        <p>All amendments to the item allowing Marion County $3 000 were severally rejected, and
         that sum was allowed to remain in the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON offered an amendment to allow Koskiusco County $7,000 for expenses incurred in
         the trial and execution of Charles W. Butler, a murderer. He explained: This trial cost the
         county much more; but as the Legislature refused to allow the correct sum. I think this
         much at least should be allowed. This man murdered his wife in Ohio, and in his flight was
         caught in our county, tried and hung.</p>
        <p>Pending further action on this item, the committee took a recess until 2 o'clock in the
         afternoon.</p>

        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. WILSON: I wish to make a further statement regarding my amendment. This is not a

          <sic>Couty</sic>
          <corr>County</corr>

        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE made an ineffectual motion to a amend the amendment by making the sum
         $4,000.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. KELLISON the item was so amended as to allow one cent.</p>

         </choice> upon a division - affirmative, 20; negative, 20, the Chairman voting in the
         negative.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE moved to strike out the item allowing John L. Case $110 for legal services for
         the State.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON moved an amendment that John Craig, Deputy Warden of the Southern Prison, be
         allowed $1 000 for extra services.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: The gentleman who is now in that office made a thorough canvass for the office.
         He knew what the salary was, and was willing to occupy it. The idea of asking for extra
         services is ridiculous. What extra services? Where could extra services come in? He merely
         wants an increase of salary, as his letter to this Assembly shows The Deputy Warden has all
         the perquisites from the prisoners and buying extras for the prisoners. While I do not want
         to be penurious in the matter of this bill, yet this should be sat down on.</p>
        <p>Mr. JEWETT moved to amend by increasing the salary of the Deputy Warden of the Southern
         Prison to $200 per year from 1877, or $1,400 to date.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON hoped the amendment would not prevail. The salary was large enough now.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVES: The question of salary of these deputies may be solved by the statement of
         the fact that there is a great demand for the position and if a Deputy Warden is
         dissatisfied he may resign</p>
        <p>Mr. JEWETT: I know that the salary of the Deputy Warden was $800 thirty years ago, when a
         dollar was worth more then than now. It was a habit of the Legislature for a long time to
         make the salary $800 per year, and then give the deputy $200 per year extra in the specific
         appropriation bill. This was done because the Legislature had not the courage to increase
         the small salary. Since 1877 this $200 extra has not been allowed. The incumbent took that
         office with the understanding that he was to get this $200 extra. He is a capable officer
         and thoroughly honest. So it will be proper to increase the salary as in past years. He has
         the active management of the prison. He was wanted to be a candidate for postmaster at
         Jeffersonville, but there was objection about the prison. He has been connected with that
         institution for years and is still wanted there.</p>
        <p>Mr. KRUEGER offered a substitute to strike out the words "Captain John Craig," and insert
         $200 per year for each of the Wardens of the Northern and Southern prisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. TWINEHAM: This is bold move. We now have too much of salary grabs in this country to
         adopt such an amendment. This measure is not only to give a salary to the future but in the
         past. This logic is not good.</p>
        <p>Mr ROBINSON: The salary is high enough. The Deputy Warden has managed to subsist on this
         pittance, was anxious for the position, and can continue to serve at the same figures.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I oppose this because I believe the people are oppose to it. Money is scarce,
         the wheat crop gives evidence of being a failure, and we can not now think of increasing
         salaries.</p>
        <p>The motion was rejected - <choice>
          <sic>affimative</sic>
          <corr>affirmative</corr>
         </choice>, 17; negative, 32</p>
        <p>The amendment to the amendment and the amendment ware also severally rejected.</p>
        <p>A claim of Bert P. Davidson, of Lafayette, for $35, services as shorthand reporter for
         the State, was struck out on motion of Mr. Williams.</p>
        <p>The item to appropriate $5,300 to buy three acres of land for the Southern Prison, being
         read - </p>
        <p>Mr. HAYWORTH said: This is the only piece of ground that the prison or the State wants;
         it is worth a good deal and a good price must be paid for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE moved to strike out the item.</p>
        <p>Mr. BARR: This is the only piece of ground over which the addition to the prison <pb
          n="149" xml:id="VAA8558-22-497"/> can be extended. The ground is needed and I hope the
         item will stand.</p>
        <p>Mr. McHENRY: I move to amend the amendment by appropriating $3,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. HANLON: I know the ground and its owner. The land is not worth over $500 per
         acre.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE: The State ought to own that land, but $500 per acre is enough for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBROOME: I was one of your committee to visit the prison. That land is a sort of a
         dumping place for the city. At the price - a little more than $1,000 per acre - it is an
         expensive luxury. I do not believe, as a matter of fact, that we need it. They could use it
         and so could I use all the prairies of Warren County. As to repairs to the chapel it needs
         some casing and plastering, which would not cost over $200. I know what I am talking about,
         as I was a hod carrier myself one time. Let us not burden the State because we can. The
         gentleman from Rush (Mr. Frazee) said we should buy it now if we would have it. It will be
         there many years, and there will be many more tin cans on it than now before any man will
         buy it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FRAZEE offered a substitute that the sum be $3,883</p>
        <p>The substitute was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLE moved to strike out the item appropriating $32,000 to build a stone wall around
         the Southern Prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD: I would like to have time to write an amendment to give the Southern Prison all
         of the country and part of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr BARR: This protection is badly needed and should be built at once.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON: This wall it seems is needed and at once.</p>
        <p>Pending a vote on the motion to strike out the committee arose, reported progress and
         asked leave to sit again to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.</p>
        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE called up the bill [S 229] defeated yesterday, the question being on a special
         committee's amendment to permit the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine when properly
         marked or branded, and not deleterious to health.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved a substitute for the report by striking out all that relates to
         oleomargarine or any other substance to be used for butter. The attempt is here made to
         repeal a bill already passed the Senate to prevent the manufacture and sale of
         oleomargarine, as well as other acts on the statute book on that subject, so the committe
         amendment is not germain. In older to avoid this difficulty, I move to strike from the bill
         all having reference to oleomargarine.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I hope the substitute will not prevail. What I said yesterday I will not
         repeat. The establishment I referred to in my county emoloys about 500 men, and the
         prohibiting of the manufacture of oleomargarine will take away the livelihood of some 2,000
         people in that town, and stop the making of as wholesome an article of food as comes upon
         the table. I can not believe we will enact legislation against any citizen pursuing an
         avocation that will not interfere with the health of any one.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: The substitute would destroy the effect of a bill that was passed the Senate
         without due consideration, which would drive out of existence a manufactory in Lake County,
         one of the largest of the State, with a capital of $100 000, upon which a tax is paid
         amounting to about $33 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the substitute was rejected by
         yeas 18 nays 22.</p>
        <p>Mr BAILEY: The committee amendment was voted down yesterday. It seeks to destroy the
         effects of a bill which has already passed the Senate. The manufacture of oleomargarine is
         only an incident to the business. It is not fair to argue that this establishment will be
         driven from the State, because an expenditure of $8,O00 or $10,000 would remove that
         incident to the business across the State line, a little ways from the main building. Then
         the great dairy producing business of this State should not be injured by the manufacture
         of such deleterious substances to take the place of butter, and thus reduce the price of
         that article, thereby oppressing the farming interests of the State.</p>
        <p>The report of the committee was concurred in by yeas 22, nays 19</p>

        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill H R. 479.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to strike out the item allowing $600 for a clerk to the Adjutant
         General. There is no law authorizing any such officer, and you can not create a statute in
         an Appropriation bill.</p>
        <pb n="151" xml:id="VAA8558-22-499"/>
        <p>Mr. WEIR hoped the amendment would not be passed.</p>
        <p>Mr MARSHALL: It does sot seem proper that the Senate should commence cutting down
         salaries on a one-armed soldier.</p>
        <p>Mr FOWLER: I don't want to commence with a one-arm soldier or any other soldier. If the
         records in that office are in a bad shape, what has the Adjutant General been doing the
         past four years? He has been traveling over the State getting up sham battles. If these
         records need copying there can be plenty of men obtained who will do the work for less than
         $1 400 a year.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 15, nays 26.</p>

         Legislature of 1879 put it down to $600.</p>
        <p>Mr MAGEE: I would cut off every single fee and give a respectable salary. Let this
         officer have $1,000; it is as little as he can live on respectably in the city of
         Indianapolis</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It is the duty of the Attorney General to attend to every State case,
         and he has to trust a great deal of this business to a deputy. Can he employ any competent
         person, who has to live in Indianapolis, for $600 a year?</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to add an item to pay the Sheriff of the Supreme Court for the year
         commencing November, 1885, $500.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to</p>
        <p>A suggestion being made to place this item in the Specific Appropriation bill - </p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE stated it had been many years since a Specific bill had been passed and it
         might not pass this year</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON queried whether a special session of thirty five days was not a sufficient
         reason why the Specific bill should be passed.</p>
        <p>The amendment adopted in Committee of the Whole adding an item of $600 for a messenger to
         the Supreme Court Judges was agreed to by yeas 33, nays 10.</p>
        <p>Mr Youche's amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole adding an item for water
         supply for fire protection at the Insane Hospital, $15 000, was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The proviso to item 12, adopted in Committee of the Whole on motion by Mr. Hilligass was
         agreed to.</p>
        <p>The amendment of the Committee of the Whole, adding $20,000 for repair on buildings,
         museum, library, chemical and botanical departments of the State University at Bloomington,
         destroyed by fire, being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It is well known that County Treasurers do not make collection of
         delinquent taxes, and unless there be some law to compel the collection of over $1 000,000
         of delinquencies in this State, there kind of appropriations should be kept down to the
         forest figure. The State University will not be hurt to wait a couple of years for these
         repairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: The Senator has been acting as though there were millions in the treasury,
         and I am glad he is waking up. The State has had to borrow $1,000,000, but I am not now in
         favor or saying we shall stop, after we have been voting away money for all kinds of
         purposes. I am in favor of this appropriation. I am not in favor of <pb n="152"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-500"/> cutting off appropriations for the educational institutions of
         the State. Many appropriations we have made might have been lopped off. There will be $8
         000 appropriated for building a bath room for felons - men confined in the Northern Prison.
         I would rather lop that off and apply it to the educational institutions I hope this
         amendment it will be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I have voted for the largest appropriation called for on every measure On page
         17 of the Auditor"s report will be found the statement that taxables have been increased
         since 1880, showing we are increasing each year in the amount of our taxable values. I hope
         the amendment will be adopted. After practicing parsimony for some years, we are at last
         compelled to pass a deficiency bill. I would not trust the State for $10 if I had to depend
         on the passage of a bill to pay it. She is the worst and the hardest paymaster that is. I
         want to see everything necessary for the growth and prosperity of the institutions of the
         State given to them without niggardly parsimoniousness.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: Since 1879 the valuation of property has decreased over $70,000,000, and it
         comes from the policy of friends of a protective tariff. It behooves this Senate to
         consider well that under the present system of collecting revenue, at the end of the fiscal
         year in November, 1886, there will be a deficiency of $330 000 You must either cut down
         appropriations, devise some better way of collecting delinquent taxes, or face an empty
         Treasury. At the regular session you gave this institution $30 000. I asked for an itemized
         statement, but could not get it. When I am called on for an appropriation I want to know
         what it is for. Now they come here and ask another appropriation of $20,000. The best way
         to meet a deficiency is to avoid the necessity of it. I trust the amendment will not
         prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr FOULKE: A prophecy has been made with regard to the finances of the State that has not
         been equalled since the prophecies of Jeremiah. [Laughter] There is no place the State can
         less afford to economize than in the upholding and upbuilding of her State educational
         institutions.</p>
        <p>The additional item was agreed to by yeas 35, nays 9.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADKISON: Believing that the next Legislature will be Republican, and not desiring a
         deficiency bill at that time, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ: I believe in voting in favor of educational institutions, and so I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>The amendment of the Committee of the Whole increasing the item to Purdue from $18 500 to
         $24 000 being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to amend by reducing the sum to $20,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe: Nearly by a unanimous vote the Committee of the Whole Senate
         decided that the demands of the Trustees of Purdue University should be acceded to. Purdue
         is very unfortunate; in place of finding friends and benefactors, it finds those who are
         otherwise. I can not imagine where that spirit of hostility takes its origin. Those who
         want to curtail that institution, were they to come to Purdue, would be kindly received.
         While in Europe the treasuries are being exhausted in preparation for battle and slaughter,
         let us use our money for the purpose of preparing our sons and daughters for usefulness in
         life, and indorse the principle that education in this State stands highest. I hope the
         amendment to reduce the appropriation will not prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay: It costs a boy in my county a great deal more to travel to Tippecanoe
         University than to attend school in an adjoining county. This bill will take money from the
         pocket of every taxpayer for the purpose of keeping up an institution in whose books is
         shown the attendance of but few pupils from the several counties in the State</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Smith"s) was rejected by yeas 10, nays 34.</p>
        <p>The committee amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> amendment proposing $25 000 instead of $12 500
         for completion of buildings and workshops and for the purchase of machinery for Purdue, and
         striking out the proviso that the people of Tippecanoe shall first expend $12,500, was
         agreed to.</p>
        <p>The amendment proposed by the Finance Committee to strike out the words "including
         publication of report" of the State Board of Health being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN moved that these words be retained in the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: California appropriates $50,000 and New York $75,000 for State Boards of
         Health. This department of State should be treated like every other department of State,
         and the $5 000 in this item is little enough without requiring the board to do its own
         printing</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: The law establishing this board makes the requirement that out of this $5
         000 it should pay for the publication of us report</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY: The publication of there report costs some $1,700, and that reduces the
         appropriation that much.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN: I believe the bill should stand as it came from the House. The
          <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> investigated this matter and decided that
         the board should pay for printing its own report.</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM: If you compel the State Board of Health to do its own printing you had better
         abolish it. A few weeks ago a law was passed increasing the number of the members of the
         board. The Secretary gets $1,200, and has a lady clerk. The $5 000 is not enough, and the
         board ought not to be required to publish its reports out of that sum. We all know we are
         threatened with the cholera this year, and the more the board has to look after the health
         of the <pb n="153" xml:id="VAA8558-22-501"/> State of course the more the expense will be.
         For that reason we ought to adopt the committee's amendment.</p>
        <p>The motion (Mr. Brown's) was rejected by yeas 14, nays 25</p>
        <p>The amendment recommended by the Committee of the Whole was agreed to.</p>

        <p>The bill [S. 314] to prohibit the importation or emigration of foreigners and others,
         under contract or agreement to perform labor within Indiana, was taken up, the
         constitutional rules suspended by a yea and nay vote, and the bill pressed through the
         three readings and the question being "shall the bill pass?"</p>
        <p>Mr. SWICH, of Tippecanoe, said: No man can exceed me in efforts to protect the laboring
         man of this country, or in endeavor to elevate or protect them.</p>
        <p>The previous question was demanded, and the House seconded the demand. Under its
         operations the bill passed by yeas 77, nays 6</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
        <p>Mr. BARNEY, in explanation of his vote, said: For the reason that the previous question
         cut off a chance for debate, I will state I am decidedly in favor of the bill. I am not
         willing to favor any measure that may cause my son to be sent to put down a sentiment that
         this bill is intended to prevent.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON, in explanation of his vote, said: I wish to call attention to the second
         petition of this bill. [Reads] The object of the bill is a good one, but I do not think the
         object will be accomplished by it. But giving the bill the benefit of the doubt I will vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL when his name was called, said: I am decidedly opposed to this hasty manner
         of legislation This bill has not been read before in the House I do not understand its
         provisions and believe it my duty to vote against it. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HAWORTH: From the fact this is probably one of the most important bills that has come
         before the House, and as it has not been printed, I shall have to vote against it I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HOBAN: I am opposed to corporations taking the advantage of labor in the way proposed
         in this bill, but being in favor of honest labor. I will vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOOP: I have confidence that the bill is right and I shall vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK: I am as much opposed to contract labor as any man in the House. There are some
         provisions that it is doubtful if they can be conferred. I want to be on the side of the
         laborer, so I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN: I am in favor of the first section, but there are some defects in the bill
         which at most destroys its usefulness. I suppose it will be a cold day when corporations
         will be convicted of a misdemeanor under this bill were it to become a law. I will not
         support any bill that will permit the pig tail Chinese to come here and compete with native
         labor in this country. I will support the first part of the bill but not the latter
         part.</p>

        <p>The item was agreed to. Mr. HANLON offered as an additional item to the bill a claim by

        <p>Mr CORY said that the claim came up in the Specific Appropriation bill six years ago, and

         building an iron railing around the Tippecanoe battleground was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE proposed an extra allowance of $400 for the last two years to Ed Price,
         Clerk of the Land Office, who had received only $1,000 a year, while he was entitled to
         $1,200 which was the amount allowed in the general appropriation bill that failed to
         pass.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. PENDLETON offered an item, which was adopted, allowing Baker, Smith &amp; Co., for

         $452 and to Griffith &amp; Williams, for plastering, $264.</p>
        <p>Mr. RIVERS moved the adoption of an additional item, giving Mr R Slater $1,254 on account
         of the destruction of the printing material of the Democrat-Herald, a newspaper at
         Franklin, by Union soldiers during the late war.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE said he had hoped that no member would have the gall to propose the
         allowance of this claim The newspaper was destroyed because it was abusing Union soldiers,
         and was advocating disloyalty. It was a Democratic newspaper, and for that reason the claim
         might be allowed by the majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. PATTEN opposed the allowance.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE said that property honestly acquired should be protected by the Government,
         and if destroyed by drunken soldiers he thought that the public ought to pay for the
         damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. HOLMES thought the claim was entitled to no consideration. The printing press which
         was thrown from the window of the Franklin Democrat Herald he himself had owned and sold.
         It is now, he said, in use in Bloomington</p>
        <p>The claim was rejected.</p>
        <p>A motion by Mr. STALEY to incorporate in the bill the claim of Matthew M. Campbell for
         $1,300, as a teacher in the State University at Bloomington from 1839 to 1854, was

        <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved to add an item allowing W. B Burford the sum of $2,801.78, as interest

         bill we have made a $20,000 appropriation in addition to the $85,000 for maintenance and
         repairs, leaving a surplus of earnings of $13,000. The earnings have just been held over
         from year to year - that is the way it has been heretofore They exceed the appropriations
         and say their earnings cover it.</p>
        <p>Mr BROWN moved to add "no such expenditure shall be made in any one year unless the
         earnings are sufficient to meet the same."</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The committee amendment as amended was agreed to.</p>
        <p>The amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole adding $400 for the State
         Horticultural Society, was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend Section 3 by adding an additional exception, stating that all
         appropriations herein made for additional buildings, libraries and all specific
         appropriations, are made but for one year - the fiscal year ending October 30, 1886</p>
        <p>Subsequently, on motion by Mr. YOUCHE, the $15 000 item for water supply for the Insane
         Hospital was also excepted, as was also the extra appropriations to Bloomington and Purdue
         University.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St Joseph, moved to reconsider the vote declaring that no expenditure
         shall be made in any one year, unless the earnings are sufficient to meet the same. It in
         desired these repairs shall go on now in 1885, and be paid from the earnings of 1884, some
         $13 000 of which is on hand. This amendment provides the earnings used shall be those of
         1885, which can not be obtained till the close of the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved ineffectually - yeas, 8; nays, 32 - to lay this motion on the table.</p>
        <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN withdrew the amendment the vote on the adoption of which was just
         reconsidered.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD to avoid ambiguity and definiteness, moved to insert instead of the words
         "are hereby" the words "in Section 2 of this act." If these words "are hereby" are left in
         the bill there will be a double appropriation.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: That makes confusion. I move as a substitute to strike out the word
         "hereby."</p>
        <p>The substitute was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE: I think I can show the effect of this amendment will be to double these
         appropriations. [Reads and comments]</p>

        <p>Mr. BENZ, in explanation of his vote, said: There are several things in that bill too

        <p>Mr. FAULKNER, when his name was called, said: There are a number of things in the bill I

        <p>Mr. McINTOSH, when his name was called, said: I think there is at least $100,000 more in
         that bill than there ought to be - $100,000 more than is necessary, and I vote "no"</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: As Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> I have endeavored
         to keep the appropriations as low as necessary. As I have stated it will create a
         deficiency of $320 000 if it passes. I don't feel like going on record in favor of such a
         bill, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I desire to change my vote and give the reasons I recognize
         the fact that appropriations have to be made and that the majority are responsible for
         them; but when the Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> votes against a
         bill he has proposed, I desire to change I vote and vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: For the same reason given by the Senator from Hendricks I desire to change my

        <p>Mr. DRAKE: I desire my name shall be called again "No."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: Call my name. The Appropriation bills did not meet my judgment at all,
         but I notice the Republican minority vote for the largest appropriation as they came up,
         and if they want to make expenses of that kind I will assist, and vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL: Inasmuch as the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCullough) has charged that the
         Republicans on this floor have tried to make this bill as large as they could, and as I,
         for one Republican, have tried to keep these appropriations down as low as I could, and I
         see they are yet altogether too large. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON asked that, his name be called, and said: Inasmuch as Senators around me are

        <p>Mr. RICHARDSON desiring his name to be again called, voted "no"</p>
        <p>Mr HILLIGASS: I want to say this in reference to my vote: We have been at work several
         days on this bill; we have worked upon it in a committee of the whole Senate, and we have
         agreed upon this bill. I see a disposition on the part of one or two individuals to charge
         the responsibility of passing this bill upon the Democratic party. The changing started on
         the Republican side of the House. I have no responsibility to shirk, and I don't desire to
         shirk. This bill is the work of members of the Senate, and the work of the Committee of

        <p>Mr. HUSTON: In the consideration of House bill 71 I have acted fairly. I hold that this
         effort to change the order is not being urged by those friendly to House bill 71. I agree
         with the Senator as to the importance of the House bill 543 but the Senate having
         repeatedly made the bill 71 a special order it should not now be set aside. It is a bill
         clearly in the interest of the farmers and not unfair to railroad interests I move to lay
         on the table the motion to suspend the order of business.</p>
        <p>This action was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON moved that the Senate Committee amendments to the bill [H. R. 71] requiring
         railroads within six months to fence their tracks be ordered engrossed. It it similar to
         the laws in Illinois, Missouri, Iowa and Kansas, except it is much milder toward
         railroads.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: This bill will be imposing a burden on railroad companies which they can not
         meet. If this bill is to pass it should be amended to give further time. I move to strike
         out the word "six" and insert in lieu thereof "eighteen."</p>
        <p>Mr SMITH, of Jennings: I am not opposed to the bill in its right form. I am in favor of
         railroad corporations fencing their lines. I am constrained to believe this bill is in
         favor of large corporations and against small ones. On principles of equality and justice
         the doctrine of partition fences should apply to this bill. I don't mean that owners of
         property should fence one-half but that there should be some equality in the matter of
         fencing railroad tracks. The owner of the real estate should contribute to the building of
         the fence. A railroad company is now liable for the killing of stock without reference to
         negligence. The first section of this bill repeals that law. Another provision is clearly
         unconstitutional. No man has the right to enter upon the premises of another and commit any
         act without the privilege of the owner. The railroad corporations give more employment to
         the laborers than all other corporations combined. There is yet another feature in the bill
         - the reverse of every law on the subject in the State of Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I agree that six months is rather a short time, but eighteen
         months is too long; after the railroad company has had a reasonable time, the owner of the
         land adjoining should have the right to build the fence. The partition fence law was not
         made with referrence to the fencing of railroads This bill gives ample time to build fences
         and cattle guards considering the fact that it will not take effect till after publication
         of the laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: This bill simply requires railroad companies to build fences where land is
         improved in six months but has no emergency clause which practically gives them nine
         months. It practically removes all liability for the killing of stock where the track is
         fenced. Then it gives the owner of land the right to fence where the railroad refuses, and
         allows the railroad sixty days to pay; then if the railroad tenders payment for the value
         of the fence within sixty days the claimant can not collect attorney fees. The farmers of
         Indiana have heretofore been building these fences, and it is but fair that railroads
         should hold up that end of the string now. Of the 3 500 miles of railroad track in this
         State all but about 900 miles are fenced. This bill, so fair, so just and so equitable, I
         trust will be passed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of St. Joseph: I move to amend the amendment by striking out the word
         "eighteen" and inserting in lieu the word "twelve." I believe six months is too short and
         eighteen months too long a time to require these fences to be built. The argument that
         there are some railroads upon which this bill will be a burden is the strongest argument to
         me why the bill should be passed, because if they are not able to build proves they are
         probably unable to pay for stock they kill.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: While the amendment would relieve the bill of a dangerous feature, there is
         still an objection to this bill. If it is in favor of any one it is in favor of the
         railroad companies. There is only one way it can be construed as constitutional and that
         is; it will be a, police regulation. The effect will be wherever roads are unsafe and where
         they are already fenced there will be no way of securing pay for stock killed. I introduced
         January 21 a bill that gave the farming community a chance for their protec- <pb n="158"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-506"/> tion. I sent it to the Agricultural Committee and it has never
         been reported back That bill required action to be brought on relation of the State and the
         suit pressed by the Prosecuting Attorney, so the farmers would obtain the amount of their
         loss without any expense. This bill repeals every chance the farther has to recover where
         railroads are fenced in accordance with this act. The amendments do not go far enough.</p>
        <p>The amendment to the amendment was agreed to upon a division.</p>
        <p>The amendment as amended was also agreed to by yeas 24, nays 22</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to amend by adding a Section 4. Nothing in this act shall change the
         liability of railroad corporations for stock killed or injured on that railroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: This bill would by implication repeal an existing law, as to all
         railroads at least that run through unenclosed lands. The amendment should be adopted. I am
         in favor of giving the farmer every right and every protection</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: I am heartily in accord with the amendment. I demand the previous
         question.</p>
        <p>The Senate refused to second the demand for the previous question upon a division -
         affirmative, 21; negative, 26</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I can see no necessity for the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr McCULLOUGH: It would not do to pass this bill and repeal the law in force. I think
         this amendment prevents vicious legislation in the bill.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas 34, nays 10.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to strike from the bill the allowance of attorney fees. While I am
         opposed to the bill if it is passed this provision should be eliminated from it</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I move that this bill and all amendments be referred to a special committee
         with instructions to report at 10 o'clock to morrow. It is now after 6 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr HUSTON: I hope that motion will not prevail. The committee will doubtless report a
         cumbersome bill that will provoke as much discussion as this one will.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I think this motion ought to prevail. The only intelligent way is to refer
         this bill and amendments to a special committee.</p>

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: It is the clause, where he fails to get a bondsman than this
         liquor dealer, principal and all the bondsmen are acquit, that is objectionable.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS: Oh, no.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH: This liquor selling is a privilege granted for which money is paid. I want to
         be careful not to release any obligations the principal or bondsmen have assumed.</p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR: This bill ought to become a law. It provides for a release of sureties just
         as a person may be relieved from the bond of a criminal; and I think that is right. I see
         nothing wrong about it I think it a good bill and ought to become a law.</p>

         without recommendation.</p>
        <p>Mr. BOOE moved to amend by striking out the section which provides that the judges shall
         be elected by the votes of the respective districts which they represent.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe: I come from a county like Marion that believes in non-partisan
         judiciary. I believe in such courts, but if this bill be amended so as to strike out the
         non-partisan features with which it comes from the Senate, I shall vote against the bill.
         It is my opinion that the judiciary can only be enthroned in the hearts of the people by
         its non-partisan character. All the people are interested in the courts, therefore the
         courts should represent the political opinions of the whole people. No other court can
         stand the test of favor. High qualifications, non-partisan characters and the
         representation of the people |is the present and will be the future test of a

        <p>Mr. BROWNLEE: I am in favor of the bill as it came from the Senate. It is non-partisan in
         its provisions, and will receive my support; but if the amendment is adopted, and the court
         is to be placed upon the level of politics, I am against it. The judgment of the people -
         those that do the voting and pay the taxes - demand that their courts shall be taken out of
         and removed from politics. I believe the better judgment of all men is that the Judiciary
         of the State <pb n="159" xml:id="VAA8558-22-507"/> and Nation be removed from all political
         influence. The one thing that must be kept free from the slime and mud of politics is the

         amendment that if they succeed in incorporating it in this bill, by so doing they sound the
         death knell of the measure. The minority in this House will gladly give their support to
         this bill as it comes from the Senate, and share in the responsibility of its passage but
         relieve it of its non-partisan features and the bill dies. I believe that so long as the
         judiciary of this country remain pure and incorruptible, the institutions we love are safe;
         and, believing that the best way to make and keep the bench pure and free from suspicion,
         is to make it non partisan; and, believing that in this position I will be sustained by the

        <p>Mr. BARNEY: I would be ashamed to go home to my constituent and tell them that we had to

        <p>Mr. DEEM: I am glad to say that I live in a section of the State where wife whipping is
         unknown. If this bill should become a law it would be a step back toward barbarism. I vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRELL: I regard it as unwise to put this law on the statute books, for it is
         unconstitutional. Article 1, Section 16, of the Constitution provides that no cruel nor
         inhuman punishment shall be inflicted. I vote "no."</p>

        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R 71] pending at the adjournment
         yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE withdrew his motion to recommit.</p>
        <p>The question being on the amendment [Mr. Willard's] to strike out all that relates to
         attorney's fees, it was rejected by yeas 14, nays 22</p>
        <p>Mr BAILEY, explaining his vote: The law in reference to mechanic's lien and in other
         cases provides for attorneys' fees, and I see no reason why such a provision should not be
         included in these cases, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I don't think we can make such a provision apply to involuntary contracts. I
         therefore vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: If this attorney fee is stricken out it will cost the farmer as much to
         hire a lawyer as the fence is worth, so I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I understand the friends of this bill put it on the ground of
         police regulation, and not on a contract basis. That uneducated professionals who may
         advise a suit for the sake of a fee may not profit by such legislation I vote "no."</p>
        <p>So the amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to amend by inserting the word "receiver" after the word "assignee"
         wherever it occurs.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE questioned whether receivers already appointed can be affected by such a
         provision.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER considered they could under police regulations.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE offered an amendment that the fences may be constructed in part of wire. All
         the new fences in my part of the State are built of barbed wire.</p>
        <p>It was adopted by consent.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET moved to strike out the words "with gates and bars." This bill ought to be
         fair and equitable to the railroad company as well as to the land owners. Is it reasonable
         when the railroad company have no use for the gates, when they are broken down the company
         is to be held responsible? Then the bill does not state how frequent these gates shall be
         built. The roads may be required to build them at every field.</p>
        <p>MR. WINTER: I favor the amendment for the reason I don't believe the feature it proposes
         to strike is constitutional. The only right we have to pass a bill of this kind is to
         protect the public by police regulation from the liability of having trains thrown from the
         track by animals getting on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved as a substitute an additional section, requiring gates and bars at farm
         crossings to be built and kept in repair and kept closed by the farmer in the absence of a
         written contract.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERSTREET: Adopt my amendment and then the amendment of the Senator from Lake (Mr.
         Youche) and all cases will be covered.</p>
        <p>Mr CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: It occurs to me the position taken by the Senator from Johnson
         (Mr. Overstreet) is right. We have no right to require railroads to make gates at
         crossings; that is not for the protection of the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. MACY: I don't know why the interests of railroads should be regarded as so <pb
          n="161" xml:id="VAA8558-22-509"/> much more sacred in Indiana than in any of the adjoining
         Stages. In Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts and a number of other States - in fact, every
         where railroad fencing in required - they are compelled to keep up fences and barriers the
         same as in this bill.</p>
        <p>The substitute (Mr. Youche's) was rejected.</p>
        <p>The amendment (Mr. Overstreet's) was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. YOUCHE now re-offered his substitute as an additional section.</p>
        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS moved to amend by striking out "cattle guards and barriers" where they occur
         in Section 2. There ought to be no provisions that will allow any person to go upon and
         occupy the track of a railroad. The loss of one life is of more importance than all the
         advantages to be gained from this bill. No one ought to be allowed to tear up a track
         except an experienced railroad man.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUSTON: Would not the railroad company put in such barriers and cattle guards within
         the time prescribed for notice?</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH of Jennings: This amendment would persons to go upon a railroad track and make
         it insecure - it is a most unreasonable thing</p>
        <p>Mr WEIR: It seems to me this amendment is eminently proper and ought to be adopted</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: If this amendment is adopted we might as well indefinitely postpone the
         bill. It is the knife that will slaughter it.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I think the amendment ought to be adopted.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 21, nays 23</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY, explaining his vote: It seems to me the adoption of this amendment would in
         fact nullify the bill. Senators exaggerate the idea of inexperienced men working upon the
         track. I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I regard the amendment as wholly immaterial. If you strike out this
         clause you still require the tracks to be fenced. If a fence is run on two sides and no
         cattle-guard is placed where a road crosses, the track is not fenced.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER moved to insert in Section 2 a thirty days' notice to the railroad agent.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, moved to amend that such corporation shall not be required to
         build fences between the first day of December and the first day of May.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr RAHM moved to amend so that fences may be dispensed with by consent. In several
         townships in my county stock are fenced in, and there is no need of the tracks being
         fenced.</p>
        <p>The previous question was demanded, and being seconded by the Senate, under its operation
         - </p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>On motion the amendments were ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr HUSTON the bill was read the third time and passed by yeas 33, nays 9</p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM, explaining his vote: I favored the passage of this bill, but when it compels
         railroads to build fences of no use to anybody I can not vote for the bill. The fences cost
         a great deal of money; the farmers will have to pay the bill at last, and as corn and
         produce are too cheap already I vote "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: Every dollar required from railroads to pay for fencing will be
         gotten back by reducing the pay of laborers or increasing the charges for carrying freight,
         and with that view I vote "no."</p>

        <head rend="cemter">SALES FOR DELINQUENT TAX.</head>
        <p>Mr. WEIR from a committee returned the bill [H. R. 48] with an amendment provided that no
         land shall be sold unless the tax shall be delinquent for one year.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD: There are one million and a quarter delinquent taxes uncollected and due to
         the State, and now why the collection should be extended six months longer is something I
         can't understand.</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: The laws for the collection of delinquent taxes for many
         years have done more harm than good. The law making them payable in installments has
         probably worked a disadvantage.</p>
        <p>The bill was rejected by yeas 15, nays 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN explaining his vote, said: The effect of this bill will be to delay the
         collection of delinquent taxes for six months longer.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER: If there has been a bill before this Senate in which the principles of
         suffering humanity will apply it is this one and I vote "aye" with all my might.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: I have never read nor had time to examine this bill. It may, and probably
         would, make some difference in the collection of taxes; but it is unreasonable to sell a
         man's property for one installment of delinquencies. I vote "aye"</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: If a man fails to pay taxes, after delinquency he still has four months, and
         that is long enough.</p>

        <p>Mr HILLIGASS: This bill provides the city shall have a lien upon the property improved
         instead of the contractor having the lien. The contractor gets the money and the city takes
         the chances of collecting the money. I don't think any improvement can be made upon the
         present law for street improvements I hope the amendment will not be concurred in nor the
         bill passed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SELLERS: I thick the report ought to be concurred in. The property owner instead of
         owing a contractor, who he must pay at once, by this bill would be given four years in
         which to pay the assessment. It if a bill in favor of the poor man who has purchased a
         home, for which he is indebted. The bill provides the City Council may make these
         improvements in this way, and the petition must be signed by a majority of property owners.
         The city is fully protected. Under the present law the property holder in straightened
         circumstances is at a disadvantage</p>
        <p>Mr HILLIGASS: The bill provides the money shall be taken out of the taxes of the poor man
         to improve the streets and alleys of the tows. Then this bill repeals all former acts, and
         cripples the power of Common Councils to improve streets and alleys, especially those
         cities already bonded to the full amount of the constitutional limit.</p>

         on the bill Messrs. McMullen and Brownlee.</p>
        <p>The House took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. ADAMS: There are some things in the amendment which I do not approve, but believing
         that to vote against them would endanger the ultimate passage of the measure, I vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND: I believe some of these items are grossly extravagant, and I therefore vote
         "no."</p>
        <p>Mr. DONHOST: As most of the increased appropriations are for the benefit of the
         educational institutions which I desire to do all I can to support, first, last and all the
         time, I vote "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. DEEM. While I regard several of the items in the bill as extravagant and perhaps
         exhorbitant, yet I have reason to believe that a non concurrence in the Senate amendments
         would probably endanger needed appropriations for the State and her institutions. I have no
         desire to appear as an obstructor, and in the conservative spirit of compromise I am
         constrained to vote "aye."</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER: In appointing the <orgName>Conference Committee</orgName> on this bill I
         would be glad if the House could name the members, but there seems to be a disposition not

        <p>Mr. MOODY: I am in favor of this bill. Its author is an honorable and educated gentlemen
         of that most honorable profession, and I am desirous on his account that the House shall
         give this bill a candid and impartial consideration. This bill is not all its friends would
         like to have by way of medical legislation, but it is a step in the right direction, and I
         trust may in some degree aid in protecting, the resident physicians and the people of our
         State against charlatans and traveling quacks fleeing from other Status into ours, because
         of similar laws there enacted. I am satisfied this bill is so liberal in all of its
         provisions that it will not deprive any man from practicing medicine if he is a man fit to
         engage in so learned and honorable calling. I have never been over anxious to legislate in
         the interest of any particular class of men, but in my humble judgment we should have a law
         that will, if possible, protect our people against that class of men who are tramping over
         the country claiming to be able to cure any, and all diseases to which the human system is
         subject I believe this bill will accomplish much good if enacted into a law.</p>

        <p>Mr. ENGLE: This bill simply repeals that provision of the existing laws which allows
         County Clerks $2 a day for attending court. That was tacked on to the bill by the
         Legislature two years ago by false pretenses, and there is no reason for the Clerk getting

         Clerks who do not deserve it.</p>
        <p>Mr. MOCK, of Wells: I favor the bill, because I believe the Clerks of the State make more

        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to strike this item from the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: From the standpoint that if a citizen has rendered services to the State
         the State should pay the claimant, such items should not be stricken out without
         information. The House has passed these items, it is fair to suppose after the
         investigation, and they should not be stricken out unless found to be incorrect.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: My plan to if I don't know the claim is right to vote against it.</p>

         they pay some forty five to fifty cents a day for convict labor and they the State $2 and
         $3 a day for such labor. I move the committee rise, report progress and recommend that the
         bill be referred to a special committee, of three with instructions to report at 2

        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks, moved as a substitute that this item be passed till the close

        <p>Mr. RAHM: The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> should consider and report on this
         bill, as no Senator seems to be able to give information sufficiently reliable upon which
         to act understandingly.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: Section 416 of the Revised Statutes makes provision for the payment of such
         claims.</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN (Mr. Willard): This bill has never been referred to the <orgName>Committee

         progress, and ask to sit again.</p>
        <p>The CHAIRMAN: The question is now on a substitute offered by the Senator from

        <p>The substitute was adopted, upon a division - affirmative, 28; negative, 18</p>

        <p>Mr. FOULKE: I think this bill ought to be disposed of as far as possible now, and in
         Committee of the Whole.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS: I think it apparent it is a waste of time to consider items about which no
         member is able to give any reliable information.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: The <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> has taken on
         the Martin claim $220 worth of testimony; the committee has worked weeks on it, and spent
         night after night in its consideration. If this bill is sent to the <orgName>Finance
          Committee</orgName> the probability is that it will never come back</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: This bill has passed the House, and presumably its provisions are just. After
         the Senate passes the bill a committee of conference will be at once appointed, and the
         House conferees can explain to the Senate members of the conference committee. I think the
         motion ought not to prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr HILLIGASS: I think the motion ought to prevail, and let the <orgName>Finance
          Committee</orgName> examine this bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE: I think the best way to consider this bill is in Committee of the Whole. I am

        <p>Mr. WINTER: There are several members of the Senate can act as intelligently upon now as
         they can a week hence. The best way to get through is to go ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR withdrew his motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS renewed it.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: If this bill is not sent to the committee to report on I shall vote against
         the last dollar in the bill.</p>
        <p>The motion that the committee rise was rejected upon a division.</p>
        <p>The three similar items following were passed to the end of the bill.</p>
        <p>The item allowing $290 to Judge Thomas F. Davidson for services as special judge being
         read -</p>
        <p>Mr. MARSHALL read the itemized bill for these services. At that time the law allowed pay
         for special services. I don'k think there is anything wrong about this claim. I move that
         this claim be allowed.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: The Senator pleads on the honor and justness of his man. It ain't on that
         ground I fight these claims. These judges are drawing $2 500 a year out of the State
         Treasury, and I say it is unrighteous to pay them one dollar for extra work.</p>

         by Arthur P Main.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ: That is an unjust claim. He got his claim. It has been here in the Legislatures
         of 1879 and 1881.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAY: The car company made a settlement with Mr. Shuler. Mr. Main accepted the note of
         the car company, indorsed by the Auditor of State, and the company failed, and Mr. Main has
         never got anything.</p>

          <corr>CAMPBELL</corr>
         </choice>, of Hendricks, the item was passed to the end of the bill.</p>
        <p>This item to allow Simon P. Thompson $785 for expenses and services as an attorney in the
         recovery of real estate in Newton County being read - </p>
        <p>Mr SELLERS moved to reduce the sum to $500</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 29; negative, not counted.</p>
        <p>Item 16 to allow $200 to a member of the Ohio River Commission being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. RAHM moved to add to Marcus M. Sulzer and J. August Lencke each $100 for services as
         members of this Ohio River Commission. He said the board was composed of some four or five
         members; $100 will pay their actual expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILL: i am somewhat acquainted with one of these commissioners who made Several trips
         East. There was an application for an allowance two years ago, but there was some
         irregularity about the bill and they never got anything. Not only that, but they paid their
         own expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved, ineffectually, to amend by placing this at the end of the bill for
         consideration hereafter. I would like to see the record of men who will pay for sending men
         to Washington to lobby.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 15; negative, 10.</p>
        <p>Item l7 was allowed</p>
        <p>Item 18, to allow $360 to estate of John M. Pettit, for forty-five days service as Judge,
         being read - </p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIS explained the claim. I move to adept the item.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER offered a substitute, reducing the sum to $180, the compensation the law
         allowed at that date.</p>
        <p>The substitute was adopted.</p>
        <p>Item 19, to allow $750 far an iron fence around the Tippecanoe battle ground, was agreed
         to after remarks by Mr. Johnson, of Tippecanoe.</p>
        <p>Items 20 and 21 were agreed to.</p>
        <p>Item 22, to allow $2,498.78 to William B. Burford, for interest on amount, due for public
         printing, allowed by this Assembly, was adopted, as was also the last item number
         twenty-three.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR moved to amend to allow J. C. Johnson $600 and $400 to G. B. F. Cooper for
         second and third best plans of specifications for the State House at the request of the
          <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> of the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I hope this amendment will not be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr McINTOSH: I think we had better vote this claim down.</p>
        <p>Mr WEIR: There is no dispute but that a reward was offered for the three best plans, and
         those plans have been used.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected upon a division.</p>
        <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to amend by appropriating to purchase a plot of twelve acres of ground
         adjoining the 160 acre grounds of the Logansport Hospital for the Insane, $2 000.</p>
        <p>Mr. BROWN understood this ground can be bought for $1 500</p>
        <p>Mr MAGEE: The owner was here yesterday and said his price was $2,000 Some day the State
         will be compelled to have this ground and money will be made by purchasing it now.</p>
        <p>Mr. McINTOSH: This is an early commencement to ask for an appropriation before the
         building is erected. We have to borrow money to pay for these buildings, and in twenty
         years we can buy this ground for this amount of money. We have now 312 acres there.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON, of Tippecanoe moved to allow Bert Davidson for services as stenographer in
         making a transcript $36, at the request of the Attorney General.</p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY moved to amend item 9 by allowing John R Rankin $86 76 for printing done for
         the House of Refuge under the administration of Superintendent Ainsworth in 1876.</p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ: I was in the Legislature ever since 1877, and I never heard a word about that
         bill.</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 17; negative, 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENSLEY moved to allow Teresa and Charles Bochtell $1 000 for damages on account of
         the death of their father at the Insane Hospital through carelessness of employes.</p>
        <p>Mr WINTER: That would be unconstitutional. [Reads Section 120 of Revised Statutes of
         1881]</p>
        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - affirmative, 21; negative not counted.</p>
        <p>Mr WINTER moved to amend by allowing $500 to Dye &amp; Fishback for services rendered the
         Provisional Board of the Hospital for the Insane in the case of John Martin against said
         board in 1881.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY moved to amend by allowing for Brevier Legislative Reports heretofore
         authorized, ordered, accepted and bound by the State; and also for these reports of the
         debates of the present Assembly.</p>
        <p>The amendments were agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware, moved to add $1 700, to wit: To George H. Fleming, $500; Cyrus F.

         1981. He said in 1881 the Board of Revision were empowered to em- <pb n="168"

         work them from eighteen to twenty hours a day. They worked over 200 days and were paid $3 a
         day, and they now present a bill for extra labor. In support of that claim we have the
         affidavits of the three Judges who composed that board. They all say this claim should be
         paid.</p>
        <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend by adding $200 a year additional for the moral instruction of
         the Prison South.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOCH moved to insert the sum of $500.</p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. McINTOSH the committee rose and the Chairman reported progress and asked

        <p>Mr FOULKE: I believe any one having an interest in any bill has the right to speak with

         I object to its passage. I have myself had trouble with the telephone company in my town.
         We took an oath to support the Constitution, and this bill is in direct violation of the
         fundamental law of both the State and Nation; and were it not the passage of the bill would
         be nothing more than the plunder of property. I shall oppose any kind of legislation which
         proposes to take property from one and give it to another. To protect the fruits of human
         inventive genius national laws have been enacted which States can not contravene, except so
         far as is necessary to insure the proper police regulation. This has been settled by the
         adjudication of the highest courts in the country The Constitution of Indiana prescribes
         that no man a personal property shall be taken without just compensation The company show
         that under this bill the Telephone Company can not do business in this State. They say they
         are only making a profit of 5½% per cent. on the cost of the plant. If this bill be passed

         pay half the expenses of the repairs, on condition that the city should be allowed to use

         though the bill is still not without its objectionable features, I am pleased somewhat with
         the work of the <orgName>Conference Committee</orgName> in reducing the amount of the
         appropriations more than $28,000. Believing that there should be an appropriation bill
         passed, and that this is the best we can get under the circumstances, I shall vote
         "aye."</p>
        <p>Mr. LOYD, when his name was called: Although I have said that I would oppose to the last

        <p>Mr STALEY, in explanation of his vote: I am in favor of sustaining the conference

         by me They were appointed under very delicate conditions, in view of the fact that it had

        <p>The bill [S. 151] to amend the common school law, so as to give to teachers a day's wages
         for attending township institutes was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr PLEASANTS said that the bill contained some good and some bad features. He didn't
         think it right to compel all teachers under all circumstances, to attend institutes, and to
         make them forfeit a day's pay for failure to do so. If enacted this bill would compel lady
         teachers to travel many miles in bad weather to attend institutes.</p>
        <p>Mr. STALEY: This bill has been indorsed by a great many teachers and leading educators,
         who believe that it will help to increase the attendance and interest at institutes For
         this reason I support it.</p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON: I am opposed to the bill because it allows the teachers extra pay for
         attending institutes</p>
        <p>Mr. MOODY: I am in favor of this bill. For many years we have had a law on our statute
         requiring teachers to attend Township Institutes without pay, and in case they failed to
         attend them one day's wages is taken from them. This law is wrong. It is in violation of
         the bill of rights, which provides that "no man's particular services shall be demanded
         without just compensation." Again I am in favor of this bill for the reason the pay will be
         an incentive to a full attendance at these institutes, where teachers meet and receive
         mutual benefit by comparing methods and modes of teaching. School teaching is no longer an
         ordinary calling but is a science and today ranks among the highest of the liberal
         professions, and this bill I am satisfied is a step in the right direction, and I hope it
         will receive the hearty approval of this House.</p>

        <p>The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R 44] pending at the adjournment
         yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: I am in favor of regulating all corporations. I have no interest in
         telephones other than I have one in my office. Telephone companies are a monopoly, and
         being a monopoly no action at this time would be more popular than to vote for the bill,
         but my convictions as to what would be to the best interests of the people and of the State
         will compel me to vote against this bill. The <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>
         [of which Mr. McCullough is Chairman] attempted to get at the facts in this case. The bill
         in part is unconstitutional, and in fact, a fraud. I believe the Democratic party is in
         favor of regulating corporations, but it should proceed deliberately and judiciously. The
         cost of the plant is $1,624,438 70 in the Central Union Telephone Company. It is probably
         true some part of this has been a donation by the people, as has been suggested. It is a
         clear proposition that property can not be taken away from them, nor can they be prohibited
         from using that property It is a written as well as an unwritten, plain proposition, that
         no man's property can be taken away from him without just compensation. It is proposed in
         this bill to reduce the telephone rental from $5 to $3 a month. What is the result? The
         evidence is that the profit is but 5 2-3 per cent. Grant that testimony is in the interest
         of telephone companies. If a man will testify falsely one time he will testify falsely
         again, and the same testimony will be given if required in court. Say your man is indicted;
         the telephone books are in Chicago; the agent says "We can't sell those instruments for
         less than $5;" and who is going to produce the evidence? There can be no witness brought
         here from outside the State. What is the result? These same officers that have given
         testimony here will come into court and will say they can not afford to put in telephones
         for $3, and as it will amount to a prohibition the court is bound to find the bill, if
         passed, is unconstitutional This Legislature will be left in the attitude of attempting to
         confiscate properly. The Democratic party is not in favor of confiscation, and does not
         want to make such a record. I am not willing to take that step, however popular it may
         be.</p>
        <p>Mr WILLARD: There is no Senator who has a less personal interest or one whose
         constituents could be less effected than mine, as I do not know of a telephone exchange in
         my district; but I can not, as a Senator here, permit the opponents of this bill to deny
         its constitutionality without speaking a word of defense for it. Where is the section in
         the Constitution that shows this bill unconstitutional? The States of Georgia, Tennessee,
         Kentucky and Wisconsin all of them have regulated by statutes the charges of railroad
         companies, both upon freight and passengers. And such legislation has been sustained as
         being within the limit of the sovereignty of the State by the Supreme Court of the United
         States. I have no sympathy with the plan against striking down monopolies. I believe in
         striking down monopolies The Democratic party believes in striking down monopolies, and I
         believe the people of the State will approve the action of the Legisla <pb n="171"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-519"/> ture in striking down this monopoly, as I hope it will. I desire
         to read from the case of Patterson vs. the State of Kentucky, and I say that case strikes
         down the last vestige of the argument of the Senator from Gibson (Mr. McCullough), and this
         case was approved by the Supreme Court of this State in 63 Indiana. [Reads 97 Ky., p. 503,
         and comments] This is exactly the object of this bill, H. R. 44, to protect the many
         against the injurious conduct of the few. And so I say the constitutionality of this bill,
         under the rulings of our own Supreme Court, is not an open question.</p>
        <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: This discussion, I think, has fully met the question of the
         constitutionality of this bill raised by the Senators from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) and Gibson
         (Mr. McCullough). I demand the previous question.</p>
        <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operation the
         Senate agreed to substitute the favorable minority for the unfavorable majority report by -
         yeas 34; nays 14.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 361] to pay John Martin $55,616 68 for work and labor done and material
         furnished the female department of the Hospital for the Insane, was read the third time</p>
        <p>The majority report recommends the passage of the bill and the minority report recommends
         that it lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to substitute the minority for the majority report.</p>
        <p>Mr. FOULKE: The testimony before the committee has been exceedingly conflicting: we
         differed among ourselves. I will try to state the evidence (which he proceeded to do). He
         favored the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: Some members must be in great doubt concerning this matter; some of them
         have changed their mind since the adjournment for dinner. I mention this to show the great
         doubt in reference to this case Under the law and under the contract I am exceedingly
         doubtful whether he should receive. I want to show some of the <choice>
          <sic>poubt</sic>
          <corr>doubt</corr>
         </choice> surrounding this matter and how this controversy has arisen. It is largely a
         question of judgment, for instance; Mr. Martin has been paid for a smoke stack $6 300. By
         the measurement allowed in this bill you, will pay for that smoke stack $12,895.60. During
         this session a bill was passed providing for removing the furnaces 150 feet away from the
         building, and in order to do that it is necessary to build a smoke stack. The board has
         given notice that they want that smoke stack duplicated. I am told by the Board - Dr.
         Harrison, the President told me, and it is reliable, that the estimate of one of the
         largest contractors in the city of Indianapolis on that smoke stack is $3,500</p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, of Hendricks: I came to the conclusion with reluctance to sign the majority
         report of the committee. It is my impression Mr. Martin would not have guessed there was
         more than $8 000 or $10 000 due. I should have been much better satisfied to have that
         building measured now, according to the contract, but that was impracticable. I don't want
         to guess away a man's right.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings: I have not the voice to make a speech of any considerable length.
         As I understand it the committee only disagreed on one thing, and that was as to how many
         brick there is in that building, measuring it by the rules in the contract. By that
         contract both parties are bound. It is true the board tried by some entry drawn by an
         attorney to preclude John Martin from further claim under that contract, without the
         knowledge of John Martin. The record made by the committee will cost the State some $220;
         and since the General Assembly adjourned two years ago there have been bills paid by the
         State in resisting this claim that will amount to $1,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: In advocating the justice of this claim said, it will not do to put off the
         claim of a citizen of Indiana, because this is the last day of the session. There was a
         general feeling that there never was a settlement with John Martin till 1881. You hear
         everywhere that the credit of the State is not good, because a claimant has to wait so long
         and be at so much expense in order to get a claim allowed, which is a fact and it is a
         shame and a disgrace to the State. From the evidence before the committee I should have
         been embarrassed, as to how to vote on this claim, but the record in the case and
         circumstances surrounding it, have made it appear a just and righteous claim.</p>

       </div>
       <div type="section">
        <head rend="center">NIGHT SESSION.</head>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER: I have examined the record in this claim, and I see that men as honest as
         ever drew the breath of life have certified that the claim is settled. They are now dead,
         and after they are dead there is a new measurement of this work. The claimant said once, so
         and so was due; and now after they are dead he comes in with a new meas- <pb n="172"
          xml:id="VAA8558-22-520"/> urement. If it runs on a few years it will get to be $100,000,
         for it is growing bigger. I say there is not one dollar due on this claim, for it has been
         twice adjudicated.</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, demanded a call of the Senate.</p>
        <p>It was ordered and, being taken, discovered 47 Senators present and answering to their
         names</p>
        <p>Farther proceedings under the call were dispensed with.</p>
        <p>Mr McINTOSH: If I were to consult my own feelings and pay no attention as to whether it
         is a just claim or not, I would vote for it. I don't know anything about the claim but what
         I am told, but I believe this bill is a fraud and a swindle. I want to put my condemnation
         upon the assertion being continually made here and elsewhere that the State of Indiana is
         dishonest. If you all could see the record as made on this claim by John Martin himself you
         would condemn it. When you vote for this bill you vote to filch that much money out of the
         Treasury of the Stare of Indiana.</p>

        <p>Mr. HUSTON: I have been importuned by several members of the House to call up House bill

         authorize County Commissioners to construct gravel roads, and it is now on its third

        <p>Mr. WILLARD: It has never been the custom nor the usage in the Legislature of Indiana to
         pass bills on this day of the session; nor can we pass bills on this occasion without
         violation of the Constitution of the State of Indiana for the Constitution distinctly
         states that no bill shall be presented to the Governor within three days of the final
         adjournment. Now, if we violate our oaths and go into passing bills the result will be that
         on the last day of the session all kinds of legislation will be rushed in. While I regret
         as much as any Senator that several bills have not beep enacted into laws, I do not think
         that to day we ought to engage in the passage of bills</p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR: My views on this question are in harmony with the Senator from Lawrence (Mr.
         Willard) I have no objection to this bill, and would be glad to accommodate the Senator
         from Fayette (Mr. Huston) but if one bill may be taken up the whole day may be occupied in
         passing bills I hope we will not go into general legislation to day.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTER: I find two decisions of the Supreme Court on the question; one in fifty-third
         and the other in ninety-fifth Indiana, in both of which cases the bills were presented in
         the last three days of the session to the Governor, and he filed them in the Secretary of
         State's office, merely noting on them the date when they were presented. The question was
         raised as to whether they were laws. It was claimed they would not be laws in case they
         were not presented previous to the two days of the close of the session. In neither case
         did the Su <pb n="176" xml:id="VAA8558-22-524"/> preme Court say the Legislature has the
         right to pass laws on the last two days of the session, but held it not competent for the
         courts to go back where a bill was found in the Secretary of State's office, properly
         signed by the officers of the Legislature, that no question of fact could be raised to show
         that it was not properly enacted.</p>

        <p>It was adopted.</p>
        <p>Mr. DITTEMORE (at 3 o'clock) moved that the House adjourn sine die. Before announcing the
         vote on the motion Speaker Jewett addressed the House as follows:</p>
        <p>G<hi rend="sc">ENTLEMEN OF THE</hi> H<hi rend="sc">OUSE</hi> - The legislative
         possibilities of this House of Representatives are at an end, and in a few moments it will
         have passed away forever. Its achievements and failures will have become part of the
         history of the State, and stand submitted to the deliberate and, let us hope, just judgment
         of our fellow citizens. I will not at this time attempt to review in detail the laws which
         henceforth shall remain as the monument of your labors. Nor have I the presumption to here
         advance my own opinion of their necessity or merit. It is sufficient now to declare, what
         all who hear me know to be the truth - that this House convened in the face of grave
         responsibilities and an enormous amount of labor. No general or specific appropriation bill
         had been enacted <pb n="178" xml:id="VAA8558-22-526"/> for four years. The new State-house
         required intelligent legislation to the end that its early completion might be assured, and
         the State protected from loss or extravagence in connection with it. An extensive and
         expensive system of asylums for the insane were half finished and without means for
         completion, and doubts were expressed as to the proper course of the State in regard to
         them. The redistribution of the Congressional and Legislative representation, always a
         difficult and delicate task, had to be made. Numerous minor investigations were to be made,
         and one State institution was subject to an appalling scandal which compelled patient
         consideration and demanded radical treatment. Many creditors of the State clamored for the
         payment of debts which bad been so long neglected that the credit of this proud State was
         in danger of ranking as that of a common cheat. The questions of the proper aid to be given
         to the State institutions and of the policy of the State in regard to one or two of them
         were important and pressing. The regulation of railroad, telegraph and telephone companies,
         the questions of damages and gravel roads, of fees and salaries, the regulation of mines,
         the protection of citizens in equal rights, the relief of the laboring classes from the
         oppression sometimes practiced by employers, the question as to another Court of Appeals -
         these and numerous others pressed upon your notice and demanded consideration I believe
         that the published volume of the acts of 1885 will, in a large measure, repel the
         disposition to criticise the action of this House, which is most indulged in by those who
         have the least information on the subject. During our deliberations there have naturally
         arisen conflicts of views and struggles for the supremacy of rival theories. Such
         contention is inseparably incident to legislation. It is often sharp and sometimes bitter,
         and while I believe we have had the smallest possible amount of it, we must have been more
         than human to have escaped it altogether.</p>
        <p>Addressing you for the last time as your Speaker, I desire to again thank you for my
         elevation to it, and the consideration you have shown me while occupying it. If I have at
         times seemed arbitrary or tyranical, rest assured that it arose from no wish to be so. Such
         would have been a shabby return for all your goodness and forbearance toward me during the
         tireful days that have gone forever. Looking into your faces, both members, officers and
         gentlemen of the press, I see not one to whom I am not indebted in some degree of
         gratitude. It is an obligation I may never hope to discharge, but it shall, nevertheless,
         rest always upon my heart in all its generous force.</p>
        <p>So with a heart full of pleasant thoughts of all of you I take my final leave or you as
         your Speaker, but with the hope that I may often meet each of yon as a private citizen. And
         in so doing I adopt in all sincerity what I deem the sweetest words of gratitude:</p>
        <lg>
         <l>"With all my love I do commend me to you,</l>
         <l>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is</l>
         <l>May do to prove his love and friending to you -</l>
         <l>God willing, shall not lack."</l>
        </lg>
        <p>And so the House of Representatives of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly adjourned
         without day.</p>

        <p rend="center">[Omitted from bottom of Page 104.]</p>
        <p>During the discussion of the ditch law bill H. R. 222, Mr. ZIMMERMAN said: The people of
         my district demand the repeal of the Circuit Court drainage act. Whilst I admit that
         through this act the general health of the people and the looks of the country have been
         greatly improved, yet all this has been accomplished at the expense of a comparatively few,
         many of whom lost their property and homes through the operation of law, which places the
         power into the hands of one or two men put liens upon the property of scores of other men
         against their will and ability, yet it is a vicious and oppressive law and ought to be
         eradicated from our statute book. The bill now pending is sufficiently modified to be
         acceptable my constituents and I hope it will pass.</p>

        <p rend="center">[Omitted from first column, Page 102.]</p>
        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to take up the bill H. R. 401, and said: This bill authorizes
         Auditors in Counties where a surplus of school fund money can not be loaned in such
         counties, to loan it out to applicants residing in other counties. Under the law each
         county is accountable for 8 per cent interest on school fund money whether loaned out or
         not. This bill gives the desired relief to such counties where a surplus is on hands and
         cannot be loaned. There is an additional safe guard provided in this act should the school
         fund money go to another county. In such cases the amount loaned will be upon one fourth
         the appraised value of such real estate exclusive of perishable improvements instead of
         one-half as now provided by law when the school fund is loaned in counties where it
         originally belongs. The bill also contains ample provisions for the appraisement of the
         real estate and the collection of interest and principle. As a proper relief measure and in
         no way endangering the safety of the school fund, I hope the bill will pass.</p>

        <head rend="center">FREE TOLL FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN.</head>
        <p>Mr. PASSAGE: Mr. Speaker, I presented this bill [H. R. 368.] in the interest of education
         and to relieve the poor children of the State of the necessity of walking through snow and
         mud to and from school. It has been urged by the enemies of this bill that we have no right
         to take private property for public use. I submit sir that the highways of the State have
         been taken by these Gravel-road corporations and converted to their own use, and that such
         being the case they have no right to set a tax upon the school children of the State. In
         some of the counties of Indiana it is impossible to get to the school house without
         traveling over these toll roads; and children whose parents are poor, but have horses,
         wagons or sleighs and could convey their children to and from school were it not for the
         expense of toll, are compelled to walk through snow and mud in order to gratify the greed
         of a few men who have control of the highways over which they are compelled to travel. I
         have said this much as applicable to the men who have taken possession of the common
         highways and built toll roads at their own expense; but there is another class who, by a
         system of wrecking, well known to Rail-Road corporations have obtained possession of the
         gravel roads built by the people; obtained them for almost nothing and now their arrogant
         and defiant conduct toward the public makes legislative action a necessity. Mr. Speaker, in
         the interest of education, in the interest of humanity, in the interest of justice to the
         bright-eyed school-boy and school-girl whose hearts will be made glad, if this bill should
         become a law, I ask for its favorable consideration.</p>

        <p>Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to take up the bill H. R. 314, and said: This bill is in the interest
         of the laboring men. Under the present law, in the construction of Rail Roads,
         Sub-Contractors and laboring men are at the mercy of the first Contractors for their pay,
         and thus tens of thousands of poor laboring men have been defrauded out of their just
         earnings. This bill provides that whoever performs any labor or furnishes material for the
         construction of Rail Roads through the State of Indiana, shall have the right to a lien on
         the right of way and franchises of such Road to the extent of the claim due such person. It
         is the sacred duty of this Legislature to protect the laboring man. A law of this character
         ought to have adorned our statute books years ago. I hope this Senate will not adjourn
         before passing this important bill.</p>

          adjourned to some other hour appointed by such motion. He shall immediately call the

          a division be called for, the Senate shall divide; those in the affirmative of the
          question, shall first arise from their seats, and after those in the negative.</item>
         <item>6. The President shall have a general direction of the Senate Chamber. He shall have
          the right to name any Senator to perform the duties of the Chair, but such substitution

        <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, from a special Committee, returned the claim for Brevier Legislative
         Reports heretofore authorized, ordered, accepted and bound by the State, [see Senate
         Journal of 1885, page 398], and, also, the bill [S. 336,] to pay for the same, with a
         lengthy report thereon, which was printed under an order of the Senate. It is as

           <p>M<hi rend="sc">R</hi>. P<hi rend="sc">RESIDENT</hi>: - The undersigned, members of the
             <orgName>Special Committee</orgName> to whom was referred Senate Bill No. 336, with
            instructions to inquire into and report the facts concerning the liability of the State
            to Mr. Drapier for the compilation of the Brevier Reports for the years 1879, 1881 and
            1883, which includes the Fifty-first, Fifty-second and Fifty-third General Assembly of
            the State of Indiana; and, also, the facts as to the value of the said Brevier Reports,
            beg leave to report as follows:</p>
           <p>The committee have taken the testimony of W. R. Myers, Secretary of State, and of Mr.
            W. H. Drapier. The committee has also caused a compilation of the resolutions passed
            from time to time in relation to the State taking such reports, and have caused the
            pages of the House and Senate Journals since 1857 to be set out, and herewith make the
            evidence and copy of resolutions a part of this our report.</p>
           <p>From the facts, as we get them, we are of the opinion that there is no legal binding
            contract between Mr. Drapier and the State, whereby the State agreed to take the
            reports. Mr. Drapier, however, has reported the debates of the Legislature since 1857,
            and has received therefor the uniform price of two-thirds of a cent per page per volume,
            up to 1879, which has been paid by the State, on resolution adopted at the close of the
            session, except where, in some instance, the resolution empowered the Doorkeeper to
            employ Mr. Drapier to make such reports.</p>
           <p>We are unable to give the value of the reports, as such reports are not put on the
            market for sale.</p>
           <p>We are of the opinion, that by resolutions passed by the General Assemblies of 1879,
            1881 and 1883, it was the intention of the Legislature to take such reports at
            two-thirds (⅔) of a cent per page per volume, and that by mistake in the form of
            resolution the same was not paid, and, also, because of the failure of the specific
            appropriation bill.</p>
           <p>We find that Mr. Drapier has placed the reports in the office of the Secretary of
            State, and that the claim, so far as the thirteen thousand one hundred and ninety-eight
            dollars and forty-four cents ($13,198.44,) is concerned, is the amount found due Mr.
            Drapier, provided the resolutions had been in the form of concurrent resolutions.</p>
           <p>We also find that the State has caused some of said reports to be bound, and that it
            paid for said binding.</p>
           <p>We further find that no resolution has as yet passed in this General Assembly
            authorizing the payment for said reports for this Legislature, but we would recommend
            the passage of the resolution<ref xml:id="ref_001" target="#note_001" rend="super"

        <head rend="center">EVIDENCE BY W. R. MYERS, SECRETARY OF STATE.</head>
        <p>Question. What, if anything, do you know, either personally or by the records on file in
         your office, about any contract, written or oral, between the State and Wm. H. Drapier
         concerning the compilation and publication of the Brevier Legislative Reports?</p>
        <p>Answer. I know of nothing excepting the joint resolution of the House and Senate of 1883,
         authorizing the publication of the Brevier Reports of that session. I have heard further
         contracts discussed by other State officers and Mr. Drapier, but know nothing of my own
         personal knowledge.</p>
        <p>Q. Did the State at any time within the six years last past receive from Mr. Drapier any
         of such reports, and, if so, under what circumstances were they received; state fully?</p>
        <p>A. My understanding is that Mr. Drapier has for a great many years published the Brevier
         Reports, and they have been received by the State, and that there is a very considerable
         difference of opinion between the State officers and Mr. Drapier as to the amount of money
         due him for said reports. Of this I have no personal knowledge other than the action of the
         Legislature from time to time in regard to the same. The Legislature of 1883, by resolution
         of each branch of the same, authorized the publication of a certain number of copies, the
         exact number of which I cannot tell without reference to the resolution. These reports Mr.
         Drapier published, and, as I understand, presented his claim or bill for to the Auditor of
         State, who refused to audit the same, and the matter was then referred to the courts, and
         was decided adversely to Mr. Drapier. In the meantime Mr. Drapier presented to me his
         Brevier Reports, the number of which I can't remember, which I declined to receive, for the
         reason that I did not. In any way, wish to implicate the State. I did, however, permit Mr.
         Drapier to deposit the same in the basement of my office, where they now remain.</p>
        <p>Q. Did the State at any time within the last six years have any of these reports bound,
         and if so, for what purpose?</p>
        <p>A. I round in my office a number of copies bound in paper covers, the same as those now
         deposited, of the Fifty-third General Assembly. As to whether the State authorized the
         binding I know nothing.</p>
        <p>Q. Were any of the Brevier Reports of the Fifty-third General Assembly delivered to the
         Secretary of State, and if so, what was the number of copies, in what condition, under what
         circumstances, and by whom were they delivered?</p>
        <p>A. Mr. Drapier now holds a certificate from me showing the number of copies of the
         Reports of 1883, which were deposited in the basement of my office, as stated above, all of
         which is more fully answered in the reply of the second question.</p>

        <head rend="center">EVIDENCE BY WM. H. DRAPIER.</head>
        <p>Question. How long have you been compiling these reports?</p>
        <p>Answer. Twenty-seven (27) years.</p>
        <p>Q. How many reports, on an average, have been furnished each General Assembly?</p>
        <p>A. Seventeen hundred and fifty (1,750) copies uniformily, making a fraction over eleven
         (11) copies to each member of the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Q. Has the General Assembly, by resolution from time to time, since the commencement of
         the compilation of these reports by you, authorized the publishing of and the payment for
         such reports by the State?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, as shown by tabulated statement herewith submitted and marked Exhibit "A," made a
         part of his answer.</p>
        <p>Q. Was there a resolution offered and adopted by the General Assembly of 1881 and 1883,
         authorizing the publishing and payment of these reports?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, as shown by Exhibit "A."</p>
        <p>Q. Does the exhibit made and filed by you as a part of answer three (3) show the pages of
         the Journal of the Legislature from time to time, where such resolutions occur.</p>
        <p>A. Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. Was there at any time since the commencement of the compilation of these reports any
         contract, written or oral, between you and the State by which you were to compile and
         furnish such reports to the State, and for which the State agreed to take the same at any
         stipulated price?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, there were a number of contracts as the tabulated statement marked "A" will
         show.</p>
        <p>Q. Has there at any time, been any objection on the part of the General Assembly to your
         appearing on the floor of the House or Senate, and reporting and compiling the reports of
         the proceedings and debates of the different sessions of the Legislature, in the forms in
         which the Brevier Reports have been made?</p>
        <p>A. Never in all these twenty-seven (27) years.</p>
        <p>Q. What has been the uniform price for these reports, and by whom has it been paid?</p>
        <p>A. The uniform price paid is two-thirds (⅔) of a cent per page, per copy, and has always
         been paid by the State.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you sell copies of these reports to any person or persons, other than the
         State?</p>
        <p>A. Never, excepting perhaps in a half dozen instances, and then only as a custodian.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you mean by the last answer the whole number of volumes published in any one
         year?</p>
        <p>A. No, I mean that I have sold only single copies and I can not now recall but three
         instances of this kind, - not to exceed perhaps, a half dozen, as stated in my answer to
         the last question.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there any instance in which no price has been fixed for these reports?</p>
        <p>A. In every order the price is uniformly stated, as the tabulated statement will
         show.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the reasonable value of these reports?</p>
        <p>A. Compared with the compensation received by me for similar services, during my
         professional life of 35 years, the Brevier Reports are worth more than double the price the
         State has ever paid me for them.</p>

           <p>Under the foregoing resolutions I presented my claim as heretofore set forth to the
            Auditor of State and demanded a warrant therefor. The Audidor questioned the legality of
            its payment under the resolutions, and refused to draw his warrant for any part thereof.
            To obtain an interpretation, and to determine whether I was entitled to receive a
            warrant, I commenced an action by mandamus in the Marion Circuit Court against the
            Auditor. The Court gave me judgement for the several amounts, less interest, charges for
            binding, etc., embracing only the number of days of each session and the number of pages
            of each volume at the usual and customary price of two-thirds of a cent per page per
            copy for the 51st, 52nd and 53d Assemblies - being volumes 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21; that

           <p>The State by her Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court, and that Court, in 95
            Ind., p. 33, held: First. That by reason of said Senate resolution not being concurrent

            being a liquidated or stated sum: and, Third. That said 53d General Assembly could not

            General Assembly as shown by the Senate and House journals for twenty-seven years past,
            at the same price uniformly paid by the State since 1857, conformably to the usage and

        <p>And Whereas, on mandate proceedings in the Marion Circuit Court to determine questions
         thereon raised, said Court did give judgement for the sum of $13,158 44, for the number of
         pages only at ⅔ of a cent per page per copy, the uniform price heretofore paid therefor,
         embracing the debates and proceedings of the Regular and Special Sessions of the 51st, 52nd
         and 53rd General Assembly of the State of Indiana, being vols. 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21.</p>
        <p>And Whereas, on an appeal therefrom by the State, the Supreme Court has held that such
         action by said Senate and House, should have been concurrent, for the then present session,
         for the payment of said Brevier Legislative Reports, of their debates and proceedings, and
         further, that said Assembly, neither by its Senate or House could appropriate by
         resolution, moneys in payment of legislative expenses of preceding sessions. Therefore,</p>
        <p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana:</p>
        <p>That the sum of (13,158 44) thirteen thousand one hundred and fifty-eight dollars and
         forty-four cents, be and the same is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury
