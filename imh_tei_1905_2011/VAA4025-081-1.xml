                    </placeName> in the early spring of 1785 the Articles of Confederation Congress turned its attention
                    to the western land question that had intermittently agitated the politics of the central government
                    for several years. The unsuccessful draft of a 1784 land ordinance was taken from the table and
                    promptly referred on March 16 to a grand committee headed by William Grayson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The creation of Grayson's committee was the logical
                    aftermath of one of the most significant achievements of the oft-maligned Confederation Congress:
                    the successful assertion of its authority over much of the trans-Appalachian West.</p>
            <p>By treaty with Great Britain following the Revolutionary War and by cessions from several key states
                    of much of their own western claims, Congress had become responsible for a public domain that
                    rivaled in size the combined areas of the thirteen seaboard states. The Peace of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> of 1783 had officially ended twenty years of sporadic attempts to restrain American
                    settlement beyond the mountains. The Proclamation of 1763 and the Quebec Act of 1774 were history,
                    replaced by boundaries that extended north to the Great Lakes, south to Spanish <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and west to the Mississippi River. Even the areas won by western militia in the
                    Revolution paled by comparison to the treaty bounds.</p>

                    participate in the development and exploitation of the new lands. All began to pressure the

                    action, and Massachusetts joined in 1785 while the report of Grayson's committee was being
                    debated. Others, beginning with Connecticut in 1786, soon followed.</p>

            <p>Historians are quick to point out that neither the diplomatic nor the political relinquishment of
                    western lands was total.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Britain was already using alleged American violations
                    of the peace treaty to justify maintaining a military presence south of the Great Lakes—a
                    presence that helped the British to retain substantial influence among several northwestern Indian
                    tribes. Most of the "landed" states were holding back portions of their western
                    lands. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, limited its cession to lands north of the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName>—and even there reserved large military bounty lands along the Scioto
                    River as well as the smaller Clark grant near the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Despite each of these qualifications, however, the lands under congressional authority
                    remained large and served as the impetus for substantial pressure for land legislation.</p>
            <p>The host of potential western settlers and entrepreneurs that had developed over the quarter century
                    from 1760 to 1785 generated part of the demand for the sale of the western lands, but much came from
                    within Congress itself. Denied taxing authority by the Articles of Confederation, and unsuccessful
                    in periodic attempts to secure a tariff (or impost) amendment, the Congress was regularly strapped
                    for the funds to service the Continental debt or to meet other expenses. Little wonder that the
                    possibility of profit from land sales was enticing to many congressmen or that the ordinance
                    proposed by Grayson moved quickly to passage. Grayson's committee reported on April
                    12,1785, and debate began on April 14. The lack of a quorum, not unusual to that body, delayed a
                    second reading until May 5 and postponed the final consideration and vote until May 20 when a final
                    compromise measure passed unanimously.</p>

            <p>The brevity of the Ordinance of 1785 has not meant that the far-reaching consequences—and
                    origins—of its provisions have been overlooked. Well before the current bicentennial of
                    the act, the language of its text drew historians of the New West to search for the motives and
                    identities of its authors. In the early part of the twentieth century the name of Thomas Jefferson
                    attracted special attention. Jefferson had chaired the committee that had drafted the unsuccessful
                    1784 ordinance, and the Virginian's lifelong interest in the West made him a logical focus

                    The correspondence of Grayson, chairman of the 1785 committee, was central to this reinterpretation.
                    Grayson was clear in his view of sectional rivalry: "I think there has been enough said and
                    wrote about it as would fill forty Volumes ... so difficult is it to form any system ... where the
                    interests of the component parts are suppos'd to be so different." In particular
                    he noted the need to "accommodate both the Eastern and Southern States,"<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and he later remarked, as a Virginian, about "the Eastern people
                    being amazingly attached to their own customs, and unreasonably anxious to have every thing
                    regulated according to their own pleasure.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The southern and eastern sectional differences noted by Grayson included alternative views of land
                    development in the two regions. The eastern (or New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>) states accorded a central role to the towns within their borders and normally used the
                    township as the vehicle through which western expansion was set in motion. As Grayson stated,
                    "the idea of a township with the temptation of a support for religion and education, holds
                    forth an inducement for neighborhoods of the same religious sentiments to confederate for the
                    purpose of purchasing and settling together ...." Southerners, on the other hand, preferred
                    to emphasize the separate farm or plantation site, or "the idea of indiscriminate locations
                    and settlements ...."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Each region also had its own type of survey and
                    sale techniques. Under the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> system, clear boundaries, usually in the form of straight lines and right angles,
                    normally preceded sale and settlement. Under the southern system, land was purchased under warrants
                    that merely specified acres and general locations. Survey, if any, usually followed the occupation
                    of an attractive location of the appropriate size. This procedure often meant an initial southern
                    purchase less extensive than a full township. Because New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> township organizers ususally resold land in smaller and relatively equal portions, the
                    final result, however, was often a larger holding by a southern settler.</p>
            <p>Viewed in these terms, the Ordinance of 1785 was heavily influenced by New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> precedents. Apart from the concession that alternating townships would be sold by
                    section, the essential features were eastern: townships, linear boundaries, advance surveys, and
                    even land to support community schools. <list type="footnotes">

                    provision to designate one section per township for the support of a local church. With seven states
                    needed to approve the idea, the vote was five yea, two nay, and two divided of the nine states
                        voting.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Important as such regionalism was in determining the final form of the ordinance, it was closely
                    allied to other, economic, considerations. Again Grayson set the tone when he noted: "Some
                    gentlemen looked upon it as a matter of revenue only" and voiced the concern that land
                    sales might depopulate the eastern seaboard or cause eastern land values to depreciate. Others
                    clearly feared the reverse through the effect of "speculators and ingrossers" who
                    would "have the effects of injuring the poorer class of people, or of establishing
                    monopolies. ..." Grayson himself was more impressed by the fact "that the Eastern
                    States, where lands are more equally divided than in any other part of the Continent" were
                    generally settled in the manner proposed.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Yet the conflict of settler and
                    speculator, found on so many frontiers in American history, had still made itself heard for all who
                    were interested in economic factions and motives.</p>
            <p>Given the considerations suggested in the correspondence of members of the Confederation Congress, a
                    broadened search for authorship of the Ordinance of 1785 was clearly in order, and several
                    candidates quickly joined the two Virginians who had chaired the 1784 and 1785 committees. The New <placeName>

                    attention on Rufus King, most vocal of the eastern congressmen. The stress upon survey and auction

                    shift from warrants to advance surveys. One fact, however, seems well established: the Ordinance of
                    1785 was much more than the inspiration of a single individual.</p>
            <p>The immediate consequences of the land ordinance have also been of interest to historians, although
                    it quickly became apparent that those consequences were less momentous in the short run than one
                    might have expected. The initial area of the survey was limited to the seven ranges of townships in
                    the southeast corner of what later became <placeName>

                    greatest appeal probably lay in the comparative absence of hostile Indian activity. Although
                    government agents, supported by small western army garrisons, had been struggling, with limited
                    success, to bring the northwestern Indian conflict to an end for some time, a number of tribesmen
                    remained unpacified. Even in the Seven Ranges, survey was periodically interrupted when tribal
                    leaders refused to assure the surveyors' safety or when Colonel Josiah Harmar was required
                    to make other uses of the handful of troops at nearby Fort McIntosh.</p>
            <p>Thomas Hutchins, a career military officer who had accepted the post of geographer of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, guided the first survey of the western lands. Aided by a fluctuating number of
                    surveyors from the various states, he needed over three years to complete both survey and paperwork.
                    Hutchins began in 1785 by drawing the East and West Line (later called the Geographer's
                    Line in his honor) westward from the junction of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s western border. A year later his group completed survey of the first four
                    ranges south of that line, and in his absence in 1787 the surveyors finished the last three. The
                    notes, plats, and general plan were finally filed in July of 1788. The Seven Ranges were the only
                    lands surveyed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1785.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sales of land in the Seven Ranges proved disappointing. A later Confederation Congress dropped the
                    original plan for land sales in the various states as outlined by the Ordinance of 1785, and the

            <p>Commentators at the time offered a variety of reasons for the poor land sales. Explanations ranged
                    from the quality of the rugged land to the remoteness of the sale site from the western settler. The
                    primary problems, however, were most likely the continued Indian menace and the alternative
                    opportunities created when Congress decided to make several large land grants in the area. Much of
                    the valley north of the Ohio was sold on generous terms to the Ohio Company, the Scioto Company, and
                    the Symmes Purchase, signaling at least a temporary abandonment of the 1785 system. It would only be
                    with the land law of 1796, under a new central government, that the Ordinance of 1785 would begin to
                    serve as a model for western surveys and sales.</p>
            <p>But a model it became. Later legislatures would debate many specific features of the 1785 design:
                    minimum price, minimum acreage to be sold, credit features, preemption rights, even the method of
                    numbering sections within townships. Yet the basic decisions for rectangular survey in advance of
                    sale and for clear title remained the rule for over a century.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Geographers are
                    quick to point out that the resulting face of the western landscape, with its distinctive
                    checkerboard effect, is a uniquely American feature—and the term
                    "section" has achieved international usage as a description of American land use.</p>
            <p>The long-range success of the Ordinance of 1785 has encouraged further inquiry into its origins in
                    recent years, although less now as a matter of specific authorship than as a search for the broader
                    climate of opinion that made general acceptance of the system possible. Some have looked far back
                    into the Roman past, noting both the ancient emphasis upon rectangular survey and the new American
                    republic's fascination with Roman republican models. Others have sought the roots of the
                    township in the medieval English hundred and the pressures of the enclosure movement. Still others
                    judged significant the era's streak of utopianism, ranging from William Penn's
                    street plan for <placeName>

            <p>Revolutionary War recruits found the promise of a postwar grant of land an attractive alternative to
                    the payments in depreciated paper that were offered as enlistment bounties. Often paid in the form
                    of warrants that could be converted after the war to a western land claim, the bounties had clearly
                    been a major factor in forcing quick political action on the western question. Generated partly by
                    claims of the actual bounty holders, the pressure to settle the western lands issue had been sharply
                    reinforced by the claims of the "landless" states for a national presence in the
                    West and given particular shape by the need to consider the role of the speculators who were making
                    a market in the often-depreciated warrants. It is little wonder that an original provision of the
                    ordinance (a provision repealed only in 1788) gave certain priority to bounty claimants. Similar
                    legislative experiences in several states before 1785, particularly in the North, had also led to
                    laws and actual surveys that recent study suggests provided strong precedent for the cadastral
                    system of 1785.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Historical geographers have also pointed out that the final form of the survey of the Seven Ranges
                    might well be rooted in surveying techniques of the day. Any attempt to impose a straight
                    surveyor's line upon the curved surface of the earth imposed a challenge to the eighteenth
                    century, even with such precedents as the excellent survey of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s southern border to draw upon. The key tool used by Hutchins and his
                    surveyors was a circumferentor, a simple compass fitted with sight vanes and mounted upon a ball and
                    socket that fitted upon a "Jacob's staff' or upon a tripod. Although
                    originally required to use a true meridian, the surveyors were allowed in practice to use simple
                    compass readings to set their lines. The result was a close approximation, but only an
                    approximation, of the precision suggested in the ordinance. Survey technique, like land law itself,
                    needed to be refined.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Viewed in the context of its era, the Land Ordinance of 1785 thus emerges as a complex and
                    many-faceted piece of legislation. Its origins reflect both the complicated regional factionalism of
                    the Confederation era and the climate of enlightened rationalism and history within which its
                    authors moved. The law's immediate implementation calls attention to a small corner of
                    southeastern Ohio and to a few <placeName>

            <p>Nineteenth century Indiana produced a number of nationally and internationally acclaimed artists and
                    writers, but few attracted as much attention, or notoriety, as William Merritt Chase. From the
                    mid-1870s until his death in 1916, Chase played a dominant role in the artistic life of the nation.
                    As a painter he won numerous awards and was designated a National Academician. His works were
                    displayed by the leading museums, and he served on numerous juries for the major art exhibitions.
                    His portraits, landscapes, and still lifes featured bold colors, slashing brush-work, and a bravura
                    style that he learned at the Royal Academy in Munich, <placeName>

                    terrain heavily forested with tall oak, walnut, maple, and sycamore trees. Along the creeks
                    elderberry bushes crowded bittersweet and trumpet creeper. In the spring redbud and dogwood provided
                    a profusion of color to be followed by daisies, queen anne's lace, goldenrod, asters, and
                    sunflowers in the summer. Bears, wildcats, wolves, foxes, raccoons, and rabbits roamed the densely

                    Indiana in the 1830s and 1840s was not far removed from the rough frontier. The few amenities
                    sometimes included a one-room schoolhouse that had infrequent and irregular sessions. The people
                    were not well educated and were suspicious of strangers. Their fundamentalist churches dominated the
                    rural communities, and preachers condemned card playing, drinking, and gambling as mortal sins. A

                    carpet while the handsome young Merritt with his narrow lips and wide eyes brought more shoes for
                    them to inspect. Years later Chase remembered that he had a genius for selling shoes to ladies; his
                    secret was to sell a pair one size smaller than that which they had been wearing.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>While young Merritt may have felt that he was an accomplished salesman, his father was clearly not
                    succeeding in his business. He acquired a new partner and a new location in 1864 in a venture called
                    Chase &amp; Cady Ladies' Shoe Store across <placeName>

                    Cady at the same site. David Chase moved his family to another residence at 159 Virginia Avenue as
                    his business fortunes declined. Within a year his name was removed from the partnership, and by 1867
                    he had opened David H. Chase Boots and Shoes Wholesale and Retail next door to his old store. Credit
                    reports continued to stress his good character but also his lack of business acumen. The high rent
                    on the store precluded profits, and his home, valued at $1,200, was heavily mortgaged.
                    Business directories for 1867 and 1868 listed as a salesman in the store one William M. Chase, who
                    was a most unhappy young man.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>After the family moved to a house on East Michigan Road on the outskirts of the city near the Deaf
                    and Dumb Institute, Merritt attended a district school. From the Chases' pleasant country
                    home he walked to school with George, Amanda, and other children, but once there he spent most of
                    his time drawing pictures of Indians on the blackboard with colored chalk. As one of the older boys,
                    he helped the smaller children, and when the ground was covered with snow, he pulled two little
                    girls on a sled to and from the district school. He called them his "Red Riding
                    Hoods" as they wore that style of dress, which was then much in vogue. But he was not
                    happy. He disliked clerking in the store and felt that he was not accepted by the other boys. A very

                    responsibilities to work in what was an unsuccessful business, and he had to help with the expanding
                    family. There would eventually be five younger brothers and sisters.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much to his father's continued annoyance, Merritt spent many of his working hours drawing on
                    brown wrapping paper or standing on an iron grate in front of Lieber's Art Store looking at
                    the chromos in the windows. Indeed, he got frostbitten toes on one occasion while staring at the
                    lithographs. His school books were covered with drawings, and just at the busiest time of the day in
                    the store he would be behind a counter working with colored pencils while customers waited. His
                    behavior infuriated David Chase, who sought to save his business and feed his family while his
                    eldest son drew pictures. Sarah Chase encouraged Merritt, and her penchant for decorative works made
                    with colored feathers, a Victorian rage, may have heightened his interest in working with his
                    pencils. She saved the drawings in his books and even at one point became a reluctant model. Merritt
                    decided to make a plaster cast of his mother's face without knowing how, and the plaster
                    hardened so rapidly that he had to chip it off her face, thus frightening his brother and sister. A
                    second try led to a successful cast. David Chase was undoubtedly happy that no permanent damage had
                    been done to his wife, but he remained irritated at all the drawings on the white shoe boxes at the
                        store.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Members of the family did become increasingly interested in the drawings of themselves that young
                    William made. He drew a rather tender portrait of Sarah Chase holding baby-sister Carrie on her lap.
                    The crude technique reveals an untrained young man seeking to please his family. Another drawing,

                    angry, bare-legged little boy who stands next to her. Chase called it "His Only Pair of
                    Pants." On a trip to visit an uncle in a nearby community William attracted the attention
                    of the townspeople with a portrait of a young cousin. George Chase recalled that William left

                    his most sensitive and memorable paintings were those of his wife Alice, whom he married in 1886,
                    their children, his sister, and sisters-in-law. Chase's devotion to his family, established
                    early in his life, would remain one of his most important values. Eventually adolescent rebellion
                    and stubbornness wore down even David Chase. Clearly his eldest son, who insisted that he be called
                    "William," not "Merritt," was not going to be a satisfactory
                    shoe clerk. The father conceded: "William, you have spoiled wrapping paper enough here. Put
                    on your hat and come with me. I am going to take you to Hays."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Barton S. Hays occupied a studio on the third floor of the Talbott and New Block Building on North
                    Pennsylvania Street next to the old post office. One of a dozen artists who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1860s and 1870s, Hays found work painting portraits and selling still lifes. He,
                    Jacob Cox, James M. Dennis, and others exhibited at Herman Lieber's Art Store, the Indiana
                    State Fair, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Art Society. Although he initially supported himself as a tinsmith, Cox became
                    Indiana's first professional painter. He had no academic training, but he knew some leading
                    artists in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, such as Joseph O. Eaton and Thomas Worthington Whittredge. Indeed, Eaton had studied
                    with Cox before going to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Hays too was self-taught and initially painted panoramas at a time when vast canvases
                    of historical subjects were very popular. Both Hays and Cox painted rather raw still lifes not
                    unlike those of the eighteenth century baroque period, and Cox produced romantic landscapes. Hays
                    also tinted photographs and operated a Daguerrean establishment. Since the Hays studio was located
                    only a few steps from the shoe store, it would seem that young William had probably been a visitor
                    there before and knew of Cox, who was the center of the city's artistic life. Both Hays and
                    Cox had accepted students before and had taught them their simple and direct techniques.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hays charged David Chase twenty dollars per month, and he set his young protege to work copying in
                    oil a steel engraving of a picture by Rosa Bonheur. Chase later recalled that this teaching
                    technique was "of no earthly advantage to me as an art student," <list type="footnotes">

                    father seated reading a newspaper. David Chase still felt that there was a limited financial future
                    for an artist in the family but proudly placed the portrait in the window of his shoe store. William
                    also did some "cattle" pieces that he exhibited. A black and white crayon portrait
                    of Captain Wallace Foster, drawn on brown paper in 1866, showed the considerable growth that William
                    had achieved under Hays's tutelage. Foster, who operated a men's clothing store
                    near the Chase enterprise, reluctantly agreed to pose for the young artist. Working with a crayon in
                    one hand and a slice of wheat bread in the other, William finished the study after two sittings.
                    Foster gave Chase five dollars for the painting, the first commission the artist received, but the
                    oval portrait with its expressionless eyes only hints at the talents young Chase possessed.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the late 1860s Chase painted numerous portraits, and his technique and style reflected those of
                    Hays and Cox. He drew a crayon portrait of Mary Elizabeth Browning and painted oils of Benjamin
                    Love, William Orbison, and two lawyers in nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, James B. McFadden and William Gurley Munson. The handsome Munson was a friend of the
                    young artist, and Chase painted him in a frontal shoulder-length view. Munson's expression
                    is vague and formal, and his eyes stare straight ahead. There is no hint of the slashing brushwork
                    of the Chase of the 1870s. A flat light illuminates the forehead against the dark background in a
                    camera-like rendering; yet, this portrait of 1868 is decidedly more polished than that of
                    Chase's grandfather, Moses Swaim, painted the year before. William had presented his
                    maternal grandfather in a painting almost wholly lacking in detail and possessing a strong
                    "primitive" quality. Clearly he had learned from working with Hays and from the
                    suggestions received from Cox. Formal portrait painting would ultimately become one of his primary
                    sources of income and fame, and he painted many portraits of his friends, fellow artists, and
                        patrons.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>While Chase matured as an artist, he continued to clerk in his father's shoe shop, and he

                    Joseph S. Skerrett was placed in command. It took a crew of 210 to man the 1,022-ton ship, and they
                    were a tough lot. Far from home, sensitive to <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-081-1-035"/> criticism, and
                    sick at heart, if not from the sea, William realized that he had made a terrible mistake. The
                    ship's muster roll described this third-class apprentice as a "school
                    boy" 5 feet, 4 1/2 inches tall with blue eyes, black hair, and dark skin and with a small
                    heart—possibly a tattoo—on his left forearm. The discipline of the ship was
                    unlike any situation William had faced before, and one petty officer in particular gave him many
                    unpleasant tasks. Young Chase and his colleagues did exalt when their tormentor lost his foothold
                    one day and fell into the sea, but other than watching one of the officers paint marine scenes,
                    William found no comfort aboard the <hi rend="i">

                    </placeName> and the security of Hays's studio and his family's hearth. A picture
                    taken of this young cadet shows a thin boy with a rakish look wearing a blue uniform with brass
                    buttons at the top of the pants pockets. Stars decorated the cuffs and the center of his shirt. A
                    porkpie hat set at an angle on his head fails to persuade the viewer that this is a masculine sailor
                    of the seven seas or even a happy young apprentice. After three months William appealed to his
                    father to obtain his discharge, and David Chase went east, arranged for his son's release,
                    bought him a new suit of clothes, and took him home.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his parents gave him a large room for a studio. He sought out Hays for art lessons
                    and Cox for advice and counsel. He also found his way back to the shoe store. Hays and Cox
                    recognized Chase's maturation and realized that the young artist had learned all he could
                    from them; David Chase concluded that William was not destined for success in the shoe business.
                    While Chase clearly owed a greater debt to Hays, he referred to Cox as his "father in
                    art," and his mentor's help and advice were crucial. William brought his paintings
                    to Cox for criticism though the artist remembered: "He [Chase] was not a pupil of mine,
                    though I often gave him instruction and advice." Both Hays and Cox knew Joseph O. Eaton,

                    experienced by the city as Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt had erected the huge Grand Central Depot
                    at Forty-second Street. William passed under the vast glass roof of the train shed into Fourth
                    Avenue, which was filled with horse-drawn wagons, carriages, coaches, and trolleys. He traveled
                    downtown to seek out Eaton who made him welcome and helped him enroll at the Academy.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>The excitement of the city carried over into the nation's leading art school, which, too,
                    was gradually rejecting the past and slowly moving away from classical training methods to an
                    emphasis on technique. Some of the best of the professionally trained artists no longer spent hours
                    laboriously copying earlier works and then using that approach for their own paintings. At the
                    urging of some instructors the young artists were being taught to paint with bolder strokes, to use
                    more color, and to abandon minute detail for simpler lines, but the conservative landscapists who
                    dominated the Academy refused to support the demands to "modernize" the curriculum
                    following the new European approaches. What an exciting place for the boy from Indiana to find

                    young painters. Upon Eaton's return William obtained his own studio in the YMCA Building at
                    Fourth Avenue and East 23rd Street across the street from the National Academy. Eaton remained a

                    make any money from the business, and credit reports suggested that he should liquidate the firm.
                    His old friend Schofield joined him again as a partner and endorsed his notes, but by March of 1870
                    the business was dissolved, leaving David Chase "worthless." He wrote his son that

                    there had been some changes in the methods of the Academy, the older instructors still emphasized
                    drawing rather than painting, and the pupils spent hours preparing copies of casts in the academic
                    manner. Chase made drawings of painstaking accuracy that pleased the instructors but came to bore
                    the young artist.</p>
            <p>Although Chase hated the tedious classes at the Academy, he found other aspects of the
                    artists' life challenging and stimulating. There were his friends among his fellow artists,
                    such as Weir and Ryder, and the new Metropolitan Museum of Art, which opened in the spring of 1871
                    and presented the Academy novices with a broader range of western European art, especially the
                    paintings of the Renaissance. At the Academy Chase found that to enter "a classroom filled
                    with casts of the antique is as disen-heartening as to go into a graveyard";<hi rend="sup">37</hi> nevertheless, he continued to improve his technique, broaden his concept of style, and

                    books and magazines. Munich offered a far less academic form of instruction, according to Mulvaney,
                    and students had more latitude stylistically. Certainly Will must have been impressed by
                    Mulvaney's sketches with their direct and vigorous brushwork. Will's enthusiasm
                    for Europe in general and for Munich in particular knew no limits except his pocketbook.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    earnings remained meager, and a photograph taken during this time shows a dark, brooding, heavily
                    lined face with a large drooping mustache. The fur hat and coat that Will is wearing in the picture
                    heightens the sense of foreboding shown on his face. Part of his unhappiness may have been the
                    strained relationship with his father. David Chase still did not approve of his eldest
                    son's vocation, and his own financial plight may have exacerbated the feeling that Will
                    should seek a more lucrative profession. The Chases had three more mouths to feed after the arrival
                    of Charles, Carrie, and Hattie. Will's brother George recalled that Sarah Chase sympathized
                    with the young artist but that their father did not. Will felt that his father considered him
                    "the black sheep of his family," though "I had my good mother always as a

                    Will's studio to visit, and Pattison recalled her as a sweet-faced, gentle lady very much
                    concerned with her son's career. Will may have tried to please his father by clerking
                    briefly at the mercantile store of Dodd, <placeName>

                    Chase's concern about Will's fortunes were somewhat alleviated when in 1871 his
                    son won several awards at the Eleventh <placeName>

                    won first prize of twenty dollars in the category "Head, Cabinet Size," but it was
                    his still life that attracted attention. The official report on the fair commented that
                    "Mr. Wm. M. Chase [showed] several tantalizingly real looking fruit pieces." One
                    of the latter took second in the fruit-painting category and a prize of ten dollars. Local
                    businessmen who belonged to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> collector of American art, Samuel A. Coale, provided many of the art awards. William
                    recalled that his father's views did change and that while walking downtown with him they
                    met an acquaintance to whom Will was introduced as "my son the artist." Over time
                    his father came to take pride in his son's accomplishments.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                    </placeName> businessmen and art patrons. Several stories, some of which must be apocryphal, purport
                    to explain how Chase attracted their notice. One story has a banker reporting to Pattison on
                    Chase's arrival in <placeName>

                    two sessions of the National Academy of Design behind him. George Chase remembered that
                    Chase's first studio was in a building that housed the office of Captain W. R. Hodges, an

                    wished to go to Europe. "My God," he replied, "I'd rather go to
                    Europe than go to Heaven!" Hodges then proposed that Chase attend an academy in Europe for

                    them a picture to repay the money that he had been advanced. He also agreed to help them acquire

                    Chase and other midwestern artists sought to live down what they considered American crudities,
                    Chase's life and art reflected many familial and regional values.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                    Clearly Chase carried with him throughout his career a sense of the importance of natural settings,
                    and his love of the out-of-doors remained a central factor in his life and his work. He became
                    famous for his paintings of Central Park in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Prospect Park in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as his many landscapes of Shinnecock, Long Island. The Shinnecock paintings
                    reflect the glory of the wild flowers, shrubs, and trees of what was then a tranquil rural area of
                    the northeast. Chase also revelled in the company of family and friends, a trait developed early in
                    his life, and before and after his marriage to Alice Gerson she would be his most faithful model.
                    Their eight surviving children proved to be the delight of Chase's life and the subjects of
                    numerous portraits and genre scenes. Although Chase would abandon "flower
                    painting," he loved still life, especially works depicting fish and fruit in settings which

                    recollection—the search for his lost five-year-old sister who had strayed from the

                    his first—and only—pair of pants was laundered.]</p>
            <p>Following that [the death of a relative, Peter Helton], I remember of riding a horse until I was
                    quite wearied, in tramping out a batch of wheat, on a threshing floor, and the next day having to
                    rake the wheat from the fanning mill, while father and a neighbor separated the wheat from the chaff
                    on the fanning mill.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next event of importance, which I remember, was the coming of the threshing machine. It was
                    called the Ground-hog, was run by six horse power—the driver standing on the platform on
                    the machine and driving the horses around to furnish the power. The thresher had a cylinder and a
                    concave and a short straw carrier, and only separated the wheat from the straw, leaving the
                    separation of the wheat from the chaff to be done by hand with a fanning-mill.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    But it was a great improvement over the old tramping process.</p>
            <p>The next event following that in my memory was the building of the old Union Chapel, near where the

            <p>The next event, following this is one of importance to every child and one ever
                    remembered—his first day at school. The school-house was known as the Woods school-house,
                    named for a family of that name near-by. It was located one mile north of the Center school-house in <placeName>

                    </placeName> t.p. [township] Clay Co. It was a log house, with seats without backs, a writing shelf
                    on two sides of the house, with a large stove in the center of the house.</p>
            <p>Sylvester Milligan, a young man was the teacher, and I think a lazier one never endeavored to conduct
                    a school. Almost every afternoon, he would put the school in the hands of some of the older pupils,
                    lay himself upon one of the writing shelves and take a nap. Into his august present I was ushered,
                    and asked the initial questions—What is your name how old are you. I had been properly
                    coached, and passed the test. After this an Elementary Spelling book was placed in my hands, was
                    shown the alphabet and told <list type="footnotes">

                    book in my left hand, with my fingers underneath, and thumb in the angle, and began to stare at the
                    letters, until my hand became tired and my eyes weary from gazing at the letters, but got no
                    farther. I finally memorized the alphabet by the time I had worn the book thru, under my thumb. In
                    that school, the pupils recited separately—two lessons per day. The school was large in
                    number and in size too. There was little system or order, but the pupils made advancement according
                    as they applied themselves.</p>
            <p>So I think in intellectual growth it is more in the pupil than in the system or the teacher.</p>
            <p>So the school passed by, about three months of the year. I learned the alphabet and to spell in words
                    of two and three letters, and in addition learned the ways of school, which was a very important
                    thing to know. The second school was taught in the same school-house, by an elderly [man] named
                    Alfred Bowling. I remember well some incidents of that school. First, that the school was well
                    attended—many grown ups making a large part of the pupils, and some read in the New
                    testament for their reading lessons. Second, that the teacher concluded that the pupils would make
                    better advancement in their studies if they were permitted to study aloud, so the latter half of the
                    school-term was turned in to an open, or loud school—every one doing his lessons audibly.
                    And it was a loud school, sure enough, some doing their work in a loud sonorous voice while the more
                    timid ones could scarcely be heard. In fact in the babel of confusion, it was difficult to hear ones
                    own voice, unless it was keyed higher than the others. It was the third day, before I got up
                    sufficient courage to [do] my work aloud. But in time we became accustomed to the noise, and went on
                    with our work about as well as when silence prevailed. The noise varied; there [were] periods when
                    it sounded somewhat like the hum of bees in their usual daily toil; then there were periods when the
                    noise reminded one of the commotion in a beehive, when some enemy had stirred the hive into intense
                    activity. Such were the periods in which we studied our spelling lessons, which occurred twice each
                    day.</p>

                    those days, Sun. was kept as a sacred day of rest. One of our neighbors concluded he would violate
                    the custom of Sabbath observance, and make hay on that day, while his neighbors rested, and be that
                    much ahead of them with his work. Just after midnight Mon. a band of young men went to his field and
                    tore down his hay shocks, scattering the hay so that the work of Sabbath had to all be done over,
                    and left a bundle of hickory switches, and a letter informing him if this was repeated, he would be

                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi> In 1852 the Indiana General Assembly enacted a law authorizing the
                        formation of companies of private individuals who were given the rights of constables in
                        arresting criminals and recovering stolen property. A result of lawmakers' reluctance
                        to appropriate sufficient funds to pay sheriffs and of many citizens' preference to
                        fend for themselves without hindrance from the government, this Horse Thief Associations Law led
                        to the organization of a number of related, albeit unauthorized, groups. There were, for
                        example, in many parts of the state secret societies which took it upon themselves to regulate
                        the morals of the community. These Regulators, as did the Horse Thief Associations, arrested and
                        punished individuals without bringing them to trial in the established courts of justice. They
                        justified their existence as necessary in order to shield young people from criminal and immoral
                        influences. In many communities the Regulators were extremely powerful, and associations of this
                        sort existed for many years. Emma Lou Thornbrough, <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War Era,

            <p>Our home was near the school-house, so my older sister and I attended the school about every day. The
                    teacher was a young Methodist preacher and was pretty strict in discipline, and a fairly good
                    teacher. We had a full school, among them several grown men and women, and some rather unruly boys
                    in their teens. I began to study reading in this school, having my McGuffey's first
                        reader.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Before the school closed, I had it about committed to memory. It
                    was then the custom for the teacher to treat his pupils about the holidays, and the teacher offered
                    to treat on cakes, candy and apples, but there being some users of whiskey in the patrons of the
                    school, [they] insisted the school have included in the treats whiskey, mixed with water, for all
                    who wished it, this the teacher positively refused to do, so there was a great commotion brought up
                    in the school and the neighborhood, the two factions in the school, the Methodists, opposed to the
                    use of whiskey as a beverage, and the Regular Baptist in favor of its everyday use. On the
                    teacher's refusal to furnish any whiskey for his pupils, some of the patrons who were
                    urging it upon the teacher came to the school house while the teacher was absent at dinner, and
                    furnished all who would partake of it a free treat of whiskey mixed with sweetened water.
                    Subsequently the teacher furnished the school a fine treat of apples, cake and candy. But the
                    commotion over the whiskey episode almost ruined the remaining part of the school-term, the children
                    of the whiskeyites, causing disorder the rest of the term, making it difficult for the teacher to
                    maintain order and discipline among the pupils.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                        in Indiana and elsewhere. In 1837 the General Association of Regular Baptists condemned the use
                        of liquor and, indeed, demanded total abstinence. Although not all churches or associations
                        accepted this view, it seems somewhat unusual to find the Regular Baptists promoting the

                        devotion to sectarianism. Many religious denominations felt that state schools would either

            <p>We lived near a cemetery, and learned to pass thru it to the next neighbors' without fright
                    or fear. There we saw the first funeral procession and burial—an old man almost 100 years
                    old.</p>
            <p>Within the year father had bought 80 acres with an old log house and three acres of cleared land upon
                    it. There was also an old deadning of about 10 acres, overgrown with hazlebrush, which we cleared
                    for cultivation within the next two years.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> This was father's old farm
                    where four of the children were born, and mother and three children passed to the great beyond, and
                    where I spent rest of my boy-hood and the first years of my young manhood. It is located two and one

                    for cultivation, and producing what the family needed for its support beside. We experienced some
                    pretty trying experiences, but lived thru it all and fifty years afterward father sold the farm for
                    nearly three times of what it had cost him.</p>
            <p>The first winter we had about three months school at the Pollom school-house, a mile and a half away.
                    Father blazed away diagonally thru the woods, which shortened the distance. In passing that woods,
                    we often encountered droves of wild turkeys and many squirrels. The school was taught by Christian
                    Hummel, of French descent, a good teacher but not very popular with the pupils, on acc't of
                    his strictness. My older sister and I attended tho the trips were rather trying at times when the
                    weather was cold and the snow deep. The conditions were to severe for the younger sister. In the old
                    log house on the farm, we lived for seven years, building a new hewed log house near by in my 17th
                    year.</p>

                            the hardest and most continuous tasks of the early Indiana farmers. Usually the new ground
                            on a farm was in various stages of preparation for cultivation. Some plots might be
                            completely cleared of all timber, underbrush, and roots, thus ready for the plow; another
                            section might have undergrowth and small timber removed but have large trees still standing;
                            a third might remain heavily forested. One stage in the land-clearing process generally
                            involved girdling, or debarking, large trees and leaving them to die. Later the dead trees
                            were either burned as they stood or pulled down, the logs rolled into piles, and burned.
                            Such acreage was frequently referred to as a "deadening," or as <placeName>

            <p>The next year we attended school at the same place, the school being taught by Elias Boyd, a
                    Methodist local preacher, a man about 30 years of age. He was a man of good nature, and a fairly
                    good teacher, and popular with patrons and pupils. The [school] continued for three months, in the
                    remaining nine months, we were engaged in working on the farm, raising about all we needed to live
                    on, including breadstuffs, hay, flax and wool for clothing. The flax and the wool had to be worked
                    by hand as there were no carding machines near enough to be reached by us in these days. The
                    clearing of the land for cultivation, a few acres each year continued as long as I stayed with my
                    father.</p>
            <p>The next winters school was at the same place taught again by Christian Hummel. In this school I had

                    By this time the system of instruction had changed giving recitations in classes, which was quite an
                    improvement over the old way of individual recitations, and a great timesaver for the teacher.
                    School being closed early, we resumed work on the farm, and continued thruout the Summer. At this

                            recreation for the community. Students often learned to read from the speller; indeed, one
                            teacher and writer referred to the spelling book as a valuable piece of property:
                            "for it was to most pupils the only text-book in spelling, reading, geography,

            <p>The next Winter's term was taught in part by Rev. Aaron Simonson, a local Methodist
                    preacher, who taught a partial [term] but on account of political disturbance in the school, failed
                    to finish the term. He was a good man and able instructor, but rather slow in his movements. The
                    civil war coming on divided the school into two factions as it did the patrons. We boys of the early
                    teens caught the enthusiasm and organized our company, armed with wooden guns and tin swords
                    continued to parade each noon recess. Political spats occurred, and finally terminated in a fist
                    fight between two young men, which ended the school for that year. The winter term being shortened,
                    a Miss Smith from Penn. a Presbyterian, and a sister of Mrs John Roadman, taught a subscription
                    Spring term, which I attended.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> She was a fine teacher, and the first to have
                    religious service at the opening of the school, each day. In my four winter's attendance of
                    that school, I became acquainted with the Wesley Chapel M.E. church, and began the attendance of
                    their S[unday] S[chool] and Preaching services. In this church I had my first definite religious
                    impressions, and in this church made my first move toward becoming a Christian. I came into

            <p>In the Spring of 1862, my brother Thomas Jefferson, named for my grand father Lucas, six years my
                    junior, contracted Spinal menenghitis, and died within five hours after first complaining. We were
                    out at work together until 11 a.m. when he complained of a pain in his neck, went to house, took
                    rapidly worse, and was so far gone when the doctor arrived about 3 p.m. nothing could be done for
                    him, to help overcome the disease, and he died about 4 p.m. shortly after the doctor departed. The
                    death was so sudden and unexpected, that he was missed by us all, and especially by me, for [after]
                    my sister's death, four years before, he had become my nearest companion. The day after his
                    death we returned from the funeral, and to help us in our sorrow, went to work in our clearing. It
                    was hard for us to adjust ourselves to the new order. For days afterward, I would find myself
                    calling to my brother, subconsciously expecting him to answer and come to me, and mother in setting
                    table for meals, would set a place for him for weeks after he had gone from us. Then when she would

                    beautiful to me since nor before. And never was the singing of the birds so melodious. It seemed

                            examiners to hold yearly institutes for the instruction of teachers. It was hoped that such
                            institutes would impart a knowledge of the principles and methods of teaching and school
                            management. Instruction was given in subject matter and teaching methods; new legislation
                            was explained; teachers exchanged ideas; and efforts were made to raise the teaching
                            profession to a more respected status. Although teachers' institutes had existed
                            during the pioneer period and had become popular in the 1850s, they were particularly
                            influential features of the educational system during the last decades of the nineteenth
                            century and well into the twentieth. In 1876 the state superintendent of public instruction
                            credited the county institutes with doing more to improve the methods of instruction in the
                            common schools than almost any other instrumentality. <placeName>

                            administered by the county examiner (later the county superintendent). The subjects, or
                            branches, in which a teacher was to qualify were listed, and certificates for six, twelve,
                            eighteen, and twenty-four months could be issued, depending upon the examination. Despite

                            form of certification by the State Board of Education also developed. Stricter requirements
                            and several months' teaching experience resulted in a life license accepted

                    floor, to the amusement of the whole school. In the center of the room there was an wood stove, made
                    to take in four foot wood, the door opening on the side of the stove. On three sides of the heater,
                    the pupils were seated, the younger pupils near the stove. The old house had no upper floor, and on
                    cold days it was quite difficult to keep the room comfortably heated. There was constant changing as
                    those near the stove would give place to those on the rear seat, by exchanging seats. The
                    teacher's desk was in the rear of the room, used as a pulpit, in the church service. We had
                    a full school, some of the pupils being older than the teacher. The course of instruction, ran the
                    whole gamut, from the beginner to the eighth grade. But we had a great time, both in the school room
                    and on the playground. For I had found my chosen work a pleasure, and that makes work easy.</p>
            <p>The following Spring and Summer, I worked on the farm with my father, and in the summer I attended
                    the Co. teachers institute, became a member of the Co. Teacher's Association,<hi rend="sup">22</hi> and was enrolled as one of the teachers of the Co, and State, which work and relation I
                    continued for 17 years. It was a great epoch in my life, when I was identified [with] the teaching
                    force of the State. At that time the school teachers were accounted as the most intelligent and best
                    educated citizens, the real benefactors of the State's citizens. Most of the teachers were
                    of high moral <list type="footnotes">

                            Institutes was the formation in many counties of the County Teachers' Association.
                            Unlike the institutes the associations were voluntary, their sessions were shorter, and the
                            discussions were carried on <hi rend="i">by</hi> teachers, not <hi rend="i">for</hi> them.
                            By 1890 an estimated two thirds of the counties had such associations. <placeName>

                    love of the work, rather than for the financial compensation, for the public school teacher was
                    never, highly financially remunerated.</p>
            <p>So my boyhood and adolescent years were lived among the pioneers of western Indiana, with as good
                    school privileges as the State then, afforded, but far inferior to those of today, and with few
                    church privileges. The closest church was two and a half miles away, over poor roads and most of the
                    time, we attended the church on foot. Our neighborhood was the out-cropping of four churches not
                    enough of any one denomination to keep up organized church service, but enough division in religious
                    belief, to prevent any concerted action, religiously, so grew up with comparatively little religious
                    training.</p>
            <p>But these pioneers, with plain living, dressed in their homespun clothing, and with little time from
                    their work to earn a livelihood, for self culture, were not devoid of human sympathy, nor entirely
                    dead to religious obligations. For the Sabbath was as well observed then as it is today, and in
                    times of sickness kindness was always shown to the family of the suffering ones, and the appeals of
                    poverty always found a ready response. In case, neighbor fell behind with his work on acc't
                    of sickness or misfortune, the neighbors joined to help him up with his work without financial
                    compensation. In the Spring of 1861, three of our family had typhoid fever—myself, mother
                    and older sister lasting April until first week of June, preventing father from attending to his
                    farm work, so he was quite a bit behind with his crop. We were all convalescing, mother and sister
                    able to attend to the household duties, in part, but I was still confined to my room, tho able to
                    walk about the room. Father had managed to plant three acres of corn, and put out part of the
                    garden, while six acres of newly cleared land lay unplowed yet, and it was getting late for planting
                    the corn crop, and that was our main dependence food and stock-feed. On Monday morning, eight
                    neighbors drove up to our gate, with their teams, their horse-feed and farming implements in their
                    wagons, and informed father they had come to help him up with his work by putting in the remaining
                    part of his corn crop and all they would ask [was] their dinners. So they drove into the field and
                    began the working of preparing the ground for planting. Mother and sister, with the help of some
                    neighbor women, prepared the dinner, and long before sundown, the six acres was plowed, harrowed,
                    furrowed and planted and the neighbors returned to their homes, feeling real glad that they been
                    able to render help to one in time of need. A dozen years after this, I was able render a like
                    service to one of them under like circumstances. <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-081-1-074"/> In those days,
                    this was not an uncommon occurrence. Without this mutual sympathy and help of one another, they
                    could hardly [have] succeeded, for in the clearing of the land and the erection of build[ings] they
                    could not have met the expense of hiring the work done. I have [known] 16 log-rollings in one
                    Spring, beside house and barn raisings, which was always done by neighborhood gatherings. I have
                    known as many as 60 men at one log-rolling, and nearly as many at a barn-raising. These were great
                    social functions, cultivating neighborly acquaintance and friendship. The women as well as the men
                    attended the gatherings. While the men were at work out-doors, the women busied themselves, at
                    inside work. Beside the cooking necessary for such a gathering, they busied themselves in
                    wool-picking, quilting or making clothes, for the clothes were all home-made in those days. The
                    out-door work was always finished before night, and the rest of the afternoon would be taken up in
                    athletic sports of some kind, by the young men and boys, such as wrestling, hopping, and jumping and
                    kindred sports, while the older men would rest in indulging in the neighbor-hood gossip. They almost
                    always remained for supper, which was a hilarious hour, but nothing of a questionable character was
                    ever allowed. These and the corn-huskings, apple-cuttings, pumpkin-cuttings, spelling schools, and
                    weddings furnished the social functions of the pioneers, in western Ind. These social gatherings
                    usually ended in some game of the mingling of the sexes, such as a play party of some kind, and
                    sometimes in a dance, but these were always conducted in a decorous manner.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                    Sometimes the party was disturbed by one under intoxication, but he was soon removed from the
                    gathering until he had become sober, or taken to his home.</p>

                    </placeName> interurbans in considerable detail. He shows how a number of small carriers early in
                    the twentieth century came into the orbit of the Schoeph-McGowen traction syndicate and how later
                    the utility magnate Samuel Insull acquired control of these properties. Indeed, Insull interests
                    eventually dominated every major interurban in northern and central Indiana except for two roads.
                    The author also focuses on urban transport. He looks at how in the late nineteenth century the
                    region's isolated animal-powered car lines, particularly in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, evolved into trolley operations and how these companies regularly became associated
                    with electric intercity carriers.</p>
            <p>The interurban and urban trolley craze in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Wabash River region reached a climax shortly before World War I. In the 1920s,
                    however, the triumph of the good roads movement and the rapid increase in usage of the automobile,
                    motor truck, and bus hastened the decline of these earlier transit forms. Although the stronger
                    interurban routes attempted to meet the challenges posed by competitors, the hard times of the 1930s
                    caused their collapse. Yet, a few urban transit systems remained using electric power. After World
                    War II the ubiquitous bus replaced the trolley, and the <placeName>

                    traction enthusiasts. In fact, its publisher, the Central Electric Railfans' Association,
                    has had a long tradition of producing this type of detailed and richly illustrated <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-081-1-076"/> volume. Bradley has done a marvelous job of research; the
                    "nuts and bolts" story of these electric railways is told in an amazing
                    completeness, and he has included more than four hundred photographs and illustrations. The only
                    obvious weakness is his failure to discuss fully corporate strategies and finances. Also, the book
                    badly needs an index even though it contains a valuable appendix of equipment rosters, car and bus
                    diagrams, and specialized maps.</p>
            <p>If anyone later attempts to produce a definitive history of the electric railroad in Indiana, the
                    Bradley book will be a must source. And there are thousands of readers who will find
                    Bradley's efforts immediately rewarding, if only to grasp a faded chapter of the

            <p>Frances Wright was a celebrity in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1820s and 1830s. Author of a flattering book on the country, written when the
                    Scotchwoman was only twenty-six years old, Fanny revisited America in 1824 when her friend the
                    Marquis de <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> arrived for his triumphal tour. Inspired by his example, incensed by the injustice of
                    slavery, and influenced by Robert Owen's community in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she founded a plantation in Tennessee called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashoba</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an experimental community intended to show how slaves working for their freedom could
                    be emancipated without financial loss to their owners. When the world learned that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashoba</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leaders favored miscegenation and permitted sexual unions between unmarried
                    adults, Wright responded to outraged public opinion by launching a lecture tour to defend her views
                    of equality and freedom. With Robert Dale Owen she edited a newspaper that championed freethought,
                    women's rights, and the rights of working people and that condemned the influence of
                    churches and the power of banks. Her political views, shocking enough in themselves at the time,
                    were greeted with even greater vituperation because they came from a woman who dared to speak before
                    mixed audiences.</p>
            <p>Celia Morris Eckhardt examines the life of Fanny Wright from a feminist perspective, stressing the
                    limitations and strains placed on an intelligent and energetic woman who fought for a juster world.
                    She has painstakingly searched out Wright's correspondence and her diligent study of it
                    adds to knowledge of Wright's personal life. Responsibly refusing to go beyond the
                    evidence, she questions the currently fashionable assumption that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Wright were lovers.</p>
            <p>While presenting an engrossing portrait of a lively figure, Eckhardt's book lacks a sure
                    sense of the historical context of her heroine's life. She accepts far too uncritically
                    Frances Trollope's jaundiced views as accurate descriptions of American society. The book
                    could have done more to analyze Wright's ideas, seeking their origins and perhaps comparing
                    them to those of other radicals (surely "radical" is a more accurate designation
                    than "liberal," which Eckhardt more commonly employs). A better understanding of
                    the eighteenth century republican ideology behind <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-081-1-079"/> her view of
                    the world, with its fears of luxury, monied interests, and aristocracy, would have helped to explain
                    Wright's support for Martin Van Buren in 1836, a fact which Eckhardt found bewildering.</p>
            <p>Eckhardt has brought to light some interesting facts about Wright's marriage to William
                    Phiquepal d'Arusmont; however, her sympathies with Wright are so pronounced that she has
                    shortchanged the relationship between wife and husband. The 1939 biography by A. J. G. Perkins and
                    Theresa Wolfson, which quotes long passages from Wright's and
                    d'Arusmont's letters and offers different interpretations of some of
                    Wright's actions, can still be read with profit.</p>

            <p>In the 1870s George Perkins Marsh, outspoken conservationist of his time, issued a warning to his
                    fellow Americans that "we are losing our ability to see." His admonition came
                    about because he believed that humankind was causing rapid deterioration of the environment and that
                    people needed to become more conscious of their surroundings.</p>
            <p>Today, Americans are certainly in need of similar exhortation. Their modern, fast-paced, mobile
                    lifestyle has placed them increasingly in a less direct relationship to the landscape. In 1950
                    historian George R. Stewart helped to alleviate this situation when his <hi rend="i">U.S. 40: Cross
                        Section of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> of America</hi> was published. In this magnificent book Stewart showed that travel
                    and landscape appreciation could go hand in hand. As he journeyed across America on US. 40, he
                    stopped at intervals to take photographs that would reveal the personality of the route and its
                    highway. He did not seek the unique landscape elements but, rather, the common, everyday features
                    that provided for regional diversity as one traveled across the country. Along with his photographs
                    Stewart provided descriptive details, including his own subjective comments. Needless to say, the
                    book was very successful and has been required reading in geography, history, sociology, and other
                    courses.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, there have been few attempts to relate the traveler with the landscape in the manner of

                    Geraldine R. Vale. By 1980 the Vales, both teachers of geography, had retraced Stewart's
                    steps, or better, his tire tracks, compiling in the process both a photographic and descriptive
                    record of the changes at those sites that Stewart had visited in 1950 along the continental extent
                    of U.S. 40. Their book is, therefore, a "carbon copy" of the landscape vistas that
                    Stewart depicted except, of course, that thirty years separate the respective visual impressions.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the principal contribution of the new <hi rend="i">US. 40</hi> is that the reader can compare
                    and contrast the 1980 location photographs with those of 1950 because they were taken essentially
                    where Stewart had stood thirty years before. As concerns format and content, there is virtually no
                    change between the present-day and the 1950 versions of <hi rend="i">US. 40</hi>. Of course, that is
                    exactly what makes this new book so exciting.</p>
            <p>After short introductory remarks on roads and motoring in America today, the authors begin their
                    visual and verbal accounts of Stewart's sites along U.S. 40. They cover all but twenty of
                    the original ninety-two locations and, as in the 1950 version, divide the transcontinental journey
                    into logical regional segments. Each route segment is introduced by a short discussion of its
                    geographical characteristics and three location maps, including physiographic and political maps and
                    a national map of U.S. 40, showing the route segment under discussion relative to all others. These
                    maps are a valuable addition to the photographs and text.</p>
            <p>The representative landscape shots share a page, with the 1950 photographs positioned above the 1980
                    ones. The new pictures are identified by the same designation introduced by Stewart. The arrangement
                    of the photographs and their clarity allow for easy recognition of comparisons and contrasts. The
                    descriptions for each set of photographs have been held to a single page. As one might expect, the
                    authors concentrate on pointing out and explaining any apparent and not so apparent changes.</p>
            <p>The book ends with a number of pertinent "reflections," among them important points
                    based on the analysis of historically different landscape impressions. First, there has been less
                    change during the thirty years than one might have expected, and, second, the American landscape
                    remains as diverse as ever. <hi rend="i">US. 40</hi>, both the old and the new versions, is
                    essential reading for anyone who wants to look beyond the unique and who has a real love for the
                    American landscape.</p>
            <p>One might argue that the authors of the present <hi rend="i">US. 40</hi> should have gone beyond the
                    site selection system used by Stewart <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-081-1-082"/> (i.e., too much emphasis
                    on historical sites in the East), but this was not their objective. Had they done so, in fact, it
                    would have lessened the importance of the book. One can only hope that similar efforts to present
                    visual and verbal descriptions of routes across the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> will be forthcoming. A motorized public weaned and raised on interstates must learn to
                    "see" America again in a way many have never seen it before.</p>

                    </placeName> and the steep decline—if not the imminent death—of its famed
                    Democratic machine.</p>
            <p>A major strength of the volume is the outline that it provides of political decay and the explosion
                    that was the 1983 mayoralty. Richard J. Daley emerges as a powerful but flawed leader who
                    centralized all political authority in himself, fragmented black leadership, and so jealously
                    guarded his power that he left no heir capable of picking up his mantle. He left instead a
                    provocative legend that goaded and, ultimately, mocked his successors. Jane Byrne appears enigmatic.

                    turned on her former allies, embraced tlle staggering machine, and attacked the legend's

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, charting a cautious path of political independence, became the beneficiary of an
                    enlarged black electorate, persistent Democratic factionalism, and a bitter racial campaign. That
                    campaign is the heart of the book. The unprecedented exercise of black political muscle, the battle
                    for "lakefront liberals," and the surprising emergence of Bernard E. Epton as a
                    serious contender for <placeName>

            <p>A good bibliography, to loosely paraphrase the sage of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is the lifeblood of a graduate seminar. The one under review here will be pleasing as
                    well to the senior professors who conduct those seminars. There are, of course, other serviceable
                    bibliographies which deal wholly, or in part, with the era of the American Revolution, but in the
                    experience of this writer none come close to this compilation put forward by the Library of Congress
                    as still another contribution to the celebration of the Revolutionary bicentennial. The work was ten
                    years in preparation and constitutes "a guide to the more important printed primary and
                    secondary works in the Library's collections" (p. xxiii), which qualification must
                    be noted. But it is still the case that the compiler cites some twenty thousand titles in 14,810
                    numbered entries and, moreover, provides access to what has been left out for those who prefer to
                    decide for themselves what is "more important." With regard to the latter, for
                    example, Charles Evans's updated <hi rend="i">American Bibliography</hi> (entry 358) and
                    Joseph Sabin's <hi rend="i">A Dictionary of Books Relating to America from its Discovery to
                        the Present Time</hi> (entry 365) made it seem to the compiler unnecessary to list all of the
                    seven thousand plus contemporary pamphlets, tracts, and broadsides in the library's Rare
                    Book and Special Collections Division. He settled for about five hundred of the "more
                    important" items, which is fair enough with Evans and Sabin to point the way toward the
                    remainder.</p>
            <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-081-1-084"/>
            <p>The organization of the bibliography is exemplary and should make the book manageable to lay users as
                    well as to the presumably more sophisticated professional practitioners. The work is divided into
                    twelve chapters, with the first devoted to research aids, including guides to manuscript
                    collections. The chapters and their subdivisions suggest how broadly conceived has been the
                    compiler's understanding of the revolutionary epoch. They bring into view the larger
                    perspective of the British empire, ranging through the secondary and primary literature bearing upon
                    the political, economic, social, and cultural forces at work in Britain and the empire at large, as
                    well as the narrower perspectives of the American partisans. The Revolution is dealt with
                    sequentially, topically, and regionally, as well as by states. A separate chapter is set aside, for
                    example, for consideration of "The West During the Revolutionary Era," which
                    section should be of considerable interest to readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi>. The War for Independence is broken down not only by campaigns and battles but also
                    with respect to military organization, supplies, weaponry, and much more. The point, of course, is
                    to enable users to find their way toward their particular objectives with a minimum of effort.
                    Loyalists and revolutionary diplomacy are treated in separate chapters, as are also the political
                    history of the Confederation and the states and, naturally, the drama of the Constitution.
                    Fittingly, the bibliography concludes with a wide-gauged assessment of the literature bearing on the
                    economic, social, and cultural life of the revolutionary era and a final chapter that focuses on the
                    Revolution as personally experienced by individuals. Any categorial scheme such as this is bound to
                    involve duplication and overlapping, but the compiler has succeeded admirably in imposing order on
                    what could so easily have degenerated into a chaos of conflicting subsets.</p>
            <p>Finally, the compiler is to be congratulated on the restraint shown in the annotations accompanying
                    about 40 percent of the entries. Gephart was obliged to exercise judgment in determining which of
                    those entries were worthy of annotation, and although this writer might differ on a few of those
                    choices, for the most part the annotations do what they were supposed to: "aid users in
                    determining which works may best meet their needs" (p. xxv). In sharp contrast is another
                    just-published, annotated bibliography on <hi rend="i">The War of the American Revolution</hi>
                    (Garland Publishing Co., N.Y., 1983), in which the compiler interjects personal historiographical
                    judgments in his annotations. Such is not the case with this present work. Gephart's
                    annotations are scrupulously objective in describing the contents or point of view of an article or
                    book.</p>
            <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-081-1-085"/>
            <p>Despite the vast holdings of the Library of Congress, <hi rend="i">Revolutionary America,
                        1763–1789</hi>, does not by any means preempt the field. In the first instance there
                    are rare works not in the possession of the library, and in the second instance the compiler, as
                    already indicated, has not included all of the library's holdings in the bibliography. In
                    fact, he finally was obliged to adopt a cutoff date of December, 1972, in the listing of materials.
                    The more recent literature will have to be ferreted out from such standard reference works as the
                    American Historical Association's annual <hi rend="i">Recently Published Articles,
                        Dissertation Abstracts</hi>, and from a wide variety of subject bibliographies and guides, all
                    of which are faithfully listed in Chapter One of <hi rend="i">Revolutionary America</hi>.
                    Researchers will, therefore, look forward to supplements to the first edition of what will
                    unquestionably emerge as the bibliography of choice for students of the American Revolution.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Grass Roots Politics</hi> contains an interpretation of American political history from
                    1854 to 1983. The title is descriptive of the content in that it is concerned not with politicians
                    but with why individuals voted as they did and how political parties appealed to them. Voters are
                    classified as belonging to one of two psychological types, the "traditional" or
                    the "modern," and their political choices are explained in terms of those
                    categorical affiliations. The "traditional" voter is defined as one who is loyal
                    to family, friends, ethnic group, community, and especially party; who is outside the modern market
                    economy (a subsistence farmer, a gentleman of inherited wealth, a welfare recipient); and who is
                    "liturgical" in religious outlook, i.e., a believer in religious rituals, dogmas,
                    and obedience to clerics. The "modern" voter is one who makes decisions based upon
                    his or her own evaluations of issues and candidates rather than on group loyalty; who is a
                    participant in the market economy (a white-collar worker, a businessman, a cash-crop farmer, a wage
                    earner); and who is "pietistic" in religious orientation, i.e., a believer in
                    salvation through personal and direct experience with Christ, in evangelism, and in the elimination
                    of temptation to sin. The author holds that "traditional" persons voted Democrat
                    and "modern" individuals voted Republican during the period 1856–1880.
                    He uses the traditional-modern <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-081-1-086"/> concepts to explain voter
                    realignments for the periods 1880–1928 and 1932–1983 and the
                    "conservative reaction" of 1938–1980.</p>
            <p>The ways that parties organized themselves and conducted campaigns are also explained in terms of two
                    concepts. One, the army style, characterizes nineteenth century parties that organized themselves
                    into a military hierarchy and mobilized their troops by appeal to traditional party loyalty,
                    employment of extensive patronage rewards, and communication of issue positions through partisan
                    mass-circulation newspapers. The other, the advertising style, describes practices typical of the
                    twentieth century when candidates, using merchandising techniques and deemphasizing their party
                    affiliations, raised their own campaign funds, formed campaign organizations independent of party,
                    hired their own political consultants, and placed greater emphasis on their qualifications than on
                    partisan issues.</p>
            <p>The interpretative analysis is presented in a text comprising about one third of the volume, the
                    remaining two thirds consisting of documents—largely newspapers, magazines, and books
                    printed contemporaneous to events discussed in the text. The documents serve as informational notes
                    illustrating points made in the text where document numbers are given at appropriate places.</p>
            <p>The book reflects the problems inherent in the treatment of an extensive time period in a short space
                    and in the explanation of a complex subject in terms of dichotomies. All American voters do not
                    neatly fit into the "traditional" or "modern" categories. For
                    example, as the author observes, many black voters of the nineteenth century were outside the market
                    economy ("traditional") and were at the same time "pietistic"
                    ("modern").</p>
            <p>The general reader interested in American politics will be pleased by the author's writing
                    style. Students and teachers of American history may use <hi rend="i">Grass Roots Politics</hi> as a
                    point of departure in discussion of the electoral process. Hoosier readers will observe that there
                    is one reference to Indiana, which indicates that it is one of the few states maintaining
                    "very large patronage markets into the late twentieth century" (p. 32).</p>

                    editor, explores the extent to which and the ways in which Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "religious and political ethics represent core values in the
                    American political tradition" (p. x). The explorations occur in two separately authored,
                    long essays—one by political and social theorist Hans J. Morgenthau (left unfinished at
                    his death in 1981 and completed for publication by editor Thompson), the other by religious
                    historian David Hein. Together, these essays provide fresh perspectives on the much-debated case of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s religious faith and political sensibility.</p>
            <p>At first blush, however, the essays could not seem more dissimilar, at least in their interpretive
                    approaches. The Morgenthau essay designs to account for the nature of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "greatness" of mind—not as a politician or a
                    statesman or a thinker but as a person—and this agenda requires the effort to penetrate
                    "the mist of mythological incense" (p. 5) obscuring those qualities of mind and
                    personality in which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s genuine greatness can be discerned. In this, Morgenthau is not interested in
                    the ways <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> measured up to and exceeded the historical roles which fell to him, for that would be
                    to limit his stature to what he <hi rend="i">did;</hi> the interest, rather, is in determining how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s self-expression reveals his profound understanding of a way to be or, in
                    short, in finding "the nature of greatness" in what <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">was</hi>. He was, Morganthau contends, consistently and deeply religious. Oriented
                    throughout adulthood by the conviction that life always followed transcendent guidance that human
                    beings could not fathom, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the distance he felt from this providential force, gained his centrally defining
                    quality of "detachment," not from the course of life but from the local and
                    momentary claims of self-interest, partisanship, ambition, and fame, all of which paled for him
                    under the shadow of eternity. Such detachment was not marked by indifference or apathy; indeed, it
                    liberated other qualities in him—objectivity, humility, compassion, toughness,
                    justness—with which he engaged the political realm and in which his greatness is
                    manifested in American terms. David Hein's essay likewise wants to
                    "de-mythologize" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the mists he wants to evaporate are those in the scholarship on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s religion more than those vapors rising from cultural mythology. In
                    particular, Hein attempts to free the scholars from the notion—in some respects abetted
                    by Morgenthau's views—that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a fatalist who succumbed to a grim determinism; and, with this charge, the essay
                    seeks to define the distinctive character of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s theological outlook by examining it in its political and historical
                    contexts. In those contexts, according to Hein, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s private and public expression reveals his consistent and radical monotheism,
                    his embrace of the doctrine of <hi rend="i">sola gratia</hi>, and his concernted <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-081-1-088"/> efforts to practice an ethics of response, each of which comes to the

                    the web of historical actions and anguish. One could reasonably argue that, in <placeName>

                    can disguise as well as disclose, can be duplicitous and manipulative as well as forthright and
                    affirmative. Finally, hard-headed historians might be inclined to conclude that both essays relent

            <p>Mark W. Summers promises the readers of this book a fresh approach to Radical Reconstruction. Through
                    a thorough examination of a hitherto neglected aspect of that era—the railroad aid
                    program of southern Republicans—he makes good on his promise, but, in doing so, he
                    prompts new queries about the strength and adequacy of his own thesis.</p>
            <p>Following the Civil War, Dixie desperately needed economic rejuvenation, and the majority of
                    southerners "trusted in railroads to achieve that end" (p. 46). Consequently, a
                    railroad mania <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-081-1-089"/> swept the section and, according to Summers,
                    provided Republicans with the central element for their political program. By advocating railroad
                    aid Republicans sought the support of ex-Confederates, as well as Unionists and freedmen, in
                    reestablishing a vigorous economy and creating a new South. In their appeals to white southerners,
                    Summers claims, Republicans propounded "a myth of Progress as a redeemer of the Old
                    South" (p. 14), a "Gospel of Prosperity" that they proclaimed with
                    religious rhetoric and revivalistic zeal. Messianic in its implications, this message centered upon
                    the doctrine that railroad aid would save the South.</p>
            <p>Once in office, therefore, Republicans focused upon the procurement of state aid for railroad
                    development. Obtaining public funding, however, posed problems—insurmountable ones.
                    Rampant localism undermined the financial bases of the roads, blocked the growth of a regional rail
                    system, and heightened the chances of corruption. Not that corruption needed enhancement, for it
                    attended the railroad issue at every stage. Promoters won friends in the legislatures through
                    bribery, while solons used the railroads for their own political advantage. Moreover, this blind
                    allegiance to railroad aid caused Republicans to lose sight of their own mission, betray their
                    commitment to human rights and the Union, and become a divided party. In short, the problems created
                    by railroad aid led, ultimately, to the failure of the "Gospel of Prosperity" and
                    of Republicanism itself.</p>
            <p>Summers bases his account of this Republican tragedy upon sound research, and his use of documented
                    evidence is particularly impressive. Unfortunately, however, the book tends to be plodding and
                    pedantic, and one becomes confused in its labyrinth of details. Furthermore, it is disappointing
                    that Summers does not explore more extensively the religious dimensions of the "Gospel of
                    Prosperity," for that intriguing phenomenon deserves more thorough treatment. Finally,
                    though Summers admits that railroad aid was not the <hi rend="i">only</hi> element of the Republican
                    calamity, one wonders if it was really as central and crucial to that party's collapse as
                    he suggests. One thing is certain: Summers's work will no longer permit historians to
                    ignore that aspect of Reconstruction, and that alone makes his book a significant contribution.</p>

            <p>Page Smith, professor emeritus of the University of California at Santa Cruz, has reached 1901: five
                    thousand pages down; <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-081-1-090"/> many more to go. As his past award-winning
                    works predict, one finds sprightly writing in this volume. "I see my role rather as that of
                    the doorman who announces to the guests ... ‘Mr. William James, and Ms. Jane Addams
                    ...’ " (p. 908). The guests speak for themselves in Smith's
                    "innumerable biographies." A rich cross section of American life, including
                    particularly women, Indians, and blacks, is presented.</p>
            <p>Few American historians would attempt so monumental a task in this age of specialization. Their
                    timidity receives some reenforcement as Smith falters in this transitional postrecon-struction
                    period. In his concluding chapter, "Retrospections," he acknowledges thematic
                    problems. "My intention is to stuff into this chapter themes and topics that I have dealt
                    with in earlier volumes but that, for the most part, have not found a convenient lodging place in
                    this one ..." (p. 909). Reluctant to give up his old themes and uneasy with his new ones,
                    "the rise of science and the war between capital and labor" (p. xiii), the reader
                    is too often left querying, "Why these people, and where is this chapter heading?"
                    "Retrospections" ends with a whimper. Having discussed whether or not Americans
                    were "happy" in 1900, Smith concludes: "the question is stubbornly
                    resistant to an answer" (p. 928).</p>
            <p>No work of such size avoids errors. Pullman was in Hyde Park Township but was never named Hyde Park
                    (p. 192). John Hay's novel, <hi rend="i">The Bread-Winners</hi> (1882) did have good sales
                    but not "greater than any novel published since the Civil War" (p. 190). No work
                    of such scope handles with equal skill all aspects of history. Smith's economics seem
                    dated. Of the year 1877 he proclaims: "Wages and working conditions were, in general, worse
                    than they had been forty years earlier" (p. 165). This traditional generalization was
                    challenged in 1966 in Douglass C. North's <hi rend="i">Growth and Welfare in the American
                        Past</hi>, and current writings buttress North.</p>
            <p>These one thousand pages, as the past four thousand, have not one footnote. This volume, as the past
                    five, has no bibliography. Perhaps half the quotations are of the kind: "Adams sadly holds
                    in <hi rend="i">The Education of Henry Adams ...."</hi> The rest give no clues. From George
                    Bancroft to Daniel Boorstin all national historians have given their readers the chance to examine
                    their sources. Even a "people's" history should meet such basic
                    professional standards.</p>
            <p>This volume is not recommended despite its vibrant text and occasional insights.</p>

                    </placeName> for those thirty years that encompassed two world wars and a massive economic collapse;
                    instead, Barry D. Karl has produced a highly interpretive work that probes the struggle of the
                    American people to adapt their government to the challenges presented by industrialism and
                    technology. He finds their attempts to develop workable adjustments complicated by the ambivalence
                    Americans have always displayed between their desire for local control and the need for national
                    policies. Karl clearly deplores their reluctance to surrender local political prerogatives in view
                    of the international and technological problems that they encountered.</p>
            <p>The author excels in his analysis of Herbert Hoover and F#2 D. Roosevelt and in his comparison of
                    their attitudes and perspectives. The book also makes an important contribution to locating the New
                    Deal in its historical perspective by successfully relating it to its Progressive antecedents. Karl
                    attempts to counter "the myth that the New Deal was a liberal reform crusade that was
                    finally defeated by a conservative minority and that it stands somewhere in the wings, waiting to
                    reenter the stage on which American history is played" (p. 237). He believes that although
                    the New Deal changed popular perceptions of the federal government in the management of public
                    policy and of the president as the prime manager of programs, it was the chief deterrent to the
                    changes reformers have repeatedly called for in American government because Roosevelt was
                    essentially a professional politician who always sought a political rather than an
                    "administrative" solution to the problems he faced. A political solution in the
                    American system meant the preservation of local political influence.</p>
            <p>Because Karl's purpose is interpretation rather than comprehensiveness, his treatment of the
                    period is somewhat uneven. Perhaps because of his focus on interpretation and his use of facts
                    primarily to illustrate his various arguments, there are some lapses in accuracy, but these are
                    minor matters that do not diminish the effectiveness of this fresh and original look at the New
                    Deal.</p>

                    1984. Pp. xv, 310. Illustrations, sources, index. $12.95.)</head>
            <p>Although Roswell Garst only attended college for a few semesters, he became an eminent
                    agriculturalist and practical agronomy experimenter of great stature. He, as a close friend and
                    business colleague of Henry A. Wallace, pioneered in the production and sale of hybrid corn. Garst
                    was an Iowa farmer, landlord, and founder of Garst and Thomas Hi-Bred Corn Company. Aptly dubbed the
                    "Great Innovator," he vigorously promoted such practices as the widespread use of
                    hybrid corn seed, intensive use of nitrogen as a chemical fertilizer, irrigation of corn,
                    utilization of the trench silo, greater mechanization on the farm, and the development of commercial
                    feed lots in the corn belt.</p>
            <p>Because of his close personal ties with Wallace, Garst supported the New Deal farm programs and even
                    contributed to the implementation of the corn-hog allotment program set up under the Agricultural
                    Adjustment Act. Although he was a lifetime Republican, Garst's loyalty to Wallace and other
                    Democrats, such as Hubert H. Humphrey, motivated him to support government management of agriculture
                    despite his free market inclinations. It was paradoxical that while he backed farm programs to pay
                    farmers not to produce surpluses, his own activities in promoting scientific farming were
                    instrumental in dramatically increasing the production of agricultural commodities. Garst, like so
                    many who lived during the Great Depression, could never quite relinquish his loyalty to the New Deal
                    for rescuing the farmers during the economic hard times of the 1930s despite the drastic
                    transformation that subsequently took place on America's farms.</p>
            <p>Garst received brief national attention in 1958 when Nikita Khrushchev visited his farm. His
                    subsequent role as an advisor to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName> on agricultural matters was unique. Garst, a capitalist entrepreneur seeking to profit
                    from hybrid corn seed sales to the Soviets, nevertheless became a trusted friend of the Soviet
                    leader and an amateur diplomat working for peaceful relations between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>. Seemingly, both Garst and Khrushchev did not look upon the Soviet purchase of hybrid
                    seed corn as opening the door to American economic imperialism, since both countries benefited from
                    the ensuing trade relations. Garst gave freely of his knowledge to the Russians in an attempt to
                    upgrade their archaic and inefficient agricultural system. The grateful Khrushchev later wrote in
                    his memoirs: "I recognized Garst... [as] a human being whom I respected <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-081-1-093"/> for his energy, his knowledge, his willingness to share his expertise
                    and, so to speak, his trade secrets with others, even with us to put to use in our socialist
                    enterprises" (<hi rend="i">Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament</hi>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1974, p. 400).</p>
            <p>Although criticized by ecologists for his advocacy of chemical fertilizers, Garst was always on the
                    lookout for ways to increase the production of food at home and in underdeveloped countries. He was
                    forever the salesman of scientific agriculture and the preacher of peace through agricultural
                    abundance. He lectured Khrushchev on the need for the Soviets to turn military armaments into
                    peaceful plowshares and was saddened by such Cold War events as the Soviet suppression of the

            <p>Garst was one of those rare individuals who, though generally not known among the general populace,
                    did influence the course of agricultural history. Many who enjoy the bountiful cornucopia of

            <p>Inspired by the success of nationally circulated black newspapers such as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Defender</hi>, Claude Barnett launched Associated Negro Press (19191, a black analog of
                    Associated Press and United Press International. For forty-five years ANPs small staff reliably
                    distributed a large quantity of well-written news and feature stories to member newspapers. Relying
                    heavily upon volunteers and poorly paid stringers, ANP covered black civic life and leadership,
                    national politics and government, black entertainment and sports, and developments in Africa,
                    Europe, and the Caribbean.</p>
            <p>Barnett dreamed of having a large, full-time, salaried staff with bureaus in major cities. He hoped
                    to add comics, editorial cartoons, photographs, and a pictorial magazine to his news and feature
                    service. Moreover, Barnett sought a reciprocal relationship with member newspapers in which they
                    would send news to ANP, thus shaping the wire service to their needs. None of this came to be.
                    Afraid of aiding competing papers, Barnett's clients did not accept reciprocity and
                    therefore never strongly identified <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-081-1-094"/> with ANP. Black publishers
                    not only refused to fund expanded staff and services but delayed or omitted paying basic ANP fees.
                    Accordingly, Barnett turned to the Republican party and private foundations to finance his agency.
                    Political money and Barnett's own partisan activity compromised his goal of news
                    objectivity and further weakened client loyalty, as editors reasoned that ANP could survive without
                    them. Thus, ANP remained Barnett's personal enterprise instead of representing black
                    journalism as a whole.</p>
            <p>By discussing these problems and describing ANP's operations, Lawrence D. Hogan adds to
                    knowledge of the golden age of black journalism. Had Hogan also examined ANP from its
                    clients' perspective, readers might have learned more of what ANP meant to its subscribers
                    and whether its members' stubborn individualism was indeed the main reason for their weak
                    support of ANP. After all, black newspapers cooperated to form a rival news service during World War
                    II. Perhaps Barnett's emphasis on "constructive news" was less appealing
                    to readers than the sensationalism he shunned. Hogan does not always critically probe
                    Barnett's motives, stressing his dedication to ANP but also mentioning action to the
                    contrary (Barnett's attempt to buy the <hi rend="i">Defender</hi> and his accepting a
                    federal job). One also wishes that Hogan had written a full-length chapter covering 1945 to 1964;
                    his five-page sketch of that period suggests that 1945 was neither the end of ANP nor the most
                    appropriate termination point for this study. Finally, this book suffers from inadequate editing,
                    leaving such lapses as an awkwardly arranged bibliography and a half-dozen misspelled andlor
                    incorrect names (pp. 25, 97, 125, 131, 240, 250).</p>

               <hi rend="i">Schools in Cities</hi> is the finest collection of essays on urban educational history
                    available. Virtually all of its nine research-based and two conceptual essays could have been
                    published independently in scholarly journals. Goodenow and Ravitch obviously convened an exciting
                    conference, since the essays placed in this volume represent some of the most sophisticated,
                    imaginatively conceived, and effectively executed work in urban educational history currently

            <p>Several of the essays offer provocative glimpses into forthcoming influential books on the late
                    nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, notably Joel Perlmann's study of educational
                    attainment and occupational mobility in <placeName>

            <p>The contributions of Perlmann and Peterson to ongoing methodological and ideological controversies
                    raging within the field of educational history, manifested in their careful quantitative research
                    designs and admirable sensitivity to the competing interests that have shaped the development of
                    schools (particularly the impact of teachers, parents, and children themselves), are also
                    characteristic of the other essays included in the volume. David Angus, for example, contrasts the
                    relatively weak role that political and ideological interests played in the establishment of common
                    schools in frontier <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the more clearly drawn divisions in the eastern states in the 1840s. His careful
                    political study, which advances understanding of the importance of
                    "ethnoreligious" interests in shaping antebellum schooling, demonstrates the value
                    of shifting attention from communities in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the Middle Atlantic states toward the Midwest. David Ringel's study of
                    industrial education in Fitchburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, clarifies the way in which schools can be "misused" by students and
                    their parents. His fascinating longitudinal reconstruction of the school's graduates hints
                    at the process through which ambitious boys could exploit a program designed to prepare machinists
                    by becoming engineers, a pattern common at many early manual training schools.</p>
            <p>All of the remaining essays display considerable sympathy for the plight of children who are outside
                    the educational mainstream or who attended school in smaller cities, many outside the hinterland of
                    the major urban centers, communities too often neglected by historians. David Ment, Charles E.

            <p>Maris Vinovskis and Barbara Finkelstein critique the research-based essays by challenging educational
                    historians to develop better sampling techniques, more appropriate comparative examples, and
                    sensitivity toward the distinction between cities and "communities," which would
                    undoubtedly demand detailed neighborhood-focused research designs. Despite these shortcomings, this
                    collection represents first-rate case study research. All of the authors are successful in their
                    ambitious efforts to articulate and elaborate complicated and timely historical themes.</p>

            <p>This slim monograph makes a significant contribution to the growing field of old-age history. It
                    studies the nineteenth century roots of modern institutions for the elderly. It explains clearly how
                    the idea of separating the old from society came to be viewed as a positive good.</p>
            <p>Carole Haber, like most historians of aging, begins by challenging David Hackett Fischer's
                    idea that colonial America was a gerontocracy. She deftly depicts the nature of patriarchal power
                    and the limits of the aged's authority and respect. In this period the helpless old were
                    cared for no differently than other indigents. Increasingly in the nineteenth century, however, the
                    elderly were viewed and treated differently. Haber traces the evolution of this
                    "classification of superannuation," the process of drawing a line between the
                    merely aging and the overaged and useless, among several professional
                    disciplines—medicine, charity work, social reform, and business.</p>
            <p>Two of six chapters are devoted to a cogent exploration of medical research and theories on the aging
                    process, research which by the end of the century culminated in the idea that aging itself was an
                    incurable disease. Thus, from the physician's viewpoint, the elderly became a special case,
                    immune to therapeutic intervention <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-081-1-097"/> Since the
                    physician's influence on American society, especially in the antebellum period, is
                    debatable, Haber's heavy emphasis on medical thought can also be questioned.</p>
            <p>The failure of the old to fit the therapeutic model of doctors was paralleled by their failure to fit
                    the therapeutic model of charity workers and the efficiency model of business. Haber shows how these
                    professionals all independently contributed to rationales for segregating the elderly. The relations
                    and interactions among these various professions should be explored. (Did leading charity workers
                    understand the implications of medical theories on aging? Were they influenced by them?) The end
                    result was that, by the twentieth century, the physical weakness and economic distress of a minority
                    of the elderly had come to be viewed as the norm; and institutional and bureaucratic responses to
                    this assumed norm would lead to further stereotyping and greater isolation of the aged.</p>
            <p>Haber frequently refers to urbanization and industrialization as transforming the elderly's
                    place in society. She provides an exemplary model of specific linkage between urban-industrial
                    growth and the changing position of the elderly in her discussion of mandatory retirement. More such
                    careful, delineated connections are needed.</p>
            <p>By studying the roots of professionally dominated modern care for the elderly, Haber avoids retracing
                    the declension thesis set forth by Fischer and modified by W. Andrew Achenbaum. Her perspective is a
                    welcome, thought-provoking addition to the literature for both historians and gerontologists.</p>
