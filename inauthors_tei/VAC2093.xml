				<div2 type="chapter">
					<head rend="center">VOCATIONAL CIVICS</head>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> state of Indiana is a great, modern civic forum. Every community
						offers a complete setting for the study and practice of vocational civics.</p>
					<p>The primary purpose of a course in present-day civics is to enable the student to
						acquaint himself with the civic life of which he is a part. The object of the course is
						not attained unless it creates and cultivates in the young citizen the civic sense of
						close relationship with everything about him that affects the public welfare. This
						cannot be accomplished by a perfunctory knowledge of official facts and legal details.
						Learning a catalog of public powers and forms from a textbook will in itself accomplish
						little or nothing. The facts will be forgotten and the lesson lost.</p>
					<p>Civic life in full significance is teeming around us as never before, and the student
						can come to understand functions of government directly by getting into touch with
						actual civic operations. He should become familiar with the powers and duties of offices
						by personal acquaintance with the officers and by witnessing the performance of duties
						in their actual setting. Thus he can see government in the functioning.</p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-010" n="8"/>
					<p>Functions may have widely different significance from forms and both forms and
						functions are constantly changing or developing, especially in such thrilling times as
						these in which we live. It is much better that the student actually get some first-hand
						understanding made vital through direct touch and through his own interested initiative
						than that he study and try to remember volumes of technical details.</p>
					<p>Having this in view, this supplement attempts to do no more than project some of the
						main phases and conditions touching governing functions. The text cannot possibly be an
						encyclopedia of civic knowledge. Compilations of fact and detail for which there is no
						space in the text can be obtained first hand in the most up-to-date, concrete and
						authoritative forms through official reports and documents without expense. The list of
						general references appended, consisting of official reports and bulletins, published
						mostly at the cost of the state for free distribution, can be made to repay the state
						richly by their use for research and investigation in civics classes. All these should
						be collected at the very beginning of the course and made easily available for all
						students. Some of these documents can be procured in such numbers as to offer copies to
						students individually.</p>
					<p>Every lesson in the course devoted particularly to Indiana civics should be a
						consideration and discussion of first-hand reports upon actual public
						work&mdash;government functioning&mdash;civics. Students should be taken into public
						offices and places of official action and public officers should be <pb id="VAC2093-011"
							n="9"/>brought to the civics class. Careful and complete plans should be made at the
						beginning of the course so that the whole direct program of vocational civics can be
						carried out during that part of the course covering Indiana civics.</p>
					<p>Students should be given special appointments for investigation far in advance, and a
						carefully arranged program of visits by the class and an even more carefully arranged
						and conducted program of visits to classes by public officers should be put into effect.
						The course can be so managed that public officers will feel the compliment of an
						invitation to meet with the civics class and will keenly appreciate the opportunity to
						further in this way their own official functions and perform an extraordinary public
						service by bringing their work into touch with forward-looking young citizens.</p>
					<p>It should be possible to have at least one state officer visit the class, and certainly
						it can be easily arranged to have several local officers. There is no better way to give
						a fair and accurate understanding of the workings of our system, as it is, than by
						having it explained directly by those who are responsible for operating the system.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, public-spirited citizens should be invited to meet with the class
						for the purpose of discussing proposed reforms of vital interest. In every community
						there are leading citizens who have taken a noteworthy position in the study or
						promotion of some one or more important proposals for fundamental civic reform. Let them
						be heard in the proper relation in the civics class. This will help in a primary <pb
							id="VAC2093-012" n="10"/>way to introduce the vocational idea into civics&mdash;the
						laboratory method.</p>
					<p>It will be possible, except in cases of schools in the most distant parts of the state,
						to have the entire class visit the state house. This will be of especial interest when
						the legislature is in session. There should be many visits to the courthouse and city
						hall, calling at all offices, attending court and meetings of the council. Where the
						class cannot go as a body, individual students may be assigned to make special
						investigation and report.</p>
					<p>The lethargy due to textbook limitations must be completely overcome in the vital
						spirit of civic life cultivated and practiced.</p>
					<p>The state constitution should be studied thoroughly in its application to forms and
						functions. Every assignment should include some specific part of the organic law for
						basic civic consideration.</p>
					<p>More important than all else, the students should have some direct part in promoting
						and helping to accomplish some needed local civic improvement&mdash;the repair of a
						bridge or sewer, beautifying a public site, the clearing of an alley, the restoration of
						a street light, or some like activity. Direct participation, through the official course
						of procedure, in such concrete civic work will be a genuine lesson in vocational
						civics.</p>

					<head rend="center">CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY</head>
					<note type="margin">Beginning of statehood</note>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> first constitutional convention in Indiana met at Corydon, the
						territorial capital, on June 10, 1816. It continued in session, meeting from day to day,
						until the 29th of June, completing its work in nineteen days. The convention was made up
						of forty-three delegates representing the thirteen counties of the state. These
						delegates were typical frontiersmen, possessing little education but much common sense.
						They did not attempt in this short time to create a constitution <hi rend="i">de
							novo</hi>. (Reed, Chapter II.) It is apparent that they modeled their work very
						closely after the Kentucky constitution, which was adopted in 1792, and the Ohio
						constitution of 1803. The constitution went into effect automatically without being
						submitted to the people.</p>
					<note type="margin">Method of revision</note>
					<p>The constitution contained no provision for separate amendment, but required that a
						vote be taken every twelfth year on the question of calling a convention to revise,
						amend or change the constitution.</p>
					<p>This provision made imperative the taking of a vote on the question every twelve years,
						but did not prevent the submission of the question at any period of less than twelve
						years.</p>
					<p>Votes were taken under this provision in 1823, 1828, 1840, 1846 and 1849. The vote in
						1849 resulted in a majority favorable to holding a <pb id="VAC2093-014" n="12"
						/>convention, thus authorizing the convention which wrote our present constitution.</p>
					<note type="margin">Some criticisms of the constitution of 1816</note>
					<p>Some of the principal grounds of public criticism of the old constitution were based
						upon legislative interference in local affairs, annual sessions of the legislature, the
						lack of provision for amendment, and the antiquated provisions of the civil and criminal
						code. The greatest single objection, perhaps, was the lack of local self-government,
						which resulted in making nearly all the work of the legislature purely local in
						character. According to this constitution legislative enactment was necessary in order
						to accomplish such trivial matters as vacating streets or alleys in towns and small
						villages. Divorces were even granted by special bills. The session of 1845-46 dissolved
						no less than forty matrimonial alliances.</p>
					<note type="margin">Convention of 1850-51</note>
					<p>The second constitutional convention met in the hall of representatives in the old
						state capitol in Indianapolis on October 7, 1850. It continued to meet from day to day
						until February 10, 1851, having been in session 127 days. The convention consisted of
						150 men who were highly representative of all walks of life, and of all phases of
						political and social experience. They entered into the work of revising the constitution
						with great seriousness and submitted their product to popular vote. (Reed, Chapter IX.)
						The new constitution was adopted in the regular election of August 4, 1851, and by its
						own provision went into operation on November 1, 1851.</p>
					<note type="margin">Amending the constitution</note>
					<p>This constitution, unlike the constitution of 1816, contains no provision for calling a
						convention. It provides a method of amendment <pb id="VAC2093-015" n="13"/>embodying
						three main features: first, the requirement that the proposed amendment must pass two
						successive legislatures in exactly the same form by a majority of each house before it
						can come before the people; second, the requirement that on submission of the amendment
						to the electors of the state, a majority of said electors must ratify it before it can
						become a part of the constitution; and third, the provision that while any amendment or
						amendments shall be awaiting action of a succeeding general assembly or of the electors,
						no additional amendment or amendments shall be proposed. (Constitution, Art. XVI.)
						Experience has proved this to be a very difficult process. By recourse to special
						elections, the constitution has been twice amended&mdash;one section in 1873 and nine
						sections in 1881.</p>
					<p>Since 1881 no less than 184 separate and distinct attempts to amend the constitution,
						including 447 proposals, have been made without success. During this time only two
						proposed amendments have ever been submitted to the people. These were the so-called
						"Lawyers' Amendment," proposing to authorize the fixing of qualifications for lawyers,
						and the amendment proposing to increase the membership of the supreme court. The
						"Lawyers' Amendment" was submitted in the regular elections of 1900, 1906, and 1910, and

						electors of the state. The supreme court amendment was submitted November 6, 1900;
						314,710 "yes" votes and 178,060 "no" votes were <pb id="VAC2093-016" n="14"/>cast. It

					<note type="margin">Demands for revision</note>
					<p>Demands for constitutional changes have been voiced by platform declarations of
						political parties, by resolutions of civic organizations, and by official
						recommendations.</p>
					<p>Governor Marshall said in 1912: <q rend="blockquote"><p>The people of Indiana are bound
								down under a fundamental law which they have no means of amending by so much as a
								punctuation mark. . . . Now, a constitution is sacred to me. But the rights of the
								people are more sacred. A constitution has got to be workable, and when one fails to
								work&mdash;why, then it's time to get another.</p></q></p>
					<p>Governor Ralston in his inaugural address in 1913 and likewise in his farewell address
						in 1917 recommended the holding of a convention for the purpose of writing a new
						constitution, declaring that the present constitution had been outgrown through
						intellectual, social and material progress. He said: <q rend="blockquote"><p>New
								questions have arisen that cannot be solved under the present instrument, and new
								conditions make it necessary for the people to assert rights they cannot exercise
								thereunder.</p></q></p>
					<p>Governor Goodrich, in his first message to the legislature of 1917, urged the calling
						of a constitutional convention, declaring that: <q rend="blockquote"><p>Since 1851,
								state government has become so complex that many of the provisions of the
								constitution which were in point sixty years ago no longer cover our present
								conditions of society. . . . The public interest requires that there be no further
								delay in changing the constitution so that we may meet squarely the important
								problems which confront us at this time. I believe, as a matter of fact, that these
								changes can be accomplished more satisfactorily through a constitutional convention
								than through any other method.</p></q></p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-017" n="15"/>
					<p>There has been much valuable civic and educational study and discussion upon proposed
						constitutional changes covering problems of city government, taxation, suffrage reform,
						short ballot, budget system, initiative and referendum, recall, labor reform and social
						justice, together with many fundamental proposals of judicial and educational reform.
						The liquor problem has also been intimately involved in all considerations of
						constitutional revision.</p>
					<note type="margin">Proposed constitution of 1911</note>
					<p>The failure of repeated attempts to amend and the demand for revision along many
						separate lines has resulted in much agitation for a new constitution. The legislature of
						1911 prepared a so-called new constitution popularly known as the "Marshall
						Constitution." It was a general copy of the present constitution, with some twenty-three
						specific changes. (Acts 1911, page 205.) The legislature proceeded on the theory that it
						was unnecessary to follow the formality of holding a constitutional convention or of
						undergoing the delay of amendment and "enacted" the constitution in exactly the same
						manner that statutory laws are enacted. The supreme court in the case of Ellingham <hi
							rend="i">vs</hi>. Dye (178 Indiana 336) annulled the proposed constitution, holding in
						effect that the legislature is without authority to frame a constitution <hi rend="i">in
							toto</hi> and that its power in the matter of proceeding to revise the constitution is
						contained in the amendment provision. The Supreme Court of the United States in the case
						of Marshall et al. <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. Dye (58 U. S. Sup. Ct. Reports, Law Edition
						206) sustained in effect the state supreme court, holding that the case <pb
							id="VAC2093-018" n="16"/>involved no federal question and that therefore the federal
						court was without jurisdiction.</p>
					<note type="margin">Attempts to call convention</note>
					<p>Following the decision of the supreme court on the proposed new constitution, the
						legislature of 1913 proposed twenty-two separate amendments embodying substantially the
						changes included in the constitution "enacted" by the legislature of 1911. At the same
						time the legislature provided for a vote at the general election of 1914 upon the
						question of calling a constitutional convention in the year 1915. (Acts 1913, page 812.)
						The vote was negative. The legislature of 1915 killed the twenty-two proposals to
						amend.</p>
					<p>The legislature of 1917 passed an act calling a constitutional convention, providing
						for the election of delegates and the assembling of the convention. (Acts 1917, page 5.)
						By the terms of this act, 115 delegates should have been elected at a special election
						on the third Tuesday in September, 1917&mdash;100 from the representative districts of
						the state and 15 from the state at large. The delegates so elected were to assemble in
						convention at the capitol on January 2, 1918, for the purpose of revising the
						constitution of the state of Indiana and of submitting the new constitution proposed by
						them to the voters for ratification or rejection. This act was held unconstitutional by
						the supreme court of Indiana on July 13, 1917, in the case of Bennett <hi rend="i"
							>vs</hi>. Jackson, Secretary of State, et al., 116 Northeastern Reporter 921. The
						decision in this case positively affirmed the right of the supreme court to determine
						the constitutionality of any act of the legislature, holding that the legislature's
						powers are not inherent but <pb id="VAC2093-019" n="17"/>derived solely from the
						constitution, and that the legislature is without authority to call a convention in view
						of the negative expression of the people in the referendum on the question in 1914. The
						court said: <q rend="blockquote"><p>We are of the opinion that the will of the people as
								expressed in the election of 1914 is as binding on the general assembly as a
								positive provision of the constitution could be, and hence the action of the
								legislature in calling a constitutional convention, as provided for in Chapter II,
								page 5, of the Acts of 1917, is null and void, being in conflict with Section I of
								the bill of rights, taking from the people the right to say when they desire a
								change in their fundamental law.</p></q></p>
					<p>It is therefore established now that the power to call a constitutional convention
						resides solely in the people through an affirmative vote on a referendum submitted to
						them by the legislature.</p>

					<head rend="center">SUFFRAGE AND ELECTIONS</head>
					<note type="margin">Qualifications for voters</note>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">UFFRAGE</hi> in Indiana is qualified by sex, age, residence,
						registration and, in the case of unnaturalized aliens, declaration of citizenship
						intentions. (Const., Art. II, Sec. 2.) Only males over the age of twenty-one may vote.
						The residence requirement of all voters is six months in the state, sixty days in the
						township and thirty days in the ward or precinct immediately preceding the election.
						Voters of foreign birth must have resided in the United States one year and have taken
						out "first papers." All voters must be duly registered according to law. None who lack
						these qualifications may vote. The legislature can neither extend the suffrage to others
						nor deny it to any so qualified except those convicted of infamous crime. (Reed, Chapter
						IX.)</p>
					<note type="margin">Woman's suffrage</note>
					<p>The legislature of 1917 passed a partial or limited suffrage act which granted women
						the right to vote for presidential electors, members of congress, all non-constitutional
						state and local officers and in all non-constitutional elections. (Acts 1917, page 73.)
						This act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Indiana, October 29,
						1917, in the case of Board of Election Commissioners of the City of Indianapolis et al.
							<hi rend="i">vs</hi>. Knight, 117 Northeastern Reporter 565.</p>
					<p>This decision completely interpreted the suffrage provisions of the constitution. The
						court held that: <q rend="blockquote"><p>The right of suffrage is not inherent or
								natural, and is held only by those upon whom it is bestowed by express
								constitutional grant or authorized legislative provision.</p></q></p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-022" n="20"/>
					<p>The court also said: <q rend="blockquote"><p>The legislature has no general power to
								confer the elective franchise upon classes other than those to whom it is given by
								the constitution, since this description of those who are entitled to vote is
								regarded as excluding all others.</p></q></p>
					<p>It follows from this decision that no measure of suffrage can be extended to women in
						Indiana except through revision or amendment of the constitution or through provision of
						the federal constitution.</p>
					<note type="margin">Alien suffrage</note>
					<p>When the constitution of 1851 was written, it was deemed advisable to extend the
						suffrage to unnaturalized aliens, to the end, as reported by the convention, that
						home-building foreigners might be encouraged to come to Indiana and help settle our
						unpopulated farm lands. Under this provision aliens who come to Indiana take out their
						declaration papers after a year's residence, or rather permit their papers to be taken
						out for them. Then they vote, or, as is too often true, are voted, in all elections,
						regardless of bona fide intention to become citizens. It takes but one year to make the
						alien a voter in Indiana, whereas it takes five years to make him a naturalized citizen
						of the United States. The abuse of this liberal provision is illustrated by the
						following figures for declaration and naturalization: <table rend="center">

					<p>For the full period of ten years from 1908 to 1917, inclusive, the total number of
						declarations was 36,621 and the total number naturalized was 4,857. <pb id="VAC2093-023"
							n="21"/>It is, indeed, anomalous that thousands of men who have been voting in Indiana
						for the past generation are being compelled to register as alien enemies.</p>
					<p>We have voters who are not citizens and citizens who are not voters.</p>
					<note type="margin">Registration</note>
					<p>All persons entitled to vote must register before they can exercise the right of
						franchise. The registration law applies alike to all electors in cities, towns and rural
						communities. It is very difficult to procure a complete registration and equally
						difficult to get out the full vote after registration. In 1912, 745,638 voters were
						registered and 654,474 votes were cast. In 1914, the registration was 725,423 and the
						total vote 646,059. In 1916, 811,405 voters registered and 718,848 voted. Taking 1914 as
						a typical election, there were 725,423 voters registered and 646,059 votes cast out of
						792,625 qualified voters, according to the enumeration of 1913. This means that 67,202
						qualified voters failed or refused to register and 69,474 registered voters failed to
						vote, making a total of 146,546 delinquent electors. It is to be regretted that in most
						instances the delinquent electors include those who are prevented from voting by a
						temporary absence from the precinct in which they reside. Again, it is regrettably true
						that the failure to vote is due to a lack of interest in politics. The alien and
						"floating" vote seldom fails to make itself a factor in the election.</p>
					<p>The legislature of 1917 passed an absent voters' law (Acts 1917, page 317) providing a
						method of voting by qualified voters who are unavoidably absent on election day.</p>
					<note type="margin">Elections</note>
					<p>All general elections in Indiana for the state, county, township, city and nation are
						held on the <pb id="VAC2093-024" n="22"/>first Tuesday after the first Monday in
						November. City elections are held every four years in odd years: 1913, 1917, etc.
						Regular elections for the election of state and local officers, members of congress,
						etc., are held every two years in the even years.</p>
					<p>Primary elections for the nomination of candidates of all political parties which cast
						ten per cent or more of the total vote are held on the first Tuesday after the first
						Monday in May each year preceding every election. The primary law is general and
						compulsory, covering all elective officers other than presidential electors and officers
						voted for by all electors of the state. Thus it includes all elective offices of the
						county, township, city and town, members of congress and the state legislature. The
						primary election law also provides for the establishment of party machinery through the
						selection of the precinct committeemen for each precinct and party delegates to the
						state convention. The precinct committeemen elect the county chairman. The county
						chairmen of each congressional district elect the party district chairman and the
						district chairmen of the state make up the state committee.</p>
					<p>Voting by secret ballot under the Australian ballot system prevails and the use of
						voting machines is becoming quite common.</p>
					<note type="margin">Corruption in elections</note>
					<p>Corrupt practices in elections, especially in our large cities, have been brought
						vividly to light in recent years. Notable punishments have been inflicted in the federal
						court upon city and county officers in certain of our cities. The characteristic
						features of the corruption in these elections were the soulless domination of partisan
						machines, the blind obedience of party workers to sinister <pb id="VAC2093-025" n="23"
						/>influences, the activity of the saloon and brewery and the purchasability of the
						floating vote, particularly unnaturalized aliens. The successful prosecutions in the
						federal court appear to be having a tremendously deterrent influence and have helped to
						bring about an awakening on the part of good citizens from which much better results may
						be expected. The passing of the liquor power from politics will tend to relieve
						political life of some of its worst evils.</p>
					<note type="margin">The long ballot</note>
					<p>What is known as the "long ballot" prevails to a very high degree in Indiana, both in
						state and local government, and this multiplicity of elective offices is coming to be
						generally recognized as the "jungle" of bad politics. (Reed, pages 106-107.)</p>
					<p>The voters of Center township, Marion county, Indiana, in the general election of 1914,

					<p>All told, we elect some fifty or more officers at every biennial election. Our sample
						ballot is usually over six feet long and contains over two hundred names.</p>
					<p>Under this system of voting for so many offices, both important and unimportant, even
						intelligent and wide-awake voters are compelled in every election, if they vote at all,
						to make a choice among candidates with whom they have no acquaintance and of whose
						qualifications they can not have adequate information. This necessarily brings about
						such political confusion as could hardly result otherwise than in irresponsible and
						uncertain voting&mdash;the ideal opportunity for political bosses and party
						machines.</p>
					<p>The application of the "short ballot" in Indiana to state elections would probably
						leave for popular election only the governor and the lieutenant governor and possibly
						the auditor. Other officers would be appointed upon merit. In the county, the short <pb
							id="VAC2093-027" n="25"/>ballot would provide for the election of the board of county
						commissioners or county council with large appointive powers, operating under a merit
						system.</p>
					<p>There is already a tendency toward the short ballot in our city elections and it may be
						expected that this movement will become much stronger. The principle of the short ballot
						is that only a few offices should be filled by election at one time and that only those
						offices shall be elective which are important enough to attract (and deserve) public
						examination.</p>
					<note type="margin">Conclusion</note>
					<p>It is quite evident that the right to vote is not in conclusion itself a complete
						guarantee of the proper exercise of popular power. The ultimate meaning of this
						fundamental right must depend upon the laws governing its qualifications and the manner
						of its exercise. Certainly more discrimination can be exercised in granting this
						privilege, so that all desirable classes of citizens may be included and that at least
						some clearly undesirable classes may be excluded. Every safeguard must be exercised to
						prevent fraudulent voting and to guarantee an honest count.</p>
					<p>Every step toward greater simplification of the ballot will tend to make voting more
						effective and diminish corruption in the conduct of elections. Most important of all is
						the need of a general awakening on the part of well-meaning citizens to a vital
						appreciation of the public benefits depending upon the proper exercise of the franchise.
						This will come from better civic education and can be greatly encouraged by an improved
						elective system.</p>

					</epigraph>
					<note type="margin">Education as a function of government</note>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> statement by William L. Bryan, President of Indiana University,
						in his inaugural address in 1902, expresses the ideal of public education.</p>
					<p>There is no more important function of government in Indiana than to provide the means
						of carrying out this "mission of democracy." Since the establishment of the principle of
						tax-supported free schools in Indiana, in 1848, the public school system has constantly
						grown and developed, ranging now from kindergarten to university. It can not be doubted
						that faith in education is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. This faith is
						finding constantly greater and clearer expression in our educational activities. (Reed,
						Chapter XXXI.)</p>
					<note type="margin">Magnitude of system</note>
					<p>What institution have we of greater magnitude? The public school enrollment in Indiana
						for the year 1916-17 was 567,962. This included 847 high schools, of which 573 were
						commissioned high schools, 113 certified high schools and 161 <pb id="VAC2093-030"
							n="28"/>accredited and unclassified high schools. The teachers numbered 19,876. The
						value of public school plants exclusive of higher institutions of learning was estimated
						at $62,051,536. During the school year of 1916-17, 173 new schoolhouses were erected,
						valued at $3,346,461. Our annual school revenues amount to over $17,000,000. The common
						and congressional school fund totaled in 1917 over $12,000,000. (Const., Art. VIII, Sec.
						2.) These permanent funds are constantly augmented by state tax levies and special
						school revenues which the trustees have power to levy. Local school funds, in addition,
						are derived from licenses, fees and special taxes. A state deficiency fund is maintained
						for the poorer counties in order to keep up a sufficient length of term. The purpose of
						this fund is to offer reasonable educational opportunity to all portions of the state
						and to all the people.</p>
					<p>The average cost per high school pupil for the year 1916-17 was $58.44. The
						administration of educational finances is complex and results can not be fully
						estimated. This is our principal investment in democracy.</p>
					<note type="margin">State superintendent</note>
					<p>The state superintendent of public instruction is the official head of the public
						school system of the state. He is elected by popular vote and serves for a term of two
						years. The length of term and manner of election are provided by the constitution and
						can not be changed by legislation.</p>
					<p>An enumeration of the duties of the state superintendent would be a report upon the
						conduct of our whole scheme of public education. He has the general superintendence of
						all work relating to the schools of the state. The duties of the office increase <pb
							id="VAC2093-031" n="29"/>with opportunity and necessity. For example, the war service
						program more than doubled the work of this office. This department is constantly growing
						in influence and importance. It has a regular working force of no less than eighteen
						members, including the following chief assistants: <list type="simple">
							<item>Assistant superintendent</item>
							<item>Deputy state superintendent</item>
							<item>Director of vocational education</item>
							<item>State high school inspector</item>
							<item>Assistant in home economics</item>
							<item>Assistant in agriculture</item>
							<item>Chief manuscript clerk</item>
							<item>Clerk of the state board of education</item>
							<item>Clerk of the teachers' retirement fund</item>
						</list> The superintendent is president of the state board of education.</p>
					<note type="margin">State board of education</note>
					<p>The state board of education consists of thirteen members, seven of whom are members
						ex-officio and six appointive. The ex-officio members are the state superintendent, the
						presidents of Purdue University and Indiana University and the State Normal School, and
						the city superintendents of Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Evansville. There are six other
						members appointed by the governor for a term of four years. Three of these must be
						citizens who have been engaged in educational work in the state, at least one of whom
						must be a county superintendent of schools. The other three must be persons who are
						actively interested in and of known sympathy with vocational education, one of whom
						shall be a representative of employees and one of employers.</p>
					<p>The board has general control of the entire system of examining and licensing teachers,
						preparing <pb id="VAC2093-032" n="30"/>questions and fixing standards, adopting
						textbooks and establishing courses of study. It controls our educational policies and
						initiates most of the school legislation. The influence of this body is constantly being
						developed to the use of every possible means of bettering the educational work of the
						state.</p>
					<note type="margin">County superintendent</note>
					<p>The county superintendent is elected by the township trustees of each county for a term
						of four years. He must have been actually engaged in school work for a period of not
						less than two years out of the ten next preceding his election and must hold at the time
						of his election a three years' license, a sixty months' license or a life or
						professional license. He has the general superintendence of the schools of his county,
						visiting schools, attending township institutes, conducting examinations for teachers'
						licenses and for common school diplomas, conducting county associations and institutes
						and determining controversies arising under the school law. It is his duty to carry out
						the orders and instructions of the state board of education and the state superintendent
						of public instruction and to labor in every practicable way to elevate the standards of
						teaching and improve the schools in his county. He has no direct control over city
						schools that have a duly appointed city superintendent.</p>
					<note type="margin">School trustees</note>
					<p>The township trustee is elected by the voters of the township for a term of four years
						and is not eligible for more than eight years in any period of twelve years. His powers
						and duties have been graphically summed up by the supreme court as follows: <q
							rend="blockquote"><p>The township trustee is clothed with almost autocratic power in
								all school matters. The voters of the <pb id="VAC2093-033" n="31"/>township have but
								little, if indeed any, voice or part in the control of educational affairs. So far
								as actual authority is concerned, the trustee is the corporation, although in
								contemplation of law it is otherwise. (Wallace <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. Johnson
								Township, 75 Ind. 368.)</p></q></p>
					<p>He has complete responsibility in the matter of selecting teachers, providing,
						maintaining and equipping school plants and, with the advisory board, determining the
						tax rate for educational purposes. The township trustees, together with the chairmen of
						the town and city school boards in the county, constitute the county board of education,
						which holds meetings every six months.</p>
					<p>In incorporated towns and cities of less than 50,000 inhabitants, the board of town
						trustees or city council selects the school trustees for the town or city for a term of
						three years. The board of school trustees consists of three members who have general
						control of the schools of the town or city similar to the control of the trustee in the
						township. For cities of 50,000, special laws have been passed fixing the number and
						establishing the manner of selection of trustees. In Indianapolis and Terre Haute the
						board consists of five members elected by the people.</p>
					<p>An encouraging movement is developing towards the selection of at least one woman on
						the board, and in several cities women are already serving in this important
						capacity.</p>
					<note type="margin">Teachers</note>
					<p>The all-important factor in the conduct of the Teachers public schools is the teacher.
						The qualifications, compensation and general conditions surrounding teachers have
						improved during recent years, although the improvement, especially in compensation, has
						been discouragingly slow. A continually <pb id="VAC2093-034" n="32"/>rising standard of
						qualifications prevails. Beginning teachers must have a high school education or its
						equivalent and must have taken a course in professional training of at least twelve
						weeks and must hold not less than a twelve months' license. The requirements as to
						professional training and license continue to rise with experience. A minimum wage law
						is tending to raise the compensation and establish more uniformity. Both scholarship and
						successful experience are emphasized. Professional interest in attending county
						institutes and other educational gatherings is also encouraged under this law. The
						rapidly growing activity and influence of educators in public affairs offers a most
						hopeful civic outlook in Indiana.</p>
					<note type="margin">Teachers' pensions</note>
					<p>A marked step in the application of a high form of social justice is found in teachers'
						retirement and pension laws, now well established in Indiana. After some special laws
						had been passed applying to some of the larger cities, a state teachers' pension law was
						enacted in 1915 providing for a teachers' retirement fund and for the payment of
						annuities after stated periods of service. The fund consists of a permanent fund coming
						from gifts and other miscellaneous sources of income and a current fund made up of
						interest on investments, assessments on teachers' salaries and apportionment of proceeds
						derived from the state school tuition fund.</p>
					<p>For the purpose of administering the pension and retirement fund, the state is divided
						into the following units: first, cities of 5,000 population or more; second, each public
						state normal; third, other state educational institutions; fourth, each county. It has
						often been proposed to make the entire state a <pb id="VAC2093-035" n="33"/>unit and
						this may be done in the near future. Any unit may come under the provisions of the law
						by petition of a majority of teachers and school officials. Teachers coming under the
						law are assessed according to their years of service. After thirty-five years of service
						a teacher is entitled to an annuity of from $600 to $700. When retired on account of
						disability, a teacher is entitled to receive an annuity ranging from $350 for
						twenty-five years of service to $575 for thirty-four years of service. The fund is
						controlled and managed by a board of trustees, consisting of the state superintendent,
						state auditor, attorney general and two other members appointed by the governor. The
						state treasurer is custodian of the fund.</p>
					<p>The more complete establishment of the pension law will add security and permanency to
						the profession.</p>
					<note type="margin">Consolidation of schools</note>
					<p>Indiana is in the front rank of the movement for the consolidation of rural schools and
						is known as the pioneer of consolidation in the Mississippi valley. More than 2,000
						one-room schools have been permanently closed in the state. There were in 1917, 706
						consolidated schools; 46,997 children were transported to these schools at a total
						township expense of over $900,000; 430 consolidated schools are of high school rank,
						employing four or more teachers. The consolidated movement is favored in Indiana by the
						township system of school organization, which vests large control and discretion in the
						township trustee. The compulsory education law, the compulsory closing of all schools
						with less than average daily attendance of twelve pupils and the compulsory
						transportation of pupils in consolidated <pb id="VAC2093-036" n="34"/>schools have aided
						this movement greatly. Consolidation tends to offer the poorest and most remote
						districts the same facilities of modern equipment and instruction enjoyed by the most
						populous and wealthy centers.</p>
					<note type="margin">Higher institutions of learning</note>
					<p>Indiana University, located at Bloomington, now has a college of liberal arts, a school
						of education, schools of law and medicine and a graduate school. The medical school is
						located at Indianapolis. In addition to its courses for resident students, Indiana
						University, by means of its extension department, places before all the citizens of the
						state an opportunity to pursue advanced study.</p>
					<p>Purdue University, located at Lafayette, is a technical, scientific and agricultural
						institution of high standing. It ranks among the foremost schools of America which offer
						technical training. A United States Government experiment station is located at Purdue;
						with this the university collaborates. The university is sustained, in part, by federal
						support.</p>
					<p>The State Normal, located at Terre Haute, is primarily a teachers' training school
						offering a four years' course leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. This was the
						first of the many Indiana schools devoted primarily to the training of teachers. Like
						the two state universities, the State Normal ranks among the foremost educational
						institutions of its kind in this country.</p>
					<p>In response to the ever increasing demands made upon teachers by the state educational
						organization, and in order more fully to present the opportunities of advanced training
						in methods of teaching, there has recently been organized a branch of the Indiana State
						Normal at Muncie. This school will co-ordinate with the school at Terre Haute.</p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-037" n="35"/>
					<p>These institutions are controlled by boards of trustees. The members are partly
						appointive by the governor and the state board of education and partly elective by
						alumni. These state institutions are maintained by a state educational institution fund
						raised by a special state tax levy. The general assembly also makes special
						appropriations for buildings and other extraordinary expenses.</p>
					<p>Denominational and private colleges and normal schools are accredited by the state
						board of education for the professional training of teachers.</p>
					<note type="margin">University extension</note>
					<p>A significant step in higher education is the rapid development and growth of
						university extension, the educational process of carrying the benefits of the university
						directly to the homes of the people. The function of extension work has come to be
						peculiarly that of public service. The character of the service depends upon the
						functions of the university and the demands of the people of the state.</p>
					<p>Purdue University directs its extension activities mainly to agricultural service by
						means of bulletins, demonstrations, short courses and institutes, thereby fulfilling the
						very important function of educating farmers and aiding them to develop agricultural
						resources of the state. The work is carried on partly by men sent out directly from the
						university and partly, in fact largely, through the county agricultural agents. Each
						agent serves as an organizer for his county. Bulletins are distributed and concrete
						investigations made in connection with conferences and institutes. Through the short
						courses the farmers of the community or district are enabled to receive advanced
						instruction on subjects relating directly to farm problems. These courses usually <pb
							id="VAC2093-038" n="36"/>last from two days to a week. The extension department of
						Purdue has very properly influenced the war aid movement toward larger food production,
						keeping ever awake to the particular needs of the day and directing campaigns of
						education to meet them.</p>
					<p>Indiana University has a well developed extension division conducting outside extension
						teaching and public welfare service. The teaching consists of class instruction,
						lectures and correspondence study. The welfare service is conducted along the line of
						organizing and directing institutes, surveys and conferences; collecting and lending
						package libraries, exhibits and lantern slides; compiling and publishing information in
						circulars and bulletins and giving co-operative assistance to clubs, civic societies and
						all community agencies. Extension centers are maintained at Indianapolis and Fort Wayne,
						where regular class work and accredited instruction are offered similar to that offered
						in residence. Instructors are furnished to classes elsewhere on application.</p>
					<p>Butler College carries on academic extension work in the city of Indianapolis among
						schools and clubs.</p>
					<p>Extension work is one of the newer departments of university activity and is serving
						the purpose of carrying the message of higher education directly into community life.
						The opportunities in this field of service are unlimited and the next few years will
						doubtless show tremendous development.</p>
					<note type="margin">Vocational education</note>
					<p>The establishment of vocational education is our most advanced step toward making
						education entirely democratic. Beginning with the Vocational Education Act of the
						legislature of Indiana in 1913, and continuing through co-operation with the <pb
							id="VAC2093-039" n="37"/>Smith-Hughes Act, passed by Congress in 1917, Indiana is
						making marked progress in the field of genuine vocational education. This form of
						education is directed purposefully and specifically toward equipping young people for
						the pursuit of some useful occupation. The home, the workshop, the farm and the
						commercial institution are no longer adequate to educate boys and girls up to standards
						required by modern conditions. This is now conceived to be the function of the schools,
						demanding special equipment and expert instruction. The school is following the youth
						into his work. The federal vocational act provides for allotment among the states an
						annual appropriation beginning at $500,000 in 1918 and increasing on a graduated
						schedule until in 1926 it shall have reached the sum of $3,000,000.</p>
					<p>Indiana has met all of the requirements for receiving the benefits of this act and has
						a state vocational department of three members, covering industry, agriculture and
						household arts. The work is classified as follows: <list type="ordered" rend="decimal">
							<item>Day and vocational courses in agriculture;</item>
							<item>Day part-time and evening courses in trades and industries;</item>
							<item>Part-time general continuation classes in civic and vocational subjects;</item>
							<item>Training courses for teachers of agriculture, trades and industry, and home
								economics subjects.</item>
						</list></p>
					<p>The state pays two-thirds of the sum expended for instruction in order to maintain
						approved vocational schools for agriculture, industry and domestic science. A special
						vocational levy is added to the state common school levy for the purpose of creating
						this fund.</p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-040" n="38"/>
					<note type="margin">War work in the schools</note>
					<p>A notable example of modern co-operation of the schools for the general welfare in
						concrete ways is seen in the war service activities now recognized as an essential part
						of the work of the schools. Immediately following the declaration of war by the United
						States Indiana educators began the task of mobilizing all educational forces. Teachers,
						students, and all persons connected with the public school system quickly enlisted in
						every civilian movement to further the winning of the war.</p>
					<p>A special part of this effort has been devoted to the intensive training of men and
						women for specialized service so that the state should not suffer from a dearth of
						experts in any needed lines. The schools have not only kept open for the pursuit of
						their normal educational purposes but have added greatly to their efforts. The State
						Board of Education formulated plans in connection with the State Council of Defense
						whereby the entire school system could be made a great reserve power.</p>
					<p>Higher institutions of learning have modified their courses and requirements to meet
						the war-time needs. Courses have been intensified to prepare young men quickly for
						enlistment in special government service. The extension departments of Purdue and
						Indiana Universities have devoted their strength without reserve to war aid work.
						Special provision has been made by Purdue University to train auto mechanics sent by the
						Government from the various camps.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the greatest educational function and service conducted through the schools in
						this connection is that of helping awaken our entire citizenship to an appreciation of
						the needs of the time. The <pb id="VAC2093-041" n="39"/>school system is the best medium
						through which information can be directed to the homes of the people. It offers "quick"
						wires of intelligence, reaching to every nook and corner of the commonwealth. In a
						democracy, people must have a clear understanding in order that they may act wisely. It
						is certainly a valuable by-product of the war that education has been vitalized into a
						more direct form of service to promote the general welfare.</p>

					<head rend="center">DEPARTMENTS AND ADMINISTRATION</head>
					<note type="margin">Distribution of powers</note>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> constitution (Art. III) distributes the powers of government
						among the legislative, executive (including administrative) and judicial departments,
						providing explicitly that no person charged with the official duties of one of the
						departments shall exercise any of the functions of another, except as expressly provided
						in the constitution. The distinction is clear in principle, but there is much
						overlapping in practice and functioning. This is especially marked between the
						legislative and judicial in the exercise by the courts of the power to annul any
						legislative act on the ground of unconstitutionality, though no such authority is
						expressed in the constitution. Recent and striking instances may be noted in the
						decisions upon the constitutional convention act and the suffrage act, passed by the
						legislature of 1917. Both were declared unconstitutional by the supreme court, and in
						both cases by a divided opinion of the court.</p>
					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">EXECUTIVE</head>
						<p>The office of governor is substantially the same in Indiana as in all the states.
							(Reed, Chapter X; Indiana Constitution, Art. V.)</p>
						<p>The lieutenant-governor is in effect the vice-governor. In case the office of the
							governor becomes vacant or the governor is unable to discharge the duties, the same
							shall devolve upon the <pb id="VAC2093-043" n="41"/>lieutenant-governor. The
							lieutenant-governor is president of the senate and has a right when in committee of
							the whole to vote on all subjects and to give a casting vote in case of a tie. It is a
							disputed question as to whether or not he can vote on the passage of bills and joint
							resolutions in any case. The senate was equally divided politically in the session of
							1917, but no test case of this question was allowed to arise.</p>
						<note type="margin">Executive powers</note>
						<p>It can not be said literally that the governor is, indeed, a chief executive in any
							such sense as in the case of the President of the United States. The constitution
							provides that he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, but in this
							respect he is entirely dependent upon the measure of power extended to him by the
							legislature. He can not, in fact, directly execute the laws, since he has no immediate
							authority over sheriffs and local police officers and he has no direct power over
							prosecutors in the performance of their duties. In cases of extreme necessity, he can
							call in the militia to execute laws, suppress insurrection or repel invasions, but
							occasions seldom arise for the exercise of this extraordinary authority. The governor
							is deprived of the actual benefits of a cabinet, since the chief administrative
							officers about him hold their positions on the independent basis of popular election.
							The attorney general is chosen in the same manner as the governor and is the chief
							legal representative of the state. He may act independently of the chief executive in
							many important functions.</p>
						<note type="margin">Administrative relations</note>
						<p>Although the executive department includes the administrative in the general
							divisions of power, a separate article of the constitution is devoted to <pb
								id="VAC2093-044" n="42"/>administrative officers. These officers are established in
							the constitution and made elective. The state administrative officers so named are
							secretary, auditor, and treasurer of state, all of whom hold office for two years and
							are not eligible to serve more than four years in any period of six years. (Reed,
							Chapter XIV.)</p>
						<p>The county officers similarly so established by the constitution are clerk of the
							circuit court, auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and surveyor. The clerk,
							auditor and recorder have four-year terms and are not eligible for more than eight
							years in any period of twelve years. The others have two-year terms and are not
							eligible for more than four years in any period of six years. Other state, county,
							town, and township officers not specifically named in the constitution are subject to
							election or appointment to office in such manner as the legislature may determine.
							(Reed, Chapter XVIII.)</p>
						<p>It thus appears that in administrative functions the duties and powers are divided
							among independent officers with whom the governor must work more upon the basis of
							equality than authority. The county is really an administrative unit of the state, but
							the functions are exercised by officers elected independently of state officers and of
							each other. The same is true in the township, thus establishing a degree of
							decentralization such as is not conducive to the strongest executive or administrative
							efficiency.</p>
						<note type="margin">Lack of harmony</note>
						<p>It is entirely possible of occurrence, and in fact has frequently occurred in
							Indiana, that the governor finds himself surrounded by officers adverse to <pb
								id="VAC2093-045" n="43"/>him politically or otherwise. This is especially possible
							in view of the somewhat uncertain political complexion of the state. A situation of
							this kind resulted from the election of 1908, causing Governor Marshall to exclaim
							that he was in "the governor's chair, surrounded by state officials politically
							opposed to him, like a rat in a trap." The fact that the political complexion of some
							of these offices, such as the secretary, auditor, treasurer and attorney general, may
							change during the governor's term, because of election every two years, further
							enhances the possibility of a lack of harmony and co-operation in the state house.</p>
						<note type="margin">The governor may demand publicity</note>
						<p>Perhaps the chief use of the governor's power over state administration resides in
							his authority to require information in writing from the officers of the
							administrative department upon any subjects relating to their respective offices. This
							is a part of his general power in transacting all necessary business with the officers
							of the government.</p>
						<note type="margin">Relation to legislature</note>
						<p>The governor, by official messages, gives information to the legislature from time to
							time, touching any condition of the state's affairs which he wishes to present to the
							law-making body. This is usually done by a formal and general message at the opening
							of the session, though numerous special messages may be given during the session. In
							these messages he recommends such action as to him seems expedient.</p>
						<note type="margin">Veto Power</note>
						<p>After a bill has passed the two houses it must be presented to the governor. With his
							approval and signature it becomes a law. If he vetoes the bill, it can only become a
							law by having again passed both houses by a majority vote of all members of <pb
								id="VAC2093-046" n="44"/>each house. If the governor does not return the bill within
							three days, Sundays excepted, it shall become a law without his signature. The
							"pocket" veto can be applied to all bills presented to the governor within two days of
							final adjournment. This may be, and often is, very effective, since it is customary
							for the legislature to pass a great many measures at the very close of the session.
							The governor can only approve or veto a bill as a whole. He can not discriminate as to
							individual parts of measures and is, therefore, divested of any real discrimination in
							final control of finances through legislative appropriation of public funds. The
							governor necessarily hesitates to veto an entire appropriation bill at the close of
							the session and so possibly require an extra session because of a few objectionable
							features of the measure. This makes possible the adoption of many bad provisions in
							the form of "riders" to appropriation bills. In the session of 1917 approximately
							$15,000,000 of appropriations were made in the last three days of the session. In
							these appropriation bills salaries were increased, new offices were created and some
							offices were abolished. This would hardly occur if the governor possessed the power to
							approve parts of a measure and disapprove special items or provisions. The governor
							may by proclamation call a special session of the legislature at any time when, in his
							opinion, the public welfare requires it. This is an extraordinary power of great
							importance, but is seldom used. The governor's chief source of power over legislation
							is usually found in his strength as party leader.</p>
						<pb id="VAC2093-047" n="45"/>
						<note type="margin">The budget system</note>
						<p>A plan popularly urged to give the governor actual responsibility and discrimination
							in financial affairs of the state is the establishment of the budget system. (Reed,
							page 486.) The present method of determining state needs through recommendation of a
							visiting committee of the legislature can hardly assure adequate and systematic
							investigation of all state needs. The recommendations may be adopted or reduced or
							greatly enlarged, or they may be changed altogether by the legislature. Special
							appropriations may be made entirely apart from the general plan. Under the
							circumstances the time and opportunity for careful consideration are limited, though
							it fortunately happens that there are usually "faithful guardians of the treasury" in
							every legislature. The budget plan proposes to substitute for general legislative
							responsibility a systematic control and a direct responsibility in the governor. It
							would authorize him to formulate, submit and defend before the legislature, if
							necessary, all financial measures. The complete budget of state needs would be
							submitted under executive direction. The budget might be reduced in one or more items,
							but could not be increased. The governor would be authorized to veto any one or more
							items of any appropriation bill.</p>
						<p>Without more centralization of responsibility it is very difficult indeed to have a
							systematic and economic control of state finances in view of the present enormous
							burden of state government. This situation of divided control led Governor Goodrich to
							state publicly at the close of the legislature of 1917, that "there is little the
							governor can do for <pb id="VAC2093-048" n="46"/>economy," and that "he is as helpless
							as a child" in some very important matters of state finance.</p>
						<note type="margin">Pardoning power</note>
						<p>The governor is vested with large power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons
							after conviction covering all offenses except treason and cases of impeachment. He can
							suspend execution for treason until the case is considered by the legislature. He has
							power to remit fines and forfeitures. This power, exercised in co-operation with the
							pardon board, constitutes the working basis of our reformative system in penal
							procedure. The tendency seems to be toward an ever broader exercise of executive
							clemency.</p>
						<note type="margin">Appointments</note>
						<p>Through the creation of large numbers of boards and commissions the appointive power
							of the governor is constantly increased. This power enables the governor to extend his
							control and influence in many special functions of administration, though it does not
							apply to much definite executive or administrative work. The principal powers thus
							exercised are of a supervisory nature, pertaining especially to state
							institutions.</p>
						<note type="margin">Military</note>
						<p>By virtue of the fact that he is commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces
							of the state, the governor is vested with authority of a military nature which in
							cases of emergency, and especially in times of war, offers a large measure of
							executive force and discretion. He appoints the adjutant, quartermaster and commissary
							generals, and is himself commander in charge of the state militia, consisting of all
							able-bodied white male persons between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, except
							such as may be specially exempted. Our war governors <pb id="VAC2093-049" n="47"/>have
							been able to use the military discretion vested in them with great efficiency.</p>
						<note type="margin">The spokesman of the people</note>
						<p>It is probably true that the governor's chief source of power is not the authority
							legally reposed in him by law, but in his influence and force as a public and popular
							representative. As the spokesman of the people of his commonwealth he may gain
							prestige and command such a following as may overcome all technical obstacles in the
							conduct of public policies.</p>
						<note type="margin">Short ballot</note>
						<p>The application of the short ballot to state affairs is being thoughtfully considered
							as a means of vesting needed responsibility and discretion in the governor in his
							executive capacity. This would probably vest such appointive powers in him as have
							always been vested in the President of the United States, leaving only the governor,
							lieutenant-governor and possibly the auditor of state, who is the check upon the
							governor, to be elected by popular vote. (Reed, page 108.)</p>
						<p>The extension of such additional power carries with it the suggestion of more direct
							recourse in the hands of the people through the recall. The short ballot idea is
							condemned on the one hand as undemocratic because it deprives the people of the
							privilege of voting for many of their officers. It is advocated on the ground that it
							really promotes greater democracy as well as efficiency in that it would make voting
							more responsible and effective through the simplification of elections and the
							complete fixing of responsibility. President Wilson has declared it to be "the key to
							the whole problem of the restoration of popular government in this country."</p>
						<pb id="VAC2093-050" n="48"/>
						<note type="margin">Local administration</note>
						<p>The conduct of business in counties and townships is almost entirely administrative
							in character and is carried out by these units as subdivisions of the state along the
							same general lines of state policy. It is simply a form of administrative
							self-government subject to general laws and policies. The only legislative powers
							vested in the county are reposed in the board of county commissioners. This board
							exercises some functions of all three departments of government. The same reasons for
							the application of the short ballot which might be urged in state government would
							apply also in county and township government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">LEGISLATIVE</head>
						<note type="margin">Membership of houses</note>
						<p>The legislative authority of the state is vested in the general assembly, consisting
							of the senate and house of representatives. These bodies now include the maximum
							membership allowed by the constitution&mdash;fifty in the senate and one hundred in
							the house. Senators are elected for four years, the term of one-half the members
							expiring every two years. No person is eligible to either house who is not a citizen
							of the United States and who has not been for two years next preceding his election an
							inhabitant of the state, and for one year of his county or district. The minimum age
							for senators is twenty-five years, and for representatives twenty-one years. There is
							no limit to the number of terms for which a member may be elected. No member of either
							house shall, during the term for which he may have been elected, be eligible to any
							office created by the session in which he serves. It is quite common for members to
							serve many terms in <pb id="VAC2093-051" n="49"/>succession. Members of the house are
							frequently elected later to serve in the senate. The membership of both houses usually
							represents all walks of life&mdash;lawyers and farmers predominating. (Reed, Chapter
							XI.)</p>
						<note type="margin">Length of session</note>
						<p>The legislature assembles in regular session on the first Thursday after the first
							Monday in January in every odd year. The fixed limit to the session is sixty-one days,
							including Sundays and holidays. It usually takes several days for the legislature to
							become thoroughly organized, and the inevitable result is that there is a tremendous
							rush in the closing days of every session. This limitation of sessions results in
							setting aside, in many important cases, the carefully planned rules of procedure which
							are intended to safeguard all steps in legislation. Instead of reading all bills by
							sections on three several days, the rules are often suspended by a two-thirds vote and
							numerous bills are passed with a rush during the last two or three days of the
							session. This tends to prevent the deliberation and thorough consideration
							contemplated in our system of representative government. (Reed, Chapter XII.)</p>
						<p>One of the suggested remedies for undue limitation of session is a divided session,
							having the first part devoted to the introduction of measures, after which a recess
							may be taken for the return of members to their constituents. The recess gives time
							for the study and discussion of these measures by the people as well as the
							representatives. After the recess, the legislature proceeds to final consideration and
							passage of needed measures.</p>
						<p>Another proposed plan is to remove all limitation <pb id="VAC2093-052" n="50"/>of
							session and fix an annual salary for legislators rather than payment on a per diem
							basis.</p>
						<p>There is comparatively little open and thorough discussion of measures in either
							house, excepting in the case of special proposals of most intense importance. The
							effective work is practically all done by hard-working committees which investigate
							and revise bills and report them for passage or block them completely.</p>
						<note type="margin">Bicameral system</note>
						<p>The two-house system that prevails in state legislation generally has always been in
							vogue in this state. It is an interesting question as to the actual effect of this
							dual plan whereby each house can check and support the other. The complaint is
							frequently heard that this system, instead of making a double safeguard, is doubly
							confusing in that each house passes the responsibility on to the other for final
							determination, developing methods of political manipulation tending to defeat
							deliberation and care instead of promoting careful consideration. The double system
							multiplies labor and expense and makes the question of limitation of session doubly
							serious. Whether or not the substitution of a single house with a smaller number of
							members would result in more representative government is a subject for thoughtful
							consideration.</p>
						<note type="margin">Representative government</note>
						<p>An all-important question of representative government is as to whether or not,
							through the legislature, the real wants and needs of the people are felt and
							considered. It must be recognized that this depends very largely upon the question as
							to whether or not party political organizations can be relied upon as being
							representative of the people, for the legislature is largely controlled by political
								<pb id="VAC2093-053" n="51"/>policies and platforms and is often subject to the
							direction of party leaders. In notable questions involving keen public sentiment, such
							as the liquor question, public influences do make themselves felt in legislative halls
							regardless of party organization. However, in the main course of legislation, the
							influences that are constantly felt are those of a specially organized nature that
							have means of reaching the legislature, whereas the general mass of the people do not.
							Anti-lobby regulations have been made to restrain the influence and possible evil of
							special interests as far as possible. The people have no direct method of reaching the
							legislature except by petitions which, having no compelling force behind them, are of
							questionable value unless backed by overwhelming sentiment. The individual member
							tries to reflect what he believes to be the prevailing sentiment of the people of his
							district, though it may happen, and frequently does happen, that his action is
							controlled by general state policy rather than local sentiment. (Reed, page 109.)</p>
						<note type="margin">Special legislation</note>
						<p>Perhaps the greatest single obstacle in the way of thorough representation of the
							people of the state is the growing tendency toward local and special legislation. The
							constitution provides (Art. IV, Sec. 22) careful and specific safeguards against this
							practice, embodying some seventeen enumerated cases of inhibitions of local or special
							laws. These were sufficient to avert the need of special legislation a half century
							ago and prove excellent safeguards in so far as they are applicable today. It is quite
							essential that the legislative body be permitted to deal only with matters of general
							state importance and to this end it is necessary that minor <pb id="VAC2093-054"
								n="52"/>local interests be attended to in local communities. The provisions against
							special legislation may be greatly strengthened by the extension of a larger measure
							of local initiative and local self-government in counties and cities. This will make
							way for far larger opportunity in the legislature to be thoroughly representative of
							all the people of the state.</p>
						<note type="margin">Representation in Congress</note>
						<p>Indiana is represented in the Congress of the United States by thirteen members in
							the Lower House and two senators, all elected by direct popular vote. The members of
							the Lower House are elected for two-year terms and those of the Senate for six years.
							The representatives are chosen by districts made of contiguous counties so as to form
							thirteen separate congressional districts. Marion county constitutes a single
							district.</p>

						<head rend="center">JUDICIAL</head>
						<note type="margin">Organization of courts</note>
						<p>The judicial power in Indiana is vested by the constitution in a supreme court, in
							circuit courts and in such other courts as may be established by the legislature. The
							development of the system has provided an appellate court for the state, superior
							courts for counties containing large cities, special probate, criminal and juvenile
							courts, city courts, mayors' courts and justice of the peace courts. (Reed, Chapter
							XIII.)</p>
						<p>The supreme court can have no more than five judges. When the great increase of
							appellate business, due to increase in population and enterprise of the state,
							rendered this number insufficient to perform all the duties of the highest court of
							appeals, the legislature, acting under its general power to <pb id="VAC2093-055"
								n="53"/>establish courts, created the appellate court of six members as an aid to
							the supreme court. Supreme judges serve for six years and appellate judges for four
							years. The judges of the supreme court are elected from districts. The state is
							divided into five sections for this purpose and one judge is elected from each
							district by all the electors of the state. The six members of the appellate court are
							elected similarly from two districts of the state, three from each district. Due to
							the practice of taking cases from the appellate court to the supreme court for review,
							it has resulted, in part at least, that the appellate court constitutes another link
							in the chain of procedure instead of being a positive addition to the supreme court.
							The cases passed upon by the appellate court are published in volumes separate from
							those passed upon by the supreme court. These reports are published by the supreme
							court reporter. Cases go both to the supreme and to the appellate court from the
							circuit courts, superior courts and other specially created courts. Cases involving
							the constitutionality of a law can be determined only by the supreme court. A majority
							of the members of the court form a quorum and a majority may render a decision. A
							great deal of the work of these courts of appeal consists in construing new statutes,
							determining their application and constitutionality.</p>
						<p>There are sixty-eight circuit courts in the state, one judge being elected from each
							circuit. In many cases the circuit is coterminous with the county. In some districts,
							several of the smaller and sparsely populated counties are combined to make one
							circuit. No county has more than one circuit judge. The judge is elected for a term of
							six years by the voters <pb id="VAC2093-056" n="54"/>of the circuit. This court has
							general original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases and has appellate
							jurisdiction from justice of the peace courts and city courts. The circuit court also
							has probate and juvenile jurisdiction, except in Marion county.</p>
						<p>The legislature has created superior courts in several counties containing large
							cities, where a single circuit court has been found insufficient. These now number
							seventeen. Five of these are in the city of Indianapolis. The judges are elected by
							the people of the county for a term of four years. The superior courts have
							jurisdiction almost identical with the circuit courts, being limited only in some
							special actions in which the circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
						<p>Other special courts created to take care of increasing litigation are a criminal
							court, probate court and juvenile court&mdash;all for Marion county.</p>
						<p>We have twenty-four special city courts in cities of the first, second, third and
							fourth classes. The judges are elected by the people of the cities for a term of four
							years and have exclusive jurisdiction of all violations of city ordinances and general
							jurisdiction similar to justices of the peace. In cities of the fifth class the mayor
							acts as judge of the city court, having jurisdiction similar to that of judges in the
							cities of the other classes and of justices of the peace.</p>
						<p>The constitution authorizes a "Competent" number of justices of the peace. We have in
							Indiana 1,260 of these courts with a constable acting for each court. The justice
							court has limited civil and criminal jurisdiction in township and county. Appeals are
							taken directly from the justice court to the <pb id="VAC2093-057" n="55"/>circuit or
							superior court. Jury trials are held in the justice courts, the jury consisting of six
							members. A questionable feature of our justice court practice is the retention of the
							old fee system&mdash;the compensation of officers depending upon conviction and
							collection of fees in criminal cases, the fees being assessed as part of the
							costs.</p>
						<p>A prosecuting attorney is elected for a term of two years by the voters of each
							judicial circuit. It is his duty to represent the state in the prosecution of all
							violations. He is compensated in part by fees.</p>
						<p>It is possible that a general reorganization of our system adapted to all the needs
							of the present day could result in reducing the number of courts and in bringing
							greater dispatch and economy in dispensing justice.</p>
						<note type="margin">Delay</note>
						<p>The Bill of Rights (Sec. 12) provides that "all courts shall be open; and every man,
							for injury done to him, in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by
							due course of law. Justice shall be administered freely and without purchase;
							completely and without denial; speedily and without delay." This expresses the ideal
							sentiment and practice which underlies our system of justice. The most general
							dissatisfaction with court procedure has been due to delay, resulting largely from
							technical forms of procedure and the chain of appeals. Cases frequently require many
							years for ultimate determination. It is true that delays may be in many cases an aid
							to the careful and thorough investigation and trial of a case and may result in more
							complete justice. On the other hand, it is also true that long-drawn-out delays
							operate in the long run against the poor, unprotected litigant, especially if <pb
								id="VAC2093-058" n="56"/>the other side of the case is of considerable power. With
							all possible delay excluded, every precaution should, of course, be maintained to
							guarantee a fair and thorough hearing, touching all wrongs and grievances for which
							public tribunal is required. The courts are tribunals of last resort and should not be
							burdened with minor complaints, which common sense and good citizenship can reconcile
							without public appeal. The development of greater civic sense among the people will
							tend to lessen the duties of the courts.</p>
						<note type="margin">The jury</note>
						<p>Although the tendency in much of our litigation, especially in civil cases, seems
							toward trial directly by the judge without a jury, this time-honored institution, the
							jury, still prevails in the Indiana judicial system. Two jury commissioners for the
							county, appointed by the judge of the circuit court, serve for one year and select
							from the names of all the voters of the county double the number needed for all the
							juries, grand and petit, for the year. The names are kept in the jury box by the clerk
							of the circuit court and the key deposited with that one of the commissioners who is
							of opposite political faith from the clerk. Names are drawn for the petit jury. These
							constitute the panel from which is selected jurors to sit in the trial of cases.
							Separate names are drawn for the grand jury. Juries in the circuit and superior courts
							consist of twelve men; in the justice court, of six men.</p>
						<p>A peculiar provision of the Indiana constitution gives jurors the authority to
							determine both the law and the facts in the trial of criminal cases. The practice
							which generally prevails limits the function of the jury to the determination of the
							facts. The <pb id="VAC2093-059" n="57"/>requirement that the verdict of the jury be
							unanimous results in many hung juries, new trials and compromise verdicts. This might
							be relieved by allowing three-fourths of the jurors to return a signed verdict in
							civil cases and in criminal cases less than felonies.</p>
						<p>It is to be regretted that many good citizens avoid jury service, leaving too many
							opportunities for professional jurors.</p>
						<note type="margin">Selection and term of judges</note>
						<p>It is of the utmost importance that judges in all courts be as free as possible from
							any form of bias or special influence. The question as to whether or not this can be
							obtained by popular election and short term is a very interesting one. It is urged
							that selection of judges by appointment would tend toward greater freedom from
							political influence such as may result in the canvass for votes in the primary and
							general elections. If the judge's term could be made to depend upon efficiency and
							good behavior, instead of being limited to a short fixed period with the possibility
							of re-election depending upon political chance, it would induce greater independence
							and possibly more satisfactory service. The constitution authorizes the legislature to
							provide for the election of all judges by an election to be held for them only, at
							which time no other officer shall be voted for. (Art. II, Sec. 14.) A separate
							election of this kind might have the tendency to lessen the influence of partisan
							politics. It has always been the practice in Indiana to select judges by the same
							political methods that prevail in the choice of public officers generally.</p>
						<note type="margin">Lawyer's qualifications</note>
						<p>Through the influence of bar associations and law schools an ever higher standard of
							professional <pb id="VAC2093-060" n="58"/> qualifications is being promoted. By
							provision of the constitution (Art. XII, Sec. 21), every person of good moral standing
							who is a voter is entitled to be admitted to the bar upon his own application. Being a
							voter and of good moral character are the maximum requirements. Many who are not
							voters have been admitted. The supreme court has held that women may be granted the
							right to practice before all courts.</p>
						<note type="margin">Impeachment</note>
						<p>Strong constitutional provisions and general laws for the impeachment of officers
							prevail in Indiana. However, the cases of impeachment and removal have been
							comparatively rare. A limitation upon the power of impeachment, intended to give
							greater independence and discretion to prosecutors and judges, provides, in effect,
							that these officers can only be impeached and removed after conviction of corruption
							or other high crime. (Art. VII, Sec. 12.) This article has had late construction in
							the supreme court (State <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. Patterson, 181 Indiana 660) holding
							that the judge and prosecuting attorney are constitutional officers and are neither
							state nor county officers subject to the general impeachment provisions of the
							constitution and laws based thereon, applicable to state and county officers. Adequate
							impeachment provisions and vigorous enforcement would do much to relieve all agitation
							for proposals of recalls applied to such officers.</p>
						<note type="margin">Federal jurisdiction</note>
						<p>The state of Indiana constitutes a federal court district, having one judge appointed
							by the President during life or good behavior. Sessions of the court are regularly
							held at Indianapolis and occasionally in Fort Wayne, Evansville, Hammond and New
							Albany. Appeals from the district judge are <pb id="VAC2093-061" n="59"/>taken to the
							federal circuit court of appeals of the seventh circuit, which includes Indiana,
							Illinois and Wisconsin. The circuit court usually holds sessions in Chicago, but may
							designate other places in the circuit. Cases involving federal questions are tried in
							the federal courts.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">TAXATION</head>
						<p>The levy and collection of taxes is a highly important function in the administration
							of government. (Reed, Chapter XL.) Probably no subject of public policy in civic
							affairs has received more thought and discussion in Indiana in recent years than
							taxation. The general system in vogue has been maintained substantially the same since
							the adoption of the constitution in 1851, though phases of the law have received
							different application. The constitution requires a uniform and equal rate of
							assessment and taxation, thus establishing the general property tax. Under this
							provision all tax laws must apply alike to all classes of property regardless of
							nature or kind. This has been found extremely difficult to carry out in practice
							because of the vastly different nature of property. Real estate differs widely as an
							object of taxation from intangible personal property.</p>
						<p>The system is administered through township, county, city and state agencies. The
							township assessor has the extremely important duty of making assessment and fixing the
							valuation of personal property of private individuals each year. Real property is
							assessed every four years. The county board of review fixes the assessment upon the
							property of corporations excepting pipe lines, railways, <pb id="VAC2093-062" n="60"
							/>express companies, telegraph and telephone systems. These are assessed by the state
							board of tax commissioners. Appeals from the valuations made by the township assessor
							may be taken to the county board and even to the state board. The tax levy is the sum
							total of levies made for the different units of government by the state legislature,
							county council, city council or town trustees, township advisory board and the school
							trustees. Taxes are paid in installments twice a year to the county treasurer, who
							makes distribution to the state, county, township and city.</p>
						<p>It will be noted that the administration of the tax system represents the peculiar
							relation of the state, county, township and city. The township assessor has really the
							most important duty of all in making the assessment. If this is inequitable, the
							further administration of the system can not possibly be equitable. The county
							assessor has uncertain supervisory powers over township assessments and can bring
							appeals before the county board of review. The county board of review, in addition to
							assessing the property of corporations, reviews grievances and makes equalization
							between the townships. The state tax commissioners, in addition to assessing public
							utilities, settle appeals from county boards and make equalization between
							counties.</p>
						<p>The application of the general property tax to modern forms of property seems to bear
							with undue hardship upon visible property in common forms which can be listed easily
							at true value, whereas vast amounts of wealth in invisible form&mdash;stocks, bonds,
							etc.&mdash;easily escape taxation. It is urged that this could be remedied, in part at
							least, by the <pb id="VAC2093-063" n="61"/>application of a classification tax which
							would fix different rates for different kinds of property. A state income tax has been
							adopted in many states as a means of equalizing the burden of government support
							according to income. Neither of these have been tried thus far in Indiana because of
							constitutional objections.</p>
						<p>Indiana has an inheritance tax law, adopted in 1913, which contributes revenue to the
							state highway fund. The rate varies from one per cent to five per cent according to
							the degree of relationship and the amount of inheritance. It is a graduated
							tax&mdash;the rate rising with the amount of the heritage and the distance of
							relationship.</p>
						<p>The problem of taxation is recognized as including much more than the machinery and
							system of levy and collection. It involves the whole subject of cost of government,
							which has been increasing in every unit of government for the last twenty-five years.
							This increase has been due, of course, in some measure to the increase in population
							but mainly to the increasing number of functions of government and possibly to lax
							methods of financial administration. Whether or not this expense will increase or
							decrease will depend upon both of these elements&mdash;the functions assumed and the
							efficiency of financial administration. Whether the cost be great or small, it is
							essential that the burden borne by the taxpayer be equitably adjusted, considering
							such elements as ability to pay and the benefit to be derived.</p>

					<head rend="center">CITY GOVERNMENT</head>
					<note type="margin">Peculiar problem</note>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> peculiar nature of the city as a separate unit in public policy
						has not been recognized to a very large degree in the government of Indiana. To those
						who live in cities, it is becoming increasingly clear that the city is a distinct factor
						in government rather than a subdivision of the state after the nature of the county and
						the township. We have more points of direct contact with affairs that are peculiar to
						the city than we have with all other units of government combined, not excepting the
						nation. A rightful regard for the city, state and nation involves a three-fold
						patriotism.</p>
					<p>The problem of city government is distinctly modern and is taking on new and peculiar
						aspects constantly. This problem today is not the problem that was involved in the
						government of compact communities fifty years ago, or even twenty-five years ago. The
						rapid increase of population makes necessary the development of new forms and functions
						of community activity. The growing complexity of social and economic relations in these
						compact communities continually produces new questions of public policy, requiring new
						methods of solution in a political sense. There is just as much basis for new and
						original development in the government of municipal corporations as there is for <pb
							id="VAC2093-066" n="64"/>new and original methods and activities in the development of
						modern business through private corporations. (Reed, Chapter XXXIX.)</p>
					<note type="margin">City growth in Indiana</note>
					<p>Over one-half of the people of Indiana live in urban communities. In 1910, Indiana had
						88 cities of over 2,500 inhabitants, and 382 towns and villages of less than 2,500
						inhabitants. Our urban population included, in 1910, 53.5 per cent of the whole and the
						rural population 46.5 per cent. Ten years previous, 1900, the relation was almost
						exactly reversed, the rural communities including 55.2 per cent and the towns and cities
						44.8 per cent. This indicates the rapid tendency toward centralization of population in
						cities and suggests the growing complexity of the problem of local government. From 1900
						to 1910 our city population increased 30.5 per cent, while our rural population
						decreased 5.5 per cent. About one-tenth of the population of Indiana is in the city of
						Indianapolis.</p>
					<note type="margin">Lack of city system</note>
					<p>It is true of Indiana, as of much of the western world, that there can hardly be said
						to exist a really adequate system of city government. As the cities have grown and it
						has become necessary to meet vitally changed conditions, government has tried to keep
						pace largely by a series of makeshifts. Our state constitution takes practically no note
						of cities and makes no substantial provision for them. The word "city" appears only once
						in the constitution, and then not in any important connection. Article XIII, adopted in
						1881, makes reference to municipal corporations for the purpose of limiting the
						activities and powers of cities by imposing a two per cent debt limit. (Reed, Chapters
						XV, XVI.)</p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-067" n="65"/>
					<p>Our cities are subject to state regulation and control by general laws. Through
						interpretation of a provision relating to private corporations (Art. XI, Sec. 13),
						cities in Indiana, constitutionally defined, are "corporations other than banking." This
						oversight in regard to cities was natural in the making of a constitution at a time when
						there was no real city problem in Indiana. Our largest city in 1850 had less than 8,000
						inhabitants and the coming of the modern municipal era had hardly cast its shadow.</p>
					<note type="margin">Classification of cities</note>
					<p>The boundary line between towns and cities is the population limit of 2,000. A village
						can become a town through petition of the people to the county commissioners asking for
						the establishment of a separate government prescribing the boundaries. If this is
						approved by the commissioners and ratified by the people residing within the proposed
						town limits, a town is formed, divided into wards, and officers are chosen. By a
						two-thirds vote of four-fifths of the electors, the town government can be
						dissolved.</p>
					<p>A town of 2,000 population or over may by petition and a majority vote of its
						inhabitants become a city. The city so formed then enters into its general class under
						our state laws governing cities.</p>
					<p>It can not properly be said that any Indiana city has a charter. The so-called charter
						of any Indiana city consists merely of an act or acts of the state legislature applying
						to that particular city or rather to the class to which it belongs. Our cities are
						divided into five classes on the basis of population and, to some extent, upon the
						assessed valuation of <pb id="VAC2093-068" n="66"/>taxable property within the city
						limits. Cities of 100,000 or over belong in the first class. This includes only the city
						of Indianapolis. Cities having a population of not less than 35,000 or more than 100,000
						belong to the second class. The third class includes all having a population of from
						25,000 to 35,000. The fourth class includes all cities having a population of from
						10,000 to 20,000, provided they also have taxable property amounting to $5,000.000. This
						class also includes cities having a smaller population than 10,000 if they have taxable
						wealth assessed at $7,500,000 or over. For example, Whiting with a population of less
						than 7,000 was included in the fourth class because of its taxable property. The fifth
						class includes all other cities.</p>
					<note type="margin">System of government</note>
					<p>The general system of government in the cities, provided by the state law, is very
						similar in all classes. The plan is the "mayor and council plan," or the so-called
						"federal plan," which is entirely political in nature. Officers are elected by party
						ballot. The holding of city elections at a time when there is no national or state
						election has tended to center more exclusive interest upon city government, but it has
						had very little effect in changing the partisan political character of the elections.
						National and state politics still reign supreme. It naturally follows that the
						appointments of officers and boards are dominated almost entirely by political
						considerations and largely as a means of paying political debts. The mayor and council
						frequently cross each other in such ways as to interfere with progress and to make the
						fixing of absolute responsibility very uncertain. Conflicts between the <pb
							id="VAC2093-069" n="67"/>departments often bring the administration of the government
						to a standstill.</p>
					<p>Again, the city is limited in fundamental respects by state legislation so as to make
						almost impossible adequate exercise of local self-government. At the same time a very
						high degree of decentralization exists, since the state can not exercise direct control
						in local affairs. There can be little doubt that the dissatisfaction which has existed
						so generally in our cities is traceable almost entirely to our confusing system of
						administering city affairs and to the dependent position in which the city officers are
						placed. This dissatisfaction is always expressed politically and it is the natural
						political history of our cities that almost every administration is succeeded by an
						administration of the opposing party&mdash;a continual round of "ins and outs" without
						much material change in results.</p>
					<p>For educational purposes the city is a separate unit, the school city being distinct
						from the civil city. If these functions are not properly discharged, the fault must lie
						either with the system in operation or with the men charged with the administration of
						these duties. The fault may reside in both. The system has much to do in determining the
						selection of men as well as the character and quality of the service they render.</p>
					<note type="margin">Public utilities</note>
					<p>A highly important part of the functioning of city government in the way of serving the
						people is conducted very largely and in many cities entirely through private
						corporations. This covers such important and universal service as the supplying of gas,
						water, electricity, street railways and telephones. Approximately one-half of the cities
							<pb id="VAC2093-070" n="68"/>in Indiana own their own waterworks and about one-third
						own and operate their own electric light plants. None of the other utilities is owned by
						any Indiana city. The city of Indianapolis owns none of its public utilities. These are
						the money-making functions of the city and private enterprise is eager to control them.
						(Reed, Chapter XXXVI.)</p>
					<p>Through our state utility law, passed in 1913, the general control and regulation of
						rates and service of these public utilities is vested in the public service commission
						of the state, appointed by the governor. All franchises are in effect indeterminate
						permits. No city may grant a franchise without permission of the commission and the
						commission may take away franchises for cause. Rates and regulations of service are
						fixed entirely by the commission upon its own investigation, taking this important power
						entirely away from the control of the people themselves.</p>
					<note type="margin">Need of home rule</note>
					<p>It is becoming clearly evident that government of cities by general classes does not
						reach the best results in the different cities. Cities are no more alike than families
						or states or nations. The internal local problems of each city are, in many cases,
						entirely peculiar to that city and can not be solved by methods of general control. This
						suggests the need of home rule, which is coming to be the prevailing method of modern
						city government. Home rule would relieve the cities entirely of special interference in
						local matters by the legislature and would enable the people of each municipality to
						provide their own special form of local self-government by a self-made charter which
						they could adapt to suit <pb id="VAC2093-071" n="69"/>their needs and could change as
						experience should recommend.</p>
					<note type="margin">Special legislation</note>
					<p>One of the main considerations in the making of the present constitution was the
						ridding of the state of the evil of local and special legislation which had grown up
						under the constitution of 1816. To some extent this evil has returned, although in a
						somewhat different form, namely, the attempt to legislate for our cities under general
						laws. In all legislative sessions much time is given to the passage of acts which,
						though general in form and terms, are special in their application inasmuch as such acts
						so fix the population limits of the cities to which they apply as to include a given
						city and no other. Thus, although the act must of necessity be so framed as to be
						general in its nature, nevertheless it actually becomes "special legislation."</p>
					<p>In order to obtain the passage of these bills it is quite often necessary that purely
						local questions be fought out in the legislature on a state political basis.
						Complications which concern only the government of cities, as for instance differences
						between city officers and city councils, the establishment of special boards or of
						special courts, must of necessity come before the legislature. These are matters which
						the cities themselves should have the power to attend to at home without asking any kind
						of state interference.</p>
					<p>Our legislature is composed of 150 men, representing 92 counties, 88 cities, 382 towns
						and villages and a strictly rural population of a million and a half. It will be seen
						that the legislature has a full program by attending to the affairs of the whole state
						of Indiana and can hardly afford to give its <pb id="VAC2093-072" n="70"/>time to a
						consideration of the internal conflicts over local interests in particular communities.
						The legislature of 1915 passed 191 laws of which less than twenty-five can be considered
						state laws of general interest. The same was substantially true of the legislature of
						1917. Legislative control of cities has given large opportunity for the influence of
						special interests in cities. This will continue as long as cities are without
						independence in their purely local matters.</p>

					<head rend="center">GENERAL WELFARE</head>
					<note type="margin">Public policy and the individual</note>
					<p>I<hi rend="sc">NDIVIDUAL</hi> rights and interests in civic life are necessarily
						subject to what is known as the public welfare, which it is the primary purpose of all
						forms and functions of government to promote. Every civic activity could properly be
						listed under this head. There are certain activities of government which deal directly
						with the immediate conduct and environment of the individual, restraining his personal
						freedom, both for his own benefit and for the public welfare. These may be generally
						defined along the broad lines of public health, public morals and public safety, though
						no classification is all inclusive or exclusive. Other functions of a somewhat
						extra-governmental nature offer the individual common conveniences and advantages for
						the sake of the general welfare. In such advanced civic functions Indiana is taking a
						leading rank among the states of the Union.</p>
					<note type="margin">Public health</note>
					<p>The state board of health, consisting of five members appointed by the governor, is in
						general charge of activities pertaining to the public health. The principle underlying
						this activity is expressed in the adage of Benjamin Franklin, "Public health is public
						wealth." The board carries on a state-wide work in the promotion of health, the stamping
						out of disease and the reform of conditions tending to bring about disease. One member
						of the board must be a physician who acts as secretary and is in active <pb
							id="VAC2093-075" n="73"/>charge of the work. The board collects vital statistics of
						every kind in reference to births, deaths, the causes of death and the prevalence and
						causes of disease. It advances means of combating disease and ill health, makes surveys
						of public and private property, issues orders to stop disease-breeding or
						disease-spreading habits and to prevent the polluting of lakes and rivers with sewage,
						restricts the holding of public gatherings where there is danger of epidemic, orders the
						discontinuance of the use of common drinking cups, establishes quarantines, maintains
						laboratories, enforces the food and drug act, and carries on campaigns of education
						along all lines tending to awaken the people to the need of better methods of preserving
						health. (Reed, Chapter XXXII.)</p>
					<p>The orders of the state board of health and the rules established by it have the
						binding, legal force of statutory laws. Legislative acts authorizing the adoption of
						these rules have been held constitutional and valid. Prosecuting attorneys are required
						to prosecute violators of the rules and orders. Local health officers act as deputies of
						the state food and drug commissioner, who is also chief chemist in charge of the
						bacteriological laboratory. The effective administration of health programs for the
						state is hindered in much the same manner that general state administration is hindered
						by decentralization of power. Our local health officers should perhaps be more directly
						connected with the state board. The continual development of this work will tend to
						bring about a greater unification of the entire system and will result in the
						establishment of offices filled by experts devoting their full time to these duties.</p>
					<pb id="VAC2093-076" n="74"/>
					<note type="margin">Charities and corrections</note>
					<p>A comprehensive system of charities and corrections, including all agencies for
						ministering to the unfortunates who are subjects of public care, prevails in Indiana
						through state and local officers and boards. The work is conducted by individual outdoor
						relief in the homes of those in need and by the so-called indoor relief through public
						institutions. This system of public relief in Indiana dates from territorial days in the
						early forming of townships in 1790, and from this local organization there has developed
						in this state one of the most complete systems of charities and corrections existing
						anywhere in the United States. (Reed, Chapter XXX.)</p>
					<p>Outdoor relief is largely in the hands of the township trustee, under some supervision
						of the county commissioners. Indoor relief is administered through state institutions
						and supervised by the state board of charities. This system of state supervision has
						been so successful and has gained such recognition as to be known generally as the
						"Indiana Plan."</p>

						</list></p>
					<p>Each of these institutions is under the control of a separate board of trustees serving
						at a nominal salary and appointed by the governor. The board chooses the superintendent
						of the institution and contracts for all supplies. The state board of charities
						supervises and investigates all these institutions, making public report to the governor
						and offering recommendations to the legislature. Annual state conferences are held and
						the proceedings published in quarterly bulletins. Much of the value of this work is due
						to its educational nature.</p>
					<p>The county maintains poor farms for persons who are helpless on account of age,
						infirmity or poverty. Some counties have orphan homes and a few have hospitals. A county
						board of children's guardians appointed by the circuit judge looks after orphan
						children. County charities generally are in charge of the county commissioners.</p>
					<note type="margin">Reformative system</note>
					<p>The Bill of Rights (Sec. 18) provides that "the penal code shall be founded on the
						principle of reformation and not of vindictive justice." This indicates the spirit
						underlying the administration of our penal system through which the reformative idea has
						developed to a high degree. Men between the ages of sixteen and thirty who are convicted
						of crime are sent to the reformatory rather than to the penitentiary, and girls under
						seventeen are sent to <pb id="VAC2093-078" n="76"/>the girls' school of correction. Boys
						under sixteen are sent to the training school at Plainfield. The principal purpose in
						all of these institutions is to give needed correction and opportunity for
						rehabilitation. All persons convicted of crime, excepting murder and treason, may
						receive an indeterminate sentence and after serving the minimum period, may, in the
						discretion of the prison commission, be paroled under good behavior. Girls under
						eighteen and boys under sixteen found guilty of crime may be committed to the custody of
						probation officers. (Reed, Chapter XXVIII.)</p>
					<p>This excellent system involved in the whole program of charities and corrections is a
						most commendable method of extending mercy and care in cases of error and wrong. It
						tends to soften the results of wrongs which may be due in large part to social
						conditions and environment rather than to inherent individual tendencies. The conditions
						out of which these cases arise are being dealt with constantly in constructive ways
						through education and through the enforcement of laws against institutional vices
						whereby, it may be hoped, the need of charities and corrections may grow less with
						increasing enlightenment. It is seldom necessary for institutions of correction to deal
						with those who can enjoy the advantages of our institutions of learning.</p>
					<note type="margin">Compulsory education</note>
					<p>The compulsory school law is an advanced step in harmony with the free public school
						system and with the public policy of benefiting the individual for the sake of the
						general welfare. This law requires that all children between the ages of seven and
						fourteen, unless physically or mentally <pb id="VAC2093-079" n="77"/>disqualified, shall
						regularly attend school during each year for the full term of the common school in their
						respective localities. The provisions of the law apply also to children between the ages
						of fourteen and sixteen not engaged in some useful employment or service. A child that
						is totally or partially blind or deaf must attend the state school for the blind or deaf
						from the period of seven to eighteen years of age. The principle upon which compulsory
						education rests is that democratic institutions can not be successfully maintained
						unless all members of society have educational training comprehending at least the
						rudiments of learning.</p>
					<p>The compulsory education law is enforced through a state board of truancy consisting of
						the state superintendent of public instruction, a member of the state board of
						education, and the secretary of the state board of charities and corrections. Local
						attendance officers are appointed by the county board of education or city school
						commissioners. All officers and teachers are required to co-operate in the enforcement
						of this act. Penalties are provided for parents or guardians who contribute to the
						delinquency of the child in the matter of school attendance. The child who habitually
						absents himself from school may be dealt with as incorrigible under the jurisdiction of
						the juvenile court.</p>
					<note type="margin">Child labor</note>
					<p>The Indiana child labor law prohibits the employment of any child under the age of
						fourteen years in any gainful occupation other than farm work, domestic service and work
						in canning factories during the summer. It also prohibits the employment of any child
						under sixteen years of age over eight hours a day and requires the consent of the
						parents <pb id="VAC2093-080" n="78"/>and a school certificate or permit showing that the
						child has completed the fifth grade in school work. By special written consent of
						parents, the child may be permitted to work the maximum of nine hours per day. Children
						under sixteen years of age are prohibited absolutely from working in any dangerous
						occupation. School officers and enforcement officers work in harmony in the enforcement
						of this act in conjunction with the administration of the compulsory education law.</p>
					<note type="margin">Anti-cigarette law</note>
					<p>A significant exercise of public restraint upon the individual, especially the young,
						is found in the effort to restrict the general use of cigarettes. Indiana has had
						different kinds of anti-cigarette laws in recent years, ranging from the absolute
						prohibition of the sale or use of cigarettes universally to the law passed in 1913
						prohibiting any minor from using, procuring or receiving in any manner or having in his
						possession any cigarettes, cigarette papers or substitutes therefor. Penalties are
						provided for violation and misrepresentation of age. This supplements the juvenile court
						law, which provides that any child under the age of sixteen years of age who is an
						habitual cigarette smoker may be made a ward of the court as a delinquent. These laws
						are based upon the fact that the habitual smoking of cigarettes among boys is
						exceedingly harmful, tending towards bad conduct and evil association.</p>
					<note type="margin">Liquor prohibition</note>
					<p>The police power of the state of Indiana received extensive application when the
						legislature of 1917 passed a law prohibiting the sale, manufacture, barter, gift, or
						exchange of liquor except for medicinal, mechanical and scientific purposes. (Acts <pb
							id="VAC2093-081" n="79"/>1917, page 15.) This act went into operation April 2, 1918.
						It defines intoxicating liquors as "beverages containing to exceed one-half of one per
						cent of alcohol." It prohibits the sale of patent medicines of high alcoholic contents
						that are capable of being used as a beverage. The law provides a scale of penalties for
						violations, ranging in severity according to the gravity of the infraction. The law does
						not attempt to prohibit the drinking of liquor in the home, nor does it prohibit the
						individual from making wine and cider for his own use. It prohibits the advertisement of
						liquor in printed journals of any kind which circulate in Indiana and renders it
						unlawful to solicit for the sale of liquor in the state either by agents or by
						catalogues through the mail. The basis of such prohibitive legislation is the exercise
						"of the police power of the state for the protection of the economic welfare, health,
						peace and morals of the people."</p>
					<note type="margin">Labor and social justice</note>
					<p>Largely through the intelligent and active public efforts of labor organizations some
						advanced steps have been taken in Indiana towards the promotion of a better state of
						social justice, applied to important phases of labor conditions. A notable step in this
						direction was the enactment of the workingmen's compensation act by the legislature of
						1915. (Acts 1915, page 392.) The act was amended in some particulars in 1917.</p>
					<p>The primary purpose of this act is to make the state a direct mediator between the
						employer and the employee in the case of injury suffered by the employee during service.
						It tends to dispense with long-drawn-out and expensive suits for damages in the courts.
						It provides compensation for injuries <pb id="VAC2093-082" n="80"/>resulting in
						disability extending beyond seven days on the basis of fifty-five per cent of the weekly
						wage. This compensation is to continue for the full period of disability not exceeding
						300 weeks if the disability is only partial. In cases of total disability the period is
						extended to 500 weeks. If the injury results in death, burial expenses are provided and
						fifty-five per cent compensation given for a period not to exceed 300 weeks.</p>
					<p>All awards are made by the state industrial board. No award can exceed $5,000 in any
						case. Many important details of administration are left to the discretion of the
						industrial board, which consists of three members appointed by the governor. The board
						may summon witnesses and examine books and records. No compensation is allowed in any
						case of willful injury or any damage resulting from intoxication of the employee. The
						purpose of this act is highly preventive as well as compensatory and includes provision
						for accident insurance. This law is not compulsory and employers can reject the act or
						elect to come under its provisions. Fifteen hundred corporations did reject it as soon
						as it went into effect and, all told, the employees of some 2,000 corporations are not
						within its provisions. By such rejection these corporations deprive themselves of many
						defenses in personal injury suits.</p>
					<p>Workingmen's compensation is a modern step toward complete social justice and is a
						great relief to the courts in the settlement of industrial disputes. Decisions are made
						much more quickly and equitably, and with less expense and uncertainty.</p>
					<p>Labor organizations in Indiana are pursuing a broad educational policy touching all
						subjects <pb id="VAC2093-083" n="81"/>affecting the condition of workers. A
						representative lobby is maintained at all sessions of the legislature. The unions
						participate prominently in civic movements. The educational results of this organized
						activity tend to bring about a better understanding between employers and employees
						conducive to the best public interest. (Reed, Chapter XXXVII.)</p>
					<p>Organized labor is represented on the state board of education and the council of
						defense. Through co-operation with the United States employment service, the state is
						thoroughly organized for a proper distribution of labor. District employment agencies
						have been established and local representatives appointed in every county. The state
						maintains free employment agencies in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, South Bend, Evansville
						and Terre Haute. This is a recognition in Indiana that unemployment is a matter of
						social significance rather than of individual fault or misfortune.</p>
					<note type="margin">Indiana and the war</note>
					<p>The most valuable by-product in Indiana, resulting from the world war for democracy, is
						the cultivation of a genuine spirit of democracy at home. The civic lessons coming from
						patriotic responses of our public officials and people to the call of the nation are
						deep and lasting.</p>
					<p>Though the conduct of the war is directly in the hands of the federal government, our
						participation as a state very properly engenders new state pride and a new sense of
						state and local civic obligation. It is bringing a more intimate and vital relationship
						among officers and people and among all units of government in the promotion of the
						common welfare.</p>
					<p>The vigorous leadership of our governor and the <pb id="VAC2093-084" n="82"/>ready
						co-operation of all public officials, aided by the prompt initiative of our citizens, is
						of exactly that kind and character needed to accomplish every important civic victory,
						and it can not be doubted that the lessons taught will remain with all our people. The
						leadership of the governor as chief executive has been voiced in proclamations,
						addresses and official acts of a public character, many of which are entirely outside of
						the lines of legal duty. Indeed, the manner in which the necessities of war have
						inculcated the broad spirit of achievement and accomplishment regardless of limitations
						and requirements touching official powers and duties, constitutes a valuable object
						lesson in extra-governmental functions.</p>
					<p>The principal war aid work is promoted through the council of defense, acting in a
						semi-official capacity. The Indiana council of defense was appointed by the governor
						following the organization of the national council of defense at the call of the
						President. Our state council is made up of public-spirited men and women representing
						the chief industries and the learned professions of the state and including
						representative leaders of organized activities of every civic nature in the state. Each
						county has a council of defense formed after the manner of the state council, the
						members being appointed by the judge of the circuit court. The headquarters of the state
						council are in the state house and it is now established as a vital agency of
						government.</p>
					<p>The new Americanism will result from the vital transformation of the thrilling impulses
						of a people <pb id="VAC2093-085" n="83"/>aroused by war into permanent forms of civic
						endeavor.</p>

						biennially at the capital of the State, commencing on the Thursday next after the first
						Monday of January, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, and on the

					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 11. Two-thirds of each House shall constitute a quorum to do

					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 14. Either House may punish its members for disorderly
						behavior, and may, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member; but not a second
						time for the same cause.</p>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 15. Either House, during its session, may punish, by
						imprisonment, any person not a member, who shall have been guilty of disrespect to the

						the legislative department of a free and independent State.</p>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 17. Bills may originate in either House, but may be amended or
						rejected in the other, except that bills for raising revenues shall originate in the
						House of Representatives.</p>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 18. Every bill shall be read by sections, on three several days
						in each House; unless, in case of emergency, two-thirds of the House where such bill may
						be depending shall, by a vote of yeas and nays, deem it expedient to dispense with this
						rule; but the reading of a bill by sections, on its final passage, shall in no case be
						dispensed with; and the vote on the passage of every bill or joint resolution shall be
						taken by yeas and nays.</p>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 19. Every act shall embrace but one subject, and matters
						properly connected therewith; which subject shall be expressed in the title. But if any
						subject shall be embraced in an act, which shall not be expressed in the title, such act

					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 20. Every act and joint resolution shall be plainly worded,
						avoiding, as far as practicable, the use of technical terms.</p>
					<p>S<hi rend="sc">EC</hi>. 21. No act shall ever be revised or amended by mere reference
						to its title; but the act revised, or section amended, shall be set forth and published
						at full length.</p>

					Professor of English Literature at Wellesley College.</p>
				<p rend="center">Cloth. 542 pages. Price $1.50</p>
				<lb/>
				<p>For the high school and the younger classes in college. It gives a clear and correct idea
					of each great period of English Literature and guides in the direct and copious reading of
					texts. Each part begins with a picture of the period treated; the significance of our
					origins and the imaginative achievement of the great medieval centuries are clearly shown
					and the student is enabled to trace the many strands, racial, physical, ethical, and
					spiritual, of which the glorious fabric of English Literature is woven.</p>
				<p>Special prominence is given to the greatest or most significant figures in our
					literature. In addition to the bibliographical references at the end of each chapter there
					are practical suggestions for discussions by the students and for talks by the teacher. A
					full outline of authors with their works and contemporary events in tables arranged for
					easy reference is also given.</p>
				<p>The book is thoroughly human, interesting, attractive, and inspiring, and has a literary
					charm not found in the ordinary text-book. There is not a dry page in it and there is no
					book that presents the story of English Literature in a manner more likely to awaken the
					desire for further acquaintance with the books that are so alluringly described.</p>
