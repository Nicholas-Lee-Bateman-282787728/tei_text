            <head>Three Years in the Orient: The Diary of William R. Johnson, 1898-1902</head>
            <byline>Edited by Donald F. Carmony and Karen Tannenbaum Contributed by Bess Sellers Johnson</byline>
            <p>"Three Years in the Orient" is the diary of William (Will) R. Johnson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, a volunteer in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army during the Philippine insurrection of 1899 to 1901. Though not a polished literary
                    account, the youthful Johnson's views and reactions are probably quite representative of
                    the majority of unsophisticated Americans who served in this conflict. His belief in the justice of
                    the American position and the backwardness and even inferiority of the Philippine people is strong
                    and unquestioned. "The Filipino is a heathen looking thing half-nude and so lazy he can
                    hardly walk," Johnson wrote on his second day on the island. Also evident is the
                    matter-of-fact and patriotic devotion which marked Johnson's performance of his military
                    duties. His uncomplaining descriptions of the hardships, dangers, and sacrifices of soldiering
                    reveal the great contrast between his life as a young soldier in the field and the life he might
                    have enjoyed in the distant—and particularly to Johnson—glorious U.S.A. It was
                    not long after his arrival in the Philippines, on March 27, 1899, that Johnson laconically observed,
                    "Have had lots of hardships etc and I have come to the conclusion that Gen Sherman was
                    right when he said ‘War is hell.’"</p>
            <p>Will Johnson was born on a farm near Whiteland, Indiana, on December 5, 1880. His mother died when he
                    was about ten years old. The family later moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> after his father had remarried. Johnson was a sophomore at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School when the Spanish-American War began in April, 1898. At the end of the
                    school year, Will quit school and volunteered for military duty. He was mustered into service as a
                    private in Company E of the 158th Indiana Infantry on May 10 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although then only seventeen, he apparently told the military authorities that he had
                    been born on December 5, 1878, thus advancing his actual age by two years. Hostilities in the
                    Spanish-American War ended, however, before his unit ever left the mainland <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-063-4-004"/> of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and Johnson was honorably discharged on November 4, 1898, when his company was mustered
                    out at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The desire to partake of military life and adventure had not been dimmed. A little over a month
                    later, on December 5, 1898 (his eighteenth birthday), Johnson volunteered at Seymour, Indiana, as a
                    private for three more years of military service. His father, hoping to see the boy finish his
                    schooling, had objected initially to this plan but eventually consented and accompanied his son to
                    the enlistment center.</p>
            <p>Johnson was assigned to Company K of the Twenty-Second Regiment of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Infantry and was at once sent to Camp Crook, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>. On January 3, 1899, he was appointed the rank of corporal. After brief training at
                    Camp Crook, he arrived in the Philippine Islands on March 4, 1899, a month after the simmering
                    Philippine discontent toward the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had flared into open insurrection under the leadership of Aguinaldo. Less than a year
                    before, in May, 1898, when the Americans were actively engaged in war against the Spanish, Aguinaldo
                    had been returned to his homeland from exile in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-hk">Hong Kong</country>
                    </placeName> to lead his followers, in conjunction with American forces, against their common enemy.
                    The Spanish had held the Philippines as a colony since the sixteenth century. Although the
                    Philippine soldiers fought well, the harmony of the relationship was short lived. Aguinaldo had
                    well-known and deeply entrenched ambitions for the independence of his country. When, in the months
                    following the capture of Manila Bay and of Manila itself, it appeared to him that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was not willing to grant independence, relations between his forces and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> occupying forces became increasingly strained. In September, 1888, the rebel group set
                    up a government with a capital at Malolos and Aguinaldo as president. Unwilling to accept President
                    McKinley's doctrine of "benevolent assimilation," the rebel forces
                    finally came into open conflict with the American troops on February 4, 1899.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    delays and detours resulting from enemy resistance and barriers such as mountains, rivers, monsoons,
                    and mud. At various times the men were compelled to go without adequate rations; indeed, at the end
                    of the "Great Northern Campaign," in the fall of 1899, they were even without
                    shoes. "Well we are completely on the bum," Johnson wrote, "lots of
                    sickness from fever." Although Johnson's company was involved in several active
                    campaigns which took them great distances across the island, they spent the greatest amount of time
                    at Candaba, doing garrison duty interspersed with night raids. In July, 1899, while at Candaba,
                    Johnson resigned his rank of corporal, for reasons unexplained in the diary. One year later,
                    however, he was reappointed to that rank.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1901, Aguinaldo was captured and the insurrection practically terminated. During
                    that summer, Johnson was promoted to sergeant and put in charge of a mounted detachment. In July, he
                    was ordered to Manila where he remained until his discharge on December 21, 1901. During these last
                    few months on the islands, Johnson did garrison duty, assumed the duties of company clerk, and, in
                    October, 1901, was made quartermaster sergeant in charge of the kitchen and rations. "Land
                    at last," he wrote on January 9, 1902, upon reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "thank God that it is the coast of <placeName>

                    </placeName>… …. I thank heaven for this privilege." On January 15,
                    1902, he arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, bought and donned a new suit of civilian clothes and proceeded by interurban railroad
                    to his home at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> to become a civilian again at age twenty-one.</p>
            <p>Although "Three Years in the Orient" should be read and evaluated in the context of
                    the widespread imperialistic spirit prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century,
                    Johnson's account has some relevance to the current Vietnamese war. The fighting in the
                    Philippines was mainly the guerilla type, with the attendant hazards of snipers, ambushes, night
                    patrols, and uncertainty in distinguishing between friend and foe. Moreover, mountains, unbridged
                    rivers, and steamy jungles existed in the Philippines as they do in <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. There was even a significant number of Americans at home who had doubts about the
                    intervention in so distant an area, but such doubts were for the most part muffled by <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-063-4-006"/> patriotism and expressed without violence. Fortunately for the American
                    soldier, no strong power gave extensive aid to the Philippine insurrectionists or offered a serious
                    threat of possible aid.</p>
            <p>Upon his return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1901 Johnson became a clerk in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> post office. In 1918 he joined the Farmer's Trust Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, becoming its president in 1937. He held this position until his death on March 18,
                    1952. (This bank is now known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank and Trust Company.) Mr. Johnson was a long and active member of the Tabernacle

            <p>Will Johnson was married to Bess Sellers on June 27, 1906. They had two children, William S., who

                    for allowing the publication of this diary and for her continued interest in helping preserve
                    valuable historical documents. With her approval a Xerox copy of her husband's diary has
                    been made by the Indiana State Library. At the invitation of Governor Roger D. Branigin the diary

                           <item>
                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In editing this diary an effort has been made to
                                        maintain, as closely as possible, the flavor imparted to it by
                                        Johnson's own spelling, grammar, punctuation, and style. Thus, lapses
                                        in spelling and grammar have been allowed to remain as long as the meaning
                                        remains clear. Some abbreviations have been spelled out in brackets for the sake
                                        of clarity. Johnson often used commas at the ends of sentences rather than
                                        periods, and periods sometimes occur in the middle of sentences. These
                                        idiocyncracies have not been corrected. Likewise, parentheses and quotation
                                        marks which were incomplete have been left. The occasional use of a capital
                                        letter in the middle of a sentence has also been maintained. When no punctuation
                                        at all occurs at the end of a sentence, a space has been inserted. In those
                                        cases where it has been impossible to determine which mark was intended, modern
                                        usage has prevailed. Some decisions regarding punctuation, capitalization, and
                                        spacing were necessarily arbitrary. In its original form, the diary was
                                        handwritten in a small, ruled, paperbound notebook. (See photos, pp. 284, 295)
                                        No attempt has been made to reproduce the document line for line, although the
                                        author's apparent paragraphs have been maintained. Johnson used a
                                        variety of formats for dates, times, etc. The following items have been
                                        standardized: all raised numbers or letters have been brought down to the line;
                                        all flourishes or embellishments have been removed; the spacing of the first
                                        line of each entry has been standardized; obvious repetition of words or phrases
                                        has been deleted; times are presented in the modern form. The full names of
                                        individuals have been provided when first mentioned wherever possible. The

                                        article on p. 267 is useful in following Johnson's travels in the
                                        Philippines. Place names which could not be identified are indicated by U.I. in

                                    bound for Manila, We now can barely see land, by night we will be entirely out of

                        <p>After traveling all day we arrived at Urdnenata [Urdaneta] with out seeing the Batt,
                                    but the natives said they had passed through there two days before, going toward
                                    Binalonan</p>
                        <p>21st We pulled out at daybreak and had gone probably 6 miles when we met Maj [John
                                    Green] Ballance and the Battalion. They were out of rations too and had come back to
                                    look for us. They were under orders also to go back to Urdeneta and then go westward
                                    and try to find the R.R. and join Macarthur.</p>
                        <p>22d We found the country, off the road, so flooded that we had to abandon that idea
                                    of getting to the R.R. and again proceeded toward the north coast our original

                        <p>23.rd Arrived in Binolonan today after a forced march F. Co. has the train now. We
                                    hear that Gen Young has played havoc with Guinaldo and his contingent</p>
                        <p>Several men have broke down and are unable to go any farther. I am allright yet. We
                                    are only 20 miles from the coast.</p>
                        <p>24. Arrived at San Jacinto today. Seen 300 dead niggers that Gen Wheaton had killed
                                    We Met the 33rd Vols. here They had the nerve to ask us when we landed etc. They
                                    have only been on the island two weeks Aguinaldo's Mother, Wife, and Child
                                    are here, they were captured close by.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                                    smoke of the transports long before we arrived there—We reached San
                                    Fabian about 12 oclock and the first thing we done was to take a bath in the surf of

                        <p>We are a ragged lot of men, no shoes Well we are completely on the bum. Lots of
                                    sickness from fever.</p>
                        <p>Nov 31. [30] Today is Thanksgiving We had hard tack and boiled beans for dinner, 3
                                    men have died in the hospital and all the Co. is more or less sick. Not a hell of a
                                    lot to be thankful for.</p>
                        <p>Dec 3. Those that could walk started for Dagupan. 8 miles down the coast, and the
                                    terminal of the R.R.</p>
                        <p>Those that could not walk were hauled in ambulances and bull carts It was a sorrowful
                                    looking outfit but as the ladies say, heros</p>
                        <p>Dec 4. We reached Dagupan last night. I had a slight attack of fever but am alright
                                    today. This morning we got on the train (flat cars) that had been collected out of
                                    the differents wrecks, and started down the railway toward Manila 165 miles away.
                                    Had to walk 5 miles from Byombang [Bayambang] to Tarloe [Tarlac]. over a washout.
                                    Will stay in Tarloe tonight</p>
                        <p>Dec 5 Today is my 19th birthday, Have only made a few miles today as the track is
                                    torn up, so we have to walk. I believe today is the hottest I have ever seen</p>
                        <p>Dec 6th A fine train met us at Mabalacat and took us to San Fernando Here we received
                                    orders to return overland to Candaba, old Candaba—We are rather
                                    dissapointed for we were in hopes we would go to Manila and have a good rest.</p>
                        <p>The company left this afternoon for Candaba, I am left at San Fernando. Have a sore
                                    foot and can hardly walk.</p>
                        <p>Dec 15 I joined my company today, so here ends the hardest campaign that ever has
                                    been made upon the island, having been out 60 days and marched about 360 miles.</p>
                        <p>During that time, we were on half ration several times and for 4 days did not have
                                    any. Excessive rain to contend with and terrific heat.</p>
                        <p>The Co. lost 13 men killed and died. About half of the Co. is in the hospitals.</p>
                        <p>The people of Candaba are very glad to have us back with them, they gave us a grand
                                    welcome in their own "bloomin" way of course.</p>

                        <p>Dec 25 This is Christmas, but it does not seem like Xmas at all. I guess it is
                                    because the snow and cold is lacking. We had a pretty fair dinner of Roast Beef
                                    (Australian) Baked Chicken, Cabbage, Tomatoes, Corn, Peas[,] Cranberry Sause, Pies
                                    and Cake, and washed it all down with two barrells of Schlitz's beer.
                                    Everbody is getting rested now, and the company is looking more like it did before
                                    the Great Northern Campaign</p>
                        <p>1900</p>
                        <p>Feb 19. Last night 50 men of the company including myself, got up and left the town
                                    silently and went to a town, about 11 miles east called Mondeli [Mandili], We
                                    reached there about four oclock in the morning and surrounded the place capturing 50
                                    insurgents and two American horses, We wounded two of the rebels but there were few
                                    shots fires as they were surprised and surrounded, and knew if they made any
                                    resistance we would kill them all.</p>
                        <p>Feb 26, Last night the Co. made a secret night march southward to several small towns
                                    but did not find any "gugud’.</p>
                        <p>Mch 4. Today we have been upon the island one Year.</p>
                        <p>Apl 10. My comrade Paul Fox [U. I.] was drowned in the river last night It seems
                                    strange that he should drown for he was the most expert swimmer in the company We
                                    are doing ordinary garrison duty and taking things easy</p>
                        <p>May 20 I have returned from Manila on pass, I had a glorious time and did in fact
                                    recuperate</p>
                        <p>Manila is quite Americanized now—I purchased some flowers to decorate
                                    Fox's grave</p>
                        <p>May 30 This is Memorial day— During the afternoon the town caught fire,
                                    the wind was rather strong therefore the eastern part of the town is in ruins and
                                    about $20,000 worth of property has been destroyed</p>
                        <p>The houses of the natives are so dry, and built of bamboo, grass and palmleaves, that
                                    they catch fire easily. One house (common) is valued at about $10.00</p>
                        <p>Three drunken soldiers of "My’ Co. are said to have set the first
                                    house on fire, because the occupants refused to give them "beno"
                                    [a type of wine] the native drink</p>

                        <p>June 8 Company went to Arayat today to relieve Co "E" which is
                                    going to the mountains with Gen. [Frederick] Funston, they probably will be gone
                                    several days</p>
                        <p>14th Returned to Candaba today through a blinding rainstorm which is very likely to
                                    be the beginning of the rainy season- Had a good time at Arayat, It broke the
                                    monotony at least.</p>
                        <p>July 4th This is our second Fourth in the Phillippines but as there are only two
                                    companies here now, everthing is about quiet as usual.</p>
                        <p>July 20 I was appointed corp'l again, just a year since I resigned-I have
                                    been clerking in the office but now I expect I will do straight duty</p>
                        <p>Aug 8. A party of 25 including myself embarked last night in small boats, with native
                                    boatmen and paddled across country to Mondeli, We did not wear shoes—When
                                    we arrived there the party divided and scoured the country in different directions
                                    1st Sergt. Maney, Pots [Albert C. Potter], [Gillis] Green, [Joseph Kolal] Kalal and
                                    [Lindon] Herberg came across some of the insurgents, and had to retreat to us, they
                                    barely escaped capture.</p>
                        <p>Sept 5th The rainy season is on now in full blast.</p>
                        <p>Last night a typhoon struck the town, and the wind blew so hard that all our quarters
                                    were blohrn down-We had time to get out of them, but all our clothes were damaged by
                                    the rain and mud.</p>
                        <p>We took refuge in the convent untill morning, when we moved our property to the
                                    convent in with "M." Co.</p>
                        <p>The country is nothing but a huge lake, We go through the streets in boats and on
                                    rafts.</p>
                        <p>Sept 12 Three days ago "M" and "K" Co were
                                    relieved by "B" Co 41st Vols. We went to San Miguel in cascos
                                    across the country, S. M. is about 14 miles southeast, We came back to Candaba
                                    today.</p>
                        <p>It was a hard trip as we were so cramped in the cascos (barges)</p>
                        <p>We had natives to pole us over the water.</p>

                        <p>I would not be surprised if we moved up the river farther very soon.</p>
                        <p>Oct 4. After being here in Candaba for over one year and a half, we have been ordered
                                    to move up in the province of Nueva Excija [Ecija].</p>
                        <p>We are all sorry to leave, and the people are trying their best to get the order

                                    that—The roads are still knee deep with mud. Last night the Co. went out
                                    and re-captured two men of the 24th Inf. that had been held prisoners for a long

                        <p>We marched all night in mud and water above our knees. In the little scrap that
                                    followed one of the American Negros were killed, the other we brought in, along with

                        <p>Nov 1. More scouting for the deserter and traitor Fagan [U. I.], I think he has left
                                    this parts, for we are making things very uncomfortable for the rebels in this
                                    vicinity. But it takes lots of hard "hiking" to keep them
                                    scattered.</p>
                        <p>Nov. 23 I went to Manila on pass, Had a fine time. Manila is still the same old

                        <p>Dec 5 This is my 20th Birthday and a big celebration—a dark brown taste in
                                    the morning. I am in my last year of Service now.</p>
                        <p>25. Christmas again, I rec'd a few presents, but did not send any as they
                                    probably would never reach Manila, let alone the <placeName>

                        <p>Had an excellent Xmas dinner.</p>
                        <p>1901</p>
                        <p>Jany 1st Last night as the Old Year went out and the New came in, I was out with a
                                    detachment of 25 searching for a noted outlaw and Lt. Col. of the guerillas. Part of
                                    us were dressed in Filipino clothes, We searched all the houses between Jaen and San
                                    Antonio, but failed to get him.</p>
                        <p>Several recruits have just joined the Co.</p>
                        <p>I feel for them if they have to stay here three years.</p>
                        <p>5th Our new Captian has taken command of the company. He has just arrived from the
                                    U.S.</p>
                        <p>Lt. Hannay, who has been in command of "K’ troop for about 18
                                    months, has taken command of the river Gunboat
                                    "Napindan"—We are sorry to see him go.</p>
                        <p>19. 50 men of Co. left station today and went to the mountains-I suppose it is purely
                                    a scouting expedition.</p>
                        <p>22 The town of Jaen was threatened today by the gugus. they swore they would burn it
                                    down, I guess it was another big bluff.</p>
                        <p>29 The 50 men returned today-they look as if they had had a hard time of it and I
                                    think they did by what they say. Gen Funston "buscowed" [searched]
                                    the mts. but did not find but few insurrectos.</p>
                        <p>Feby 8— The Company moved from Jaen to Gapan Nueva Ecija. We are much
                                    pleased as it is a much better location <list type="footnotes">

                                    [Pafiaranda]. We searched all the shacks but did not find any thing</p>

                        <p>7 All the M. D's. were out last night searching of Jose, he robbed Lieut

                                    From all appearances the Maccabebens received a severe drubbing at the hands of Gen

                    during the speech. He first contrasted America and Europe. In one there were freedom and harmony. In
                    the other, under arrogant rulers, "twenty centuries of blood have watered the red-hot
                    chains, and still the fetters are not broken." He went then to his main point, that for its

                    of the union of the states two years before, then took off his hat, swung it over his head, and
                    shouted "Hurrah for the Union!" The audience roared "Hurrah" in

                    </placeName>. He had first appealed for creation of the organization in a letter to Governor Wright.
                    "Since I cannot address everyone," wrote Kossuth, associations must
                    "carry my message," "rouse the public mind," and
                    "collect money" for Hungarian freedom.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> He also had circulars

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In these he set forth his need for the fruits of such associations, citing especially
                    the situation in 1848 when his 400,000 man army had only 150,000 muskets.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                    Wright in turn moved for formation of the Indiana association at a public meeting in the hall of the
                    House of Representatives on February 28, 1852. The association's constitution, then
                    adopted, prescribed such routine matters as offices and meeting dates. It further provided for an
                    executive committee of "one influential citizen" from each county to supervise
                    formation of local chapters.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Annual dues were a dollar, payable at twenty-five

            <p>Party politics had also dictated the nature of the Indiana assembly's joint resolution of

            <p>Catholic hostility to the Hungarian intensified that quarrel. Archbishop John Hughes and Orestes
                    Brownson, then the national leaders of Catholicism, publicly denounced Kossuth. They called him a
                    rabid Protestant who had revolted against a Catholic monarch, who now wanted help to repeat his
                    mischief, and who praised the English government, long anti-Catholic.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> Since
                    many Catholics had also allied themselves with the Whigs against the seemingly anti-Catholic

            <p>In addition to political disputes, Kossuth left beards, bills, and his name behind. Male America had
                    long been cleanshaven, but men cultivated beards in imitation of his, and Kossuth won "the

                    pot or stew pan on his cranium, there would be plenty of fashionables to wear them also. Several
                    little urchins about town are wearing ‘Kossuths' with feathers…

            <p>Such is the story of Kossuth in Indiana. The state requested succor for him when he went into exile.

                    </placeName>. Her German organizations feted him. Indiana citizens bought his bonds and contributed
                    to his cause. They erupted into political and religious controversy over him, wore Kossuth beards
                    and hats, and paid his bills. Today a town and a street named after him are the only public
                    reminders in Indiana of a once-famous man who thought himself inspired by God but who did little
                    more than sow the wind and write his words in water.</p>

            <p>This work is what it purports to be: memoirs. No sources are given, no credit or recognition is given
                    for anything already written on the subject, and no index is included.</p>
            <p>The subject, then, <hi rend="i">is</hi> Clessie L. Cummins. The life he describes is one full of
                    successes, but due notice is given to heartaches and disappointments.</p>
            <p>These memoirs trace the development of the high-speed diesel, which in itself is perhaps the prime
                    reason for the growth of the trucking industry. One story follows another in rapid order. Cummins
                    tested Marmon cars. He became chauffeur and handy man for William G. Irwin, famed banker and
                    entrepreneur of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He sold one idea after another to Irwin and to Irwin's relatives:
                    support of his machine shop; support of what proved to be a wild venture in building small engines
                    for Sears, Roebuck and Company; financial backing during a decade of almost continual losses. Much
                    space is given to highly amusing accounts of "the Barnum and Bailey days" when,
                    lacking funds for a normal advertising campaign, Cummins pulled off one stunt after another-all with
                    excellent results.</p>
            <p>Great names appear throughout the book. Cummins, aided and abetted by William G. Irwin, sought
                    contacts and had interesting experiences with railroad magnates, automotive giants, government
                    heads, and, on occasion, foreign dignitaries. The pursuit of those whose influence might be helpful
                    in the growth of the engine company paid off in some cases. In a few instances, however, Cummins and
                    Irwin failed. Henry Ford, General Motors, Baldwin Locomotives, Walter P. Chrysler—all are
                    mentioned and listed as having failed to appreciate the potential of the Cummins product. But one
                    notes no bitterness in the chronicle over the hopes that died.</p>
            <p>There is a sad note in the account, and it is regrettable. The relations between the two truly great
                    men, William G. Irwin and Clessie L. Cummins, grew more and more strained as the years went by. The
                    untimely death of Irwin prevented the reconciliation which, this writer believes, might have
                    occurred.</p>
            <p>Basically, the work is an interesting account of the growth of a company whose life was given it by
                    two clever, intelligent, and noble men. The book is a contribution of value and should be widely
                    read by students of recent American history.</p>

                        </placeName>.</hi> By Thomas T. McAvoy. (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1967.
                    Pp. xi, 514. Frontispiece, notes, index. $7.60.)</head>
            <p>Father McAvoy has written the first scholarly biography of a recent leader of the Catholic Church in
                    America. The author meticulously covers the details of O'Hara's career from his
                    Notre Dame <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-063-4-056"/> days and his wartime work as assistant bishop for
                    chaplains to his postwar achievements as bishop of Buffalo and then <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although McAvoy seldom steps back from his coverage of O'Hara's
                    daily activities to an evaluation of the broad significance of his career, the subject nevertheless
                    emerges as the paradigm of ante-aggiornamento Catholic conservatism. O'Hara was devoted
                    above all to the spiritual salvation of Catholics by means of daily communion and plentiful
                    parochial schools. Distrustful of liturgical, political, or economic liberalism, he buttressed his
                    opposition to "dangerous influences" with the papal authority of Pius X and Pius
                    XII. Besides communism, O'Hara saw grave spiritual and moral dangers in nudity, birth
                    control, Hemingway, behaviorism, interfaith dialogue, Time magazine, socialized medicine, sociology,
                    and federal aid to education.</p>
            <p>As Notre Dame's prefect of religion in the 1920's and its president in the
                    1930's, O'Hara encouraged the diversification of the curriculum, a statistical
                    output of daily communions to match the school's athletic achievements, and the purging of
                    the library. Convinced that "a book in which God does not appear is against God"
                    (p. 305), he roamed the stacks looking for dangerous books. To help the nervous librarian,
                    O'Hara always preserved the title pages of the volumes to be burned.</p>
            <p>Painstakingly, perhaps painfully, the author recounts O'Hara's many crusades,
                    ranging from his efforts to stop the distribution of contraceptives in the wartime army to his
                    denunciation of "lay cardinals" who "out of the wealth of their ignorance
                    and inexperience … broadcast their views on Gregorian chant, homiletics, hermeneutics,
                    the Pauline privilege, and ecclesiastical art" (p. 122).</p>
            <p>O'Hara resented insinuations that Notre Dame valued football uppermost. The aims of the
                    university, he countered, were the salvation of souls, clean living, and the study of what he
                    referred to as "Catholic art, Catholic literature, Catholic science, Catholic philosophy,
                    Catholic economics, and Catholic sociology" (p. 171).</p>
            <p>Although the biography sometimes bogs down in the discussion of small controversies, it affords a
                    unique insight into the mind of American Catholicism in the days before President Kennedy and Pope
                    John XXIII. Unfortunately the reader is treated to a ghastly amount of graphic detail on
                    O'Hara's poor health. The man died well, but his death throes could better have
                    been summarized briefly instead of spread out through two chapters.</p>

            <p>It is rather surprising that a second- or third-rate political figure such as Joseph Lane of Indiana
                    and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> should be accorded two scholarly biographies, separated though they are by exactly a
                    quarter century. The answer, in part, may be that the earlier of these, <hi rend="i">The <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-063-4-057"/> Career of Joseph Lane, Frontier Politician</hi> by Sister M.
                    Margaret Kelly, is basically a biography, whereas the present book is largely a study of Lane as an
                    inveterate machine politician during his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> career from 1848 to its denouement in 1860. Roughly one-third of the Kelly book is
                    devoted to Joe Lane's Indiana-Mexican life. Hendrickson, however, takes identity for
                    granted and initially refers to his subject simply as "General Joseph Lane, the ‘<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> of the Mexican War' and the ‘Cincinnatus of
                    Indiana"’ (p. 2), followed by one brief paragraph on Lane's pioneer
                    family background. In view of this limited background material it may well be that Hoosier interest
                    in this new book will be to observe how well one of its own fared in outside political fields.</p>
            <p>The present author has had one significant advantage over Sister Kelly in the preparation of his
                    book; he was able to use the Lane Papers now housed in the Lilly Library at Indiana University,
                    whereas his predecessor prepared her study prior to the availability for scholarly use of this
                    important manuscript collection. It is, however, incorrect for Hendrickson to declare, as he does in
                    his introduction, that the Lane Collection was "hitherto unused." It has been
                    previously used, and at least one article based solely upon the collection appeared in the <hi rend="i">Indiana University Bookman</hi> more than a decade ago. This comment does not mean to
                    imply that Hendrickson has been remiss in the use of materials related to his subject. He has made
                    exhaustive use not only of Lane manuscript sources but also of sources for persons associated with
                    him-including "the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Clique."</p>
            <p>The product is a thorough and very readable treatise on machine politics as they were deftly managed
                    by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator.</p>
            <p>Hendrickson is, on the whole, somewhat move critical of Lane as a political figure than was Sister
                    Kelly. His over-all estimate is well summarized in a brief epilogue. He credits Lane with
                    "most faithful and energetic" (p. 253) service and with being an effective
                    representative in Congress. He declares Lane to have been "a colorful if not particularly
                    attractive personality and a man of unquestioned personal integrity" (p. 253). He was also
                    egotistical, ambitious, shrewd, and demagogic. If he stood for a principle at the time of sectional
                    crisis, it was "that the majority must not tyrannize over the minority" (p. 265).</p>

            <p>This slight volume is solely concerned with federal mineral policy in the Galena lead district,
                    1824-1847, and makes little or no effort to place the story of lead mining in its larger economic
                    setting. No <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-063-4-058"/> mention is made of federal mineral leasing policy
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> of the same period. It may not be fair to ask more of the author than he intended to
                    do, and certainly the first experience of the American government in dealing with its minerals
                    needed attention, yet one could wish for a treatment of lead mining of the scale and with the
                    technological knowledge that Rodman Paul has given to gold mining.</p>
            <p>The story is not a pleasant one. It reveals a low standard of public morals in officials charged with
                    the administration of the lands, the leases, and collections in the lead district and the tarnished
                    reputation of the entrepreneurs engaged in the mining. The author finds that the leasing system
                    seemed to work fairly well at the outset, which is somewhat surprising, but that it soon broke down.
                    Through dissimulation, influential people in the region, including prominent politicians, were able
                    to persuade the government that much lead-bearing land contained no minerals so that it could be
                    sold.</p>
            <p>Administration of the leasing, collection, and sale of the rent lead was handled by the War
                    Department rather than by the General Land Office. This divided responsibility did not work for the
                    best. The author has used the local deed records and is aware of the speculation in lead-bearing
                    land carried on by local people supplied with capital from the east. He has made no effort, however,
                    to show the extent of their purchases. He is concerned with the "profitability" of
                    mining and smelting, but the operations were on such a small, individualistic scale and participated
                    in so widely that he is not able to be very concrete. Some attention is given to the gradual shift
                    from mining to agriculture.</p>
            <p>Widespread discontent with leasing and a concerted drive in Congrese to end the system, led by that
                    redoubtable champion of free enterprise, "Old Bullion" <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, resulted in 1846 in what the author calls the "desocialization" of
                    the mineral reservation policy. The reserved lands were to be sold as other public lands were sold,
                    first at public auction and thereafter at private entry, except that no preemption rights were to be
                    recognized until after the public offering. Tracts on which mines were actually being worked were to
                    be offered in small lots at a minimum price of $2.50 an acre, and working mines then
                    under lease were not to be sold until the leases expired. Wright has produced a useful account of a
                    small segment of a big and much needed history of federal mineral policy.</p>

            <p>Much newspaper history is no more than superficial chronology shored up by a liberal use of
                    quotations. The present book fits more into that genre than anything else, but not entirely. The
                    author, <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-063-4-059"/> professor of journalism at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, begins his account with the publication of the first newspaper in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> in 1849 and finds 1860 a justifiable cut-off point because that was the year the
                    telegraph line reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>He recognizes in the foreword that "One approaches research in a specialized segment of
                    regional history hoping it is justified as a part of the whole." Such an approach is
                    justified, but Hage forces the reader to perceive the relationships between his treatment of certain
                    characteristics of the frontier press and that which others have observed elsewhere. These include
                    the importance of public printing contracts to the foundation of early newspapers, the promotional
                    and town-boosting function of the frontier editor which had more than a little to do with
                    determining the trend of Western urbanization, and the extreme partisanship of most local
                    newspapers.</p>
            <p>However, Hage has set out to write a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> journalism during a limited period, and that is what he has accomplished, albeit with a
                    parochialism that is sometimes frustrating to the general reader. As almost always happens in
                    journalism history, he treats the newspaper as though it were an editorial entity only, with only
                    perfunctory attention to advertising and subscription. Nowhere does he treat the early newspapers as
                    business institutions or attempt to show their place in the emerging economy of territory and state.
                    But, then, the paucity of personal and business records of early editors often hamstrings the
                    historian in this area, too. While Hage does include the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> journalism in his scope, his emphasis is on newspapers in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName> area. An appendix lists all the newspapers involved.</p>
            <p>Hage goes into considerable detail in recounting the political position of the major newspapers. This
                    effort, although appropriate to such a study, involves him in a forced rehash of early political
                    history in which the significance, if any, of the attendant editorial sound and fury is not clearly
                    indicated. At the same time, he does give a clear idea of the general pattern of content, which,
                    incidentally, shows no departure from the norm for that period.</p>
            <p>A frontier historian would appreciate more analysis of the background of the early editors, the areas
                    from which they emigrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, and where they went next. Some of that information is present, to be sure, in brief

            <p>In all fairness to Hage's conscientious research, clarity of writing, and controlled
                    organization, it should be pointed out that his book is of considerable value to subject and area
                    specialists. Because this review is intended for non-<placeName>

                    </placeName> readers, it deliberately views the book from the vantage point of one who would have
                    wanted some useful generalizations or, at least, more indications of relationships.</p>

                    its 1965 International Conference on the North American Fur Trade. Originally, these papers were
                    presented in the Winter, 1966, issue of <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> History</hi> but this new book permits their wider circulation.</p>
            <p>The essays were selected to illustrate the variety of viewpoints and disciplines which have interests
                    in the North American fur trade. The choices were well made; if the remaining papers were of equal
                    quality, readers must regret their omission, although some degree of repetition has surely been
                    avoided by using the smaller number.</p>
            <p>The editors made a happy choice in using Dale L. Morgan's mature and contemplative
                    "The Fur Trade and its Historians" as the initial essay. The phrase
                    "publish-and-perish" is used to focus his ire on hasty or lazy writers; his
                    discussion of the significance of Hiram Martin Chittenden's The American Fur Trade of the
                    Far West is convincing; and his plea for extending the peripheral interests of historical research
                    is gracefully written.</p>
            <p>This reviewer found the essays by W. L. Morton and K. G. Davies concise and well-written
                    condensations of information on the North West Company and on the competition between it and the
                    Hudson's Bay Company. Davies' work is a welcome contribution to a subject too
                    often presented in redundant detail. David Lavender has a sure grasp of the essential and
                    interesting aspects of the American Fur Company, gleaned from the usual sources. This historical
                    novelist has much to teach the historian whose writing is pedestrian in style.</p>
            <p>J. D. Herbert and Merrill J. Mattes contribute pictorial essays of fur trade sites of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, the Plains, and the Rockies. Both add to the understanding of the primitive aspects of
                    the fur trade in those regions. Wilcomb E. Washburn's "Symbol, Utility and
                    Aesthetics in the Indian Fur Trade" goes beyond its apparent themes to stress the relations
                    between traders and Indians, and the social and economic utility of their rendezvous as traders.</p>
            <p>John Witthoft deserts the object-centered study of the archaeologist to coordinate European and
                    American history with historical Indian movements to clarify the technological production of Indian
                    trade goods. He believes the archaeologist must deal with Indian culture in relation to European
                    technology.</p>
            <p>James L. Clayton accepts a larger challenge in his essay on the "Growth and Economic
                    Significance of the American Fur Trade, 1790-1890." A few of his assumptions are on
                    uncertain grounds, and he nearly ignores the influences on the trade made by style and fabric
                    changes. Nevertheless, Clayton moves with assurance between Asian-European and American fur markets,
                    while challenging the shibboleth of monopolistic efficiency in the trade. He proves that the Great
                    Lakes <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-063-4-061"/> area, especially the <geogName>Kankakee River</geogName>
                    region, was of paramount importance to the fur trade of the period, primarily because of its
                    production of raccoon skins. Both white and Indian fur producers played a major role in economic
                    development, at least in this region. Even more important, he gives incontrovertible evidence that
                    the bulk of fur production ultimately depended on the "egg-money trapper" of the
                    white settlements, while traders for Indian furs profited through their access to Indiana treaty
                    debt claims and annuities (p. 68). Despite this, Clayton clearly demonstrates his statement that the
                    fur trade "actually was of no importance to the economy of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a whole …" (p. 71).</p>
            <p>The citations are extensive and carefully presented, the numerous illustrations are well chosen and
                    placed in context, and the four maps are valuable additions. Through these essays, the society amply
                    indicates that its 1965 conference was worthwhile. The scholarly range of its program merits the
                    circulation this little book should enjoy.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Irish and Irish Politicians: A Study of Cultural and Social Alienation.</hi> By
                    Edward M. Levine. (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1966. Pp. ix, 241. Appendices,
                    notes, index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>In an attempt to analyze the phenomenon of "the American Irish politician," Edward
                    Levine utilizes a third of his book to survey cultural, social, and political aspects of Irish
                    history from the Reformation to modern times. The genesis of the "Irish identity"
                    is examined and related to the centuries of religious persecutions, political privations, and
                    economic discrimination under British rule, which endowed the Irish with a keen, if not perverse,
                    appreciation of power. The fact that predominantly rural immigrant Irishmen became part of a
                    political power structure as eastern urban dwellers, rather than as midwestern farmers, does not
                    seem unusual to the author. As cotters or squatters most of them never had been part of the
                    propertied agricultural class in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The chapter entitled "Symbols of Irish Identity and Alienation" will be of special
                    interest to the social historian and behavioral scientist alike. Levine views the power ascent of
                    the Irish clergy within the American Catholic Church as one of the key factors delaying the
                    "structural assimilation" of the Irish into the general population. And he
                    convincingly demonstrates the culpability of the parochial school in preserving Irish ethnic
                    identity. Conservatism isolated the Irish further, inhibiting their attitudes on nearly everything
                    from abolition to political reform. In addition, Irish assimilation was also hampered by forces in
                    middle-class Protestant America which were inimical to a working-class Catholic, alien group.
                    Despite discrimination the Irish regarded even such extreme nativist groups as the Know-Nothings
                    preferable <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-063-4-062"/> to some German immigrants who were imbued with
                    atheistic Marxist doctrines. "Apostacy was more reprehensible than heresy" (P.
                    91).</p>
            <p>Levine is strongest on the subject he knows best, the phenomenon of the contemporary Irish
                    politician. In the urban setting, the saloon and the police department are seen as institutions
                    which figured prominently in the "politicization" of the American Irish social
                    structure. Using the example of their church, Irish political organizations naturally became
                    hierarchical and authoritarian. However, in the 1960's Levine sees traditional traits
                    gradually dying out. Mayor Daley of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is viewed as a "transitional" Irish politician, who can now assume
                    status roles inconceivable a few decades ago. Generalizing upon his findings among the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Irish, Levine concludes that the current generation of Irish politicians is probably
                    the last of its kind. Admittedly, his conclusions are too thinly supported by the evidence which he
                    offers, but his contribution is valuable in that it provides the prologue for some future
                    Handlin-like work on the Irish in <placeName>

                    and the successive presidencies of Samuel P. Colt, Charles B. Seger, and Francis B. Davis, Jr.
                    During this time the organization took shape and grew, and procedures shifted and adapted to
                    changing business conditions. Profits vacilated and products multiplied as management sought answers
                    to new industrial demands.</p>
            <p>The early years emphasized organization, consolidation, and expansion in rubber footware production
                    and sales. Dozens of industrial plants were absorbed, each retaining its product identity, competing
                    fiercely with other articles produced by the corporation. During Colt's presidency
                    (1901-1918) the company expanded overseas and began producing tires and nonrubber related items.

                    instituted; and employee relations improved. Company worth jumped from $47 million to

            <p>Charles B. Seger (president, 1919-1928) is characterized as lacking executive skill and knowledge.
                    His problems were legion-wartime strains, price and sales decline, heavy competition, deteriorating
                    labor relations, research mistakes, overly-centralized administration, large indebtedness, and
                    marketing shifts. All together they contributed to a <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-063-4-063"/> disastrous
                    financial picture. Francis B. Davis, Jr. (president, 1929-1942) took the company through the
                    critical depression years, while solving his inherited problems. He reorganized management, reduced
                    costs, lowered indebtedness, and introduced new products, aided by a hustling sales force. By 1935
                    the company again showed a profit.</p>
            <p>The basic documented facts of this history are useful reference guides to the growth of this great
                    American company. Unfortunately, the presentation lacks a harsh editor's pencil. Syntax and
                    diction need attention, and proportion is askew. Historical perspective is absent, for the company
                    is treated apart from America's industrial growth. Few explanations spell out the
                    "why" of specific company actions, and questions tumble endlessly into the
                    reader's mind.</p>

                    Notes, index. $4.50.)</head>
            <p>This is a small book, but a significant one. Most historians agree that technology and its influence
                    on American history have been sadly neglected, and Brooke Hindle spells out just how great this
                    neglect has been.</p>
            <p>The first part of the book is a 28-page essay in which the author raises pertinent questions about
                    the history of technology in America before 1850 and offers suggestions for areas of basic research.
                    Hindle presents a number of challenging ideas. For example, he suggests that the driving force for
                    technical advance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> may be found within technology itself rather than from technology as a means to some
                    desired end. Technological development may have been, he says, "a satisfying emotional
                    experience" (p. 24). Hindle also raises questions about the connections and
                    interrelationships between technology and American society as a whole. He calls for the placement of
                    technology in the full stream of American history rather than its insertion as a rivulet here and
                    there.</p>
            <p>Following this stimulating essay, which raises many more questions than it answers, the author
                    presents a 65-page annotated and critical bibliography of early American technology. This piece of
                    work is tremendously useful, especially for scholars in general American history, economics, and
                    historians of special aspects of technological development. After listing guides and general sources
                    in this field of study, the author cites special works dealing with the technology of agriculture
                    and food processing, mining and metals, military technology, transportation, engineering,
                    manufacturing, and other aspects of technological development. Hindle treats bibliographical
                    materials with the knowledge and judgment that come from mastery of a field.</p>
            <p>The last section of the book is by Lucius F. Ellsworth and includes a directory of artifact
                    collections. It is important for historians to <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-063-4-064"/> know the
                    literature of early technology, but it is also vital for them to learn where they can see the actual
                    artifacts which represent the nation's technical progress. Ellsworth fills an important gap
                    by telling his readers what they can find, and where. In general, this book will challenge and serve
                    its readers for many years.</p>

                    lines between the Indians of the Appalachian frontier and their rapidly encroaching white neighbors.
                    The author treats the period from the issuance of the great proclamation to the eve of the American
                    Revolution as a unit of frontier advance. He deals with three main driving forces. The first was the
                    almost insoluable problem of developing an administrative procedure of frontier control following
                    the French and Indian War. The Proclamation Line of 1763 was a landmark attempt to bring about some
                    tenable solution for the spreading problem of land claimants. A second issue was the importance of
                    land itself in the dynamics of the westward movement and especially in its relationship to the
                    homelands of southern Indians. Finally there was the complex matter of establishing identifiable
                    lines and marks across the rugged Appalachian highlands.</p>
            <p>Involved in Indian claims to the eastern highlands were the Catawbas, Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, and
                    Chickasaw. De Vorsey gives considerable attention to the historical background of these Indians.
                    Some discussion of variable land uses and Indian attitudes toward the territory is also included. Of
                    necessity a summary of administrative Indian policies is included, translated in terms of the
                    successes of John Stuart as a southern Indian agent.</p>
            <p>The strong pressures exerted in the earliest phases against the Cherokee frontier were of central
                    concern. These were felt along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and Carolina frontiers, and from the Watauga area to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. From 1750 and 1751, with the entry of land scouts Thomas Walker and Christopher Gist
                    west of the Appalachians, friction and confusion existed over the location of a dividing line
                    between colonial and Indian territories. This situation became especially complicated by the
                    agreements made at Hard Labor in October, 1768, and at Fort Stanwix the same month. The Hard Labor
                    and Lochaber agreements made in western <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> involved the establishment of dividing lines.</p>
            <p>Historians of the westward movement and colonial policies have labored in darkness and in error on
                    the subject of the various lines that were established between the eastern flowing headstreams,
                    Chis-well's lead mines, and the mouth of the <geogName>Kanawha River</geogName>. None of
                    these lines provoked more controversey than did that established by John Donelson in 1771.
                    Fortunately De Vorsey has been able to clarify the facts behind these interesting surveys. He has
                    done the same for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and East <placeName>

                    </placeName> Indian boundaries.</p>
            <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-063-4-065"/>
            <p>Throughout this book the reader is given an insight into the monstrous problems of locating lines, of
                    marking them, and of establishing and planting durable landmarks and witnesses. Calls were stated in
                    terms of miles, stream courses, and mountain ranges, but they were no less vague and confusing than
                    those given for small tracts of settler lands.</p>
            <p>In the final analysis the question arises as to the ultimate significance of an established Indian
                    boundary. Perhaps the Crown would have attempted to see that it was honored for a time at least, but
                    in the face of the American Revolution it had no real significance.</p>
            <p>This study is long overdue, but it needed to be done by a scholar with a geographical orientation.
                    The care with which this author has examined documentary materials and platted his maps gives the
                    reader confidence in the results.</p>

            <p>A group of radio lectures provided the first draft of this book, and unfortunately not enough
                    revisions were made before its printing. Admittedly, space limitations and the fact that the series
                    is directed at the general reader place certain restrictions on the authors, but several other
                    contributors to this series have overcome these handicaps and produced superior volumes. Among them
                    one might mention Samuel P. Hays, William E. Leuchtenburg, Harry L. Coles, and Charles P. Roland.
                    Smith has not performed as well as they.</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact, this volume is rather superficial and is characterized by far too little
                    analysis and penetrating interpretation. For example, the chapter on "Democracy and Its
                    Leaders" is primarily a series of capsule biographies of well-known figures; there is no
                    attempt to wrestle with the issues of the changing political situation and the almost constant
                    ferment and shifting of party allegiances of the period under study. The chapter called
                    "There Were Sections" adequately delimits the areas geographically, but it neither
                    describes the strong community of interests between the South and the Old Northwest nor indicates
                    the sharp differences existing within the various sections. Further, the treatment of the Compromise
                    of 1850 leaves chronology of developments confused and provisions of the measures obscure.</p>
            <p>More serious than the absence of analysis and synthesis is the inclusion of a number of misleading or
                    incorrect statements. A few of these must be noted. Did the Compromise of 1820 bar slavery in the
                    "vast area north of the southern border of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> between the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> and the Rockies," and did
                    the South during the debates over the Compromise of 1850 "openly accept the right of the
                    federal government to prohibit slavery in the territories" (p. 7)? Was slavery abandoned in
                    the Northeast before the Revolution (p. 19)? Were there 4,216,000 slaves in 1860 (p. 20)? In 1824
                    did Calhoun <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-063-4-066"/> accept the "vice-presidency in the runoff
                    between Jackson and Adams" (p. 46)? Is it not taking too much poetic license to say that
                    "Overnight some 100,000 immigrants scrambling for riches poured into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> by land and sea, and every kind of lawlessness quickly followed" (p. 99)? And
                    just how does one arrive at the conclusion that "nearly 800,000 Negroes served voluntarily
                    in the Union armies" and there were 68,000 "losses" among these troops
                    (p. 193)? This would have meant that every free Negro, North and South, plus about 300,000 slaves
                    enlisted with the federal forces. Actually the number was less than 200,000.</p>
            <p>These and numerous other statements which fail to make fine, but important, distinctions
                    substantially decrease the value of this work. There are more than the allowable number of errors in
                    the suggested reading section, especially on page 210. For these and some of the other mistakes,
                    perhaps the editor of the series and the University of <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Political Literature of the Progressive Era.</hi> Edited, with an introduction by
                    George L. Groman. ([East Lansing]: <placeName>

            <p>In the literature of the Progressive Era there are numerous collections of muckraking articles which
                    appeared in the popular magazines of the time. In contrast, little or no attention has been given to
                    the muckraking fiction that appeared during the same years. The present volume attempts to remedy
                    this imbalance.</p>
            <p>George L. Groman has assembled a collection designed to illustrate the diversity of American
                    political fiction during the Populist-Progressive period. He has also contributed a succinct
                    introduction and a series of brief sketches about the authors of the pieces. The result is a
                    well-planned and interesting book which adds to our knowledge of the reform drive that was
                    Progressivism.</p>
            <p>Groman has included in this study selections from a dozen writers, many well known and others largely
                    obscure. Some, like Hamlin Garland, Booth Tarkington, and William Allen White, were famous as
                    authors in other fields of literature. Men like Lincoln Steffens, David Graham Phillips, and Elliot
                    Flower were practicing muckraking journalists who for the moment turned their talents to fiction.
                    Brand Whitlock was better known as a diplomat and public official. Included also are excerpts from
                    Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and Frank Norris' The Octopus. Together the selections
                    range from the rural protests of the Populists to the more subtle exposures during the days of the
                    New Freedom.</p>
            <p>Frequently fiction can portray a situation with greater completeness and truth than can a documented
                    factual report. Certainly, Phillips has depicted the struggle for power in The Plum Tree more
                    meaningfully to the general reader than could a literal account of the <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-063-4-067"/> events on which it was based. The horror that was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Packing-town was brought home to the average citizen far more fully in the
                    pages of The Jungle than in the report of the official investigation. Thus muckraking fiction
                    augmented the muckraking articles and added to the wave of literature of exposure which helped bring
                    on the reforms of the Progressive Era.</p>
            <p>The reviewer might criticize Groman for his selection of certain pieces to the exclusion of others.
                    Several of the stories are a bit repetitious and the chief figures are mere stereotypes. In a few
                    cases the accounts are brief and seem incomplete. But these are minor quibbles. In general the
                    selections are judiciously made and the impact of the volume is distinctly favorable. This
                    collection of muckraking fiction is a welcome and useful addition to the growing shelf of
                    Progressive literature.</p>

                    examining and using this index, as this reviewer has done, will find it most valuable.</p>
            <p>As the introduction notes, related indices are needed. Gathering data and editing this compilation,
                    however, was obviously a herculean task even without attempting to select and include dissertations
                    of an historical nature from other subjects and areas. The subject index to this volume is most
                    helpful, but there is no satisfactory substitute for examining the text page by page. Since the
                    index proper lists theses alphabetically by author, no author index was needed.</p>
            <p>Disssrtations in History is not without its errors, both of omission and commission. This situation
                    results largely because "historians, who are so concerned with the records of others, have
                    been so shoddy in keeping their own or in seeing that their institutions maintain complete files (p.
                    ix)." Compiler Kuehl reports that he did not find even a single instance of a university
                    whose records concerning its own dissertations were "found to be fully accurate or complete
                    (p. x)."</p>
            <p>An analysis of this index reveals various gaps in historical dissertations. For instance, authors of
                    doctoral theses have generally neglected topics in local and state history and they have also
                    neglected topics regarding the Middle West. Librarians, teachers, researchers, administrators, and
                    interested citizens alike should combine their efforts and take significant steps to remedy this
                    unfortunate situation. (Similar observations were offered by editor Kuehl himself in his discussion
                    of <hi rend="i">Disssrtations in History</hi> which appeared in the American Historical Association

            <p>This, the second volume of Woodrow Wilson's papers, encompasses a formative period in his
                    life, from January 1, 1881, to January 31, 1884. During these years Wilson tried and abandoned the
                    practice of law, fell in and out of love with his cousin, Harriet Woodrow, met and won his future
                    wife, Ellen Louise Axson, and decided (ironically, almost by chance) to pursue his yearning for
                    literary-scholarly-political distinction via graduate study at the Johns Hopkins University. Nearly
                    half of this volume is devoted to the last six months of 1883, when Wilson's two most
                    important goals, acceptance by Miss Axson and return to "those subjects whose study most
                    delights me" (p. 357), were realized. Even if one repudiates the importance assigned to
                    these years by Bullitt and Freud's collaborative catastrophe, the documentary record
                    presented here in full, fascinating detail is of tremendous value for understanding Wilson the
                    public figure and the private man.</p>
            <p>This volume is continued evidence that The Papers of Woodrow Wilson, under Arthur S. Link's
                    skilled editorship, is a historical accomplishment of the first magnitude. It demonstrates that
                    necessary fusion of subject and editor which, unfortunately, is so rarely achieved. One might wish
                    that certain of Wilson's replies to missives from friends and relatives had been preserved;
                    one could raise gentle objection to type choice or to place of insertion of editorial notes. But
                    these quibbles do not detract at all from the volume's excellence.</p>
            <p>Notably, this volume contains many heretofore unpublished documents, especially the remarkable
                    exchange of letters between Wilson and Miss Axson. Their letters reveal two young adults expressing,
                    not some abnormal condition of mother or father substitution, but healthy attachment and growing,
                    deserved ~espect for each other's ideas and aspirations. The thoroughly-entranced
                    "Woodrow" who wrote such epic, fervent letters may have been somewhat priggish and
                    hypersensitive, but he did not lack the ability (occasionally) to laugh at himself or even (at
                    times) to throw off his hopeless didacticism. Wilson's descriptions in these letters of his
                    first term in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, supplemented by notebooks and other writings, provide useful information about his
                    participation in and reaction to the changing, "experimental" academic environment
                    then taking hold at Johns Hopkins.</p>
            <p>Above all, the man Wilson was and was to become stands revealed in the record of these years. It
                    shows, for example, how much of a southerner he was in background, interests, and outlook. The later
                    influence of this factor is obvious from reading—in context— "Stray
                    Thoughts from the South," ‘(Culture and Education at the South," and
                    other writings. Finally, one finds ample expression of Wilson's awesome ambition, that
                    daemon which was driving him to satisfy his "love for composition … keen desire
                    to become a master of philosophical discourse and of the art of public speech," with the
                    ultimate purpose of making himself "an outside force in politics" (pp. 357-58).
                    Volume II demonstrates with what ardor and unbending determination Wilson set these goals for
                    himself and began to make his way toward their attainment.</p>

                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> I. Cohen. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 1967. Pp. xv, 252. Notes, index. $7.95.)</head>
            <p>The author treats revisionism both in a historical sense and as a debate engaged in by scholars
                    seeking to shape American foreign policy. Although Cohen traces revisionism in the writings of five
                    men—Harry Elmer Barnes, Charles A. Beard, C. Hartley Gratton, Walter Millis, and Charles
                    C. Tansill—he neither commends nor condemns their ideas.</p>
            <p>The seeds of revisionism were sown in liberal periodicals such as The Nation and The New Republic. By
                    1924 revisionism found its champion in Harry E. Barnes who, within a year, was convinced that <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and Russia were equally responsible for the war and more blameworthy than either <placeName>
                        <country reg="au">Austria</country>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. When the American Legion, the Ku Klux Man, and the Daughters of the American
                    Revolution denounced him, he goaded them with more revisionist articles.</p>
            <p>By 1926 the revisionist controversy focused on the American intervention of 1917. Barnes and others
                    denounced the pro-English influences which they alleged had duped Wilson. Although the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> entered the war for altruistic reasons, they claimed that Wilson was the victim of his
                    pro-English associates and that during the war he had served as the "tool of the
                    interests."</p>
            <p>Hartley Gratton's book, Why We Fought (1929), revealed the shifting focus of revisionism. He
                    contended that Wilson's ambition to be a messiah through peace activities demanded entrance
                    into the war. Gratton saw no moral reason for intervention and concluded that America fought for
                    cash and commerce.</p>
            <p>In the early 1930's, Charles A. Beard argued that war had many causes and that international
                    capitalism was the best hope for peace. His revisionism, expressed in The Idea of National Interest
                    and The Open Door At Home, was based on the thesis that national interest lay in a high standard of
                    living for all citizens and an economy that was conducive to individual and social virtues. He
                    supported the Neutrality Acts of the mid-3930's in the hope for continuing peace.</p>
            <p>Walter Millis contended that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> stumbled into war in 1917 and that any resort to force was futile. He accused the
                    American people of creating the intervention sentiment which forced entrance into the war. He
                    questioned the validity of the Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1936, and he saw dangers in their
                    mandatory application in future wars. Whereas Beard wanted mandatory enforcement of neutrality,
                    Millis urged flexibility. In the debate generated by the neutrality laws few Americans deeended the
                    1917 intervention. Beard, in The Devil's Theory of War, rejected the idea that submarine
                    warfare caused American intervention and blamed the "total military and economic
                    situation." He demanded an embargo on trade and travel and advocated feeding hungry
                    Americans, not warring Europeans. As Europe drifted toward war Millis viewed the world situation
                    without alarm and sought American acceptance of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s appeasement policy.</p>
            <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-063-4-070"/>
            <p>Charles C. Tansill, in <hi rend="i">America Goes to War</hi> (1938), viewed <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> foreign policy of 1914-1917 as a struggle between British realism on the one hand and
                    American idealism on the other. He blamed Edward House and Robert Lansing for Wilson's
                    blundering intervention and concluded that the foreign policy was designed to preserve the British
                    Empire. Tansill warned that America should not intervene again for the same purpose. Barnes shouted
                    that if the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> made war again democracy was doomed, but Millis favored a rational intervention.
                    Shortly before the Japanese bombers rained their bombs on Pearl Harbor, Barnes wrote that American
                    entrance into the Pacific war was "sheer national idiocy."</p>
            <p>Cohen has done a scholarly job of presenting the controversial views of these five historians at a
                    time when America's foreign policy is again under scrutiny. His book desemes a wide
                    reading.</p>

                    </placeName>: David McKay Company, Inc., 1967. Pp. 344. Index. $6.60.)</head>
            <p>Fehrenbach's readable account of Roosevelt's efforts to align the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with Great Britain is designed for a popular audience. Although it is filled with
                    interesting, if often arguable, judgments about the American position and the policies of other
                    major powers before Pearl Harbor, it is based entirely on published materials and adds nothing to
                    our factual knowledge of the period.</p>
            <p>Fehrenbach accepts the thesis that an isolationist-minded America was brought to its senses by a
                    President who awoke earlier than most of his countrymen to the dangers the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would face in a Hitler-dominated world, and who used his superb political skills to
                    change America's course. In developing this thesis, Fehrenbach, like others before him,
                    overestimates both Roosevelt's vision and the magnitude of the gap between his views and
                    those of the public.</p>
            <p>Roosevelt, as his wartime consensus diplomacy was to show, shared the general American aversion to
                    power politics and failed to understand its essence. He resorted to idealistic and moralistic
                    pronouncements about the war and America's role not because he wished to lead or to mislead
                    the public, but quite simply because he believed them. The President was, of course, better informed
                    than the public about events in Europe and Asia, more aware of how they might adversely affect
                    American aims and interests, and more confident that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could intervene to good effect, if necessary. He recognized somewhat earlier than most
                    that American security depended on the maintenance of Great Britain and the defeat of Hitler and he
                    was not wedded to the concept of unilateralism in foreign affairs, but he was also not prepared to
                    throw America's full weight into the balance at any time before Pearl Harbor.</p>
            <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-063-4-071"/>
            <p>Public opinion lagged only slightly behind that of the President and was affected more by world
                    events than by anything Roosevelt said or did. Fehrenbach underestimates the significance of the
                    Senate's confirmation of Stimson and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> and the sponsorship of the Selective Service Bill by an anti-New Deal Democrat and a
                    Republican as indicators of widespread concurrence with administration policy. He takes little
                    account of the fact that the nomination of Willkie demonstrated the belief, even of the Republican
                    party, that no isolationist candidate could win the presidency in 1940. Nor does he recognize the
                    America First Committee for what it really was: a last-ditch effort to rally the opponents of
                    Roosevelt's foreign policy in the hope of stemming the tide.</p>
            <p>A number of overstatements and inaccuracies mar the book. For example, the cash-and-carry provisions
                    never applied to "all buying of raw materials by foreign powers" (p. 2) and had
                    already expired in March, 1939; Borah, Johnson, and Wheeler never served on the Nye Committee (p.
                    4); Roosevelt did not accept Hoover's tariff policies (p. 11); there were no
                    "urgent pressures" for a declaration of war from either the Cabinet or the State
                    Department in June, 1940 (p. 67); the Committee to Defend America First was formed not two days
                    after but two months before the destroyer deal, and its name was changed to America First Committee
                    prior to the date mentioned by Fehrenbach (pp. 163-64); and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>-British staff talks early in 1941 produced contingency plans and not formal American
                    commitments to specific actions (pp. 222-26).</p>
            <p>Fehrenbach, in short, has produced an interesting, readable, but not particularly enlightening book.</p>

            <p>Dexter Perkins, one of the most distinguished historians of American diplomacy, has had a long and
                    amazing professional life. He has retired from two teaching careers, one at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the other at Cornell university, and since his last retirement in 1959 has kept
                    active lecturing and writing on American foreign relations. In 1966 he was visiting professor for
                    the Patten Foundation at Indiana University. This book is an outgrowth of his Patten Lectures.</p>
            <p>As could be expected from a book based on lectures, this volume offers a series of essays on selected
                    topics, such as the Marshall Plan, that are loosely connected and focused most often on <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> relations with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>. Despite the brevity of the book and the selectivity of the author, these essays do
                    analyze or touch on most <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-063-4-072"/> of the important developments in
                    American foreign policy since 1946. Since the book covers ground well known through other work, its
                    unique qualities must be sought in Perkins' analyses, interpretations, and judgments. He
                    does not disappoint the reader. His mind appears to be as incisive as ever; if the reader is willing
                    to accept his basic premises, his judgments are sound and logical.</p>
            <p>Two notable themes run through these essays. The first states that the outstanding feature of the
                    past thirty years is the development of massive American economic and military power and the use of
                    that power in the nation's expanding global commitments. Few historians would quarrel with
                    this assumption. A number of them might, however, find it difficult to accept the implications of
                    Perkins' second theme, that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has made good use of its vast influence. What flows from this second theme is a defense
                    of American foreign policy in almost all instances, even in such controversial matters as the
                    nonrecognition of Red <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>, the intervention in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dr">Dominican Republic</country>
                    </placeName> in 1965, and the war iii <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. This defensive attitude gives the deceptive impression that Perkins sees foreign
                    policy in black and white. The American side invariably comes out as the upholder of justice and
                    righteousness; the other side usually emerges as being wrong and bad. So the result, for those who
                    are critical of recent American policies, is a conservative analysis of foreign policy of the past
                    thirty years.</p>
            <p>This reviewer agrees with Perkins' major theme, and also with many of his moral judgments.
                    On the whole, Americans have used their great power with remarkable restraint.</p>
            <p>In presenting his assessments Perkins is seldom dogmatic and always calm, urbane, and civilized.
                    Everywhere, even when one might boggle at his judgment, he is shrewd and knowing. For example, he
                    points out that the scholar and the statesman have to go beyond fact to understand foreign policy.
                    "The roots of diplomacy," he writes, "are to be found in feeling, feeling
                    often rationalized by the appropriate symbols, but feeling none the less. To understand this fact is
                    the business of every student of foreign policy" (p. 18). Wisdom such as this justifies the
                    reading and re-reading of this gracefully written and charmingly provocative book by a man whose
                    mind seems to stay forever young.</p>

            <p>This volume is a lucidly written and readable analysis of a complex series of issues evolving out of
                    a complex period of history. The postwar years posed unique problems for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, some of the most urgent of them farm problems. Unprepared for the awesome <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-063-4-073"/> responsibilities of the presidency, Matusow writes, "Truman in
                    his first term tended to rely on his subordinates to perform the real tasks of
                    policy-making" (pp. 2-3). Too often his agricultural policies reflected the tendency of the
                    policy makers to read too close a parallel between past history and present events. Haunted by the
                    fear that the end of the war would find the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> holding the huge surpluses that had been a prelude to depression in the
                    1930's, the Department of Agriculture hastened to deal with the problems of abundance, but
                    did so at first by imitating New Deal policies, ignoring the fact that the situations that had made
                    those policies valid had long since changed. Further, the Department of State, viewing problems from
                    another perspective, and remembering the adverse effects of trade rivalries during the depression,
                    saw free trade as the answer.</p>
            <p>Going separate ways, overwhelmed by short-range problems, often working at cross-purposes, planners
                    in both departments nonetheless contributed many novel and purposeful ideas. That their early labors
                    fell short of the mark was simply because the technological revolution in agriculture in the
                    1940's was so rapid and far-reaching as to be beyond the comprehension of even the most
                    thoughtful student of economics. Hence, preoccupied by immediate and urgent problems, the Truman
                    administration was not prepared to cope with the larger changes wrought by that revolution. Indeed,
                    as the author bluntly states, "Only the famine in Europe and the Korean War saved the
                    farmer from depression in the Truman years" (p.115).</p>
            <p>Thus saved from the maelstrom of depression, the Truman administration eventually faced squarely a
                    veritable maze of conflicts to be reconciled-petty but bitter jealousies among members of the
                    administration; the hopes and fears of the individual farmer as opposed to the aggregate problems of
                    agriculture; economic ideologies versus political reality; and, perhaps hardest of all, economic
                    nationalism as opposed to international responsibility.</p>
            <p>What finally evolved out of these troubled years was no panacea, no simple system for agriculture,
                    but a series of alternative plans, of which the most comprehensive (and controversial) was the
                    defeated Brannan Plan. Perhaps the true measure of Truman's farm policy is less its
                    accomplishments than the examples it set. As Matusow concludes, "with the approach of a
                    world crisis whose potential gravity recalls the famine years after World War 11, the experiences of
                    policymakers in the Truman years assumes an unwelcome relevance" (p. 252).</p>
            <p>This is a well-organized, meticulously researched book. Matusow does a superb job of analyzing the
                    interaction between domestic issues and international commitments. Surveying the complex, shifting
                    patterns of agriculture, he makes a brilliant argument for creative thought as an alternative to the
                    politics of drift that have too often marked American agriculture, presenting his argument with
                    candor, frankness, and often subtle wit.</p>

            <p>In these two volumes are most of the public messages and statements-663 in all-of President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson for the year 1966. The books are part of a series begun in 1957 in response to a
                    recommendation by the National Historical Publications Commission. To date volumes have appeared
                    covering the administrations of Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy, and one on Johnson from
                    November 22, 1963, through the year 1964.</p>
            <p>The documents for 1965 have a large range: the President's toast to President Yameogo of
                    Upper Volta; transcripts of presidential news conferences; messages to Congress; remarks to Italian
                    artists, Boy Scouts, and the Antarctic Policy Group; radio and television addresses; birthday
                    greetings to former-President Truman, commencement addresses; statements on the deaths of such
                    individuals as Winston Churchill and Bernard M. Baruch; congratulatory messages to American
                    astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts; statements on signing legislation, including the splendid remarks
                    given in the Capitol rotunda on August 6, 1965, when Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act.</p>
            <p>What is the merit of these publications? As any novice in the study of history knows, there often is
                    a large difference between the public and private statements of a political leader. Of course what
                    the president has to say to a visiting delegation of the Y.M.C.A. really is not very important.
                    Still, public messages and statements offer insight to the ideas and policies of a leader, and the
                    student of Johnson or any other occupant of the White House must take them into account. These
                    compilations, then, have the virtue of saving the historian the arduous task of paging through the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Times Index and the Times itself in search of the President's public remarks;
                    everything is neatly set out in these nicely bound and indexed books. The contents also reveal the
                    endless trivia that command the time of the man whose judgment—or lack of
                    it—can determine whether the world survives.</p>
            <p>A final thought: here are nearly 1,200 double-column pages. The President's staff, of
                    course, writes most of the statements uttered by the President or given over his signature. But does
                    he have to read every word of it?</p>

                        Paulus. (The author, 1966. Pp. 639, 63, 194, 216.) These four volumes of General Robert Huston
                        Milroy's Papers principally concern his service in the Civil War. As the
                        author's Preface forth-rightly states in its initial sentence: "The purpose of
                        this work is to rectify I hope at least in part, the unfavorable appraisal of the military
                        career and conduct of General Robert Huston Milroy." Mrs. Paulus feels "that
                        the jealously and competition of a number of Union Army Officers formed the basis of many of the
                        discrediting charges against General Milroy." She notes that President Lincoln later
                        exonerated the general but points out that Milroy was not allowed to publish the Court of
                        Inquiry or his own report of the Winchester retreat until 1890; thus the stigma of having
                        directed a cowardly and disorderly retreat remained with him. (This omission caused him to be
                        considered as a coward and greatly diminished his subsequent military service.) This
                        comprehensive presentation of Milroy Papers should encourage a painstaking and apparently
                        merited reevaluation of the general's Civil War services. Meanwhile, all of the Milroy
                        Papers should be deposited in some appropriate reputable library; otherwise, at least some
                        researchers in Civil War military history are almost certain not to take these volumes at face
                        value for fear that the available record is not complete.</p>

                        Business Research for the Division of Planning of the Indiana Department of Commerce, offer
                        projections concerning Indiana population to 1986. These projections-not predictions-are offered
                        by counties and economic regions and for the state as a whole. They are also offered by age
                        groups and by sex. The Introduction explains the basis for and nature of the projections used as
                        well as how the data were gathered and organized. It is also explicit in explaining that
                        projections are in part based upon particular assumptions which will not be entirely valid in
                        all instances. Moreover, as also noted, a study of the projections themselves may lead to
                        efforts and programs significantly affecting the nature and size of the population of any given
                        area. Nevertheless, used thoughtfully and wisely, the data here available should be quite
                        helpful to businessmen, school administrators, city and county planners, and the like.</p>

                        alone make this essential—it offers, with editorial commentary, extracts from the
                        speeches of members of Congress concerning the interpretation of the new federal constitution,
                        the division of powers between the federal government and the states, the nature and importance
                        of republican government, and other political questions. The title, A Second Federalist, aptly
                        and appropriately suggests that the views and interpretations of early members of Congress merit

                        comments on basic ideas set forth in the frontier thesis of Turner and offers commentary
                        regarding both support for and opposition to Turner's views on "The
                        Significance of the Frontier in American History" since the publication of his famous

                        with care will have been introduced to the basic questions raised by the Turner thesis and will
