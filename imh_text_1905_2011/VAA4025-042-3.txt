            Why Was the Democratic Party in Indiana A Radical Party, 1865–1890?
            WILLIAM G. CARLETON
            
            The money question was a live issue in Indiana frori 1866 to 1880, in 1868 it became a leading issue,
                    and in 1874, 1876, and 1878 it was the paramount issue. Its importance began to decline in 1880 and
                    by 1882 it was negligible. The Greenback party managed to taper out an existence in the state to
                    1886, but by 1884 it scarcely counted and by 1885 it had passed into history. By the 1890's
                    Indiana had definitely become an ally of the conservative East.
            Immediately following the close of the war, both Democratic and Republican parties were radical on
                    the money question. The state platforms of both parties stood against contraction and for the
                    payment of the debt in greenbacks. The Republican enthusiasm for soft money began to wane by 1870,
                    and by 1872 the party was inclined definitely toward conservatism. But in 1874 the Indiana
                    Republicans in Congress not only voted for but led the fight for the adoption of the Inflation Bill.
                    The Republican platform of that year was a straddle on the money question. The Republican members in
                    Congress voted for specie resumption in 1875, although the state platform of 1876 and the Republican
                    party press during the campaign of that year demanded repeal of the clause which fixed a definite
                    date for the beginning of resumption. The Indiana Republican members of Congress in 1878 stood for
                    the radical Bland Bill and for the Bland-Allison Bill, and even voted to override Hayes’
                    veto. This was the last manifestation of monetary radicalism on the part of the Republicans of
                    Indiana. Their platform of 1878 was ultraconservative, and in that year they accepted the Specie
                    Resumption Act without reservation.
            
            It will be seen, then, that the Republican party was headed for conservatism as early as 1870, but
                    that a temporary intensifying of agrarian hard times forced the party into more or less radical
                    positions at various times from 1870 to 1878. On the whole, the votes of the Indiana Republican
                    members in Congress were more radical than the party's state platform declarations. This is
                    a situation almost unique in political history—a party more radical in action than in
                    promises. The Republican party contained a considerable radical money element at least down to 1880.
            The Democrats were radical on the money question in 1868 and continued to be so down to 1880, and, in
                    that year and after, the party was conservative only because the inflation agitation was over and
                    there was no radical money movement in the country to which the party could attach itself. The
                    Democrats stressed the money question in 1868 and continued to do so down to and including the
                    campaign of 1878, with the single exception of 1872!, when the party unwisely abandoned economic
                    issues for the political reforms advocated by the Liberal Republicans. The platforms of 1874 and
                    1878 were extremely radical, and differed little from Greenback declarations. The platform of 1876
                    was predominantly radical, and the party that year was ardently inflationist. Indiana Democrats in
                    Congress stood against the Specie Resumption Act, supported the original Bland Bill, and voted to
                    pass the Bland-Allison Act over the Hayes veto. In both pronouncement and performance the Democratic
                    party of this era was radical on the money question.
            Both parties contained minorities which opposed the prevailing tendencies of their respective
                    organizations. The Republicans contained a minority who opposed the conservative trend of their
                    party. Oliver P. Morton, whose personal influence over his party was well-nigh overwhelming, managed
                    to keep his party fairly liberal until his death in 1877, and there were those who attempted to
                    continue his policy after that time. Tn the Democratic party a powerful minority led by such able
                    leaders as McDonald, Kerr, and English attempted to keep the party in the conservative path, but
                    without much success.
            When the prevailing economic distress became temporarily more intense the Republicans would become
                    less conservative and the Democrats more radical. When the 
                    prevailing economic distress was less intense, the Republicans would become more conservative and
                    the Democrats less radical. The position of the parties on the money question was a trustworthy
                    barometer of economic conditions.
            The positions taken by public men on the money question were not always consistent. Morton voted for
                    the Specie Resumption Act in 1875, although his record up to that time had been constantly and
                    vigorously radical. Pratt likewise violated his past record when he voted for the Specie Resumption
                    Act. So did Orth. McDonald, honest as he was in his conservatism, voted for the amended
                    Bland-Allison Act, and back in the National Democratic Convention of 1868 he was the Indiana member
                    of the resolutions committee, the committee that wrote the radical national platform of that year.
                    Apparently, he did not dissent. The unstable position of Hendricks on the money question has often
                    been pointed out. Harrison was consistently conservative, but had he been in a public position in
                    the seventies it would not have been so easy for him to have maintained such a record. Kerr and
                    English never faltered in their conservatism. Voorhees and Turpie never swerved from inflationist
                    convictions, and the former was ardently radical. But these men are the exceptions. Among the lesser
                    leaders the records are even less unifying than among the more important. The insistent tug of party
                    loyalty, a temporary change in economic conditions, and a fleeting shift in public sentiment are
                    among the factors which explain the changes in the public attitude of politicians. Many had no
                    convictions on the subject of money. Still others did not understand it.
            A man's attitude on the financial issues was not the only criterion by which he was judged
                    in the seventies. When one isolates a topic from the completed story and develops it, he is likely
                    to overemphasize it at the expense of other topics and other factors. A radical legislature sent the
                    conservative McDonald to the Senate in 1875, a comparatively conservative legislature returned
                    Voorhees to the Senate in 1885, and a radical Democratic district sent Kerr to Congress in 1874. Men
                    never entirely subordinate the personal element to economic interests, even when economic issues are
                    uppermost in the political discussions of the day. And there is always present an interplay of
                    issues, no one candidate epitomizing and harmonizing all the views of the men who vote for him.
            
            What were the reasons for the agrarian radicalism of Indiana in the 1870's? These
                    are to be found largely in the economic and social conditions prevailing in the state at that time.
                    Indiana was predominantly agrarian in 1870. The total population, excluding children under the age
                    of ten, was 1,197,936. There were 459,369 persons engaged in gainful occupations, and of these
                    266,777 were engaged in agriculture. Only 76,057 were then occupied in the manufacturing and mining
                    industries, some 80,000 were to be found offering professional and personal services, while a meager
                    36,517 were employed in trade and transportation. There were no really large cities in the state. 
                        Indianapolis
                     boasted a mere 48,244. 
                        Evansville
                     contained 21,830 inhabitants, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     17,718, and 
                        Terre Haute
                     16,103.1
            
            The census of 1880 again emphasizes the dominance of agriculture. Out of a population ten
                    year's or older of 1,468,-095 inhabitants, there were 635,080 engaged in earning a living,
                    and of this latter total agriculture claimed 331,240. There were 137,281 offering personal and
                    professional services, 110,127 working in the manufacturing and mining industries, and 56,432
                    employed in trade and transportation. Even in 1880, 
                        Indianapolis
                     possessed a population — of only 75,056, 
                        Evansville
                     of 29,280, and 
                        Terre Haute
                     of 26,042.2
            
            In the entire state there were in 1870 but 11,847 factories and only 58,852 factory hands. The
                    capital invested in manufacturing totaled $52,052,425, the value of the manufactured
                    products $108,617,278, and the wages paid $18,-366,780. On the other hand, the
                    total capital invested in agriculture amounted to $652,480,780, and the total value of
                    agricultural products reached $122,914,802.3 It is highly
                    significant, however, that the $52,052,423 invested in manufacturing yielded products
                    valued at $108,617,218, while the 8652,480,780 invested in agriculture, more than twelve
                    times that invested in manufacturing, rendered only $122,914,302. The difference between
                    the total valuation of the products of each was only $14,297,024, while the difference in
                    capital

                     invested was $600,428,355. Of course, a great
                    allowance should be made for the food livelihoods made by the farmers, and these livelihoods do not
                    appear in the census figure. Even so, money invested in agriculture seems to have earned
                    considerably less than the same amount invested in manufacturing.
            Statistics for 1880 reveal practically the same conditions. There were only 11,198 manufacturing
                    establishments in the state in that year, a slight decrease below the number of 1870, due to the
                    then prevalent tendency to consolidation. The capital invested in manufacturing represented
                    $65,742,-962; more than 62,000 wage earners were employed; the total wage paid was
                    $21,960,888; and the entire manufactured production was valued at
                    $148,006,411. The capital invested in agriculture amounted to $655,713,099,
                    and the total value of farm production was $114,707,082.4 The
                    disparity between agriculture and industry in the amount invested and the financial return thereon
                    is even more striking in 1880 than it was in 1870. The comparatively meager amount invested in
                    industry was actually bringing in more financial returns than the comparatively large amount
                    invested in agriculture. The peculiarly privileged position of manufacturing is still more enhanced
                    when it is revealed that the figures for the total amount invested in agriculture do not include
                    capital invested in livestock, while the figures representing capital invested in manufacturing
                    include every conceivable factor of investment. As pointed out before, however, allowance must be
                    made for the food livelihoods of farmers, which allowances do not appear in the census figures.
            During the Civil War, the farmers in Indiana, like those elsewhere, had enjoyed a phenomenal
                    prosperity. The average price received in Indiana for corn in 1864 was ninety-five and one-half
                    cents a bushel, while wheat had soared to $1.75. Corn had dropped to sixty-five cents in
                    1867, but wheat had rocketed to $2.21. The boom was over by 1868. Corn had taken a
                    further slump and the average price per bushel received that year was only fifty-two cents, while
                    wheat had gone down to $1.50. Corn rallied to seventy cents in 1869, but wheat went down
                    to ninety-three cents. Corn fell to 
                  
                     4
                     Tenth Census of the

                     thirty-eight cents in 1870, but wheat recovered and went up to
                    $1.00. Corn continued to fall in 1871 and averaged only thirty-seven cents, but wheat
                    climbed to an average of $1.26. Corn declined to twenty-nine cents in 1872 and wheat
                    increased to $1.32. In the panic year of 1873 corn rose to forty cents, but wheat fell to
                    $1.22, while the price of hogs, which had hovered around six and seven dollars since
                    1870, fell to $3.61.5
            
            It will be noted that by 1868 corn arid wheat had both registered a decline, Corn declined to
                    unprecedented prices during the years from 1870 to 1873, so that these years constitute the lean
                    time of the Indiana corn grower. Wheat rallied after the depression of 1868, but declined in 1873,
                    and did not again reach the 1872 level of $1.32; during the period under consideration.
                    Corn went up to fifty-one cents in 1874, the year of particularly hard times for the wheat grower,
                    but went down to thirty-nine cents in 1875, never again to reach the 1874 level during the decades
                    of the seventies and eighties except in the single year 1881 when the average price received for
                    corn in Indiana was sixty cents.6
            
            It is significant, then, to note that the depression of 1868–1869 was followed by a
                    partial recovery of agricultural prosperity, that both corn and wheat rallied, but not
                    simultaneously, so that the corn grower suffered a lean year while the wheat grower enjoyed a
                    temporary and comparative prosperity, and vice-versa. But after the depression of
                    1873–1874 the distress was continueus, and all agricultural producers suffered a loss. To
                    be sure, there were years of relative prosperity, and years when the general depression was
                    comparatively even more severe. Wheat fell as low as eighty-one cents in 1878, and hit bottom at
                    sixty-seven cents in 1884.

                     It went up to $1.27 in 1881, but the rise was
                    abortive. Corn hit bottom at twenty-seven cents in 1878 and staged a temporary rally in 1881, going
                    up to sixty cents.7 The years 1879–1881 were tantalizing in that they
                    seemed to prophesy a return to general prosperity, but the revival was ephemeral. There was a slight
                    variation in the condition of producers of different agricultural products, and there was some
                    fluctuation from year to year in the prices of one product, but as a general condition the hard
                    times were continuous. Indiana was above all else a corn producing state and there is a marked
                    connection between the price of corn and the existence or non-existence of agrarian radicalism in
                    Indiana politics in the 1870's and 1880's.
            The corn producers of Indiana received $70,941,567 in 1864, for 74,284,363 bushels of
                    corn, which represented the yield of 2,561,529 acres. Six years later, 113,150,000 bushels of corn,
                    representing the yield of 2,864,556 acres, rendered the corn producers only $42,997,000.
                    The crop yield and the acreage increased, but the financial returns were actually less than they had
                    been in 1864. Similarly, 138,252,000 bushels of corn were produced on 4,215,000 acres of land in
                    1878, and the total yield of the crop in money value was onlr $37,328,040. The acreage
                    was almost double that of 1864, and the total yield was more than double, but the value of the crop
                    was approximately one-half what it had been in that year. Even in 1881, the one year approaching the
                    old-time agrarian prosperity, the 79,618,000 aggregate yield of corn on 3,657,800 acres brought
                    financial returns amounting to only $47,777,800. Even if one takes as a basis for
                    comparison the figures of 1884, which was an average year for corn in these decades of depression,
                    he will find that 104,757,000 bushels, representing the yield of 3,612,312 acres, brought a
                    financial return of only $35,617,380.8
            
            Figures involving wheat valuation are equally significant.

                     The financial returns in 1964 totaled $39,062,308,
                    for 22,321,-376 bushels of wheat which were raised on 1,594,384 acres. Ten years later, 23,331,000
                    bushels of wheat raised on 1,912,-377 acres of land yielded only $21,931,140. The value
                    of the crop had fallen off by almost one-half, although its size was slightly larger. In 1878, a
                    particularly bad year for the wheat grower, 33,136,000 bushels of wheat, representing 2,071,000
                    acres of land, brought only $26,840,160 in money. The, crop and the acreage had been
                    increased by one-half and one-third over the 1864 totals, but the aggregate pecuniary return was cut
                    down by about one-third. In 1884, another very bad year, 33,745,000 bushels of wheat, representing
                    the entire yield of 2,708,016 acres of land, resulted in a total crop valuation of only
                    $22,609,150. The crop and the acreage had been increased over the 1878 figures, but the
                    total money yield was even less than it had been in 1878. In 1883, an average year in these decades
                    of depression, 28,447,800 bushels of wheat, representing the output of 2,535,370 acres, yielded in
                    money only $27,025,410.9 The farmer might thus increase his acreage
                    and his output, but the consequent rise in supply only resulted in further declines in price and a
                    decrease in his annual money income.
            Land values declined enormously. In 1870 there were 10,104,279 acres of improved farm land in
                    Indiana, while there were about eight million acres of unimproved farm land. The total valuation of
                    all farm land was $634,804,189. In 1880 the unimproved farm land had dwindled to
                    6,487,245 acres, while the improved farm land had increased to 13,933,-738 acres. Thus between 1870
                    and 1880 more than two million acres had been added to the farm land of the state, while more than
                    three million of the farm acres had been improved and put under cultivation. Yet the total valuation
                    of farm land in 1880 was only $635,236,111.10 The value had remained
                    constant, while the acreage and improvement had greatly increased. If the land values of 1865 and
                    1866 were

                     available, the disparity would appear more striking, for the
                    great deflation in value had occurred before the census of 1870. The values of 1880, moreover, are
                    slightly higher than the values for the years preceding and succeeding that year due to the
                    temporary revival of agriculture from 1879 to 1881.
            Interest rates in Indiana were high in the decade of the seventies. In 1880 the average rate of
                    interest in the whole state on all types of mortgages was 7.13 per cent. In 
                        Marion
                     County, where money was relatively plentiful, interest rates on mortgages averaged 6.91
                    per cent. If interest rates in 
                        Marion
                     County were 6.91 per cent, it is safe to assume that they were much higher in the rural
                    communities, and that in the more remote and less wealthy counties they were considerably over the
                    average for the state. Even as late as 1889, when the average rate of interest for the whole state
                    was down to 6.33 per cent, the average rate of mortgage interest in Crawford, a poor agricultural
                    county, was 7.32 per cent. Even in Hendricks, a wealthy county and contiguous to 
                        Marion
                    , but an agricultural community, the average interest rate in 1890 was 7.07 per cent.11 During the decades of the seventies and eighties the agrarian communities
                    must have suffered, as a rule, from high interest rates, and the rate of interest must have varied
                    inversely with the wealth and capital of the county.
            Although there had been since 1865 a steady improvement in the financial condition of the state
                    government, as late as 1880 it was heavily in debt. The total debt of the state aggregated
                    $4,998,178.34, the greater part of which was in ten per cent and eight per cent bonds.
                    The entire outstanding bonded debt of all civil divisions in Indiana, including the state debt just
                    mentioned, was $16,794,078.12 County and municipal governments of
                    Indiana very largely fell within the debtor class.
            It is a surprising fact that at the close of the Civil War there were in Indiana few who held 
                        United States
                     government bonds. At the end of the decade of the seventies there were only 698 holders
                    of government securities in the entire

                    greenbacks made great headway in the state.
            The National Banking Act of 1863 and the federal tax of ten per cent on the circulation of state
                    banks, which had gone into effect on July 1, 1866, were felt keenly by the many state banks in
                    Indiana. The state banking system of Indiana had been sound, and the currency of the banks usually
                    had been received at par. The state banks rode the panic of 1857 with ease, paying gold where most
                    banks in other states suspended.14 Hugh McCulloch, the conservative Secretary of
                    the Treasury under Johnson, was president of the Indiana State Banking System at the time. The
                    destruction after 1865 of a sound and valued local currency was regretted by some of the most
                    conservative citizens of the state.
            Running east and west in the central part of Indiana is located the rich agricultural region called
                    by geographers the 
                        Tipton
                     Till Plains.15 The average price of an acre of land of all counties
                    included in this region was $159 in 1922.16 North of the 
                        Tipton
                     Till region is the district known in geography as the Northern Moraine and Lake Region.
                    For the most part the counties in the western portion of this geologic division fall into the
                    subdivision known as the Kankakee Lacustrian section.17 The soii is rich, but
                    not as productive as that of the 
                        Tipton
                     Till region. The average price of an acre of land for all counties herein included was
                    $102 in 1922. The eastern portion of the Northern Moraine and Lake Region is

                            with most of Cass, 
                        Elkhart, Jasper

                                Fulton
                             and Marshall, are found in this subdivision.
               
                     called the 
                        Steuben
                     Morainal and Lake Section.18 The average price of an acre of land
                    in all the counties included in this region was ninety-six dollars in 1922. It will be noted that
                    this region is less rich than the 
                        Tipton
                     Till or the Kankakee Lacustrian Section.
            The region south of the 
                        Tipton
                     Till is the poorest section of the state. In the southwest is the 
                        Wabash
                     Lowland.19 The average price of an acre of land of all counties in
                    this region was seventy-seven dollars in 1922. Just east of the 
                        Wabash
                     Lowland is the Crawford Upland.20 This is one of the poorest
                    sections of the state, and the average price of an acre of land in this region was twenty-six
                    dollars in 1922. The three sections east of the Crawford Upland are known successively as the 
                        Mitchell
                     Plain, the 
                        Norman
                     Upland, and the Scottsburg Lowland.21 The soil here is slightly
                    better than in the Crawford Upland, and the average value of an acre of land in the 
                        Mitchell
                     Plain and the 
                        Norman
                     Upland in 1922 was thirty-four dollars. East of the Scottsburg Lowland is the
                    Muskatatuck Regional Slope.22 This is a very poor section, outside of Rush and 
                        Shelby
                     counties, and the average value of an acre of land in this section in 1922 was
                    twenty-six dollars. The 
                        Dearborn
                     Upland23 in the southeastern part of the state is a richer section,
                    but poor when compared with the regions of northern and central Indiana. The average value of an
                    acre of land in this section in 1922 was seventy-four dollars.
            Indiana, then, may be divided into three distinct sections: the rich central plain; the moderately
                    wealthy counties in the Northern Moraine and Lake Region; and the poor counties of the south, the
                    sections southeast and southwest comprising the wealthier of the relatively poor southern counties,
                    and the counties in the central portion of this southern region 
                  
                     18 Herein are included the counties of

                     21 Included in these three sections are

                     22 Included in this region are the counties of 
                                Decatur
                            , Jefferson, Jennings,

                        Bartholomew, Clark, Rush

                     23 This region comprises the counties of 
                        Dearborn, Fayette, Franklin, Ohio,
                                    Switzerland
                     , Union, and parts of
                                    
                        Jefferson, Ripley

                     comprising the poorest in the state. In area the southern
                    counties comprise well over one-third of the state.
            In the decades of the seventies and eighties the population was densest in the counties of the great 
                        Tipton
                     Till, the heaviest population being concentrated in 
                        Marion
                     County and in the counties that cluster about it. The old portion of the state, the
                    poorer area of the south, was growing in population less rapidly than the central and northern
                    portions of the state. In some counties in the southeast the population was practically stationary
                    and the census of 1870 reveals that 
                  Dearborn, Switzerland
               , and Union had actually declined in
                    population since 1860.24 The counties of the northwest were undergoing the
                    process of settlement and development, and at the opening of the seventies they were in many ways in
                    a state of growth scarcely removed From frontier and pioneer conditions.
            The development of 
                        Jasper
                    , Newton, Porter, Starke, and southern Lake was long arrested by the refusal of the
                    state to undertake the drainage of the Kankakee Valley, and it was not until 1882 that this very
                    important project was begun with state aid.25 These counties were further
                    hampered in their development by the long legal controversy between riparian owners and the state
                    involving rich Kankakee bottom lands in LaPorte and Starke counties.26 The
                    counties with less than fifty inhabitants to the square mile were to he found for the most part in
                    the newer counties of the northwest in 1880, and in the poorer counties (of the south, particularly
                    in the counties of the central portion of the southern region, comprising the poorest in the state.
                    But it was the pioneer counties of the northwest which contained the sparest population. 
                        Benton
                     County possessed only twenty-seven people to the square mile; 
                        Jasper
                     only seventeen; Newton only twenty; Starke only sixteen; and White only
                        twenty-seven.27
            
            The wealth of the state was also concentrated in the rich counties of the 
                        Tipton
                     Till. If one takes as a basis the figure $750 as the average per capita
                    wealth in 1870 of the state, he will discover that the great majority of the counties

                     showing a per capita wealth of only $750 or less to
                    be generally localized in the north or in the counties of the old and poorer south. Figures which
                    indicate the average value per acre in each county show unmistakably that the highest values are in
                    the rich central plain, and the lower values in the northwestern and southern counties. Counties
                    with an average value per acre of twenty dollars or less are found concentrated in the northwest and
                    in the south. Counties with an average yield per acre of only five dollars or less are found bunched
                    in the north and in the south. There is a tendency for the entire northern counties to be included
                    in this particular classification, northeastern as well as northwestern. The soil of the northwest
                    was wealthy but undeveloped. The soil of the northeast was less wealthy but more highly
                        developed.28
            
            If the average amount of a mortgage of twelve dollars is taken as a basis for comparison, it will be
                    found that in 1880 the counties with an average of twelve dollars or under were grouped in the
                    northwest and south. The average amount of a mortgage debt always correlates closely with the value
                    of the land—if the average is low the land is likely to be of scant value; if it is high
                    the land is usually valuable. If for comparative purposes one takes thirteen dollars as a figure
                    representing the average mortgage debt for the decade of 1880–1890, he will discover
                    again that the counties registering this figure or below are to be found for the most part
                    segYegated in the northwest and the south. Even as late as 1890 the same sectional division holds
                    true; the census of that year shows that the counties in which the average value of an acre of land
                    was less than forty dollars were concentrated in the northwest and in the south.29 The northwest registered low land values not because the land was poor, but because it was
                    undeveloped.

                            ibid., Table IV, 138, 140, 142. If one takes the total estimated cash
                        valuation of farms of every county in 1870 and divides these figures by the total acreage of
                        each county, he will arrive at figures which represent the average value per acre in each
                        county. If one divides the total value of the agricultural production of each county by the
                        acreage of each county, he will find the average yield per acre. There is a fundamental weakness
                        in the method of computation used in the last two illustrations, an exact compilation would
                        involve only the acres under cultivation, and not the entire acreage of the county. But for
                        relative and comparative purposes these figures are valid.

            The poor counties were the counties of’ small farms. This is a generalization to which
                    there are many exceptions, but it is essentially true. The counties having one-half or more of their
                    farms in sizes of fifty acres or under were found in 1870 clustered in the northern and southern
                        regions.30 Even in the central plain, it is the comparatively poor counties
                    like Adams, Black ford, Jay, 
                  Madison, Randolph, Tipton
               , and
                    Wells which fall in this category; 
                        Boone
                    , Clinton, 
                        Hamilton
                    , and Howard are the exceptions, for they are among the wealthy counties, but the
                    tendency is rather in the direction of small farms in poorer counties. In the northwest the farms
                    tended to be larger than those in the north central and northeast portions.
            The greatest tendency toward rented farms is to be found in the wealthy central counties and in the
                    newer counties of the northwest.31 There was a tendency for wealthy capitalists
                    to buy the land in the northwest, to hold it for investment purposes, and to people it with tenant
                    farmers. In the wealthy central counties men of means often held farms as investments and rented
                    them to tenants.32 The districts with the fewest rented farms were the
                    northeast, which is the poorer but older developed portion of the Northern Moraine and Lake Region,
                    and the counties in the central portion of the southern region, the district with the poorest soil
                    in the state. The farmer in this poor district struggled with unfavorable conditions and lived on a
                    small farm, but he owned the land he tilled.
            In the northeast, then, the farms were comparatively poor, they had a tendency to be small, and the

                     Till; the land was undeveloped, and, therefore, less valuable in this, period than the
                    land of the northeast, and much of it was held by tenants. In this region development was the need.
                    In the south the soil was poor, the farms were small, and the farmers generally independent,
                    especially in the central portion. The population here was comparatively sparse and in some places

                     32 The counties with the largest percentage of tenant farmers were 
                                Benton
                             with 44 per cent of the farms tilled by tenants; 
                                Warren
                             with 40 per cent; 
                                Montgomery
                             with 38 per cent;

                             and 
                                Marion
                             with 34 per cent; Newton and 
                                Tippecanoe
                             with 33 per cent; and 
                                Jasper
                             with 32 per cent.
               
                     practically static. In the central plain the land was rich,
                    developed, and valuable; here the population was densest, the farms were large and in many cases
                    farmed by tenants. An undue emphasizing of tenant farming is, however, a mistake because rarely did
                    it rise above thirty per cent.
            The greatest percentage of foreign-born were concentrated in the northern and southern counties; the
                    smallest percentage in the rich central plain.33 The poor soil of the southern
                    region was less of a handicap to the foreign husbandman, accustomed as he was to the intensive
                    cultivation practiced in Europe. The comparatively low price of the land was an ever preset
                    inducement to the penurious but thrifty European. The land in the north was also less expensive than
                    that of the central plain, and its cheapness, together with the fact that geographically it stood on
                    the main route of the immigrant to the West, and underwent development during the high tide of
                    immigration which followed the Civil War, are factors which explain the large percentage of
                    foreign-born found in this region as early as 1870. The census of 1880 shows the foreign-born
                    consolidated in the border counties of the south beginning with Posey and ending with 
                        Wayne
                    , but excluding Crawford, 
                        Ohio
                    , Scott, 
                        Switzerland
                    , and Union; and solidly in the counties of the northwest from 
                        Benton
                     to 
                        St. Joseph
                    . In the northeast, Adams, Allen, 
                  DeKalb, Elkhart, Huntington
               , and Noble contained the largest foreign-born
                    population. 
                  Marion, Tippecanoe
               , and 
                        Wayne
                     were among the few counties in the central plain possessing large foreign populations.
            The Germans were the most numerous of the foreign settlers, and the areas in which they located were
                    almost identical with the sections having the greatest number of foreign-born generally.34 The Gaman voter played an important part in the politics of Indiana, and he
                    was an especial object of political coddling. Campaign documents were printed in German. Campaign
                    speakers spoke to the German voter in his native tongue. So zealous were the politicians in their
                    solicitation of the German vote that it was a common practice for the state legislature to order
                    one-third of the copies of official documents published by the state to be printed

                    large share of legal advertising.
            The Catholic church was strong where the foreign elements were most numerous.36
                    If one maps the counties possessing in 1870 over one thousand Catholics to the whole population, he
                    will find that with few exceptions these counties fall into the northern and southern regions.

                     are exceptions, but it will be remembered that these were the exceptional counties of
                    the central plain possessing large foreign populations.
            Methodism was the most important of the Protestant sects. It was strongest in the rich counties of
                    the central plain.37 If one maps the counties in 1870 possessing a Methodist
                    population of five thousand or above, he will discover that of the twenty-nine counties involved
                    seventeen are to be found in the 
                        Tipton
                     Till region.
            Manufacturing was not segregated in any one section of the state. Twenty-seven widely scattered
                    counties contained manufacturing establishments which represented capital of a half million dollars
                    or more in 1880.38 Indiana ranked eleventh in 1880 in the number of malt liquor
                    establishments, and thirteenth among the states in the value of liquor products. In the city of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     the liquor industry ranked fourth in the amount of capital invested. In 
                        Indianapolis
                     it ranked fifth.39
                    
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Evansville
                     also contained wealthy brewing interests. These liquor interests played. a part in
                    Indiana politics out of all proportion to their statistical strength, and usually were in alliance
                    with the Democratic party, which was thus wet as well as inflationist. Indirectly, the liquor
                    interests aided the cause of soft money.
            Why was the Democratic party the radical party? Because it drew its strength from the poor
                    counties of the state and from the poorer elements of the wealthier counties. The

                     bulwark of Democratic strength was in the poor counties of the
                        south.40 Vigo was normally Democratic in the 1870's but leaned to
                    the Republican column in the 1880's.

                        Vanderburgh
                     were close, but somewhat predisposed to Republicanism. In this entire section the only
                    definitely Republican counties were 
                  Greene, Jennings, Lawrence, Monroe

            The counties lying in the central plain which were normally Democratic were the poor counties of the
                    section. Miami contained an average per capita wealth of only $570; 
                        Huntington
                     contained an average per capita wealth of only $520, and the yield per acre
                    was low; 
                        Blackford
                    's land values were low, the yield per acre was small, the population sparse,
                    and the average per capita wealth meager; Wells possessed a population of less than fifty to the
                    square mile, land values were low, and the per capita wealth was only $441; while in
                    Adams the population fell below fifty persons to the square mile, the yield was small, land values
                    were low, and the per capita wealth was only $330. In 
                        Tipton
                     the per capita wealth stood at $334 in 1870 and the yield and value of land
                    were low. In 
                        Madison
                     land values were low as land values went in the counties of the central plain, but they
                    were not as low as in most of the other Democratic counties of the central plain. The average in
                    cumbrance of land per acre was below $15 in 1880. In 
                        Putnam
                     the population was under fifty people to the square mile and the yield per acre was on
                    the average smaller than in the majority of counties of the central plain. In 
                        Fountain
                     the average per capita wealth stood at $610. In Carroll the population was
                    sparse and land values low. In Cass the yield per acre was small and the value of the land low.

                     were the only wealthy counties of the central plain which were Democratic.
            There were nine Democratic counties in the north.41

                    plain, but the large Catholic and foreign, especially German, populations in each were factors
                    predisposing them to Democracy. The other counties, save 
                        Whitley
                    , were the decidedly poor counties. The farms were

                     was small. 
                  Elkhart, Kosciusko
               , and Noble tended to go Republican, but they
                    were close. The Democratic strength, then, was in the poor south and in the poor counties of the
                    north and of the central plain. Where the per capita wealth was small, the yield meager, the land
                    value low, the size of the farms restricted, and the farms tilled by their impecunious owners the
                    Democrats were usually in the majority.
            Why did the Republicans become conservative? Because their strength came from the wealthy
                    counties. Their citadel of strength consisted in the populous and rich counties of the central
                        plain.42 These counties of the northwest were comparatively new. They were
                    in the process of development. The population was rather sparse and the land was not developed to a
                    point where land values correlated with the true fertility of this region's soil.43 But the farms were large, the capital wealth was very high, and about
                    one-fourth of the soil was tilled by prosperous tenants. In 1870 the per capita wealth in Porter was
                    $1,063; in 
                        Jasper
                     $787; in Newton $1,286; in Lake $724; in 
                        Benton
                     $1,424; in 
                        Warren
                     $980; in Parke $866; and in 
                        Vermillion
                     $922. The per capita wealth in 
                        Marion
                     County was only $1,042. This northwest region was Republican from the first,
                    and as its soil came more and more under cultivation and after the industrial development of the
                    Calumet region took place in Lake and Porter, its Republicanism was intensified.
            Let us look at the counties of 
                  Fulton, Jasper
               , Lake, Marshall, Newton, Porter, 
                        Pulaski
                    , and Starke a moment. Nothing will better illustrate the difference in economic
                    background of the two major parties in Indiana. These counties fall for the most part in the
                    Kankakee Lacustrian Section. Yet the four to the west were Republican while the four to the east
                    were Democratic. Why? The four to the east were older; the four to the west were later
                    developed and under 
                  
                     42 The Republican counties of the central plain were

                        Vermillion, Wabash
                     , and 
                                Wayne
                            . The six counties just south of Lake 
                                Michigan
                             and north of the 
                                Wabash
                            : 
                        Benton, Jasper, Lake, Newton, Porter

                             were in alliance with the wealthy counties of the central plain. In point of
                            development 
                                Parke

                                Vermillion
                             really ought to be classified with 
                        Benton, Jasper, Lake, Newton, Porter
                     , and 
                                Warren
                            .
                  
                     43 That is why this section is shown on the maps with low land
                        values.
               
                     went the process of development during the Republican supremacy
                    following the Civil War. The soil of the four counties to the west was richer; it was owned in large
                    tracts by wealthy landowners; the per capita wealth was high. In 
                        Fulton
                    , Marshall, 
                        Pulaski
                    , and Starke on the other hand, the soil was poorer; it was owned in smaller plots and
                    by struggling farmers. The average per capita wealth was lower by from two hundred to three hundred
                    and ever four hundred per cent. In Starke the average per capita wealth was $308; in 
                        Benton
                     it was $1,424. These figures represent the two extremes. In this connection
                    it is interesting to note that White County, which belonged to the eastern group economically, threw
                    in its political lot with the western group, just as Jay County in the central plain was a poor
                    county which usually went Republican.
            The Republican strength, then, came from the wealthy counties, the counties of large farms, and from
                    those where there was a tendency to a higher percentage of tenantry. Politically, this likeness in
                    economic condition expressed itself in a sectional alliance of the central plain with the northwest.
            The conservative position of the national Republican administrations was a force always tending to
                    make the Republican party in Indiana conservative, but the fact that the party in Indiana drew its
                    strength from the wealthier elements in the state made its assumption of the conservative position
                    much easier. The Democratic party of Indiana in the seventies was more radical than the national
                    organization. The roots of its radicalism extended down to the small struggling farmers in the poor
                    sections of the state, the farmers who had a hard enough time in the prosperous years, and who found
                    the lean years intolerable.
            The Greenback party never came close to carrying Indiana. Except in coalition with the Democrats,
                    that party never carried a single county of the state in the whole decade of its existence. It
                    polled in 1874 a vote of ten per cent or more in twenty counties, some wealthy and some poor, some
                    Republican and some Democratic.44 The party ran second in Black ford,
                            
                  Delaware, Jasper
               , and Newton. Two years later 
                  
                     44 The Republican counties in which a vote of ten per cent or more was
                            registered were 
                        Benton, Boone, Delaware
                     ,
                            Grant, Henry, 
                                Jasper
                            , Jay, 
                                Montgomery
                            , Newton, 
                        Steuben, Tippecanoe
                     , and 
                                Warren
                            . The Democratic counties were 
                                Blackford
                            , Clinton, 
                        Greene, Hancock, Johnson,
                                    Pike, Sullivan
                     , and 
                                Whitley
                            .
               
                     it polled a vote of ten per cent in only 
                  Boone, Brown, Fountain, Steuben, Vigo
               , and 
                        Warren
                    . Three were Republican counties and three were Democratic. The Greenback party reached
                    its high water mark in 1878 when it polled a vote of ten per cent in thirteen Kepublican counties
                    and in nineteen Democratic counties.45 The party was second in Jackson, Newton,
                    Vigo, and Wells. In 1880 the Greenback vote was ten per cent or more in 
                  Boone, Fountain
               , Marshall, 
                        Pulaski
                    , Starke, and Wells. Only in fusion was the Greenback party able to function as an
                    effective political organization.
            The truth is that there was no need of a third party in Indiana. Unlike overwhelmingly Republican
                    states as 
                  Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa
               , and the
                    Dakotas, Indiana was a state with two strong major lbarties, and a third party was not the necessary
                    and inevitable creation of a suffering people groping for an instrument with which to express
                    opposition. The Democratic party was the natural party of opposition and was radical enough to give
                    the discontented a means of expressing their unrest. The Greenback party did serve a purpose,
                    however. It was a creator of original programs; a maker of new ideas. The Indiana Plan was adopted
                    by the Indiana Democracy as well as by the national Greenback party, and it is perhaps one of the
                    cleverest and safest soft-money schemes ever devised.
            What accounts for the success of the Democratic party in 1870, 1872, 1874, 1876, 1878, 1882, and
                    1884? Undoubtedly, economic discontent was the chief factor. But the Democratic party
                    made a bid for the wet vote, and it was the combination of liquor and inflation which explains the
                    victories of the seventies. Democracy made a bid to the cities with its wet planks. Republicanism
                    made a bid to the cities with its appeal to the manufacturing and industrial interests. And
                    Democracy won. The Republicans usually won some thirteen counties which had over a half million
                    dollars invested in manufacturing in 1880, while the Democrats usually carried some fourteen
                    counties with similar investments.46
            
            
               
                  45 The Republican counties were 
                            Benton

                     Steuben, Switzerland, Vermillion
                  , and, 
                            Warren
                        . The Democratic counties were Adams,

                        .
               
                  46 The Republicans usually carried 
                     Delaware, Elkhart
                  ,
                        Grant, Hen Jefferson, Lake, 
                     Marion, Montgomery
                  , Noble, 
                            Tippecanoe

                            Wabash
                        , and 
                            Wayne
                         counties. The Democrats offset this by usually carrying Allen, 
                            Bartholomew
                        , Cass, Clark, 
                     Dearborn, Floyd, Johnson, Knox, LaPorte, Madison, Marshall, Miami, St. Joseph, and Vigo. Vigo County
                  
                        usually went Democratic in the 1870's, but went Republican more often in the
                        1880's.
            
            
            It was the liquor issue which carried for the Democrats the industrial and urban centers. The chief
                    cities of Indiana in 1870 were in their order of population 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 
                  Marion, Evansville
                in 
                        Vanderburgh
                    , Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in Allen, 
                        Terre Haute
                     in Vigo, New 
                        Albany
                     in Floyd, 
                        Lafayette
                     in 
                  Tippecanoe, Richmond
                in 
                  Wayne,
                            South Bend
                in 
                        St. Joseph
                    , and 
                        Vincennes
                     in 
                        Knox
                    . 
                        South Bend
                     had superseded 
                        Richmond
                     in 1880 as the seventh city. The Democrats in 1874 carried Allen, Floyd,
                            
                  Knox, Marion,
                            St. Joseph
               , and Vigo. Two years later the
                    Democrats carried Allen, Floyd, 
                  Knox, St. Joseph
               , and Vigo, as they did again in 1878. They won
                    in the same urban communities in 1882 and in addition carried Vander-burgh. The Democrats usually
                    came out of Fort 
                  Wayne, Terre
                            Haute
               , New

                            South Bend
               , and 
                        Vincennes
                     with large majorities, while they managed to keep the Republican pluralities in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Evansville
                     down to a very low level, and occasionally carried either or both of the latter two
                    cities. The only cities of the first rank which were definitely Republican were

            Besides appealing to the urban population, the liquor issue appealed to the Catholic and foreign,
                    especially German, voter. But many of these lived in the cities and have thus already been accounted
                    for. The Democrats carried the rural counties where these elements constituted numerous parts of the
                    population. But as these counties were for the most part poor counties, with Democratic leanings,
                    they probably would have been carried anyway.
            Of the forty-three counties containing the heaviest foreign-born population only eleven were
                    definitely Republican while twenty-seven were definitely Democratic. Of the thirty-five counties
                    possessing the heaviest German population only seven were definitely Republican while twenty-four
                    were definitely Democratic. Of the thirty-three counties having the heaviest Catholic population
                    only four can be set down as Republican while twenty-two can be set down as normally Democratic. In
                    the central plain there were fewer foreign-born and here the Protestant sects were strong,
                    particularly Methodism. The Republicans, with their tendencies to temperance, drew heavily from the
                    Methodists and the Baptists.
            The Democrats made no demagogic nor unnatural appeal to the poor, the discontented, and the wets. In
                    1868 their party already was composed of the poor counties, and contained large foreign, German, and
                    Catholic elements. Thus composed, it naturally espoused the causes which appealed to  its own people. A party becomes what it is because of the constituent
                    elements which combine to make it up. In the seventies the Democrats welded liquor and inflation
                    into a winning issue, carrying the poor counties (and a majority of the urban communities. This
                    victorious alliance was neither unnatural nor unholy: the Democratic party merely adjusted its
                    policies and its creed to the interests and predilections of the people who composed it.
            After 1880 the industrial development of Indiana was more rapid. Of the 724,058 people in the state
                    engaged in occupations in 1890, 330,569 were engaged in agriculture; 161,637 were offering personal
                    and professional services; 139,-508 were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits; and
                    92,344 were employed in trade and transportation. Far less than half of the population of the state
                    was engaged in agriculture. Cities were growing rapidly. 
                        Indianapolis
                     contained 105,436 people. 
                        Evansville
                     had grown to 50,756; Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to 35,393; and 
                        Terre Haute
                     had increased to 30,217. In 1880, capital invested in manufacturing had climbed to
                    $131,605,366, the number of manufacturing establishments had increased to 12,354, the net
                    value of the manufactured products was $96,705,976, the number employed in factories was
                    124,349, and the total yearly wages paid amounted to $51,749,976.47
            
            From 1886 to 1900 the "Natural Gas Craze" existed in ten counties, and factories
                    were drawn by the prospects of cheap fuel.48 The amount of coal mined in the
                    state jumped from 1,996,490 tons in 1880 to 4,068,124 tons in 1896.49 The
                    capital invested in manufacturing rose to $234,481,528 in 1900. The number of wage
                    earners in that year increased to 155,956. It is significant that the greatest industrial
                    development in the state was taking place in the central plain land in the northwest, Republican
                    sections, increasing their population and their wealth. On the other hand, industry in the southern
                    section was not growing so rapidly, and the industrial center at New 
                        Albany
                     had actually declined. These facts help explain why Indiana did not respond effectively
                    to the agrarian crusade of the 1890's.

            German newspapers were first published in the East, and as the Germans migrated west, German
                    newspapers began to appear in other sections. The type used for many of them did not appeal to the
                    eye, and a number of them were written in a corrupted German. Among the first to appear was the Philadeldphische Zeitung published by Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                     on May 6, 1732. After fifty subscribers had been procured, the regular publication of
                    the paper began on June 24, 1732. It was issued every other week for five shillings per year. Der Hoch Deutsche Pennsylvanische Geschicht Schreiber was established in America
                    in 1739 by Christopher Sauer at 
                  Germantown, Pennsylvania
               , and was among the first permanent
                    German newspapers. The title of the paper was changed in 1762 to 
                        Germantown
                    
                    Zeituny. It published the more important news about the kingdom of nature and the
                        church.1
            
            Thirty-seven newspapers were published in the 
                        United States
                     in 1776, of which three were German. They were the Germantowner
                    Zeitung, a, four-page weekly paper; Der Wochentliche Plzilaclelphische
                    Staatsbote, also a four-page, weekly paper; and Der Amerikanische Staatsbote
                    at 
                        Lancaster
                     which was a bilingual paper, half of it being printed in German and the other half in
                        English.2
            
            The early movement of Germans into 
                        Ohio
                     is marked by the publication at 
                        Lancaster
                     in 1807 of Der Westliche Adler vion

                         Eagle. The next year the title of the former was changed to Der 
                            Ohio

                    Republican from November 7, 1818, to February 13, 1819, urging German citizens of
                            
                  Ohio, Kentucky

                    , and elsewhere to subscribe to the paper which was "shortly to
                    recommence" publication. In the thirties the name was changed to 
                        Lancaster
                    
                    Volksfreund. It was removed to 
                        Columbus
                     in 1841 and resumed the old name. Fried-rich Fieser and Jacob Reinhard bought the paper
                    in 1843, and a new biweekly paper was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays under the title of the
                        Westbote. The latter had a circulation of twelve hundred in 1876 and in
                    politics supported the Democratic party.3
            
            The Catholics in 1837 established the first German Catholic periodical in the Middle West, Der Wahrheitsfreund, in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The impetus for this venture, no doubt, may be attributed to the Catholics of that
                    city. Since Father Kundek advertised in this periodical in order to induce settlers to come to
                    Ferdinand, it was also familiar to the German Catholics in 
                        Dubois County
                    .4
            
            The first German newspapers that circulated in Indiana came in from neighboring states. It was not
                    until 1845 that the first attempt was made by Georg Walker to establish a German newspaper, the Hochwächter, in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The publication of the paper was suspended in 1849 upon the death of Walker, The
                    credit for the first regular weekly paper in Indiana must be given to Julius Botticher, a Prussian,

                            who, coming most of them over Zane's Trace from Wheeling had settled in the
                            vicinity. Ebenezer Zane had laid out the town and named it for

                    and in 1876 there were thirty German newspapers being printed in Indiana. Of the twenty-two who
                    reported their circulation, the average circulation was 1,589. Eighteen endorsed the views of the
                    Democratic party, seven supported the Republican party, one was neutral, two failed to indicate
                    their tendency, one was a religious paper, and one devoted its columns to humor and satire.5
            
            The first newspaper issued in 
                        Dubois County
                     was the American Eagle, published by Henry Comingore in 1846. He
                    arrived at 
                        Jasper
                     on July 4, 1846, and began the publication of his paper in the county
                    assessor's office in the courthouse. The American Eagle was a four-page
                    six-column paper published at 
                        Jasper
                     until 1848 when it was removed to Paoli. Unfortunately, the files of this paper were
                    destroyed by fire. In its columns it announced that wheat, corn, oats, corn meal, and potatoes would
                    be received in payment of subscriptions. In politics it supported the Democratic party. Since there
                    was no paper published in 
                        Dubois County
                     for a number of years after the removal of the American Eagle, legal
                    notices had to be published in a near-by paper. After the American Eagle had been
                    removed from 
                        Jasper
                     to Paoli, it published a legal notice for the treasurer. of 
                        Dubois County
                     on July 2, 1852.6
            
            John Mehringer, Rudolphus Smith, and Clement Doane commenced the publication of the 
                        Jasper
                    
                    Weekly Courier in 1858. The first number of the four-page five-column paper

                            from 
                        Germantown, Ohio
                     , to 
                                Cincinnati
                            , then to 
                                Louisville
                            , and later back to

                     was issued on Friday, March 19, 1858. Several paragraphs from
                    the editorial section of the first issue follow: 
                        The importance of a newspaper in 
                                Dubois County
                             is too obvious to require an elaborate argument. The rich and fertile lands of
                            this county, teeming with nature's most valuable productions; the vast array of
                            laborious and successful agriculturalists spiread over its entire surface; the immense beds
                            of coal and other valuable mineral deposits treasured up beneath its surface, entitle it to
                            a high place among the best counties of our rich and prosperous State. The agricultural
                            interests of Dubois are annually assuming more importance; its population is rapidly
                            increasing; its political influence is sensibly advancing, and consequently it is of the
                            highest importance that those interests, and the general wants of our citizens, should be
                            kept prominently and constantly before the country. To accomplish this end no means that can
                            be devised will prove so effectual as the permanent establishment of a good weekly paper.
                        Politically, the Courier will steadily advocate the principles and policy peculiar to the
                            Democratic party. But as in the present state of political controversy, it requires optics
                            as sharp as those of 
                                Butler
                            's hero to distinguish the genuine from the counterfeit….
                        The Courier is not intended exclusively for any class of readers, or for any kind of
                            reading….
                        … And we intend to publish it at so low a rate, ($1 50 in advance,
                            $2 within six months,) and to give it a value so much beyond its price, as will
                            make it a welcome visitor to the family circle, the counting room and the shop.7
                  
                    
            
            That the editors were conscious of the German element in the county is obvious by the fact that the
                    following notices appeared in the first issue and those that followed, in German type:
                    "Advertisements in German will always be handled in this office in the best and cheapest
                    manner."
            At the end of the first year Smith closed his career with the 
                        Jasper
                    
                    Weekly Courier, and the business was thereafter conducted in the name of
                    Mehringeir & Doane. Mehringer severed his connection with the paper on November 1, 1859,
                    because the income was not sufficient to justify the division of the profits.8
            
            From all records available it may be assumed that the

                            , Indiana, Weekly Courier, March 19, 1858. Mehringer was
                            auditor of 
                                Dubois County
                             from 1856 to 1863 and Smith a lawyer. Doane was born in Circleville, 
                                Ohio
                            , on November 11, 1832. At the age of eighteen he left home and began working at
                            the printer's trade in Portsmouth, 
                                Ohio
                            , then in 
                        Louisville, Kentucky
                     , and from there went to 
                                Rockport
                            , Indiana, and in 1858 came to

                        Huntingburg
                    
                    Signal, a weekly German newspaper for 
                        Dubois County
                    , was the third newspaper to be established in the county. The first issue appeared on
                    Saturday, May 11, 1867. It was a four-page, five-column paper, and the price was $1.50
                    per year. The first number contained several statements as to its policy. First, it was hoped that
                    no German would find the price beyond his means; second, that if the Germans did not support the
                    paper they would be degraded in the eyes of the Americans in the county; and third, that the paper
                    would not affiliate with any political party.
            The first editor and operator of the paper was E. Reininghaus, a native of 
                        Germany
                    , who had learned the printer's trade in that country. E. Pickhardt, a pioneer
                    merchant, financed the paper for his nephew in part by getting a number of businessmen to loan him
                    ten dollars each. He gave them notes for the loan and later redeemed the notes with advertising and
                    printing. A year after the paper began its publication, it was suspended, apparently, because it had
                    not received sufficient support. In the fall of that year, Pickhardt made an attempt to revive the
                    paper because a prominent Democrat promised to get six hundred subscribers for the paper provided it
                    would sponsor the principles of the Democratic party. The paper was revived in September of 1868
                    under the title of the Huiitingburgh Demokrat. Since the Democrat failed to make
                    his promise good, the paper was again suspended after the sixth issue. Pickhardt again revived the
                    paper in January, 1869, which bore the name of Huntingburgh Signal and started
                    with the first issue in January as volume 2, number 1, ignoring the six issues published under the
                    name of Demokrat.9
            
            From time to time, changes were made in the size of the paper. The four-page paper had six columns on
                    March 6, 1869; two columns were added on March 27, 1879; another column was added on March 24, 1887,
                    making it a nine-column paper. The paper was enlarged to eight pages with six columns on December
                    26, 1895. Both English and German advertisements appeared in the paper, but all other reading matter
                    was printed in German. Some of the advertisements which were unusual and very clever appeared in the
                    columns devoted to personal items.10

                            Huntingburg
                        , Indiana, July 10, 1944.
               
                  10 From the files of the 
                            Huntingburg
                        , Indiana, Signal in the Indiana University Library.
            
            
            The paper began its publication in English on May 1, 1914. The change in languages apparently was
                    purely a business move. Pickhardt planned to install a typesetting machine, the first in the county,
                    and he — was well aware of the fact that eventually he would need to buy English mats,
                    and, therefore, he did not deem it available to invest in German mats which would be discarded in
                    the near future. It was, no doubt, also difficult to get German printers. The paper was leased to
                    Elmer Katter on July 1, 1933, for six months with the privilege of buying the business any time
                    during the life of the lease. Katter discovered that the business met his anticipations and
                    concluded it would be more economical to own the business and move it to his own building, and on
                    October 16, 1933, he became the owner of the paper.11
            
            Before mentioning the part the Germans played in politics, it may be well to state that there was
                    considerable friction in the 
                        United States
                     between the "Grays" as those Germans were called who came before
                    1848, and the "Greens" those who came after 1848. There were times when it was
                    advisable for a member of either group not to appear alone in a locality as his opponents might
                    descend upon him. Occasionally, they went so far as to engage in a hand to fist fight. There were a
                    number of radical reformers and revolutionists among the "Forty-eighters" who were
                    determined to make the world over. The native Americans were also disgusted with them and referred
                    to them as greenhorns, revolutionists, and blasphemers.12
            
            Most of the "Grays" had affiliated with the Democratic party, but those
                    "Greens" whose views were too radical and who did not care to unite with this
                    party floundered around for some time. The abolitionists expressed the views of this group on the
                    slavery question, but the religious zeal of the former was frowned upon by the
                    "Greens." They saw no future in the Free Soil party and, therefore, had no desire
                    to be identified with it. So far as the Whig party of 1852 was concerned, it did not appeal to them
                    because it was no more out spoken on the, antislavery question than the Demo

                     party. Then too, General Winfield Scott, the Whig candidate for
                    president, had a record which was distasteful to the Germans.13 A few, however,
                    did unite with the Whip party and consequently, the Whig newspapers made every attempt to secure the
                    German vote. The Whigs made an effort to attract the German vote through their paper Der Deutsche Republicaner published at 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Thousands of these copies were distributed free among the Germans in Indiana. A German
                    Democratic Association was also organized in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the hope that this party might induce the Germans to vote for the Democrats. Both
                    parties were discouraged because the Germans refused to become excited.14
                    Because the Germans had been oppressed by their governments and the nobility, the very word
                    Democracy appealed to them. This may account for the fact that the "Grays"
                    identified themselves with the Democratic party. In 
                        Cincinnati
                     when there was a movement on foot to teach German in the public schools, the Whigs
                    opposed it and the Democrats favored it. The economic principles of the Whig party did not appeal to
                    the Germans because such principles were held to be in favor of the land speculator, merchant,
                    banker, and manufacturer. The Democratic party, on the other hand, claimed to be the party of the
                    people. Their interests lay more with the workingman, the farmer, and the settler in the West. The
                    Germans believed that no more true friend for the immigrant could be found than the Democratic
                    party. It was said that the Democrats were able to maintain control of the government because so
                    many immigrants identified themselves with this party.15

                        had said: "I now hesitate between extending the period of residence before
                        naturalization and a total repeal of all acts of Congress on the subject: my mind inclines to
                        the latter." At

            The slavery problem which raised new issues in all parties in the fifties made some Germans question
                    their political allegiance. Because the Democratic party was so closely allied with the slave
                    interests many Germans began to waver, and upon the arrival of the
                    "Forty-eighters," the first thread was broken in the allegiance of the Germans to
                    the Democratic party.16
            
            When the Republicans began their organization in 1854, a large number of
                    "Forty-eighters" identified themselves with this party. Now the struggle between
                    the "Grays" and the "Greens" was again renewed since the former
                    supported the Democratic party. Although a large number of Germans had become Democrats, they were
                    opposed to the repeal of the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise. The hostility of the German newspapers was aroused by the passage of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Bill and out of eighty-eight German newspapers, eighty opposed the bill and eight
                    favored it. Some Germans hesitated to join the ranks of the Republicans because the Puritans and
                    Know-Nothings had united with the party. Because the "Forty-eighters" identified
                    themselves with the Republican party and were bitter enemies of the Catholics, the latter usually
                    remained true to the Democratic party. The Republican party was denounced by the Catholic Seebote as a party composed of "Temperance men, abolitionists, haters of
                    foreigners, sacrilegious despoilers of churches, Catholic-killers."17
            
            Concessions had to be made in order to win the German vote for the Republican party. 
                        Iowa
                     well aware of its large German element in 1858 amended its prohibition law so as to
                    permit "the manufacture and sale of beer, cider from apples or wine from grapes, currants
                    or other fruits grown in this state."18 Lincoln also did his part by
                    going to German

                        Illinois
                    , in a speech which he delivered he said, "God bless the Dutch." The
                    Republicans in a number of states nominated Germans for state offices.19
            
            At the Republican convention which was held in 
                        Chicago
                     in 1860, efforts were made to convince the German delegates that the Puritans and
                    nativists were not in control of the party. A sufficient supply of beer seems to have been on hand
                    to help rally the Germans to the Republican standard. Carl Schurz, a delegate from 
                        Wisconsin
                     to the convention, was regarded as the representative and spokesman for those of German
                    parentage. Honors were bestowed upon him in the hope that he might influence the German vote. As a
                    member of the resolutions committee, he wrote w-hat became known as the Dutch plank and it was
                    subsequently included in the Republican platform for 1860.20 The Dutch plank
                    read as follows: 
                        "The Republican party is opposed to any change in our naturalization laws, or any
                            State legislation, by which the rights of citizenship heretofore accorded to immigrants from
                            foreign lands shall be abridged or impaired, and is in favor of giving a full and sufficient
                            protection to all classes of citizens, whether native or naturalized, both at home and
                                abroad."21
                  
                    
            
            The Germans not only opposed slavery, but also the greenback and silver craze. A large number of them
                    advocated civil service reform and wanted to see an end put to the radical program of reconstruction
                    in the South. Some Germans shifted their politics from time to time, which would seem to indicate
                    that they were not tied permanently to any party. Charles G. Reemelin, a prominent German-American
                    politician of 
                        Ohio
                    , who had attended the Republican convention at 
                        Pittsburgh
                     in 1856 for the purpose of organizing a permanent party, identified himself in 1860
                    with the Breckinridge Democrats of 
                        Ohio
                    . Gustav Korner was elected lieutenant-governor of 
                        Illinois
                     on the Democratic ticket, but in 1854 at the time of the Mansas-

                     Bill and the trouble among the border ruffians in

                     of the president's cabinet, as Secretary of the
                    Interior, in the Hayes administration.22 It is apparent that the Germans were
                    independent in politics and that some achieved high positions.
            The first officials in 
                        Dubois County
                     were Whigs, but since 1840 the Democratic party has been continually in control. As has
                    already been stated in a previous article, 
                        Dubois County
                     was settled mostly by Southerners and Germans, especially German Catholics, and one can
                    thus readily account for the Democratic control of the county.23
            
            Ferdinand has always been Democratic. This may be explained by the hostile attitude of the old Whigs
                    as well as the new Republicans towards immigrants and Catholics. The Whig party was influenced by
                    the Know-Nothing and similar groups which opposed immigration and Catholics. For the European
                    immigrants the principles of government which the Democratic party favored had more of an
                    attraction. Father Kundek was a loyal Democrat and his colonists followed in his footsteps in their
                    choice of a political party. He also impressed upon them the need of their remaining together
                    whenever their interests were concerned and not permit scheming politicians to win their votes. He
                    wrote the following letter to John N. Gerhard: 
                  
                     
                        Let the people know that according to my counsel the German Catholics never do well
                                    at an election except they hold together—
                                        Jasper
                                    , Ferdinand, Celestine, One; and it'll go—else the
                                    German Catholic vote will not be regarded and I can not effect any good for you with
                                    the Americans once they find out that they can divide us and set us against one
                                    another; we the disunited lose by that, and the other party laughs over our
                                    simplicity because we help to hand over to him the power wherewith to harm us.
                        Ponder over this for all future time, even when I am no longer here. That should be
                                    your principle.24

                  24 Father Kundek to John N. Gerhard, Ferdinand, Indiana, July 27, 1846, as
                        quoted in Kleber, Ferdinand, 77–78.
            
            
            The day following the presidential election of 1888, the returns were brought from St. Meinrad, also
                    a Democratic center in 
                        Spencer County
                    , to the county seat. When the inspector arrived he was informed that since the
                    Democratic party had lost by a large majority, it would not be necessary to take care of his
                    ballots. No doubt, somewhat surprised he replied: "Has the vote from Ferdinand Township
                    been heard from?" He seemed to be confident of the fact that the combined vote
                    of Ferdinand and St. Meinrad could bring a victory in the national election to the Democratic party.
                    So far as Father Kundek was concerned politics meant the management of public affairs, and even
                    though politicians might claim religion did not belong there, he felt it did. He was further of the
                    opinion that the principles of the Democratic party served the interests of the public in the most
                    satisfactory manner.25
            
            When the old log courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1839, a new building had to be constructed. The
                    money was appropriated and a contractor engaged. After the foundation had been completed the work
                    ceased, and for some time the partially constructed building stood, no credit either to 
                        Jasper
                     or 
                        Dubois County
                    . Since Father Kundek could no longer endure the view, he consulted with men of
                    experience who were willing to do the work for a reasonable sum under his management. He then filed
                    a petition with the board of county commissioners to permit him to complete the building which he
                    agreed to do by December. 1, 1845. The contract was accordingly awarded to Father Kundek on December
                    3, 1844. Father Kundek was also appointed to the board of school examiners of 
                        Dubois County
                     in 1853.26 From these acts it must be obvious that the people had
                    confidence in him and thus he was enabled to demonstrate his belief that politics was the management
                    of public affairs.
            Many Germans of 
                        Dubois County
                     were interested in the management of local affairs as can be seen by the names of the
                    county officials. Some Germans became prominent as state officials. Matthais Keinpf of Ferdinand
                    represented 
                        Dubois County
                     in the lower house of the state legislature in

                     the General Assembly of 1859. No doubt, credit must be given to
                    him for the addition of German books to county libraries in areas where a sufficient number of
                    Germans would warrant the expense. He also advocated that a longer period of residence should be
                    required of foreigners before permitting them the privilege of voting, doubtless with the view that
                    the new citizens should be better acquainted with American ideals before casting their ballots. It
                    is possible that Kempf was influential in the act which was approved on March 5, 1859, to provide
                    for the printing and binding of two thousand copies of the Indiana Laws passed at the special
                    session of the General Assembly in 1858, and at the regular session in 1859, in the German language,
                    and for the distribution and sale of the same.27
            
            The fact cannot be overlooked that the Germans made a real contribution in the Civil War. From the
                    statistical study made by B. A. Gould, it appears that 176,817 men born in 
                        Germany
                     volunteered in the great war. This study also indicated that there were 75,000
                    foreigners whose nativity was not known, and it may be assumed that a large proportion of this
                    number was born in 
                        Germany
                    . Gould compiled another table in which he indicated the contribution each nationality
                    should have made in proportion to its population in the 
                        United States
                    . The Germans were expected to contribute 118,052 but the actual enlistments totaled
                    176,817. This may in part be accounted for by the fact that among the German immigrants a large
                    percentage were young men of military age. Then too, bounties were made so attractive that it was
                    financially. worth while to enlist. Recruiting officers met immigrants as they arrived and persuaded
                    them to volunteer for military service. Some, however, were approached to volunteer while on the
                    journey over. Senator Henry Wilson of 
                        Massachusetts
                     took pride in relating that his state had imported 907 Germans for four regiments.28
            
            Germans also served in the Confederate army; the number has been estimated to be 70,000 of whom
                    15,000 lived

                        Louisiana
                     regiment had six German companies and was commanded by Colonel August Richards. 
                        Georgia
                     had a German artillery commanded by Captain Steigen. Several companies were recruited
                    in 
                  Richmond, Virginia
               , and a German battalion in Galveston.29
            
            Europeans, however, were accused of desertions. It was said that the large bounties attracted them
                    and after desertion they would enlist again for another bounty. Cognizance, however, must be taken
                    of the fact that the immigrants were not familiar with the regulations governing enlistment and
                    discharge in the army. No doubt, the Germans had an even greater handicap because of their language.
                    The localities where the most desertions occurred were in the Eastern manufacturing states. Since
                    the states that had the largest number of German volunteers were in the Middle West, it would be
                    unfair to place too much blame for the desertions on this group.30
            
            The interest of the foreigners can readily be seen by the number who responded to the call of the
                    government. As national unity was important to them, they were willing to defend the government oi
                    their choice. The Germans were also a martial race. Entire regiments were made up of Germans, and as
                    late as 1864, a German regiment in the 
                        Chicago
                     area could be recruited. An act which is indicative of their interest was displayed by
                    the fact that the ships, the "Bavaria" and the "
                        Bremen
                    " brought arms. German societies gave concerts and entertainments in order to
                    raise funds for the troops.31
            
            Because a large number of Germans had received their training abroad the 
                        United States
                     was referred to as an "overseas orphanage for cracked up German
                    officers." The fact, however, remains that the trained Germans made a real contribution in
                    the artillery and engineering corps, as well as in making military maps. Efficient officers were
                    very valuable to the North in view of the fact that the Confederates had the advantage of having
                    most of the West Point

                     graduates. A number of West Point graduates of German ancestry,
                    however, won laurels in fighting for the North, but the names of Samuel P. Heintzelman and William
                    S. Rosecrans are the most prominent. No doubt, the challenge was greater for the German soldier in
                    the border states, especially when the state had not indicated whether it would support the Union or
                    the Confederacy. In 
                        Missouri
                    , the Germans were confronted with such a situation, but loyalty to the national
                    government superseded their allegiance to the states.32
            
            Indiana Germans were also alert and ready to defend the Union. Several years before the war began a
                    military organization had been formed at 
                        Evansville
                     known as the 
                        Steuben
                     Artillery. This company of fifty was composed entirely of Germans with Martin Klauss as
                    the captain. After they had been sworn in as a state militia, they were equipped with two cannons
                    and twenty-four 
                        Mississippi
                     rifles. Since they were stationed at 
                        Evansville
                    , their first job was to search all boats on the 
                        Ohio
                     River for contraband of war. After having been sent to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , they enlisted in the 
                        United States
                     army as the First Battery of Indiana. There they received additional equipment and were
                    sent to 
                        Missouri
                    . The most outstanding engagement that the First Indiana Battery participated in was the
                    siege of Vicksburg. They were mustered out of service on August 22, 1865.33
            
            The Sixth Battery was also recruited in 
                        Evansville
                    , and consisted of German volunteers with Frederick Behr as captain. Michael Mueller
                    succeeded Behr when the latter was killed on the first day of the battle of 
                        Shiloh
                    . This company was mustered out of service on July 22, 3865.34

                    cities of the state were represented by a company. August Willich,35 the first
                    colonel, and Lieutenant Colonel H. von Trebra, drill master at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , had been officers in the Russian army. The Thirty-second Indiana Infantry was
                    commanded in the German language, and each company had a book in which the orders of the colonel or
                    superior officer were written in German. When the regiment had completed its training, it was sent
                    by train to 
                        Madison
                     and then by boat to 
                        Louisville
                    . It joined General Buell's army and on December 17, 1861, encountered its
                    first engagement at Rowlett's Station near Munfordsville, 
                        Kentucky
                    .36
            
            A number of years after the war General John M. Claiborne, a Southern aristocrat, wrote a series of
                    articles for the Galveston News in which he related a somewhat exaggerated account
                    of the part taken by Terry's 
                        Texas
                     Rangers at Rowlett's Station. William Friedersdorf, an old soldier of the
                    Thirty-second Indiana Regiment, became so disturbed that he sent the following article to a 
                        Missouri
                     paper: 
                        Instead of 3,000 "federal Dutch" engaged that day, our force did not number
                            over 700, all belonging to the 32nd Indiana infantry. We were called Germans (Dutch by the
                            enemy) but the majority of us were born or raised under the flag which we
                            served—the stars and stripes and understood for what we were fighting. We were
                            all American citizens. I think fifty-five of our regiment had seen service in the old
                            country. We received the same pay as other soldiers, and like most of the others, the
                            majority of us could have made much more outside than in the service. We were doing picket
                            duty, not having started on the march, when the rangers attacked us. There were just four,
                            not fifteen cabins, "nigger quarters" at the place.
                        
                     
                        35 At the age of twelve he was sent to a military school at
                                Potsdam. After he was graduated from this school, he enlisted in the Prussian military
                                service as lieutenant of artillery. In the revolutionary period of 1848, he became
                                acquainted with Franz Siegel and at the close of this period emigrated to America. Since
                                he was an able civil engineer, he found employment in the Coast Survey of North and 
                                    South Carolina
                                . Later, he came to 
                                    Cincinnati
                                 and edited a German paper. When the Civil War broke out, he organized the
                                Ninth

                        We had only thirteen killed in that engagement, including brave Lieutenant Sacks, a Jew who
                            died revolver in hand, rather than surrender.
                        On a little mound in Munfordville are twelve graves holding the remains of all our men killed
                            in action, except those of Lieutenant Sacks, which were sent to a brother in 
                                Philadelphia
                            . A farmer showed us two graves six or seven miles south of our little battle
                            and told us they contained the bodies of two of our men murdered by Col. Terry's
                            son while prisoners. We never heard of that youthful "aristocrat" avenging
                            his father's death in open battle. Not over twenty-five of our men were wounded;
                            they all recovered.
                        We admired the bravery and dash of Col. Terry and his command, but facts are facts, and facts
                            are said to be stubborn things. If the battle was over "in a period of four
                            minutes," that was all the time required by the "Dutch" to clean
                            up the rangers, aristocracy and all. They left their dead commander on the field and asked
                            for his remains the next day.37
                  
                    
            
            The nativity of one-fourth of the soldiers who served in the Civil War from the state of Indiana is
                    not known, but of the total known which was 155,578, the Germans were represented by 6,456.38
            
            Before the news of Fort Sumter, the inhabitants of 
                        Dubois County
                     were interested in the preservation of the Union, but by compromise. When the news
                    reached this county that Fort Sumter had been fired on, the people were not only determined to
                    defend the constitution and the Union in principle but also in action. Immediately steps were taken
                    to organize the 
                        Jasper
                     Home Guard, and under the leadership of Captain John Mehringer the organization had its
                    first drill session on May 4. Other towns in the county soon followed the example which had been set
                    by 
                        Jasper
                    . A pole raising took place on May 18, 1861, at which were voiced the sentiments of 
                        Jasper
                    .39
            
            
                    The wood of the pole is hickory, indicative, we suppose, of the belief of those who raised it
                        that if the example and counsels of the patriot hero, Old Hickory, had been followed, the
                        present unhappy difficulties in our country would have been avoided; the stars on the flag are
                        thirteen, showing their love for the Constitution of the old thirteen States who originally
                        composed the Republic, and their belief

            Around Ferdinand the feeling of loyalty to the Union was not so apparent. Although the German
                    Americans of this township were slow to defend their country, they, however, seldom sought
                    exemption. Even though the people of Ferdinand Township may have been somewhat reluctant to enlist,
                    the sentiment in 
                        Dubois County
                     as a whole was strongly in favor of the Union.41
            
            While Herman Beckrnann and Frank Kometscher, volunteers of the Ninety-first Indiana Regiment, were
                    home on furlough, they made an attempt to induce others to volunteer. This step angered the members
                    of the Knights of the Golden Circle who lived in Ferdinand Township. One day when
                    Herman Beckmann was in his father's store, Victor Drach, an exceptionally strong young man
                    twenty-one years of age, and some of his comrades, entered the Beckmann store, dragged Herman into
                    the street and threatened to cut his throat. Herman's friend, Frank Kometscher, was
                    approximately a block down the street when he received the news. He immediately ran to the scene and
                    upon his arrival drew his service pistol and fired on the man who was struggling with his friend.
                    Victor Drach was seriously wounded but continued to fight with Kometscher and finally collapsed.
                    Victor's associates were stunned for a few moments. Beckmann and Kometscher, however, lost
                    no time in entering the Beckman store and immediately locked the doors.42
            
            Friends of the dead man were determined to take revenge. The two soldiers, however, escaped and
                    hurried to 
                        Troy
                    . Their enemies followed them, but fortunately for the soldiers, they arrived at the
                    boat first. Since there were quite a few soldiers on board, further attempts at violence were
                    averted. Kometscher, upon the advice of Father Chrysostom requested that he be placed before a court
                    martial. The court justified his action, and the military authorities informed Ferdinand that if any
                    more disturbances occurred there, the town would be placed under martial law. The

                     people of the locality claimed that whisky had been responsible
                    for the tragedy. Father Chrysostom denied Victor Drach ecclesiastical burial because he had not
                    attended church on the day of the tragedy, had started the brawl, and though fatally wounded, he did
                    not give evidence of repentance at any time before his death.43
            
            A number of Germans from 
                        Dubois County
                     achieved prominence in the Civil War. John Mehringer was promoted to be major of the
                    Twenty-seventh Regiment before he had been commissioned as a captain. Blume also of 
                        Dubois County
                     and born in 
                        Germany
                     in 1831 was one of the first Union men on the field at 
                        Chattanooga
                    .44
            
            The militia in 
                        Dubois County
                     consisted of 1,481 at the time of the Civil War. Seven hundred and eighteen volunteered
                    for service, but one hundred and sixty-two were exempt from military service because of physical
                    defects. Six hundred and ninety volunteers in service were credited to 
                        Dubois County
                    . Sentiment was so strong in the early days that many young men rushed to the nearest
                    railroad station or town to enlist. Because they were so excited, they failed to check to see if 
                        Dubois County
                     had received due credit, and thus other counties, received credit instead of their own
                    county. One thousand two hundred and fifty-seven men in the county were subject to be drafted, if
                    more recruits were needed. Bainbridge Township was the only township in 
                        Dubois County
                     that escaped the draft which occurred on February 1, March 14, and July 18, 1864,
                    because it was accused of offering large bounties ranging from two hundred to three hundred
                        dollars.45
            
            One company apparently made a deeper impression on the history of’ 
                        Dubois County
                     than any other group. Company K was the first company recruited in 
                        Dubois County
                     for the war. It had been organized as a militia or Home Guard and frequently met for
                    drill. It also included some men from Father Kundek's Guards. Most of the members of this
                    company were young men of German parentage.

                    German. During the course of the day, it was not unusual to find this group conversing in German.
                    The company voted to enter the service of the 
                        United States
                     in August, 1861. A farewell dinner was served on August 6, by the ladies of 
                        Jasper
                     on the courthouse grounds. At this dinner a flag was presented to the company, which
                    had been made by the ladies who served the dinner. The company left 
                        Jasper
                     on August 9 in wagons for Loogootee and from there went by rail to 
                        Indianapolis
                     where they arrived on August 10. They became a member of the Twenty-seventh Regiment
                    which was organized on June 24, 1861, and mustered into service on September 12, 1861, for a period
                    of three years. Company K with other companies of the Twenty-seventh Regiment was actively engaged
                    in the battle of 
                        Antietam
                     on the seventeenth of September, 1862. While this company was somewhat different from
                    the other companies in the regiment, there was never any question as to its bravery, and it
                    commanded the respect of all. It was mustered out of service on November 4, 1864. The veterans of
                    this company who were citizens of 
                        Jasper
                     assisted in the erection of the Soldiers’ Monument upon the spot where the
                    kind ladies of 
                        Jasper
                     had presented the flag on August 6, 1861.46
            
            The first German newspapers were published in the East, but as the Germans migrated west, newspapers
                    in this language appeared in other sections. The first attempt to publish a German newspaper in
                    Indiana was not made until 1845. Twenty-two years later the first German newspaper in 
                        Dubois County
                     was published. It continued to be published in that language until 1914. The Germans
                    participated in politics and until the arrival of the "Forty-eighters" allied
                    themselves with the Democratic party. Many of the "Forty-eighters" identified
                    themselves with the Republicans when they began their organization in 1854. Southerners and German
                    Catholics made up the largest percentage of the population of 
                        Dubois County
                     and that may account for the control of the Democratic party in that county. The
                    Germans also made a real contribution in the Civil War. National unity was foremost to them, and
                    they were willing to defend the

                     were alert and ready to defend the Union and several achieved prominence. Company K,
                    which was a part of the Twenty-seventh Indiana Regiment, was the first company recruited in 
                        Dubois County
                     and most of the members were of German extraction. Those who returned after the war
                    assisted in the erection of the Soldiers’ Monument which stands out as a memorial to the
                    Germans of 
                        Dubois County
                     who fought to preserve the Union.47

                    Telegraph on July 21, 1838, printed its first story upon a monster, already famed
                    in Indian legend, that had made a fresh appearance in Lake Manitou near 
                        Rochester
                    —a monster sixty feet long with a head three feet in width and a dingy coat
                    variegated by bright yellow spots. By the end of eight weeks, the monster and its exploits were
                    known not merely in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                    , but in such far-off cities as 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Boston
                    .1 The Mayville, 
                        New York
                    , Sentinel indignantly decried the tale, refusing to believe in the
                    existence of either the monster or the lake in which it sported;2 but the
                    Buffalo Commercial Advertiser hoped that tidings of this "Western
                    Monster" would flourish, so that lovers of marvel would not feel the loss of the Nahant sea
                    serpent, which had not appeared as yet that year.3
            
            Stories of the monster did flourish. It became the subject of a rather remarkable ode and the object
                    of a public meeting. Its horrific likeness was portrayed in the Telegraph at
                    half-column length. It became a last survivor of the prehistoric mammoth. Plans were made for
                    sending out a "scientific expedition" to sound Lake Manitou and to haul the
                    creature from the deeps by means of a large boat and rafts as a martyr to learning. It was declared
                    to live in Bass Lake, where bones of its former companions still strewed the bank; it swam by vast
                    subterranean passages to Lake Maxinkuckee. All in all, the articles are a curious compound made up
                    in nearly equal proportions of the legends of the Potawatomi who were being removed from the state
                    at the very time when the stories were printed,4 and the literary and scientific
                    resources of pioneer

                  4 In 1836, the Indian Agent Colonel Abel C. Pepper bought the
                        Potawatomi's remaining lands from the chiefs at one dollar per acre with the agreement
                        that the Indians could remain for two years. There were clashes in August, 1838, between the
                        Indians and squatters who had come in anticipation of the expiration of this agreement. On
                        August 29, the Cass and Miami county militia under John Tipton left
            
            
            As this brief summary suggests, the accounts of the Indiana monster grew rapidly to something more
                    than the proportions of a common "snake" story. By September 15, 1838, the time of
                    the last article, they had become a good deal more; they had expanded to include much of what 
                        Logansport
                     thought and felt about the still, somewhat mysterious regions opening up as the
                    Potawatomi left the state. By means of these accounts, we can recapture something of the outlook of
                    our forefathers upon their have, but slightly puzzling, new world.
            The authorship of the articles in the Telegraph is apt to remain a matter of
                    conjecture, but it seems probable that John Brown Dillon had the most important hand in them. Born
                    about 1808 at Wellsburg in what is now West 
                        Virginia
                    , Dillon removed to 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1826 and worked there as a compositor for the 
                        Cincinnati
                    
                    Gazette. He came to 
                        Logansport
                     in 1834 to study law; but though admitted to the bar, he did not become a practicing
                        lawyer.5 Dillon became associate editor and publisher of the Telegraph on August 16, 1834.G He seems to have been the principal editor of the 
                  
                     
                                Logansport
                             to herd the Indians together and remove them from the state. The procession of
                            about eight hundred Potawatomi reached 
                                Logansport
                             on September 6 and remained at the encampment on Honey Creek for three days and
                            three nights before again taking up the terrible march, which was to claim the lives of
                            one-fifth of the band before they reached their destination on the Osage
                            River in 
                                Kansas
                            . On September 16, they had reached 
                        Danville, Illinois
                     ,
                            and on September 18,

                     6 At the time when Dillon joined the paper, it was edited and
                            published by Stanislaus Lasselle. On July 9, 1836, Stanislaus Lasselle sold his share in the
                            paper, at that time called The Canal Telegraph, to his brother Hyacinth
                            Lasselle, Jr. The name was changed to The Telegraph. When Dillon severed
                            his connection with the paper on January 22, 1842, Hyacinth Lasselle, Jr., took over
                            exclusive management of the Telegraph, which remained under his control
                            until March 24, 1849, when it was discontinued. Thomas Helm (ed.), History
                            of Cass County, Indiana (
                                Chicago
                            , 1886), 453.
               
                     paper in 1838.7 In all likelihood it was
                    Dillon who wrote the three articles signed "A Visitor to the Lake." I assume that
                    these articles were written by an editor of the Telegraph because the second
                    assails the senior editor of the 
                        Logansport
                    
                    Herald as only a rival editor would be apt to assail him and the third defends the
                        Telegraph as only an editor would be apt to defend it. Dillon rather than his
                    colleague, Hyacinth Lasselle, Jr., seems the probable author not only because he was apparently the
                    principal editor but also because he displays elsewhere a command of phrasing, vocabulary, and
                    information equal to that exhibited in the articles, whereas Lasselle's contributions,
                    where they can be identified, do not rise above good journeywork.
            John Brown Dillon was, of course, to become in, later years the noted historian whose A
                        History of Indiana (1859) is still a standard work. In his writings as a historian, there
                    is little suggestion of the spirit of playfulness that is evident in the articles of "A
                    Visitor to the Lake"; but we have a clew to this aspect of the young Dillon's
                    character in "Dillon's April Fool," as recorded by Judge Horace P.
                        Biddle.8 We have also the word of me biographer that "hoary border
                    legends, traditional story, but more especially local history" absorbed
                    Dillon's mind during his early years in 
                        Logansport
                    .9 Such interests run strongly through the articles of "A
                    Visitor 
                  
                     7 Though nominally Dillon shared the editorship with Hyacinth
                            Lasselle, Jr., Dillon seems to have devoted his full time to the paper while Lasselle must
                            have given much time to his combined dry goods, hardware, and book store, advertisements for
                            which appeared weekly in the Canal Telegraph. In the issue of August 5,
                            1837, Dillon states that "Circumstances of recent occurrence will require my
                            undivided attention to the regular publication of the paper in which, as a partner, I am
                            interested." Dillon is often spoken of as the editor of the Telegraph, see issues of November 26, 1836, July 27, 1839, see also the
                                Herald, September 27, 1838, October 4, 1838, and Coburn's,

                                 hotel a note with the following legend:
                            "There will be exhibited at the court house this evening a living manthorp, from
                                8 to 10 o'clock.

                            There was much rummaging on the part of the learned young men of 
                                    Logansport
                                 in encyclopedias and books on natural history before it was realized that
                                    manthorp is but a combination of the Old English words for man and village, and that Sir Roger de Coverley is

                    the Northern Monster" signed "Logan" may well have (come from Dillon, who
                    had made a name for himself while: at 
                        Cincinnati
                     as a poet.10
            
            The two articles signed "X.Y.Z." are ostensibly by another hand, for on September
                    15, 1838, the editor of the Telegraph invites "X.Y.Z." to send
                    further communications.11 It is possible that these articles were written by
                    George Winter, Indiana's first artist of note, for his name seems to have been associated
                    with the story of the rncmster.12 My own opinion, which I should not care to
                    press, is that Dillon wrote these articles also, merely resorting to the common editorial fiction of
                    an additional contributor to add interest to his tale. Certainly these contributions are remarkably
                    similar to the articles of "A Visitor to the Lake" in style and point of view.
            These are admittedly conjectures rather than statements

                            contributions of verse to the Telegraph; it is distinguishable by the
                            author's range of vocabulary and his rather deft use of a satirical style. It seems
                            to be hurried work from a writer who could do better things when not confronted with a
                            deadline.

                            "supposed to have been written by our Artist George Winter." No article
                            upon the monster seems to have appeared in either the Telegraph or the Herald during 1837. Cox's account is apparently based upon his
                            memories of the articles of 1838, and oral retellings of the story, after the lapse of
                            twenty years. However, he gives some details not included in the articles; these will be
                            employed in footnotes later in this paper. Jehu Z. Powell, History of

                            of an article in an 1837 Telegraph written by William Winter; but
                            Powell's account seems to be only an inaccurate redaction of Cox's
                            statements. George Winter, "the Catlin of Indiana," was born at Port-sea, 
                                England
                            , in 1810. He studied art at the Royal Academy, 
                                London
                            , for four years before coming to 
                                New York
                             in 1830. He came to

                             in 1837 to paint pictures of the Indians, and he remained at

                             until 1850, when he removed to

                     of fact, though Dillon's identity with "A
                    Visitor to the Lake" seems at least highly probable. In any event, the articles are in good
                    part the work of the community rather than of one or two individuals. The "men named
                    Robinson," the surveyor of the government purchase on Lake Manitou, the workmen at the
                    Potawatomi mills, Mr. Linsey, General Milroy all figure in the accounts of the monster.
                    "Some gentlemen in town" propose the expedition to search out the creature. The
                    editors of the Herald take a hand in the direction of the legend. And Mr.
                    McCartney, the former husband of No-cum-mic-qua, assumes a major role as a man versed in the lore of
                    the Indian.

                    THE DEVIL'S LAKE.
                    In the northern portion of Indiana there are many beautiful little lakes which give great
                        interest to a country somewhat open. About twenty-five miles from 
                            Logansport
                        , and in the vicinity of 
                            Rochester
                        , there is one of these lakes about two miles in length, half a mile in width, and
                        of unknown depth. Soundings were once tried with a line of thirteen fathoms, but with no effect.
                    There is an ancient tradition of the Pottawattimie Indians relative to this lake, which has been
                        handed down from generation to generation, and is now received by the white man with confirmed
                        credence. The precise time at which the tradition was first received among the Indians cannot be
                        determined—probably not a long time after the emigration of the Pottawattamies across
                        the "hard waters" of the north, some centuries since, to this district of
                        country, which was then occupied by the Miamies, by whose grant the Pottawattamies became
                        possessed of the lands which they have held north of the 
                            Wabash
                        . It appears that the tradition does not owe its origin to the superstitious fears
                        of the red men; but that some gigantic creature inhabited the lake, and does at the present
                        time, is beyond the probability of doubt.
                    This lake is called by the Indians "Lake Man-i-toe," or the Devil's
                        Lake; and such is the terror in which it is held, that but few Indians would even dare to
                        venture in a canoe upon its surface. The Indians will neither fish no bathe in the lake; such is
                        the powerful conviction that "man-i-too" or the Evil Spirit, dwells in its
                        chrystal waters. It may elicit a smile from the incredulous to assert gravely the fact that some
                        very extraordinary creature claims monarchy of this beautiful lake. But the existence of a
                        monster in this lake is not an object of more surprise to us than the remains of the Mastadon,
                        whose teeth measures 18 inches—and which were found but two miles from town,  in prairie through which the canal runs. Were there not
                        assurances from men entitled to credibil[i]ty that a monster has been seen within a few days in
                        the lake Man-i-too, it might be supposed the strange story originated in the superstitutious
                        fears of the Aborigines.
                    When the Pottawattamie Mills were erecting some ten years since, at what is called the out-let of
                        the lake,13 the monster was seen by men known to Gen. Milroy,14 under whose direction the Mills, I believe, were erected. There are persons in 
                            Logansport
                         who questioned closely those who lately saw the myterious occupant of the lake, and
                        are now convinced of this tradtion of Man-i-too being founded upon something more substantial
                        than the basis of fish and snake stories generally.
                    But two weeks since some men by the name of Robinson were fishing in the lake, when they beheld
                        with surprise the even surface of the water ruffled by something swimming rapidly, and which
                        they suppose must have measured sixty feet. The Robinsons are respectable men, whose fears are
                        not easily excited; yet such was the terror which this nondescript caused, that they made a
                        hasty retreat to the shore, much alarmed. Since this circumstance took place, and but a few days
                        since, Mr. Lindsey, who is well known here,15 was riding near the margin of
                        the Lake, when he saw, at the distance of 200 feet from him, some animal raise its head three or
                        four feet above the surface of the water. He felt the security of the shore, and viewed the
                        mysterious creature many minutes; when it disappeared and reappeared three times in succession.
                        The head he described as being about three feet across the frontal bone, and having something of
                        the contour of a "beef's head," but the neck tapering, and having the
                        character of the serpent; color dingy, with large bright yellow spots. It turned its head from
                        side to side with an easy motion, in apparent survey of the surrounding objects. Mr. L. is
                        entitled to credibility. So convinced are many of the existence of the Monster, that some
                        gentlemen in town have proposed an expedition to the lake, and by the aid of rafts to make an
                        effort to capture the mysterious being which is a terror to the superstitious, but which becomes
                        an object of interest to science, the naturalist, and philosopher.

            The next week the following article appeared.
            
                    THE MONSTER
                    An expedition to the vicinity of 
                            Rochester
                         for the purpose of surveying the "Devil's Lake," and
                        making an effort to capture the Leviathan that inhabits its mysterious depths, it is generally
                        believed would afford an exciting and interesting trip, worthy the consideration of every
                        scientific mind. If every one who is desirous of joining the expedition would leave his name at
                        the office of the Telegraph or that of the Herald, the full extent of the
                        "Devil's Lake Expedition" may be determined on.
                    Now is the time that invites those interested in the capture of the terrific creature in its
                        natatory gyrations. The weather—the aid of moon-lit nights, are favoring
                        circumstances to effect a triumph over the "Indian terror." It would be well,
                        probably to suggest the propriety of those holding a meeting who are favorable, and willing to
                        support the effort to ascertain with certainty, whether the mysterious, old and cherished
                        tradition of the Indians, is based upon a KNOWN species of fish, or serpent, or whether the
                        field of science shall be extended by the discovery of a new species of animal, perculiar to
                        this beautiful and not oft visited Lake Man-i-too.
                    There are many necessary preparatory steps to be taken, to ensure a successful issue of the
                        expedition:—plans for the capture should be suggested; the policy, too, of the
                        building of a large boat, and constructing rafts; and to advise upon the proper means, to the
                        fullest extent. To determine the soundings of the chrystal depths of Man-i-too would be of
                        itself ample requital to the enterprising who will perform the expedition.
                    The belief of the tradition of Man-i-too is daily becoming confirmed from many unexceptionable
                        sources. Among them is the testimony of the Surveyors of the "Government
                        Purchase" on the Lake,17 who declared they saw a gigantic
                        inhabitant of the waters which very much alarmed them. It is confidently asserted that a line of
                        the surprising length of forty fathoms or 240 feet, has been once dropped and without effect.18 It is truly astonishing that such a small inland lake, so remote too from
                        the seas, should be as mysterious in its depths as it is in its legendary associations. But so
                        it is. Boys! up with your harpoons and to the Lake Man-i-too. The weather, the season, the
                        forest in all its leafy beauties, offer you inducements to leave the turmoil of every day life
                        for a week, and seek relaxation in the exciting expedition to the Devil's Lake.
                    
                  
                     17 "I have been informed that Austin W. Morris, who completed
                            the survey of the lake for the erection of the mills, said that several of his flag-men,
                            while assisting in its survey had become alarmed and made to shore, declaring that they had
                            seen a monster in the water—and for awhile it was difficult for him to get a man
                            to carry the red flag. Whether they really saw anything terrible in the water, or their
                            fears were merely the result of an excited imagination, after hearing the Indian legends,
                            Mr. Morris never pretended to say." Cox, Recollections of the Early

                    It is a subject now of interesting and scientific speculation whether the mysterious creature is
                        a reproductive animal or not—whether amphibious or otherwise. The tradition of
                        Man-i-too will ever lend a romantic interest to the lake and surrounding country; and when the
                        native wilds shall have disappeared, and when
                    "The garden, orchard, mead, and furrow'd field,
                    The choicest products of the season yield,"
                    yet will the tradition be regarded by the infantine mind, and the superstitutious, as a theme of
                        thrilling interest. and terror—while by the scholar it will be cherished as a
                        beautiful historic remembrance of an ill-fated race, whose history will increase in interest as
                        the fleeting days gather upon their memories.

            The following poem appeared in the; same issue as the above-mentioned article.
            
                    TO THE NORTHERN MONSTER.
                    Dear Mr. Monster, Devil, Fish, or Snake,
                    Or whate'er other cognomen you wear,
                    Your neck's in danger in the "Devil'!; Lake,"
                    Unless you keep your head below the air.
                    An expedition soon will scour your range,
                    to take and kill you in your own dominion;
                    Oh! Homicide! or Snakicide! most strange!
                    Supported too, by popular opinion.
                    Look out old Scratch! a head & tail'n at stake.
                    Keep dark and low. How deep's your famous lake?
                    How many hundred years, you old Infernal,
                    Have pass'd since in Manitto you began to revel?
                    Keeping the harmless fish in fear eternal,
                    And scaring young papoosies like the devil!
                    When, with her lover, the poor Indian girl
                    Roam'd near your lake, the fairest of Earth's daughters, Say, did you not your
                        long tail often. twirl,
                    And pop your ugly head above the waters?
                    And was it not for thee right glorious fun,
                    To see the nude and tawny lovers run!
                    How many legends could your skinny Grace
                    Unfold to mortals, if you had a tongue!
                    The loves, and wars, of that strange Indian race,
                    Who never knew from what far land they sprung.

                    Look to thyself, old Monarch of the North!
                    Thy lake will soon be filled with hooks and ropes,
                    And many a tempting bait to lure thee forth,

                    I do not wish to see thee come to harm,
                    Old Imp—and ergo you had better DIVE;

                    The best thermometer stands now at 95;
                    But’ if you will not take a timely warning,
                    Why, I'm your most obedient. Good morning.

            The following item appeared in the 
                        Logansport
                    
                    Herald, August 9, 1838: 
                        Is the expedition to the Devil's Lake no go? Or were the notes of the
                            horn which blew for volunteers, lost amid the din and clatter of the more sonorous sounds of
                            candidates and electioneerists? For ourselves, if there is a big serpent, fish,
                            muley nondescript, or other curious thing, in this lake, we should really like to see it
                            captured. We have heard two or three persons say, should an expedition be gotten up, they
                            would volunteer.
                    
            
            Two days later the Telegraph published another story about the monster.
            
                    THE MONSTER OF "THE DEVIL'S LAKE."
                    The well known tradition of the Indians respecting the Monster in the "Devil's
                        Lake," and the many confirmatory statements of credible citizens, have placed the
                        existence of a monstrous creature in the 
                     
                        20 The author may well have in mind Thomas Ashe's
                                discovery of the bones of the megalonix at Big Bone Licks, near Rising Sun, Indiana:
                                "It is at this place, where the huge organick remains of the mammoth have been
                                dug up in large quantities …. An early English traveler, who called his name
                                Thomas Ashe, and who carried o& to

                                 several waogon loads of the bones, dug out of this Lick, gives it as his
                                opinion that the animal was of the lion kind, called ntegabmyz, or
                                great lion. He says that ‘his shoulder blade was of the size of a breakfast
                                table; that he was 60 feet in length, and 25 feet in height; that his figure was
                                magnificent;—his looks determined; his gait stately, and his voice
                                tremendous!’" The Western Pilot, Containing Charts of

                         waters of the lake, almost beyond a doubt. The length of
                        the nondescript has been variously estimated, from forty to seventy feet; and the figure below
                        represents its appearance according to the best idea that could (be formed from the concurring
                        statements of those by whom it has been seen. The Lake is situated in 
                            Fulton
                         county, about 26 miles, in a north-eastern course, from 
                            Logansport
                        ; and it appears that every attempt to ascertain its depth has hitherto failed.
                    [A sketch of the monster appears at this point.]
                    We are requested to say that a Public Meeting of those who feel an interest in the proposed
                        examination of Lake Man-i-too, will be held at the Seminary,21 THIS EVENING,
                        at half past six o'clock.
                
            At this point, Jesse C. and David Douglass, the editors of the

                    They had printed a brief redaction of the Telegraph's first article in
                    their issue of July 26, 1838, and the title of this article "FISH STORY—A MONSTER" suggested some skepticism, as did the tone of their brief item
                    of August 9 quoted above. In the two selections given below from their issue of August 16, they
                    express open contempt for the Lake Manitou story fostered by the Telegraph and
                    offer a substitute monster in what is now known as Bass Lake.
            
                    
                  The Monster, and a Monstrous Meeting.—A meeting, the object of which
                        was to devise means for the capture of the monster of the devil's lake, was held in
                        this place on Saturday evening last. We did not attend, but are informed that much eloquence was
                        expended, and many plans suggested to accomplish this important object. Resolutions were
                        adopted, committees appointed, and the modus operandi agreed upon. Drawings,
                        we believe, were also exhibited, to show the facility with which "some things might be
                        done as well as others."
                    We suppose his Snakeship, or Scalyship, or sulphuric-ship, as was suggested at the meeting, will
                        be waited upon in due season, and a council of amenity held to effect the object of the pioneers
                        in this great work.
                    Of late he has been seen very frequently, if we may be allowed to judge from the excellent
                        likeness which has already been taken and published of his majesty.

                    THE MONSTER OF LAKE MAN-I-TOO.
                    As this story has obtained and is likely to obtain a credibility which it does not deserve, we
                        have taken the pains to enquire of those who should know, the truth or falsity of the statements
                        made, and find that there is very little if any foundation for the many garbled reports which
                        are afloat in regard to this wondrous and extraordinary animal. Indeed, it would seem that it
                        required more proof, in any event, to be believed. The story it seems in the first place, is
                        predicated upon the superstitious traditions of the Indians, and receives additional strength
                        from the statements of those who have witnessed the curiosity—some ten years ago,
                        others more recently.
                    We are informed by the gentleman who located the Pottawatamie Mills, at the foot of this lake,
                        that nothing of the Indian traditions ascribed to this Lake ever existed, and that when the
                        mills were located, the Indians objected strongly upon the ground that they would sooner be in
                        possession of the fishery than of the mills—the location, they thought, would in a
                        measure, destroy the fishing. Mr. McCartney, one of the first settlers in this country,23 and who has lived among the Indians for several years, says that the only
                        Lake Man-i-too he has any knowledge of lies in Stark county24 near an old
                        road, known among the French traders as the Portage road, and is now called Cedar lake.25 This lake lies near 
                            Tippecanoe
                         river, and has ever been held in dread by the natives. A monster (the bones of
                        which are now to be found) was once—so says the Indian tradition—killed on
                        its banks, the mate of which escaped into the water. This gave rise to the fearful superstitions

                        swan playing on the waters of the Lake, so great was his fear of the Man-i-too, or Devil.

                            men among the Pottowattomies," and was "absent on a trip to

                            "one of Indiana's oldest lawyers," to guard his wife because
                            Bennack "had become dissatisfied with the match, and declared the marriage a
                            nullity." On March 4, 1834, John B. Chapman wrote John Tipton that McCartney had
                            left his Indian wife and that she had married a Frenchman named Rousseau "according
                            to the Indian mode." See Robertson and Riker (eds.) The John Tipton

                    The story of the men engaged in building the mills, at that time, was not at all credited, but
                        was ascribed to their ignorance or superstition—they having no doubt tortured the
                        shadow of the canoe—which was of Indian manufacture, some 20 feet long, and had a
                        figure head—into the shape of a huge monster, which their fright would not permit
                        them to examine.
                    We should not have noticed this, did not the increasing notoriety which the story is obtaining
                        demand it of us. Where there is no plausibility about a story, there is no use in its
                        circulation.
                
            "A Visitor to the Lake" replied to these aspersions in the Telegraph for August 18 with what is surely the wrath and language of an editor:
            
                    THE BONE EXPEDITION.
                    Some very grave and elaborate Editorial remarks appeared in the Herald of Thursday
                        last—avowedly the result of much "pains," and careful investigation
                        of the "Nonster Story," which were characterized with the awful obligations of
                        DUTY, to admonish the public, not to give credence to a tale destitute of plausibility, and
                        which is "obtaining an undeserved increasing notoriety." Has the Senior editor
                        of the Herald, the arrogance and vanity to imagine that he can exert an influence that shall
                        arrest the "increasing notoriety" of the article which appeared in the
                        Telegraph under caption of "The Devil's Lake?" His effort
                        to effect it, is made in a spirit of pitiful, irritability of feeling, and mendacity of
                        sentiment. But says the sapient editor: "we should not have noticed it, did not the
                        increasing notoriety which the story is obtaining demand it of us." Truly a very
                        handsome eulogy upon the merits of the story considering the impartial source whence it comes!
                    The article in the Herald forsooth! scarce merits a passing thrust, as it was concocted in the
                        bitterness of chagrin, illiberality and guilty meanness of spirit. But we merely glance at the
                        absurdity of the impotent effort to change a favorable public sentiment, towards a tradition
                        connected with a people in whose fate the whole civilized world manifests the
                        warmest’ interest. The attempt is preposterous as it is futile and ridiculous! But a
                        week since friend Jesse was up in arms with highly polished harpoon prepared to start upon the
                        expedition to "The Devil's Lake," to capture the terrific
                        "critter." He announced himself "a pioneer in the great
                        work." But now "a change has come over him like a summer cloud." Not
                        however, until he had "taken the pains to inquire of those who should know the truth or
                        falsity of the statements made" in the Telegraph. Now the Illuminary of the Herald
                        says, that there is no plausibility about the "monster story"—that
                        Lake Man-i-too is not Lake Man-i-too, but that Cedar Lake is Lake Man-i-too. Marvelous! That
                        there is no "monster" at all. Yet, strange contradiction, there is a monster
                        in Cedar Lake, enjoying its natatory gyrations "solitary and alone." And even
                        more forsooth? The tale now is made truly monstrous. For, says the Herald,
                        "a monster, (the bones of which are now to be found,) was once,  so says the Indian tradition, killed on the banks of the Lake, the
                        mate of which escaped in the water." This is valuable information—a
                        scientific point is acquired, which decides the monster to be amphibious and a reproductive
                        animal—or the Man-i-too's mate would not have made a rapid exit in the
                        translucent bosom of the Lake. The Senior editor of the Herald assures us that after much
                        pains-taking that these bones may be found high and dry upon the banks of Cedar Lake.
                    The capturing of the Leviathan of the Devil's Lake near 
                            Rochester
                        , was always dubious—but the soundings alone were deemed of great
                        interest. But the capturing of Man-i-too's bones is rendered certain. For one, then, I
                        go in for the bones! The mystery which has shrouded the change in friend Jesse's
                        sentiments comes intuitively to our mind! Of course as a member of the expedition to the
                        Devil's Lake near 
                            Rochester
                        , he could not aspire to a higher office than "Leftenant," whereas
                        Jesse is ambitious of being a "canting," so he wants to get up "The
                        Bone Expedition" in a sort of generous emulation with the Devil's Lake
                        exploit. Truly noble! Friend Jesse makes a pitiful and uncalled for thrust at an old ally and
                        friend—which is kindly and gently parried without a wish to hurt feelings naturally
                        irritable. Ah! friend Jesse, thou didst wrong to effect a sneer at "the monster and
                        monsterous" meeting and the eloquence displayed there. Jesse says that he did not
                        attend the meeting, a circumstance monstrously regretted—for who like him could make
                        the assembly shine?

                        One of my neighbors says that the large creature in Lake Manitoo, which has
                                    frightened the Indians and whites so often, "is nothing more than that

            Matters rested thus for two weeks so far as the newspapers were concerned. No expedition seems to
                    have materialized. According to Sandford C. Cox, a "sickly season, combined with other
                    circumstances." discouraged the volunteers from setting out.26 Probably
                    the growing tension between the Potawatomi and the whites at this time made the venture seem
                        unadvisable.27 The Herald on August 30, further
                    discredited the Lake Manitou monster in the following brief article, its last upon the subject:

                             Gen. Milroy28 to a gentleman of
                            this place, puts to flight any remaining credulity which may be placed to the credit of this
                            story. We doubt, indeed, if this will not set at rest even the recent discovery of the
                            Telegraph i. e. that the monster has degenerated into the monster of the U.S. Bank. In other
                            words, that Nick Biddle is the Devil of Lake Man-i-too.
                        "I had noticed the snake-story to which you refer. It appears to be going the
                            rounds, and I am unwilling to be referred to as vouching for the truth of a tale of this
                            class in which the author has thought proper to introduce my name. I remember of hearing
                            something of an Indian tradition that doubtless gave rise to this tale—for myself
                            I never credited it as reality. You are aware of Indian credulity, as relates to that which
                            they have received from their Fathers;—also, how many residing places they have
                            imagined for their Man-i-toos,—their good or evil spirits. All that I learnt
                            relative to the Lake, that never appears to have received the name of the
                            "Devil's Lake," I suppose had its origin in some such tradition
                            or fiction. So far as came to my knowledge, the Indians had no fear of being on the Lake;
                            their fishing and night-hunting for deer, was common on it. The objection made by them to
                            the erection of the mills, was that the dam at the outlet would injure their fishing.
                        "I will add, that if any are disposed to invent a "snake-story," I
                            would thank them not to introduce my name into it; this class of tales does very well
                            without a witness."
                    
            
            Two days later, the Telegraph printed a reply by "A Visitor to the
                    Lake."
            
                    THE MONSTER STILL ALIVE
                    In the Herald of Thursday last, an extract from a letter received by a gentleman in town, from
                        Gen. Milroy, was given publicity to, it would seem, to divest the "Monster
                        Story" of the CREDIBLE testimony which is its basis. It becomes a subject of regret to
                        the author of the tale of the "Devil's Lake," that Gen. Milroy should
                        suppose that his name had been endorsed as "a witneiss," believing in the
                        Indian tradition by [sic] which Lake Man-i-too is so interestingly associated, or in any way
                        lending credit to a tale in which, it appears, Gen. Milroy gives no credence. But it would be
                        truly a source of DEEP regret to the author, HAD he wa[i]ved that proper delicacy, and regard in
                        the use of a name WITHOUT SANCTION, to give plausibility and credit to the tradition of the
                        Devil's Lake.
                    The use of Gen. Milroy's name was not necessary or important, or in fact mentioned to
                        give credence to the tale; and by reference to the 
                     
                        28 General, Samuel Milroy, "one of the most noted men of
                                the 
                                    Wabash
                                 valley, was born in Mifflin County, 
                                    Pennsylvania
                                , on August 14, 1780. He came to 
                                    Carroll County
                                 Indiana, in the spring of 1826 and was a leader in establishing that county
                                in 1827–1828 as well as the originator of the name "Delphi"
                                for its county seat. He was a representative for 
                                    Carroll County
                                 to the state legislature in 1837 and again in 1838. For further details of
                                his life, see John C. Odell, History of

                         article that appeared in the Telegraph July 21st, it would
                        be seen that Gen. Milroy's name was used only in connexion with the erection of the
                        Pottawatt[C]mie Mills; and in what way that allusion to his name should bring conviction upon
                        the mind of Gen. Milroy, that, he was therefore supposed to be a believer in the mysterious
                        tradition of the Red Men, is somewhat enigmatical! These are the words used in the article
                        referred to:—"When the Pottawattamie Mills were erecting some ten years
                        since, at what is called the out-let of the Lake, the Monster was seen by men known to Gen.
                        Milroy, under whose direction the Mills, I BELIEVE, were erected." If it be true that
                        these Mills were superintended by the General, and the men in his employ saw the Monster, of
                        course the men gave credence and were "witnesses," but [it] is not set up as a
                        fact, or even intimated, that Gen. Milroy was a witness, nor did the writer of "the
                        story" insinuate such a thing; therefore, it certainly appears to us, that it became
                        unnecessary for Gen. M. to say that he is "unwilling to be referred to, as vouching for
                        the truth of a tale of this class, in which the author has thought proper to introduce my
                        name."
                    HAD Gen. Milroy's name been used in support of the "monster
                        story"—HAD he really been brought in as "a witness," there
                        is no doubt but the respectability of his name might have influenced the minds of some who are
                        now incredulous in regard to the tradition.—Whatever efforts have been made to make
                        "the story" appear destitu[t]e of plausability, or to attribute the Indian
                        tradition as originating in the superstitious fears of the Aborigines, have certainly proved
                        unavailing; for confirmatory testimony every day, adds interest and importance to the
                        Devil's Lake. Consequently, the extract from the letter, in the opinion of many, does
                        not "put to flight any remaining credulity which may be placed to the credit of this
                            story.)’ There is a diversity of opinion as to the location
                        of Lake Man-i-too. At one time, Cedar Lake is Lake Man-i-too and the Devil's
                        Lake—then it appears that the mysterious waters, in the vicinity of 
                            Rochester
                        , are Lake Man-i-too, but not the Devil's Lake.—This is
                        perplexing! It is a point which should be settled at this day. If it be a
                        "BONE" of contention now, it will be, certainly, at some future time, a
                        subject for learned disquisition and antiquarian regret. The mysterious depth of the Lake near 
                            Rochester
                        , is truly surprizing, and the source of so vast a body of water becomes a matter of
                        speculation with many, The Indians believe that there are subterraneous communications with Lake
                        Max-in-euk-kee and the large lakes of the north; and though a theory originating with the
                        Indians, it is not an improbable one, when we reflect upon the physical conformations of the
                        earth.
                    Lake Man-i-too, at this time, is unusually high; and it is well known that the northern lakes are
                        rising to an alarming degree.—Hence, it would appear, that these vest [sic] bodies of water are the source of this lovely little lake. What seems to
                        substantiate the ABORIGINAL theory of the subterranean communication, is, that a
                        "monster" was seen in a lake not far from 
                            Rochester
                        , at the time of surveying the northern portion of Indiana, by a man in the employ
                        of the engineer, who was very much terrified. Such was the testimony  given in 
                            Logansport
                         a short time since, by the gentleman in whose employ the man was.—Now,
                        probably, this is the same "monster, the mate of which was captured on the banks of
                        Cedar Lake." There is no doubt, then, that the "monster" is
                        migratory, and makes excursions through the subterraneous passes from lake to lake,
                        periodically.
                    In the mysterious workings of nature, it is known that subterraneous convulsions have raised
                        mountains from the level—slides have buried vallies—the sea has receded
                        from the land, and advanced upon other portions of the earth—rivers have changed
                        their channels; and subterraneous caverns of miles in extent, are known to exist. All are
                        mysterious, and which render the Indian theory concerning the lakes, far from being out of the
                        pale of probability.
                    A VISITOR TO THE LAKE
                
            This was the final contribution signed "A Visitor to the Lake" and the final word
                    of the Telegraph upon Lake Manitou near 
                        Rochester
                    . The last article of the Telegraph upon the monster of the Indiana
                    Lakes appeared on September 15, 1838, and came from "X.Y.Z." and has to do
                    exclusively with Cedar (now Bass) Lake.
            
                    INDIAN TRADITION OF CEDAR LAKE AND THE MAMMOTH
                    In a few years, how little shall we really know of what relates to the unfortunate race of Red
                        Men, but from what has been but imperfectly gleaned from those who have lived and mingled among
                        them for speculation and profit, rather than from an interest in their history, and social
                        habits. The crumbling column, and disfigured statue, of Egyptian, and Grecian production, are
                        cherished as mementos of a distinguished people, who have excelled in the arts. These relics
                        tell of the age in which they were fostered, and proclaim the advanced state of human
                        achievements, and the sublimities of the arts of that day.—But what monumental pile
                        shall stand, that future generations may point at, to commemorate the ages in which the
                        unfortunate Indians lived? Though these people, rude and ignorant of the arts, will
                        leave but little more than the curious, rude and simple sepulchres of logs and bark, that must
                        inevitably perish before the corroding hand of time, or the irresistable plough-share of
                        obtruding civilization; and though the artist has perpetuated the features of many of the
                        distinguished Warriors, Headmen and Orators of the Red Nations, and the poet, too, has sung of
                        their sorrows and they wrongs; yet, let us, while we can, rescue from oblivion, all that
                        concerns a people that are rapidly disappearing from the theatre of human action, known alike
                        for fortitude and valor.
                    We cherish the old ballads of the; days of chivalry, and feel interested in the superstitions of
                        the days when the mind was shrouded in mental darkness; and as we glance in retrospection upon
                        the mazes of buried ages, and reflect upon our own days of human rights and  religious freedom, before whose radiant star of mental regeneration
                        superstition has partially disappeared, we may well feel proud of our advanced and enlightened
                        civilization. Will not, then, the traditions, history, and thoughts of the Red Men interest the
                        civilized world? Many of the lakes in the fair region of the north of Indiana, are
                        associated with Kee-caw-bas and Man-i-tous. There is a curious and interesting Indian tradition
                        associated with a sparkling lake in Stark county of this state, about four miles in length, and
                        a mile in width, varying but little. The margin of the lake is bounded by occasional bluffs or
                        abrupt banks of no great elevation, and beautifully timbered. Here and there, are green slopes
                        extending from the margin of the lake in gentle ascent, but upon which the Indians never encamp,
                        from the religious awe in which they hold these hallowed waters; which, to the whites, are
                        familiarly known as Cedar Lake, but which the Indians call Man-i-tou-ken, or the Lake of the
                        Devil's Bones.—It is a well known custom among the Indians, to make the
                        squaws the repository of their history and traditions; and though it is a SAVAGE custom yet it
                        may be deemed a felicitous one, for as it is the mother who gives shape, form and character to
                        the infantine mind, so are the squaws, from their habits, suited to impart to the papooses the
                        tone of the tribe. The tradition of Man-i-tou-ken, was related to an Indian trader by a squaw,
                        who was well known in the Pottawattamie nation by the name of No-cum-mick-qua. She was a
                        descendant of the line of the chiefs of To-bin-a-bey; and there fore the tradition is entitled
                        to the credit of legitimacy. When the Pottawattamies located south of the great lakes, and north
                        of the 
                            Wabash
                        , a succession of many centuries since, the land was barren, and the sun shed his
                        refulgent rays upon the open surface of a country not bold nor striking, but diversified with
                        small lakes of various depths. There was but little timber to fling the cool and refreshing
                        shades upon the earth for the game to repose it. At that time, which was so remote, the mighty
                        Mammoth, whose history, like that of the early period of the Indian nations, is enveloped in
                        doubt, mystery and obscurity, was a habitant of the earth, and was indigenous to the great
                        western territory, of which Indiana was a part. Recent discoveries, but a short distance from 
                            Logansport
                        , which are known and familiar to every one here, substantially corroborate the
                        fact, that the Mammoth did once exist in this section of country. These gigantic animals were a
                        terror to the aborigines of the north, among whom they caused much tribulation and anxiety; for
                        the game and all habitable creatures but man, were fast disappearing before the voracity of the
                        mysterious Mammoth, whose pomers [sic] of mastication may be imagined by the
                        citation of a tooth measuring nearly two feet—and it seems it was hailed by the
                        Indians as a happy decree, that the evil or bad Man-i-tou would no longer scourge them by his
                        presence. The Kee-caw-bas, who were good spirits that inhabited the deep waters of lake 
                            Michigan
                        , loved the Indians, and took pity upon their impending dangers of extinction by the
                        rapid disappearance of the game before the terrible and repeated aggressions of the ponderous
                        Mammoth. The Kee-caw-bas, who were diminutive creatures, like unto the muskrat, came  forth from the clear depths of lake 
                            Michigan
                        , which they inhabited, and passed over the barren land, when they found the Mammoth
                        walking forth upon the verdant banks of the 
                            Tippecanoe
                         river, in majestic dignity, a conscious monarch of the land and a terror to the
                        whole of the animal creation, beneath whose ponderous weight and massive foot, every leaf, bud
                        and flower was crushed. The Kee-caw-bas, or Man-i-tous, discovered three Mammoths on the 
                            Tippecanoe
                         river, to whom they avowed a hatred which a final extinction would only gratify,
                        for the rapid disappearance of the game was about to end the chase. Two of the Mammoths were
                        females, and one of them escaped from the destruction of the Kee-caw-bas, enciente [sic] and disappeared in the translucent waters of Man-i-tou-ken, which is about eleven
                        miles from the 
                            Tippecanoe
                         river. From that day to the present time, the lake while it is reverenced for its
                        hallowedness by the Indians, yet it is regarded with thrilling terror and dread. The lake
                        abounds in many species of fish, but the Red Men, from superstitious dread, or from a desire not
                        to disturb these sacred and sparkling waters, never avail themselves of a bounteous providence.
                        No Indian was ever seen gliding in his canoe upon its glassy surface. The Loon sits upon its
                        bosom and screams its melancholy note and flaps its wi[n]gs undisturbed; for the Red Man will
                        not fire his rifle, least the sound should disturb the slumbering Mammoth in her repose in the
                        chrystal depths, and whose terrible desolating work on the earth many centuries since is
                        remembered—for the Indian mother, in narrating the tradition, never failed to awaken
                        a superstitious dread in the minds of the pop-pooses. The Kee-caw-bas, having caused the
                        Mammoth's extinction, retreated to lake 
                            Michigan
                        , and disappeared in its depths for ever.
                    Tho tradition further states, that a crazy Indian, who was encamped with a band of Pottawattamies
                        upon the banks of the 
                            Tippecanoe
                         river, discovered the bones of the Mammoth, and in a fit of desperate insanity,
                        threw them into a deep ravine which connects itself with the river. This place is called
                        Man-i-tou-ken, or the place of the Devil's bones, even to this day. The banks of the
                        river at this spot are of more than their general elevation, and the water remarkably deep.
                        Occasionally the bones of the Mammoth are washed from the ravine, and many of them
                        irrecoverable; but the hope is yet entertained that the skulls have not been dislodged from the
                        repository in which it has laid many centuries.
                    Whatever interest or credit the tradition is entitled to, every mind must decide for itself. But
                        the existence of the bones claims credibility; for they have been seen by many, among whom is
                        our respected friend Mr. M'Cartney,29 who is well known here, and
                        by whose consent, we have the use of his name in making these statements. Upon his veracity no
                        one can cast a shLadow of doubt. He, also, is the surviving husband of her whose name is
                        familiar to the Pottawattamies as No-cum-mic-qua.

            The printing of the Telegraph's last story upon the Indian monster
                    coincided nearly to the day with the passing from the state of the last party of Potawatomi.30 The monster seems to have departed from the lakes with the Indians. The
                    following unsigned editorial, which appeared in the Telegraph nine months later,
                    June 15, 1839, in all probability from the hand of John Brown Dillon, seems a fitting valedictory to
                    the legend:
            
                    LAKES OF INDIANA.
                    The scenery of the "thousand isles", of the St. Lawrence, and of the
                        "highlands" on the Hudson, have been made subjects of history and themes of
                        romance, while the wild, beautiful and gorgeous scenery of northern Indiana is almost unknown to
                        those who have never travelled among it. Hundreds of small, clear Lakes with sandy shores, from
                        one to five miles in circumference, decorate and enliven the face of the country. At one moment
                        the eye of the traveller rests upon cultivated fields, fair hamlets, and bright sheets of pure
                        water glittering in the sunlight. Suddenly the scene changes, and the View extends, through
                        "oak openings" and over a gently undulating surface covered with rich and
                        variegated wild flowers, as far as the eye can reach. Wild deer are often seen bounding in herds
                        over the plains, and flocks of white swans croak their hoarse notes at sunset upon the waters of
                        the Lakes. Almost every Lake is invested with interest by the legendary lore of the Indians who
                        have inhabited the country for centuries, and whose traditions, if faithfully recorded and
                        transmitted to posterity, will be regarded as deeply interesting memorials of a strange race of
                        "barbarians" who perished under the "protection" of their
                        civilized brethren.
                
            The Telegraph could feel that it had done at least something to preserve the
                    Indians’ "legendary lore."

            Documents: REPORT ON THE STATE PRISON, 1823
            GAYLE THORNBROUGH
            
            Samuel Milroy moved in the Indiana House of Representatives on December 5, 1820, "That the
                    judiciary committee be instructed to enquire into the expediency of so amending the criminal code of
                    this state, as that corporal punishments by whipping and imprisonment be abolished and that hard
                    labor on the 
                        Ohio
                     Canal at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     under proper overseers, be substituted …."1
                    This resolution was prompted by three motives: 1) to furnish a supply of labor for the canal, 2) to
                    abandon the brutal and much hated whipping post as a means of punishment, and 3) to reduce the
                    number of prisoners kept in the county jails.
            All the acts and parts of acts in force in Indiana relating to crime and punishment were codified.
                    This code defined around forty-five misdemeanors and felonies and described the punishments or
                    penalties to be inflicted or imposed. Four were punishable by death by hanging, thirteen by
                    whipping, sixteen by imprisonment, and the rest by fines.2
            
            Whipping was meted out as a punishment in so many cases because of the great lack of satisfactory
                    jail space. By law each county had a jail, but these were crude, small structures, unhealthy, poorly
                    ventilated, and usually unheated. Confinement of the prisoners for a period of months or years was a
                    financial burden on the county and a grave responsibility for the sheriff who was in charge of them.
                    Public sentiment against whipping, however, was so strong that some substitute for it had to be
                    found.
            Six months before Milroy introduced his resolution, the 
                        Vincennes
                    
                    Indiana Centinel & Public Advertiser on May 6, 1820, lashed out against
                    this practice: 
                        On Thursday last, the minds of our citizens were shocked by the shameful spectacle of a
                            fellow citizen tied to a sign-post, and flogged like a dog, under sentence of the Circuit
                            Court, now sitting in this town…. The sight was truly disgusting; and it was
                            evident that the

                             manly mind of the officer who executed the sentence
                            revolted at the performance of that odious duty.
                        The criminal code of Indiana is a disgrace to civilization, and it ill becomes our lawgivers
                            to boast of their refinement, while they sanction this species of degrading brutality.
                        Corporal punishments are worse than useless; for nine times out of ten, they are fatal to the
                            mind of the victim—he is lost to society—he sinks under his sense of
                            shame; or, if sensitive and revengeful, the petty felon becomes the hardened ruffian. If
                            guilty, he is then desperate— if innocent, the scars on his shoulders keep
                            knocking at his heart, and calling for satisfaction in a voice that is never mistaken or
                            unheeded.
                        The arguments against such punishments are inexhaustible and insurmountable.
                    
            
            Following Milroy's resolution a bill was introduced into the House authorizing the building
                    of a state prison at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and for other purposes.3 This bill commuted punishment by stripes
                    into confinement in the prison at hard labor. It also linked the, prison with the construction of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls Canal. At one point in its consideration Andrew P. Hay of 
                        Clark County
                     moved that the whole report and resolution which he had submitted relative to the canal
                    be referred to the committee to which was referred the bill authorizing the building of a state
                        prison.4 Also, an amendment was offered to the bill, but rejected, to the
                    effect that the prison proposed to be erected should be completed by voluntary contribution from the 
                        Jeffersonville
                        Ohio
                     Canal Company and other individuals, and that labor of convicts committed to the prison
                    should be limited to work on the canal.5
            
            The bill which finally passed both houses and received the governor's approval on January 9,
                        1821,6 provided for a board of managers for building and governing a prison
                    to be located near 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . The board members listed by the act were Stephen Ranney, John Fischli, Samuel
                    Gwathmey, John Prather, and William Bowman. An agent of the prison was to be appointed by the
                    managers who would give bond for $10,000. The managers were to make rules and regulations
                    for the government and employment of the convicts,

                     to provide for their clothing and maintenance, and to employ
                    officers necessary for their safekeeping. The agent was to make contracts, receive and pay out money
                    under the direction of the managers, watch over the prisoners’ health, conduct, and
                    safekeeping, and employ them in occupations suitable to their various capacities. He was also to
                    purchase clothing and tools for the convicts, raw materials for their labor, and to dispose of their
                    manufactures. All contracts and dealings on account of the prison were to be contracted in the name
                    of the "agent of the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     prison." An annual report on the state of the prison was to be sent to the
                    General Assembly by the agent. One article stipulated that the agent, with the consent of the
                    managers, could contract with the 
                        Ohio
                     Canal Company for the labor of ablebodied convicts.
            Persons to be confined in the prison included anyone convicted of any offense for which he would be
                    liable by the existing laws to the punishment of stripes. Persons liable to punishment by one
                    hundred stripes would be sentenced to prison at hard labor for seven years. Those liable to fifty
                    stripes would be sentenced to five years, and those liable to thirty-nine stripes, to three years.
                    The certificate of a conviction was to be delivered to the county sheriff by the county clerk, and
                    the sheriff would deliver the convicts to the prison. Twenty-five cents a mile was to be allowed to
                    the sheriff for conveying prisoners to 
                        Jeffersonville
                    .
            How the agent was to be paid is not set out clearly. The building and maintenance of the prison was
                    to be a joint affair between private individuals and the state. Three thousand dollars were
                    appropriated for the building to be paid out of funds arising from the sale of lots at 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            
                    
                  Provided, That after all expenses for the support of the convicts, clothing,
                        &c. and suitable allowances to the officers of the prison are paid, the proportion of
                        the residue of their earnings which would belong to the state, according to the different sums
                        paid, shall be laid out in the purchase of canal stock for the benefit of the state, and the
                        proportions belonging to individuals according to the amount by them subscribed and paid, shall
                        be apportioned in such manner as the said managers may direct tlieir said agent to contract with
                        such individuals on their subscribing.
                
            Governor Jonathan Jennings proclaimed the new prison  ready for
                    occupancy on October 2, 1821,7 and in his message, to the legislature in the
                    following December, stated, "Further legislative provisions will be necessary, to carry
                    into operation, the humane purposes of the Legislature connected with the establishment of the
                    penitentiary; and the situation of those, who have been engaged in erecting the building, are
                    entitled to legilsative [sic] attention."8
            
            In response to this last clause, the legislature passed an act which allowed Robert Gray and Reuben
                    H. Murray, "undertakers" to build the prison, $500 in addition to the
                    $3,000 appropriated for the building.9 The prison was not a
                    profit-making institution, and a minimum total of $10,800 was expended for it to the
                    close of the year 1826. Much of this was from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund, but part from tax revenue.10
            
            The 1821–1822 session of the General Assembly did not seem inclined to take further action
                    on the prison. In reply to a report by Stephen Ranney, president of the board of managers, the
                    Senate committee, to which the report was referred, declared that on examining the report and the
                    1821 act, the committee believed that the managers "have full and ample powers granted them
                    to provide for the maintenance and employment of convicts committed to said prison"; and
                    declared that "it would not be advisable to make a further sufficient appropriation, to
                    create good and sufficient walls around said prison, if in the opinion of the Legislature the
                    situation of our financial concerns will admit of the same."11
            
            The following resolution offered by Joseph 
                        Bartholomew
                     in the Senate was rejected: "That the committee on so much of the
                    Governor's message as relates to the state prison at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     be instructed to report a bill to provide for the subsistence of the convicts while in
                    prison, and that they insert in the bill what further improvement they think in

            Governor Hendricks’ message to the General Assembly at the opening of the
                    1822–1823 session asked for provision for payment to the sheriffs to defray the expense
                    of transferring prisoners to 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , and for additional appropriations for the institution which seemed necessary
                    "not only for its prosperity but for its existence."13 Two
                    acts were passed relating to the prison. Another act for the relief of Murray and Gray, and an act
                    amendatory to the act authorizing the building of a state prison were passed in 1821.14 The latter modified the length of sentences the convicts were to serve in relation to
                    the number of stripes they were liable to receive under the existing laws. It also provided that
                    prisoners whose sentences included a fine and who could not pay, could be detained at the prison at
                    hard labor at fifty cents a day until the fine was discharged. The agent was directed to have a Rood
                    and substantial wall built to enclose the prison and appropriated $2,500 for this out of
                    the state treasury. Further provision for reimbursing sheriffs for bringing convicts to the prison
                    was made.
            During the 1823–1821 session of the General Assembly, Governor Hendricks requested a
                    reorganization in the management of the prison. The act15 that was passed in
                    response to this abolished the board of managers and the agency, and entrusted the prison to a
                    "superintendent of the state prison." To this officer fell the duties and powers
                    of the former agent and board of managers. The act confirmed the contract made with the incumbent
                    agent, Abel 
                        Spencer
                    , who was to keep the prison and prisoners according to agreement until August 4, 1824,
                    at which time his contract would terminate. The act gave the governor power to farm the prison out
                    to a superintendent or to employ one at a salary not to exceed $1,000, payable out of the
                    proceeds of the prison. Wells were to be dug and workshops and other necessary buildings were to be
                    erected at the prison.

                     August 5, 1823, was received by this General Assembly,16 but no copy of it has been found. The following document is the report of
                    Abel P. Spencer, who succeeded White as agent. It is addressed to the General Assembly and covers
                    the period from August 5 to December 8, 1823. It gives a good picture of the prison as it operated
                    under the direction of the board of managers and agent and gives some idea of the kind of contract
                    made with the agent. It is evident that the 1824 act endeavored to correct some of the difficulties
                    and problems that 
                        Spencer
                     mentioned by doing away with the dual control of managers and agent and placing one
                    superintendent in charge of the institution.
            This document is in the Archives Division of the Indiana State Library among papers from the

                    To the Honorable the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Indiana.
                    In Obedience to the Act authorizing the building of a States Prison and for other purposes. I beg
                        leave to lay before the Honorable the General Assembly the following report, showing the
                        situation of the said prison, and the convicts from the fifth day of August 1823. to the present
                        date. On the Ninth day of August 1823 I received the appointment of Agent of the 
                            Jeffersonville
                         Prison. At the same time I made a proposition to supply the prisoners with
                        provisions, Clothing, Bedding, Medical aid &c. To pay all the expenses necessary, for
                        the security of the same; according to the Instruction of the Maniger. For which I would receive
                        the services of the convicts as my compensation and clear the state of all expenses except
                        paying the keeper. This proposition was excepted by the Managers. And I entered into bonds of
                        ten thousand Dollars with security for the faithful performance of the same, and the discharge
                        of the duties of agent. It was ordered by the managers that I should settle and pay the expenses
                        of the prison from the fifth day of August (the date of the former Agents Resignation) the time
                        from which he refused to furnish supplies. Whence I entered on duty. the Number of prisoners was
                        Sixteen. Their ware no Mechanicks among them, except two masons and the only business carried on
                        was the manufacturing Segars and the labour on the wall. For those on the wall I received twenty
                        five Cents pr. day each, in Treasury Notes. Since I have had the charge of the prison, I have
                        established the shoe making Tailoring, Blacksmithing Basket Making, the making of Brooms
                        & Mats, and am preparing to introduce other manufacturies, as soon as practicable.

                         and the other a carpenter. I have procured for them sets of
                        Tools but have not been able to put them in employ. I find the expenseof establishing business,
                        in the prison greater than I anticipated Yet I believe by close attention and strict economy the
                        Prisoners may be made to support the establishment. But to ensure its success—some
                        change in its government is necessary. At present the Keeper has the exclusive control of the
                        prisoners, is paid by the day, feels no interest in the business carried on, he lives out of the
                        Prison and is necessarily absent when business requires his attendance. Suffer me therefore to
                        suggest the propriety of allowing the agent to employ a Keeper, One who will attempt to all the
                        business necessary and who shall be approved of by the managers or by the Governor. The work
                        Shops we make use of at present are inconvenient. The Shoe makers, Tailors Basket Makers and
                        those who make Segars are all crowded into one room. This room Tho inconvenunt for so many
                        workman I have made comfortable by putting up a large stove, laying a floor over head, making a
                        door repairing the walls and windows. The Blacksmiths’ Shop one of the ground rooms
                        is too dark and confined; it exposes the prison to Smoke and fire I therefore propose the
                        building of work shops which may be done with little expense by connecting them with the Prison
                        and the Prison wall. A well is indispensably necessary. The water used in the Prison is brought
                        in buckets from a distance of three hundred yards with out the wall and sufficiently employs one
                        man one half of his time. While we remain in this situation the gate must stand open and we
                        constantly exposed to escapes and the Prison liable to be destroyed by fire. The building a Necessary within the wall was deemed requisite. This I have commenced by the
                        advise of the managers, and rely on the Legislature to make an appropriation to pay the expense.
                        There are now confined in the penitentiary twenty Prisoners three of whom are learning the
                        Shoemaking business; three at basket making; five manufactoring Segars, two at Tailoring, two at
                        Blacksmithing, one making Brooms and mats, one cooking one bringing water and making fires; the
                        others are at this time employed on the building above mentioned. Since the 5th of August last
                        there has been brought in from the different Counties fifteen Prisoners sentenced to confinement
                        as follows to wit: Ten for one Year each, One for Eighteen months three for
                        two Years and one for four Years. I have furnished them all with shoes clothing Bedding
                        &c. according to law. They are comfortably clad for winter and are at present healthy.
                        There are in the Prison two women whom I have furnished with domestic gowns.
                        One is employed in Cooking the other at present in manufacturing segars but she ell soon be
                        engaged in Spinning. Since my appointment five have been discharged one reprieved; and six have
                        made their escape.17 The circumstances of which were as follows to wit: On
                        the eleventh day of August last I called on Col Stephen Ranney and Doctor Samuel Meri-wether two
                        of the managers and informed them that business (of which all the managers had previous notice)
                        made it necessary for me to 
                     
                        17
                                
                                    Indianapolis
                                , Indiana Gazette, September 9, 1823, carried an account
                                of this escape.
                  
                         leave home. I stated to them the situation of the Prison
                        and they gave me permission to be absent. At time there were a number of the Prisoners sick one
                        man by the name of Troxel was not expected to live. I did not return untill late in the eaving
                        of the sixteenth when I enquired of one of the managers the situation of the Prison. he informed
                        me that the Keeper was sick and had left the Prison; that he had himself taken the kees had been
                        to the Prison and had shut up the Prisoners in the cells, all except Troxel who he believed
                        could not live through the night. He had therefore left him on a pallet in one of the upper
                        rooms. After receiving this information I callled to see the Keeper returned & went to
                        bed. The next morning at day brake Col Ranney called me, and said I had better go [to] the Prison that the keeper was sick. I went immediately and found the Prison
                        broken. And on examination I found that nine of the convicts had made their escape. Troxel the
                        sick man was gone; and I have no doubt in saying that he broke the Cell locks and through him
                        there escape was effected. I lost no time in giving the allarm and many of the Citizens turned
                        out in serch of them. I spent five days myself. I made an advertisement offering five Dollars
                        bounty; and all reasonable Charges paid for the aprehension of each of them six of whom have
                        been taken and brought back the expense of recovering them hits been in money paid out
                        $72.00 of which I made an account a[n]d the same has been settled by the Treasurer
                        with the exception of fourteen dollars (deducted by His Excelency the Governor) Three out of the
                        nine who made their escape at that time have not been returned. Their names are Alexander H.
                        Porter James Johnson & George Gray Thomas Cummings James Robinson and John Boyd have
                        likewise made their escape they were employed on the Wall, according to a contract with Col
                        Ranney they found their escape easy as their was no guard, nor has there ever been any
                        authorized by government. I am aware that much has been said concerning the escape of James
                        Robemon a man of coular, as their has been an attempt to attach blame to the officers of the
                        Prison. I shall be happy to have a committee appointed from Your Honorable body to examine into
                        their conduct. I understand however that this fellow has been taken up by some persons near New 
                            Lexington
                         Indiana and has been carried to the State of Tenesee. The others I have not healt
                        of. It is not in my power to show the debts due to the Prison, or what claims there are against
                        it, for I have never had the Prison Books in my possession. The Managers directed me to call on
                        Mr George White for the Books and papers belonging to the Prison. I did so,—and he
                        refused to deliver them up untill he got a settlement. I have only settled one account which had
                        been made previous to my agency that of Abraham Knickerbocker who was hired by the President of
                        the board of manigers as an assistant Keeper (The Agent having refused to him one) This account
                        I likewise lay before Your Honorable Body. It is testified by the Keeper and you will see by the
                        receipt that I have paid on it thirty four dollars Treasury money. From the nature of my
                        contract to support the Prison I consider it unnecessary to go into a detailed account of the
                        expences. The hiring of instructors in the different kinds 
                        of mechanical business established; furnishing tools stocks &c. has cost more money than
                        I have realized from the labour of the Convicts. It was well known to me that this would be the
                        case in the commencement. But it was my opinion at that time and still believe by perserverance
                        I shall be able to fulfill my Contract without suffering a loss. In this I should be more secure
                        however if I was allowed to employ such keepers as would attend strictly to my business. I have
                        found by experience that I cannot (under the present regulation). I have the Convicts imployed
                        more than one half of the working hours—On the subject of the Prison Wall, I am not
                        able to make any report. I have been deprived of the Books and papers necessary to enable me to
                        do so—the Wall however had been built of good materials and in a workmanlike manner.
                        It is now completed but I do not know whether it fulfilled the contract of the money which was
                        appropriated for the building of the Wall. I have received $1431.38/100 and I have
                        paid over to Col Ranney $1423.84 1/4 which leaves a balance in my hands of
                        $7.53 8/4 Those accounts & receipts, are lodged in the Treasurers
                        office—To show the situation of the Prison when I took it I herewith submit a copy of
                        my receipt given to the keeper for every article of every description then in his, possession.

               A House Dividing, Lincoln As President Elect. By William E. Baringer. (The
                    Abraham Lincoln Association, 
                  Springfield, Illinois
               , 1945, pp. ix, 356. Bibliography,
                    Index, and Illustrations. $4.00.)
            With an attractive title and a copious subject William E. Baringer has made a scholarly, but withal
                    an interesting, study of the most dangerous period of American history—Abraham
                    Lincoln's four months tenure as president-elect. The gaunt lawyer is deftly portrayed
                    "as a man living between two worlds, one dead, the other struggling to be born."
                    Yet the book is not a segment of the history (November 6, 1860 to March 4, 1861) of the 
                        United States
                    ; it is rather "the story of the making of a statesman" at a
                    "time big with the fate of the nation."
            The two main topics of this day were "crisis" and "cabinet."
                    Lincoln, a representative of the Republican party, a youthful institution, was determined that a
                    dissatisfied minority must not be allowed io disregard with impunity the results of a lawful
                    presidential election. In a position of great influence, but with no power, Lincoln's task
                    was threefold: "He must, unite his party, make himself its leader, and impose on the
                    Republican party a political program which would increase its strength without alienating the whole
                    slaveholding section." Not only did he resist compromise with the South "with the
                    iron grip of a railsplitter," but he moulded the policies and principles of the Republican
                    party—forced them on his followers as no party leader had ever done. To the bitter end
                    Lincoln refused to restate his policy—a sop demanded by Southerners who did not like the
                    principles he had previously enunciated.
            One problem, which immediately presented itself after the election, was the matter of
                    patronage—the proper distribution of the "loaves and fishes." At first
                    this distribution of offices was an annoyance, but as Lincoln grew in political wisdom, he
                    discovered that "political plums" constituted a mighty political club that could
                    occasionally be used to his own advantage.
            The selection of the cabinet was the chief task of the patronage problem. A desire was expressed that
                    Lincoln would appoint a "cabinet in which all men (all except fools  and fanatics) will have confidence." Lincoln's
                    efforts were certainly directed along these lines. The cabinet problem was involved with geography,
                    friendships, ability of candidates for portfolios, secret bargains, coalitions, the right of the
                    vice-president-elect to name one member, and many other annoying and complex factors. After four
                    months of classifying "Grade A" claims with those of lesser pretentions, Lincoln
                    appointed a cabinet almost identical to the one he had had in mind on election night.
            With the "vultures" taken care of, Lincoln studied the threats of secession, heard
                    the secession salvos, and formulated his border state policy. Resting heavily upon press
                    reports—-particularly "the most perspicuous of the reporters —Henry
                    Villard" of the 
                        New York
                    
                    Herald the untiring author has delved to the very depths of the plots and
                    counterplots of pre-Civil War politics. At the same time Baringer has infused into his narrative
                    human interest stories about the president-elect, his family, and associates. Ample attention has
                    likewise been given to Lincoln's visit with his stepmother, the Farewell Address, the
                    inaugural tour, the 
                        Baltimore
                     assassination plot, and his brief residence in 
                        Washington
                     as president-elect.
            As the reader follow-s Lincoln through these many political complications, from the Republican
                    "mecca" at 
                        Springfield
                     to the Nation's capitol in 
                        Washington
                    , he will be consciously aware that the lawyer from 
                        Illinois
                     is no longer an untried statesman, but one who is capable of dealing with
                    "problems …. enough to frighten the greatest statesman who ever lived."
            One is impressed with Baringer's Bibliography of source materials. Then,
                    too, in addition to his attractive title the chapters bear headings replete with fascinating
                    alliterations such as "Bates and Botts," "Travel to 
                        Washington
                    ," and "Travail In 
                        Washington
                    ."
            In summarizing this scholarly and readable work, this reviewer believes that if all phases of
                    Lincolniana were as thoroughly and interestingly treated as this four months period of
                    Lincoln's life, the Lincoln theme would truly be exhausted.

               Catholics and the Civil War. Essays by the Reverend Benjamin J. Blied.
                    (Privately printed, Milwaukee, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , 1945, pp. 162. Bibliography and Index. $2.50.)
            The author tells us that this book had its origin in a study which he earlier prepared on the
                    attitude of the Catholic bishops of the North toward the Civil War. This has become Chapter III of
                    his Catholics and the Civil War and with it begins the real study.
            During the Civil War Catholics were not politically or numerically strong and for the most part their
                    contributions as a church and as individuals have been neglected by the general historian. Father
                    Blied in his Essays, as he calls them, has helped complete the picture of the Civil War by his
                    researches into the church's part in the war. His chapter on the Catholic Press analyzing
                    contemporary Catholic opinion is a real contribution, though smaller in scope than Madeleine
                    Rice's American Catholic Opinion in the Slavery Controversy.
            The bishops of the Catholic church were almost as divided in their opinions on slavery and secession
                    as were the Protestant clergy. A Southern bishop's argument that "the law of
                    Moses, not only did not prohibit slavery, but sanctioned it, regulated it, and specified the rights
                    of masters, and the duties of slaves" (p. 62) could have come from many a Protestant
                    minister in the South. In the main the loyal northern bishop's concern was in preserving
                    the Union rather than in destroying slavery. Catholic representatives, North and South, agreed in
                    blaming the Protestant clergy for making slavery a political issue.
            By dealing primarily with the church as an organization, this study has scratched the surface of a
                    broad subject, Catholics and the Civil War. The national origins of the  people making up the Catholic population in the 
                        United States
                     had much to do with their attitude. The feelings of the Irish Catholics on Civil War
                    issues were undoubtedly influenced by their hatred of 
                        England
                    , and the author rightly includes a chapter on the Fenian Brotherhood, though it is not
                    well integrated with the rest of the book. Much more could be written on this subject, and on the
                    importance of free land to the immigrant, so many of whom were Catholics. How important was the
                    Catholic immigrants’ fear of slave labor competition, and how did they react to the,
                    Northern draft law? Catholics fighting for the North must have been aware that there was
                    more anti-Catholic sentiment among Northerners than among the people of the South. What, if any,
                    frontier influences were shaping Catholic thinking in the Civil War period? The chapter
                    on 
                        Wisconsin
                     Catholics made a good start on this. Many of these questions have been posed by the
                    author and some of them touched upon; they are all subjects which could with proFit be further
                    pursued by one who would write the history of the Catholics and the Civil War.

               Names on the Land. By George R. Stewart. (Randorn House, 
                        New York
                    , 1945, pp. ix, 418. Index, Maps, and Author's postscript. $300.)
            The author of Storm, George R. Stewart, has again written an original and
                    informative narrative in Names on the Land Subtitled A Historical
                        Account of Place Naming in, the 
                            United States
                        
               , Stewart's latest work is nevertheless an exciting narretive of the
                    romance, tragedy, idealism and humor that characterized the namings in American history. Stewart
                    describes the four centuries of place naming from the days of Ponee de Leon to the activities of the
                    Post Office Department and the Beard on Geographic Names created by President Harrison in 1290.
            First were the Indians and Spaniards, whose namings were often lost, igncred, or vulgarized by the
                    English who followed. The first English namers, Captain John Smith and Gabrlel Archer, represented
                    the extremes of practicality and high-flown fancy. They named for the royal family, for their fellow
                    explorers and for their patrons, thus Cape Henry, 
                    Archer's Hope, Jarnestown, Cape Charles, Keale's Hill and most important, 
                        Virginia
                    . Charles Stuart struck out the Indian names on Captain Smith's map and gave
                    the Puritans a precedent for English names soon to spread over New 
                        England
                     under the authority of the 
                        Massachusetts
                     General Court. In 
                        Virginia
                     fanciful Elizabethan names were given the plantations and royalist sentiment
                    commemorated the rulers, but the common people named the features of the land—rivers,
                    creeks, and mountains—giving names often unknown in 
                        England
                     and truly American.
            The Dutch and Swedes and the minor nationalities of the Middle Colonies all contributed in naming, as
                    in blood and work, to create the new nation. The French on the frontier named the Great Lakes and
                    the important rivers and states of the Middle West. English-speaking settlers who followed respected
                    the French, but their rendition of French words was a dubious compliment. Lewis and Clark named no
                    state, but recorded Council Bluffs, Milk River and the names of 
                  Madison, Jefferson, Gallatin
               , and 
                        Knox
                    . The railroad builders like General Dodge of the Union Pacific and influential persons
                    like James M. Ashley of the Committee on Territories named many states and towns of the new west.
                    When local pride and ingenuity collapsed, the Post Office clerks took over.
            Every aspect of American life contributed names on the land. The wars left their quota of names of
                    generals and battles. 
                        Washington
                    's name was given to a state, 33 counties, 121 cities and towns, 257 townships,
                    10 lakes, 8 streams, 7 mountains, and about 1140 streets. The classical revival put names like 
                        Troy
                     (31 places), 
                  Seneca, Utica
               , and 
                        Athens
                     on the map. They became a part of American life, as did the Biblical names—
                        Goshen
                    , Canaan, Sharon, and others. The wave of gentility that struck after the Civil War
                    eliminated Cow Neck and Rum Point and brought in the somewhat nauseating Bosky Dell and its
                    relations. Suffix trouble beset the namers, as it did President Harding, and provided many odd
                    combinations, for example Applebacksville.
            Stewart considers a major awkwardness the 
                        United States
                     of America, first used officially in the Declaration of Independence. It supplied no
                    name for the inhabitants, was unsuited to song or poem. The makeshift adoption of the national name
                    refused to give way to 
                        Columbia
                    , Fredonia,  Appalachia or Usonia among others, and
                    so we limp along.
            Some names were jokes, some were mistakes in spelling. There were scandals, too, in the names, and
                    vociferous debate that shook the country, before 
                        Arkansas
                     gained recognition of its nonalignment of spelling and pronunciation and Tacoma settled
                    down to accepting Mt. Rainier.
            Stewart disavows encyclopedic purpose for Names on the Land, but by process of
                    selection he succeeds in suggesting the wide scope and diversity of geographical naming throughout
                    American history. He gives attention not only to the great names but to the little homely names on
                    the land of rivers, creeks., mines, and streets that make up the American concept of home. He writes
                    with subtle humor and an easy style that more scholarly writers in American history might well
                    attend.

               The Free Produce Movement, A 
                            Quaker
                         Protest Against Slavery. By Ruth Ketring Nuermberger, in Trinity College
                    Historical Society, Historical Papers, XV. (Duke University Press, Durham, 
                        North Carolina
                    , 1942, pp. ix, 147. $1.00.)
            While engaged in the research from which came her biography of Charles Osborn, the author learned
                    about the free produce movement. After much additional investigation she was able to produce this
                    second small volume, which traces this phase of 
                        Quaker
                     activity as far as available sources permit. It is an account of the effort, largely by
                    Friends, to secure goods not made by slave labor and to boycott the productions of the slave system.
            To the uninitiated, the most interesting point which the study illustrates is the sharp division
                    among the Quakers in regard to the agitation against slavery. Although hostile to the institution,
                    the conservative majority of the Friends were opposed to co-operation with others and to the
                    "excitements" involved in the controversy. The free produce movement offered to
                    some of the Friends an opportunity to work against slavery without engaging in the more extreme
                    forms of the antislavery agitation. It was not supported by the conservative majority nor by the
                    more extreme antislavery Quakers, the latter regarding it as too mild and ineffective.
            
            Its failure was due primarily to this lack of support, although there were other contributing factors
                    of importance. It was very difficult to secure supplies of cotton, sugar, and rice which had not
                    been produced by the labor of slaves and such supplies as were obtained generally cost more than the
                    market price. Because of the nature of the business, it was necessary to conduct it on a cash basis
                    and the men engaged in it lacked the resources to buy on a large enough scale to compete with
                    regular agencies.
            The author has related the story in a scholarly and interesting manner, without exaggerating the
                    importance of her subject. The final chapter includes a brief account of the anti-slavery press of
                    the Friends. The volume will be of interest to persons in Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                    , because Quakers of those states took some part in the movement. Particularly involved
                    were Benjamin Lundy, Charles Osburn, and Levi Coffin. The main center of the movement, however, was 
                        Philadelphia
                    , where George W. Taylor was active.

            The author attempts to write a history of 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, which during the nineteenth century was the scene of two
                    utopias—Johann Georg Rapp's Harmonie which was negative and dictatorial, and
                    Robert Owen's 
                        New Harmony
                     which was positive and democratic.
            This book does not represent a true picture of 
                        New Harmony
                     today. Errors lume up repeatedly and lead one to doubt the use of documents and other

                     was about thirty miles from Harmonie, as the latter was known during the days of Rapp,
                    and was not on the 
                        Wabash
                    , but the author stated it was "twenty miles up the

                    little thought to the actual facts.

            We welcome, as one of the signs that peace is gradually returning to the lives of British scholars,
                    the reappearance of the Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research (

                    Summer of 1945. It contains among other valuable materials, a report on the destruction of French
                    archival materials during the war and a list of French historical writings for the same period. It
                    also has a most informative article on the House of Lords in the Parliament of 1680. It continues
                    its regular reports on the migration of Historical Manuscripts, and its corrections of the Dictionary of National Biography. It will be interesting to know how many American
                    libraries make use of its data to keep their sets of the Dictionary of National

            In the middle of the seventeenth century many Quakers were drawn to America by the hope of religious
                    tolerance. Among the occasional clusters of 
                        Quaker
                     homes at favorable sites along the Atlantic cons! was a nucleus on the lowlands
                    bordering Albemarle Sound in what was incorporated as Albemarle County in Carolina about 1666. These
                    permanent settlers pushed the frontiers of the 
                        Virginia
                     colony to the south after the good land had become scarce, drifting individually, or by
                    families Into the fertile spots bordering the rivers, evidently in the latter part of the
                        1650's.1
            
            Geographical factors largely determined the direction of this small migration. Many of the streams of
                    southeastern 
                        Virginia
                     find their way to the Albemarle Sound. These water courses offered a route to fertile
                    unsettled lands with less danger and greater ease. Their chances of escape were better if attacked
                    by tribes of Indians or wild beasts from the impenetrable Dismal Swamp, or the dense forests and
                    thick undergrowth of the interior. An abundance of fish in the streams was a partial guarantee of a
                    food supply, and purer water could be obtained along the streams, then too, the rich bottom lands
                    were more easily cleared, and the higher lands were more desirable site.; for building homes.
                    Furthermore, the soil, climate, flora, and fauna were similar to that of the southern part of the 
                        Virginia
                     colony. It is quite possible that the revision of the colonial laws of the colony of 
                        Virginia
                     stimulated a portion of them to seek homes in the unsettled lands to the southeast, for
                    in 1662 the Church of 
                        England
                     was re-established and severe laws were passed against the Quakers and other
                    separatists. It seems, however, that there was only a small percentage of Quakers among the earliest
                    settlers. George Fox, the founder of the 
                        Quaker
                     faith, visited the settlement in 1672 and organized

            They bought their land of the Indians, and when Charles II, 1663, included the Albemarle region in
                    the grant of the Lords Proprietors, they took out patents for their newlysettled plantations in a
                    land infested with malaria and remote from any colonial settlement. When William Edmundson, an early
                    follower of George Fox, traveled from 
                        Virginia
                     to Albemarle in 1671, he found his way through "all wilderness with no English
                    inhabitants or pathways, but some marked trees" to guide the traveler.3
            
            It is evident that among these adventurous colonists were some members of the Bulidy family, a family
                    of French descent that originally spelled their name Bundeie. According to the family tradition
                    their ancestors were among the French Huguenots driven out of 
                        France
                     by the Catholic persecutions, who settled in 
                        Wales
                    , and about the middle of the seventeenth century some of the more venturesome sailed
                    from Pembroke, 
                        Wales
                    , for America. Members of the family residing in Worcestershire in southwest 
                        England
                     adopted as the family crest, a hand, holding an eagle's leg and had as their
                    motto, Certum Pete finem." (Aim at a sure end.)4
            
            The Bundys settled on plantations reaching out from both banks of Little River, that forms a. natural
                    boundary between 
                        Pasquotank County
                     and 
                        Perquimans County
                     where some of their descendants were living two hundred years later. Caleb and Jean
                    (Jane), his wife, sold a plantation on 
                        Perquimans

                    Caleb, 175 acres, and Samuel, 110 acres. Samuel received a grant of 351 acres on Little River in
                    1716. A grant was made in 1714 to Caleb "which lapsed in John Fundy's
                    name" in 1727. Samuel received a grant of 588 acres in 1739 and William a grant of 483
                        acres.5
            
            The Bundys seem to have been active members of the 
                        Quaker
                     church and to have participated in the civic and political life of the colony. William
                    Bundy was a member of the first 
                        Quaker
                     organization in 
                        Perquimans
                     Precinct which met at the home of the members. William's wife, Elizabeth, whom
                    he probably married before coming to Carolina, died March 4, 1676. Seven years later at a quarterly
                    meeting held at the home of Christopher Nicholson, William Bundy and Mary Pearre, widow of John
                    Pearre and daughter of Joseph Scott, published their intention of marriage. They were married at her
                    home "December 15, 1683." William Bundy is recorded as being a witness at several
                    weddings in 1680. His signature appeared on a remonstrance dated September 25, 1679, which was
                    addressed to the Duke of Albemarle by the Quakers, most of whom had been inhabitants of Carolina
                    since 1663. The court records show that he assigned to Mary Scott all his interests to an Indian
                    named Sanders, April 6, 1680. He served as one of the justices at a court held for the Precinct of 
                        Perquimans
                     at the home of Mary Scott, the first Monday in January, 1690–1. In every
                    precinct the court consisted of a judge and four justices. To be an eligible candidate for justice,
                    a man must have been an inhabitant of the precinct and own 300 acres of land. At that time there
                    were four precincts in Albemarle County —
                  Perquimans, Pasquotank
               ,
                    Curritack, and Chowan. Albemarle County was abolished in 1729 when each of the precincts became a
                    county. He is listed among the Quakers who were sentenced and imprisoned for refusing to bear arms,
                    serving a six months’ term in 1680.6

            Caleb Bundy married Jane (Jean) Maners at "ye quarterly meeting," July, 1690. At a
                    meeting of the Quakers, March 1, 1703, their home was selected as the place for holding their
                    monthly meetings. At their regular monthly meeting May 4, 1706, this organized group of Quakers
                    decided to build a church between the home of Caleb Bundy and William Brother's Creek, and
                    "unanimously agreed that it should be left to the Discression of the afsd Caleb Bundy
                    Stephen Scott & Henry Keton to choose a proper place and also to go through with the
                    Building of the said Meeting House." The committee chose a site on the banks of
                    Symon's Creek, an arm of Little River, the oldest 
                        Quaker
                     meetinghouse in the State of 
                        North Carolina
                     of which there is a record. It has not been possible to fix accurately the location of
                    the early 
                        Quaker
                     churches in 
                        Pasquotank County
                    . It seems to be the consensus of opinion that the site of this church was one mile from
                    Symon's Creek on the road from Nixonton to Weeksville. Samuel and Caleb Bundy are listed as
                        members.7

                describes an old cemetery where the Bundys who settled on Little River were
                    probably buried.
            
                    Little River Meeting House is just beyond the village of Woodville, and it is spoken of as being
                        "at the head of Little River" where today a 
                            Quaker
                         burying ground can be seen on a small eminence on the right side of the road going
                        toward the Weeks home across Little River, on the 
                            Pasquotank
                         side. A large sycamore tree marks the location and many small grave stones lift
                        their mute testimony for all to see. Here in tranquil peace lie numbers of old residents of 
                            Quaker

            Caleb Bundy served as a member of the House of Burgesses, the lower house of the legislative body,
                    for several terms. An address from the House of Burgesses to the governor and council, bearing no
                    date but evidently about 1703, bore the signature of Caleb Bundy and others. When Queen Anne came to
                    the throne of 
                        England
                     in 1704, Parliament passed a law requiring all public officials to take an oath

                     days of the colony of Albemarle the Quakers were more numerous
                    than any other religious group, they were exempted from taking the oath to hold public office,
                    cleaving religiously by the teachings of the New Testament, "Swear not at all" and
                    were given the privilege of taking its equivalency, an affirmation. The deputy-governor, a staunch
                    member of the Church of 
                        England
                    , was anxious to establish the Church of 
                        England
                     in Carolina by law, but as long as the Quakers had a potent influence in the
                    legislative body and higher offices, the law could not be passed. For that reason Robert, Daniels,
                    the deputy-governor, demanded that all persons holding public office should take the oath of
                    allegiance which resulted in driving the Quakers from the Assembly.9 Meanwhile,
                    the following proclamation was issued giving the reason for ordering another election:
                    "Whereas Caleb Bundy Jeremiah Symonds Augustine Scarborough & John Hawkins Chosen
                    Burgesses for this present Assembly … have refused to take the Oaths appointed by
                        Law."10 The date of the proclamation was 1709 or 1710, as Caleb
                    Bundy was a member of the House of Burgesses, October 11, 1709.
            Caleb mentions a brother Samuel in his will. Mary Bundy married Nicholis Simons, June, 1602. The same
                    year Hannah Bundy married John Larance, son of William Larance. Very likely Mary and Hannah were
                    sisters of thc three brothers, William, Caleh, and Samuel, sons of William Bundy. It seems that
                    William Bundy, a cordwainer, settled in 
                        Perquimans
                     Precinct where he died, March 27, 1692. William, his son, a planter, died in 
                        Pasquotank
                     Precinct, July 28, 1700. There is a record of the birth of Samuel, February 4, 1676, to
                    William and Elizabeth. One daughter, Mary, is mentioned. William and Mary had one daughter, Sarah.
                    Samuel married Tamer Symons in 1696 at the home of Henry White in 
                        Perquimans
                     Precinct. Two of his children were Jeremiah and Samuel. Caleb died, March 4, 1721. His
                    will was probated in 
                        Pasquotank
                     Precinct Court, April 27, 1721, in which he bequeathed to each of his heirs a tract of
                    land. John was given the land he had purchased of Thomas Stanton,

                     Benjamin received the farm where his father lived, Samuel was
                    willed the land "lying up Little River," and Mary, the daughter, received a tract
                    of land that he had bought from his brother Samuel. In the will he mentioned a granddaughter Liday,
                    daughter of his son William. He named as his executors his sons, John and Benjamin. His son Caleb
                    died in January, 1721, leaving a will in which he named his brothers, William and John, as his
                    beneficiaries. His wife, Jane, died in 1719. His son, William, who married Ann Keaton, died in
                    February preceding Caleb's death, and Mary passed on a few days after the death of her
                        father."11
            
            The spirit of freedom overflowing with energy and self-reliance of the sons of William Bundy seems to
                    have been handed down to the next two or three generations. At the close of the eighteenth century
                    and the early part of the nineteenth century a number of their descendants joined the heavy
                    migration from the Tidewater section of the Carolinas to the "uplands" or Piedmont
                    region, and many of them were traveling by packhorse over nature's thorough-fares, crossing
                    the Appalachian Highlands and following the streams that directed them into the fertile lands to the
                    west. William Bundy and relatives crossing the Appalachian Highlands, where the barriers had been
                    carved by the interlocking of the eastward moving rivers and westward flowing streams, found their
                    way to middle 
                        Tennessee
                     and settled near the present site of 
                        Nashville
                     in 1792. This was two years after Congress had passed an act providing for the
                    government of the western land ceded by 
                        North Carolina
                     to the federal government, which was known as the Southwest Territory. In a few years
                    one of his brothers, accompanied by two cousins emigrated from the Southwest Territory to Walnut
                            
                  Prairie, Illinois
               . S. H. Bundy of middle 
                        Tennessee
                     moved to Williamson County, 
                        Illinois
                    , in 1852. Several Bundy families were among the pioneers that found their way to the
                    border of Indiana and followed the course of the Whitewater River into the east central part of the
                    state. Christopher Bundy, the great-grandfather of the late Major General Omar Bundy, who was born
                    in

                    , joined the tide of emigrants

                     County, Indiana. Later, he entered land in 
                        Henry County

                        Carolina

                        Carthage
                     in 1832. Ely Bundy followed his relatives to 
                        Henry County
                    , Indiana, in 1824. William Bundy and family transferred their membership to the

                        Perquimans County
                     settled in 
                        Washington County
                     in 1816. The same year John Bundy joined the pioneers in 
                        Washington County
                    , Indiana, and moved the church membership of his family to the Blue
                    River Monthly Meeting. Another pioneer that came to 
                        Washington County
                     was William, son of Moses and Elizabeth Bundy. In 1813 Gideon Bundy moved from

                     head of a Bundy family for some good turn the white friend had
                    given them in 1815 and kept the other half for their own use. This stone, used for the bites of
                    snakes, dogs, and wolves, was brought by a pioneer BuMy family to Indiana and is said to be kept in

            Caleb, whom records indicate was the third son of John and Elizabeth Keaton Bundy, owned and operated
                    a farm near Little River Bridge, 
                        Pasquotank County
                    , 
                        North Carolina
                    . He married Elizabeth Henby in 1745. Their children were Dempsey, John, Miriam, Samuel,
                    and Sarah. Elizabeth died November 5, 1762. Caleb's second wife was Miriam Morgan, one
                    authority states that her maiden name was Nicholson. The children of Caleb and Miriam were Benjamin,
                    Caleb, John, Jeremiah, James, Hannah, Moses, Samuel, and Christopher. In a sketch of the family the
                    following was read at the celebration of the golden wedding of John and Mary Moore Bundy at
                    Monrovia, Indiana, March 10, 1881: 
                        We are indebted to Joseph Bundy, son of Moses [one of the above-named brothers] for a
                            description of the old homestead. He is an old man now in his 84th year, living at High
                            Point, 
                                North Carolina
                            , and quietly waiting his summons to that Better World. He was a member of his
                            grandfather's family in his boyhood and seemed living over again his childish joys
                            whilst telling of the large old-fashioned house built upon a stone basement, which served as
                            a cellar in which was stored many barrels of wine and cider and great heaps of apples. And
                            very often some of his large family of boys would serve as cooks whilst the rest were in
                            attendance at meeting arid quite often expecting some traveling Friends BS guests as they
                            lived near the meeting house.
                    
            
            Many of the descendants of the fourteen children, three daughters and eleven sons, of Caleb Bundy
                    were part of the stream of emigrants that left the Tidewater region and sought homes in the more
                    favorable uplands of 
                        North Carolina
                     in 
                  Guilford County, Randolph County
               , and surrounding section, from whence they followed
                    along the streams of 
                        North Carolina
                     to their sources and crossed over to the trails following rivers and buffalo trails
                    leading westward. Among these were the descendants of Jeremiah Bundy.
            Jeremiah, fourth son of Caleb and Miriam Bundy, married Betsey (Elizabeth) Low, daughter of one of
                    Caleb Bundy's neighbors, and member of a pioneer family in Albemarle

                     County in 1797. He settled in the lowland along Albemarle
                    Sound. In late 1806 or early 1807 he died, leaving the widow and eight children, four boys and four
                    girls. In the December term of court, 1807, the dower of the widow was laid off. John Bundy served
                    as administrator with Benjamin as security. The administrator made his final statement in 1809.
                    Leaving the eldest daughter, Milliscent, with her grandmother Bundy, the widow with seven children
                    joined some neighbors that were emigrating to the uplands of 
                        North Carolina
                    . She was not financially able to support the children. For that reason she
                    "bound out" five of them. She married Joseph Stafford on May 11, 1812.14
            
            After the death of her second husband, she again became a part of the westward movement. She and
                    Fielden and Martha Bundy 
                        Brown
                    , her daughter, were on the frontier in 
                        Hamilton County
                    , Indiana, in 1851. As they crossed southern Indiana they visited her sons east of
                    Vernon. Her two sons, Phineas and Ephriam, and their families joined them on the edge of the
                    frontier in 
                        Hamilton County
                    . The spirit of pioneering urged them until the three families had reached Sauk County, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , in 1855. The mother passed on in 1858. Her funeral was held in Ephriam
                    Bundy's hewed log house, and she was buried at the edge of a forest in a pioneer graveyard
                    which is now abandoned.15
            
            Phineas, the second son, married Nancy Reynolds in 
                        North Carolina
                    , and joined his brother, Miles, in one of the early settlements in 
                        Jennings County
                    , Indiana. His wife died in 1825 at the birth of their only child, William. When William
                    was three months old, his father carried him on horseback from Vernon, Indiana, to his former home
                    in 
                        North Carolina
                    . A year later he married Nancy Turner and returned to Vernon, Indiana. He entered the
                    marriage contract five times. All of his living sons served in the Civil War. John, Phineas, and
                    James served in the infantry and Dr. Miles

            Ephriam Bundy died June 12, 1888, and was buried in a new cemetery about a mile from where his mother
                    was buried. He had a large family. The eight children were Christopher, Pheriba, Martha, Jabez,
                    Mary, Eva, Miriam, and William. The latter served in the Civil War, was graduated from Ripon
                    College, and was employed as a teacher in the 
                        Wisconsin
                     public schools.17
            
            Martha 
                        Brown
                     had three children, Mary

                        Brown
                     Pickering, and Jabez. A daughter and two sons of Jabez 
                        Brown
                     founded Browns’ Preparatory School in 
                  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
               , which has served that section for more than fifty years. Later,
                    on the 
                        Wisconsin
                     frontier these descendants of Jeremiah Bundy endured the usual hardships of pioneer
                    life. One winter when the settlers "rail short of flour, Phineas Bundy and a neighbor drove
                    sixty miles through a deep snow to Portage to get a supply."18
            
            John Bundy, another son of Jeremiah and Betsey, was "bound out" to John Hodges who
                    died when he was about eleven years old. Then he was "bound out" to Joseph Newby
                    with whom he lived until his marriage in his twenty-fifth year to Mary Moore. Their children were
                    William P., Samuel C., Jesse M., Daniel W., Martha, Elizabeth, Sarah Jane, Semira, Mary, and John
                    Elwood. The children were all born in 
                        North Carolina
                    . Some of them attended Guilford College, and later most of them came to Indiana. John
                    Elwood taught in Earlham College and was dean of the 
                        Richmond
                     group of painters. John and Mary Moore Bundy sold their possessions in 
                        North Carolina
                     in 1866 and came to Monrovia, Indiana, to make their future home, stopping on their way
                    for a visit with Miles Bundy.19

                        United States
                     Census for 1820, they were living east of Vernon, Indiana. They must have joined those
                    who were pushing the frontier northward for according to the Census of the 
                        United States
                     for 1830, an Ephriam Pool was living in 
                        Wayne
                     County, Indiana. The eidest daughter whose name was very likely Miriam, not Milliscent,
                    married John Nixon, April 19, 1816, in 
                        Wayne
                     County, Indiana. Hannah married Andrew Whisenhunt in September, 1819, in 
                        North Carolina
                     where they continued to reside. According to the family history, handed down, their
                    sons served in the Confederate Army.20
            
            Miles, the eldest child of Jeremiah and Betsey, was "bound out" at the age of
                    eleven. In the spring of 1816, he ran away and joined some neighbors who journeyed westward,
                    following the Wilderness Road to its terminal, 
                        Louisville
                    . Here they crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     River on a ferry and found their way to a settlement near 
                  Charlestown, Clark
                    County
               , where they stopped at the homes of the Pools, Benjamin and Thomas. He
                    joined Joseph Pool whose family followed the trail on packhorses to Vernon which had been platted
                    the previous year, 1815. The town consisted of three cabins, surrounded by a clearing here and there
                    with a cabin in the center. Joseph Pool chose a site for his round log cabin near a spring on the
                    south side of the South Fork of the Muscatatuck in the forest three miles east of Vernon in which
                    they lived until 1824 when he erected a large two-story house from brick he burned on the site. Just
                    across the creek from the Pool cabin was a camp of some of the 
                        Delaware
                     whose camps extended for several miles along the stream. They were under the control of
                    White Eyes and Big John. In the spring of 1817, they abandoned their camps and set out for the West.
                    Just before leaving some of the tribe came to the Pools and demanded meal.
            Their first year was full of hardships and privations. In the fall of 1816. their horses got loose
                    and the last of their corn meal had been made into corn pone. Joseph Pool and his thirteen year old
                    daughter, Emilia, walked and carried the packsaddles forty miles to the settlement in 
                        Clark County

                     where they found the horses and obtained meal. Jemima, the
                    second child, said when reminiscing in her advanced age that "it was awful" while
                    they were gone, for the mother and the children lived on frost-bitten pumpkins, the children cried
                    and the wolves howled around the cabin. The summer was cool, frost came early and the winter of
                    1816–1817 was severe. One week in January the ice froze eighteen inches thick on the
                    Muscatatuck Creek. Then a thaw came and the creek was almost clear of ice and again it was frozen
                    sixteen inches or more thick. Scars that were made on the trees by the floating ice could be seen
                    for many years.
            Miles Bundy married Emilia (Milly) Pool, the eldest child of Joseph and Hannah Hooker Pool in 1819
                    and lived in a cabin across the Muscatatuck from the Pools for thirteen years. They obtained a
                    living by tilling the "clearing" and killing wild game. There were plenty of deer,
                    and turkeys were easily caught in rail pens. In the fall when the beechnuts were ripe, the passcnger
                    pigeons came in such large flocks that they darkened the air and at night they would roost in the
                    trees at their regular roosting places in such numbers that the limbs of the trees were often
                    broken. They obtained many of them for food with clubs at night. Every spring they made maple sugar.
                    One spring the young wife cared for two children and made two hundred pounds of sugar. She placed
                    the baby, Elizabeth Bundy (Patrick) in a sugar trough and carried Jeremiah so far from the boiling
                    sugar water that he could not reach the fire under the sap before she returned from gathering sap.
                    Hogs were fattened on the bountiful mast and part of the drove was driven to market at 
                        Madison
                    . In a few years, the Vawter slaughter house was built in Vernon from which salt pork
                    was shipped by rail to 
                        Madison
                     and from that place by flatboat to 
                        New Orleans
                    .
            The father cut millstones and in this way was able to accumulate a small capital. He formed a
                    partnership with "Jim" Spaulding and erected a gristmill run by water power two
                    miles farther up the creek which was later known as the Wilson Mill. Then the family moved to the
                    site of the new mill, Their savings increased and in 1839 they purchased two hundred or more acres
                    of timberland on Crooked Creek, paying $1.25 an acre for government land. A cabin was
                    built which burned to the ground in 1840. That year with the 
                    help of his seven sons, he built one of the largest sawmills in the county. The dam was made of
                    limestone rocks and timber, the huge frame of hewed timber. During the spring months, the mill was
                    run night and day while the stream was being fed by rains and the melting snow. During the summer
                    months, his sons, John and Miles, hauled thousands of feet of poplar, walnut, and ash lumber with ox
                    teams over the dirt road to Vernon from which point it was shipped by rail to 
                        Madison
                     to be loaded on boats for the market at 
                        New Orleans
                    . When the little Crooked Creek was out of its banks in 1876, tha dam broke and was
                    never rebuilt for the supply of timber was exhausted, steam-driven mills were taking the place of
                    the older water-power mills.
            Another hard year was 1833 when a killing frost came the night of June 15. The tender new twigs on
                    the beech trees were about a foot in length and an abundant crop of green peaches about the size of
                    a quail's egg hung on the trees. The leaves, twigs, and fruit fell, and
                    many of the trees and shrubs were killed. On large areas in the flats or level swamplike land the
                    timber was killed which was afterward known as the "frost deaden."
            They were among the first members of the Baptist church which was organized at Vernon in 1817. On
                    horseback the father and mother each carried two children along the unimproved dirt road roughly
                    paralleling the North Fork of the Muscatatuck to Vernon to listen to the sermon of John Vawter, or
                    of Reverend Jesse Vawter. They were among the organizers of the Ebenezer Church, a Methodist church
                    erected on a plot of land adjoining their farm. Their large family of young people made the home a
                    place for social gatherings such as quiltings, dances, stirring off sugar, etc., which were attended
                    by the Moncriefs, Hiltons, Royles, Patricks, and Hinchmans. In cases of illness, Dr. Pabody, the
                    first physician to join the settlement at Vernon, was called. Dr. Gunn's book was often
                    consulted and a generous supply of "Smith's Ager Tonic" was kept on hand.
            The parents could write a legible hand, in fact, both of them had had instructions in the three
                    R's. The father helped "to raise" the first log schoolhouse on Crooked
                    Creek, which was equipped with puncheon floor, long benches, and a fireplace. He was appointed in
                    1841 as one of the three school commissioners. In this position he served for a number of years.
                    Many evenings all the thirteen children would gather  around the
                    fireplace and by a flickering yellow poplar torch drill for the neighborhood spelling school. Around
                    this fire was kindled the desire for learning that enabled one son to become judge of the circuit
                    court for a number of years, another enter the ministry, and several to serve the community as
                    teachers. Most of the grandchildren and many of the great-grandchildren entered the professions.
            The news came in 1863 that Morgan and his men were coming, and that, no doubt, there would be an
                    attack on Veron. The father hid the horses in a deep hollow, commonly known as a sinkhole. The small
                    amount of "shin-plasters" and bills were placed in a box and secreted in a
                    knothole in an apple tree. The two young sons, Miles and 
                        Clay
                    , joined the handful of old men and boys that had assembled to protect Vernon. Various
                    verbal reports reached the home as to the number killed in a battle. Later, an authentic report came
                    that the inhabitants of Vernon with some of their treasures sought safety outside of the town, and a
                    few volunteers were formed in line of battle south of town. They refused to surrender to Morgan who
                    moved his forces south through the county towards Dupont.
            Miles not only endured the hardships that fell to the farmer-lumbermen and other citizens during the
                    Civil War, but death claimed his wife and daughter, Mary Ann. His youngest son Frank, accidently
                    shot himself. Shortly after the war closed, 
                        Clay
                     passed on. His children were Jeremiah, Nancy, Joseph Pool, Elizabeth (Betsy), George,
                    Hannah, Mary Ann, Emilia, John, Jane, Niles, Henry Clay, Benjamin Franklin. Jason, the eldest, died
                    at the age of a few months and was buried in the Baldwin Cemetery, one of the oldest in the
                        county.21
            
            The family of Jeremiah Bundy endured the hardships and privations that were experienced by all the
                    members of the small groups who pushed the frontier northward across the Northwest Territory and
                    helped to block out the territory for settlement. Yet theirs is a record of longevity. The mother
                    reached the eighties, and Martha died at the age of ninety-one. Miles, Phineas, and Ephriam passed
                    on in the eighties. Records indicate that John and Hannah also enjoyed long lives. The family was a
                    part of the migration from 
                        North Carolina
                     to the Old Northwest, particularly to Indiana.

            Query 129
            Cornelius Merry, who was born 1763, in Litchfield, 
                        Connecticut
                    , fought with 
                        Connecticut
                     Troops during the revolutionary war. He died and was buried in 
                        Knox
                     County, Indiana, 1842. Who were his children’? Calvin Merry
                    married Isabel Hanks in 
                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana, in 1812. What were the names of their children? I cannot find
                    anything about Isabel Hanks or Calvin Merry. Would there be an old newspaper file somewhere that
                    might give the death of Cornelius Merry in 1842? This might give the names of children.
