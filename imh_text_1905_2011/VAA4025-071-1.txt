            Controversies over banking provided much of the fuel for the political fires that raged during the
                    Age of Jackson. Bank wars occurred on national, state, and local levels throughout the era. These
                    struggles often reached heroic proportions, especially in the West after the Panic of 1837 when hard
                    money Democrats mounted strong, steady, and often successful attacks against existing banking
                    institutions and practices.1
            
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana was not immune to the successive waves of
                    antibank activity. At first glance the local bank war in 
                        Indianapolis
                     shows a familiar Whig-Democrat struggle, with Democrats linking their opponents to an
                    aristocracy of merchants, bankers, and politicians, all deriving wealth and power from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Branch Bank. Although Democratic criticisms of the Branch Bank were heavily infused
                    with the inflated rhetoric common to antebellum America, Jacksonian attacks on the institution and
                    on the political and business aristocracy associated with it did contain elements of truth. Unlike
                    many similar struggles, however, the

                     war ended not with the destruction of the Branch Bank by
                    political opponents nor even with substantial modifications in the charter or the regulations
                    affecting banking practices. The result was instead a private, nonpolitical solution, formulated and
                    implemented by leading—and mainly Whig—members of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     business community. These businessmen succeeded in stealing much of the thunder of
                    local Jacksonian politicians as they substantially curtailed criticisms directed against the Branch
                    Bank and the business community.
            There were no banks in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and few in Indiana prior to 1834. The Indiana legislature had established a state bank
                    with branches in 1817, but the institution had died an infamous death in the early 1820s.2 Most of the banking services available to 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents in the 1820s and early 1830s came from the Second Bank of the 
                        United States
                    . No branches of this federal institution existed in Indiana, but branches outside the
                    state, especially those in 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        Louisville
                    , provided banking services for 
                        Indianapolis
                    . These services included supplying most of the paper currency circulating in the
                    Hoosier capital during the 1820s and early 1830s.3 Largely because of the
                    absence of alternative banking facilities, 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents showed strong support for the Second Bank of the 
                        United States
                    , especially when President Andrew Jackson and his political followers began their
                    sustained war on the institution in early 1832. But Jackson's veto of the bank bill that
                    summer and his victory in the fall election seemed to spell doom for the national bank and
                    threatened to leave 
                        Indianapolis
                     and most of Indiana with little or no access to banking services.4
            
            Although there had been some agitation for a new state bank during the late 1820s, Jackson's

                     the 
                        United States
                     prompted the Indiana legislature in its session of 1832–1833 to begin
                    serious consideration of a state banking system. The lawmakers adjourned without agreeing on a bank
                    bill but in the next session again took up the issue. In January, 1834, the legislature passed and
                    the governor signed an act establishing the Second State Bank of Indiana.5 The
                    charter gave exclusive banking privileges to the new State Bank and, to add to the
                    institution's public character, stipulated that the state was to own one half the
                    bank's capital stock. The new institution, as it was organized, consisted of ten branch
                    banks, each with separate officers and directors, and a central State Bank Board. The State Bank
                    Board was composed of the president of the State Bank, four persons appointed by the legislature,
                    and one delegate from each of the ten branches. The board's primary responsibility was to
                    conduct periodic examinations of the branches to insure compliance with charter provisions. The
                    officers of the State Bank, who carried out most of the board's responsibilities, were the
                    president, Samuel Merrill, and the cashier, James M. Ray. Both were prominent 
                        Indianapolis
                     businessmen. In addition to the control exercised by the State Bank Board and officers,
                    the branch banks were also bound together by provisions for mutual liability whereby all were liable
                    for the debts of any branch that failed. In actual operation the ten branch banks enjoyed a large
                    degree of independence. Each branch retained its profits and had its own stockholders who elected
                    the majority of the branch directors. (The State Bank Board elected three of a total of between ten
                    and thirteen branch directors.) The directors chose the branch's officers and were
                    responsible for managing the branch. Branch directors or officers decided, for example, who would
                    receive loans and the kind and amount of security to require.6

            The State Bank Board chose 
                        Indianapolis
                     as the location of one of the ten branches established in 1834. 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents—Democrats as well as Whigs—were enthusiastic over the
                    prospect of a bank in their town. Even before the branch was in operation, several enterprising
                    persons foresaw the possibilities of using to advantage its credit and exchange facilities and
                    decided to enter merchandising. Others planned land investments with expectations of receiving
                    Branch Bank credit.7 The subscription books for stock in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch were opened in early April, 1834. By early May investors had subscribed for all
                    the stock and soon were able, if they wished, to sell it at a premium.8 The
                    institution was off to an excellent start.
            The first duty of new stockholders in the Branch Bank was to elect directors.9 An
                    examination of the eight men they chose provides valuable insights into the nature of the
                    institution. The eight directors were Hervey Bates, James Blake, Benjamin I. Blythe, Homer Brooks,
                    Samuel Henderson, Alexander Russell, John Wilkins, and David Williams. All had signed a memorial in
                    early 1832 urging the rechartering of the Bank of the 
                        United States
                    .10 They were undoubtedly convinced of the value of banks and, after
                    realizing the impossibility of retaining a national bank, shifted their interests to a state bank.
                    Four directors (Bates, Blake, Henderson, and Russell) owned property assessed at $5,000
                    and above in 1835, which placed them among the wealthiest three per cent of the citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .11 Of the six directors

                            discussion that follows is concerned primarily with the 
                                Indianapolis
                             Branch Bank and the term Branch Bank applies only to the

                             branch. The term State Bank is used for the entire banking system and

                     whose party identification in the mid-1830s can be ascertained,
                    five (Bates, Blythe, Henderson, Russell, and Williams) were Whigs and one (Blake) a Democrat. At
                    least four directors (Bates, Blake, Russell, and Williams) were engaged in mercantile businesses.12
            
            The large proportion of directors who were also merchants indicates the close relationship between
                    mercantile and banking activities in antebellum 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The nature of this relationship is more clearly illustrated in the reactions to the
                    Panic of 1837. As early as January, 1837, various 
                        Indianapolis
                     businessmen were expecting "great pecuniary distress."13 But in the spring, as in preceding years, many of the town's merchants
                    traveled east to purchase goods with credit from the three year old 
                        Indianapolis
                     Branch Bank.14
            
            During the prosperous years of the mid-1830s 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants had extended large credits to their customers and, in turn, had received
                    credit from eastern wholesalers or loans from the Branch Bank. Because of threatening financial
                    conditions in early 1837, however, seaboard wholesalers were less willing to grant new credit and
                    were presenting notes for payment as soon as they came due. Had 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants attempted to meet all the demands of their eastern creditors, they would have
                    been unable to pay the debts they owed the Branch Bank. By mid-May economic crisis seemed imminent.
                    Six of the town's leading merchants decided to meet and "consult as to the general
                    welfare of the mercantil [sic] interest" in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . They gathered on May 13 at Nicholas McCarty's countinghouse and agreed not to
                    discriminate against any single creditor, "but to pay them all an equal portion as it
                    becomes due & especially to pay the Bank here as fast as any other creditor."15 Two days later the merchants met again and renewed their pledge to treat
                    their creditors equally. Aware of "the present approaching crisis," they vowed
                    "to sustain the Bank in case of pressure. …"16

            News of the "pressure" expected by the merchants reached 
                        Indianapolis
                     on May 18; banks in the East had suspended specie payment. The State Bank Board
                    immediately advised the branches to stop payment of specie.17 The next day 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants met again, this time more formally. They elected officers and passed
                    resolutions expressing confidence in the State Bank and approving the decision to suspend specie
                    payment. They also resolved: "That we will continue to receive at par in payment of debts
                    due us and for merchandize at the usual prices, the paper of each of the Branches of the State Bank.
                    …" Forty-one 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants signed the proceedings in order to make public their support.18 Their newspaper advertisements soon repeated the message that they would accept State
                    Bank paper at par and, as one merchant noted, would sell "particularly low for silver or
                    Hoosier bills."19
            
            The desire of merchants not to slight the Branch Bank in payment of their debts and their attempt to
                    keep the currency circulating at par illustrate their dependence upon the bank. Without the
                    institution's credit facilities many merchants would have been driven out of business or at
                    least would have been required to reduce their scale of operations. With a currency that circulated
                    below par they would have been forced to pay close attention to changing discount rates and to risk
                    losing profits by accepting a note at more than its value or gain the ire of their customers by
                    demanding too high a discount. In their collective and public support of the Branch Bank during the
                    crisis of 1837 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants made clear that they believed their own self interest to be very much
                    entwined with that of the bank. The close relationship between merchants and bankers soon became an
                    important element in criticisms directed against the Branch Bank.
            The state banking system had been established during a period of intense partisan conflict over
                    national banking; yet, the Indiana banks had aroused no serious opposition during their first years
                    of operation. When the State Bank suspended specie payment in 1837, an

                     meeting fully approved and expressed its confidence in the
                    institution, as did both the town's Whig and Democratic newspapers.20
                    But the economic crisis continued during the summer and fall of 1837, and as eastern creditors
                    pressed for payment of claims, 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants and other residents became convinced that "hard times" had
                        arrived.21 In the midst of this economic difficulty the attack on the State
                    Bank of Indiana began.
            Criticism leveled against the State Bank in late 1837 and early 1838 was based in part on the
                    traditional hard money agrarianism that distrusted all banks, especially after the suspension of
                    specie payment.22 The most significant attacks, however, centered not on hard
                    money arguments but on issues of economic and political discrimination. The political charge was
                    straightforward; the State Bank and particularly the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch was a Whig institution. In 1837 eleven of the twelve officers and directors of
                    the branch were said to be Whigs.23 Because Democrats were understandably more
                    willing to find fault with an institution controlled by their political opponents, any charge made
                    against the bank was a potential issue for public debate. The charge of economic discrimination
                    centered on the issue of who received and who was denied Branch Bank credit. One Democratic editor
                    summarized the criticisms of both Whigs and Democrats when he asserted: "The heavy
                    merchant, land speculator and bank director are generally accommodated by the bank with as much as
                    they wish."24
            
            In December, 1837, and January, 1838, a committee of the Indiana House of Representatives conducted
                    an investigation of the State Bank. The committee learned that over one half the total money loaned
                    by the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch had been granted to branch directors and stockholders, indicating that the
                    branch gave these persons "an improper

                     advantage. …"25 When
                    questioned about the basis for deciding which notes and bills to discount, the cashier of the
                    branch, Bethuel F. Morris, refused to answer.26 The cashier of the State Bank
                    and friend of many branch directors, James M. Ray, privately dismissed these charges by the House
                    committee as part of "the effort to rebuild on the prejudices against Banks, and against
                    those whose industry & talent have been blessed with success in the world.
                        …"27
            
            The charges against the State Bank had little immediate effect. Public discontent with the
                    institution declined, and the legislature took no action on the House committee report of January,
                    1838, in part because of the return of apparent prosperity and the resumption of specie payment in
                    August, 1838.28 State Bank President Samuel Merrill noted in early 1839:
                    "Last year the very dogs seemed to bark at all concerned in the Bank but this year we are
                    almost too popular."29 Merrill's optimism proved to be short
                    lived. The attack on the State Bank during 1837 and 1838 was only a preparatory skirmish, and the
                    quiet period of late 1838 and early 1839 was but a lull prior to full scale conflict.
            The renewed and more vigorous attack on the State Bank grew out of political and economic events of
                    late 1839 and 1840. The election of 1839 produced a Democratic majority in the Indiana House,
                    thereby stimulating visions of greater state—and perhaps also
                    Democratic—control of the bank.30 Indiana Jacksonians were also
                    looking to the election of 1840 and welcomed any hint of bank corruption or mismanagement that they
                    could blame on Whig directors and officers. In addition to partisan politics the bank war was fought
                    against the background of severe economic depression,

                    from November, 1839, until June, 1842, an "explosion" of the state sponsored
                    internal improvements system, and a general curtailment of commerce and other economic activity.31 These political and economic forces nurtured a variety of attacks on
                    practices of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch, especially in regard to the extension of credit and the relationship between
                    bankers and merchants.
            The skirmishes of 1837 and 1838 had only hinted at the indebtedness of merchants to the Branch Bank.
                    In 1840, near the low point of the economic depression, critics pushed this issue into public view.
                    A committee appointed by the Democratically controlled House of Representatives investigated the
                    State Bank and reported in January, 1840, that in making loans, officers and directors of several
                    branches had shown "extreme partiality to merchants over farmers. …"32 Part of the evidence for the committee's conclusion came from
                    Morris, cashier of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch. On the evening of January 9, 1840, Morris appeared before the investigators to
                    respond to their "interrogatories." He informed the committee that loans due the
                    branch from individual debtors amounted to over $400,000 and that almost
                    $225,000 of this sum had been loaned to merchants. Large merchant debts indicated, Morris
                    admitted, that "but a small portion of the community are directly accommodated with loans,
                    yet," he added, "the indirect accommodations of the bank are
                    very generally distributed among the people. …" Referring to the credit extended
                    to customers by 
                        Indianapolis
                     businessmen, the cashier asserted that "an inquiry recently made"
                    showed that there was then "due to the merchants, mechanics and manufacturers of the town
                    of 
                        Indianapolis
                     from the citizens of the surrounding country above three hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars, and almost exclusively from the farmers." Without "bank
                    accommodations," he concluded, "the merchants and others in the town could not
                    permit [this credit] to remain in the hands of their customers. …"33 The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Indiana Journal, a Whig organ, agreed with Morris' defense of loans to
                    merchants

                     and on the basis of its own informal survey reported that 1,800
                    persons were indebted to one 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchant, 700 to another, and 600 to a third. And, the Journal added,
                    most of these debtors were farmers from 
                        Marion
                     and adjoining counties.34
            
            The investigating committee agreed that farmers received credit through merchants. Unlike Morris,
                    however, the committee did not approve of this arrangement but favored instead direct loans to
                    farmers to encourage agricultural production and to increase the shipment of surplus farm products.
                    Lending money to merchants instead of farmers, the committee argued, had enabled the businessmen to
                    purchase large quantities of goods, most of which were "articles of show and luxury, beyond
                    the wants and the ability of the community." The committee concluded that the result had
                    been "to stimulate a love of indulgence and display, and to increase the consumption of the
                    country beyond its production. The State therefore is impoverished, [and] the habits of the people
                    vitiated, by the policy of stimulating the import trade … by bank credit."35
            
            In addition to criticizing large loans to merchants the committee of 1840 also renewed earlier
                    charges of discrimination in favor of Branch Bank officers, directors, and stockholders.36 The Democratic Indiana State Sentinel repeated the
                    criticism and noted: "very few, if any of the common people, the farmers
                    and mechanics, can get a discount; yet it is well known that bankrupts … and particular
                    favorites, can get almost any amount called for. …"37 These
                    charges were soon given explicit documentation.
            Early in 1842 the legislature appointed Nathan B. Palmer to conduct an extensive examination of the
                    State Bank. Palmer was a Democrat, but his report contained little of the hard money, antibank
                    philosophy often associated with western Jacksonianism. His criticisms were instead directed to
                    specific instances of mismanagement, most importantly the practice of "granting large
                    accommodations to favorites and men of influence. …" Palmer especially

                     singled out the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch as having "greatly erred in the practice of favoritism, and exorbitant
                    loans and large debts." To substantiate this charge his report included a list of debtors
                    and the amount each owed.38
            
            The largest debtor to the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch as of April 15, 1842, was Nicholas McCarty, who owed $32,614.39 McCarty had borrowed most of the money during the 1830s when he was the
                    town's leading merchant, operating seven or eight branch stores in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and nearby communities.40 During the boom years of that decade he
                    had invested large sums in land speculation. He was also a stockholder and president of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Insurance Company and a stockholder, director, and president of the Washington Hall
                    Hotel Company, which built the hotel of that name by means of a $25,000 loan from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch.41 McCarty also sat on the State Bank Board, and although he
                    was not a director of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch, he doubtless had a voice in its management through director David Williams, his
                    cousin, merchant partner, and—according to at least one
                    observer—"mere instrument."42 Even without
                    Williams, McCarty would have been influential in the branch for he was its largest individual
                    stockholder, owning over one fourth of the private shares.43 McCarty was
                    unequaled as a merchant-entrepreneur in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The economic crisis of the late 1830s made him the town's leading debtor,
                    unable to pay for merchandise bought on credit and unable

                     to collect from many of his Indiana customers. And, as his
                    friend Calvin Fletcher noted, the money he had "invested in lands & building hotels
                    &c. … [was] now dead capital."44
            
            Although McCarty was the most indulged Branch Bank "favorite," other 
                        Indianapolis
                     businessmen with close ties to the branch had also obtained loans and like McCarty were
                    unable to repay them because of depressed economic conditions. Palmer's bank report in 1842
                    included a list of these unpaid notes which were under protest. Most debtors on the list owed sums
                    of only a few hundred dollars, but three persons stand out as owing large amounts: James Blake owed
                    $13,400; Samuel Henderson, $10,000; and Daniel Yandes, $7,236. All
                    three were large stockholders and directors of the branch during the 1830s.45
            
            Palmer's report was made public in early 1843, and although it caused considerable
                    excitement in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , its contents were not a revelation to some residents.46 By setting
                    forth in embarrassing detail the exact amount owed by each debtor to the Branch Bank, however, the
                    report substantiated what many persons had long suspected. The large loans to a select few had been
                    a subject of conversation for several years, and the names that had been heard in the streets were
                    those of McCarty, Blake, Yandes, Henderson, and others of the town's leading
                    businessmen—known favorites of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch and men who had used their position and prominence to obtain large loans that
                    they were now unable to repay.47
            
            The issue of favoritism by bankers to themselves and to other merchants was part of and helped lend
                    credence to a broad and virulent attack on the 
                        Indianapolis
                     business community in the early 1840s. This antibusiness campaign was politically
                    motivated as it was largely the work of Democratic politicians eager to discredit their Whig
                    opponents. One of the first steps in their effort was the assertion that most

                    Indiana Democrat noted, "all the mercantile houses, with the exception of
                    three or four, are whig, and all the mercantile community are combined against us.
                        …"48 Jacksonians also emphasized Whig control of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Branch Bank. In 1837, they claimed, only one Democrat was included among eleven
                    officers and directors. Four years later there were said to be only two.49
            
            If most 
                        Indianapolis
                     merchants and bankers were Whigs, a logical next step for Democrats was to publicize
                    the moral shortcomings of businessmen. An editorial in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Indiana Democrat illustrates the tactics used. Referring to businessmen in general
                    and to merchants in particular, the writer asserted: "the nature of their business is such
                    that selfishness and self interest become their leading incentives to
                    action," and "they lose to a great extent the feeling of expansive philanthropy
                    which look[s] to the interests of all." With proper Jacksonian rhetoric the editor
                    concluded: "constant hankering after profits has an evil influence upon
                    the mind. This class of men opposed Jefferson, they opposed Jackson, they now oppose Mr. Van Buren.
                    They never did as a body, belong to the democracy. Taught from early life to look upon wealth and goodness as the same thing, they will of course unite with
                    the aristocracy."50 Businessmen were dangerous not only because they
                    were selfish or evil but also because, in the words of a leading 
                        Indianapolis
                     Jacksonian, they were "in possession of the two great elements of power,
                    KNOWLEDGE and MONEY." They had, therefore, "the means of exerting an immense
                    influence in public affairs."51 Democratic rhetoric and propaganda thus
                    created a Whig business community powerful enough to carry out its own measures of self interest and

            Jacksonians had raised the cry of "Junto" as early as 1837.52
                    By 1840 they were often warning the people of the Junto's political and economic power. One
                    editor described the group as a "combination of men who have made 
                        Marion
                     and a part of the surrounding counties their hewers of wood and drawers of water.
                        …"53 Although Democrats excelled at describing the
                    general results of the Junto's power, they were usually unable or unwilling to explain
                    exactly how the alleged clique of businessmen operated. An editor could deplore "the
                    dishonorable means resorted to by the federal Junto, the merchants, bankers and clerks of 
                        Indianapolis
                     to deceive the people …," but beyond vague and unsubstantiated
                    allegations of voting frauds he could offer few examples of this deception.54
                    When, despite these warnings, a large majority of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Marion County
                     voters cast ballots for Whig candidates, the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Indiana Democrat weakly explained that the people were blinded by the
                    "glare of aristocracy" and "supposed when they saw the merchants and
                    bankers on the whig side that it was the decency side. …"55
            
            Much of this antibusiness Junto campaign was no more than the thin rhetoric of partisan politics. In
                    an effort to frighten voters into the Democratic party Jacksonian politicians and editors fabricated
                    a monster, a junto of businessmen united to deprive the people of their economic and political
                    liberties. It was a poor imitation of the tactic used earlier by President Jackson; the monster now
                    was not the Second Bank of the 
                        United States
                     but local merchants and bankers.
            Although much of the campaign against the business Junto was partisan rhetoric, there was one area in
                    which Democratic accusations had credence. Democrats had hinted at the relationship between Branch
                    Bank loans and Junto power as early as 1837.56 In 1840 and 1841 they made

                     effective use of this issue. When, for example, the Branch Bank
                    installed a new combination lock for its vault, the Democratic 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel asserted that "each member of the Junto has a key to suit the combination lock," and all loans were
                    "distributed to the Holy Alliance of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ."57 Another Sentinel editorial on the
                    Junto noted that the "monuments of their pride and mischief" included the 
                        Indianapolis
                     steam mill, the Washington Hall Hotel, and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Insurance Company. None benefited the people, yet all were financed with loans from the
                    Branch Bank—"the people's money."58 And
                    although they had acquired their wealth through Branch Bank credit, "a large portion of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Junto are now standing on their reserved, rights: that is, the right
                    to have large houses, stores, farms, &c. without paying their debts."59 Merchants, bankers, and Whig politicians could not easily dismiss Democratic criticism
                    of Branch Bank loans to alleged Junto members. Rumors about the Joans and several reports of
                    legislative investigating committees provided evidence for the charges and lifted them above the
                    level of political mudslinging. Even the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal admitted: "Many Whigs believe that the Branch at this place is
                    not conducted as it should be. …"60 The issue had become a
                    political liability to Whigs and a means of providing substance to attacks against businessmen. By
                    making evident economic and political favoritism on the part of a public institution, Democratic
                    criticism prepared the way for a movement to change Branch Bank practices. Unlike the experience of
                    some other states, however, Indiana Jacksonians did not participate directly in formulating or
                    instituting these changes. Instead, members of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     business community—mainly Whigs—quietly and privately modified
                    Branch Bank practices.
            The leader of the Branch Bank "reform"61 movement was Calvin
                    Fletcher. Born in 
                        Vermont
                     in 1798, Fletcher left 
                        New England
                     for the West at the age of nineteen. He studied

                            money" was doubtless based on the fact that the bank was a public institution in
                            which the state owned one half the stock.

                            Fletcher and his associates referred to themselves in those terms and were so referred to by
                            others. See Thoi'nbrough and Riker, Diary of Calvin Fletcher, II,

                  Urbana,
                            Ohio
               , but because of an abundance of
                    lawyers there decided in 1821 to move to the future capital of Indiana. Fletcher was the first
                    lawyer in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and practiced law there for several years. With the aid of his friend McCarty he became
                    a collection agent for many eastern merchants, and by the early 1830s debt collection was the
                    largest and most profitable part of his business. But Fletcher soon acquired other interests and
                    gradually diminished his law and collection activities, turning much of this work over to partners.
                    He served in the Indiana Senate from 1826 to 1833. In the mid-1830s he spent much of his time and
                    money on investment projects, including the Washington Hall Hotel, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Insurance Company, the Branch Bank, and large land speculations with McCarty. The hard
                    times of the late 1830s and early 1840s left Fletcher with large debts, including some to the Branch
                    Bank. At the same time, however, his collection business prospered, and unlike many other debtors
                    Fletcher was soon able to meet most of his obligations. By 1842 he possessed enough financial
                    security to abandon law and debt collection, and from then until his death in 1866 much of his
                    attention was devoted to banking. During the 1830s Fletcher had been a member of the State Bank
                    Board and the attorney for the 
                        Indianapolis
                     branch. His interest in the issue of loans to branch favorites brought about a closer
                    association with the institution.62
            
            Fletcher's concern over Branch Bank credit antedated the Panic of 1837. In early March,
                    1837, he noted: "Several of our Merchants are going East & have been accommodated
                    to an extravigant [sic] length at [the] Bank." He added: "it has
                    been resolved by several of us that we will put a stop to such extravigant [sic]
                        loans."63 But Fletcher and his unidentified
                    associates apparently took no action at this time, and the intensive Branch Bank reform movement did
                    not begin until 1840.

            In late 1839 Stoughton Fletcher, Calvin's youngest brother, was elected to a directorship in
                    the Branch Bank. Stoughton had arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1831 and had soon become a successful merchant and later a broker and banker.64 Encouraged by Calvin, Stoughton began in early 1840 to vote against
                    extensions and further renewals of loans to directors and other favorites.65
                    Though urged by his brother to persevere, Stoughton soon abandoned bank reform. In early October,
                    1840, the two brothers had a conversation that marked the beginning of an estrangement between them.
                    "He insists," Calvin lamented, "on getting very rich & thinks I
                    am too scrupulous on the subject of buying notes. …"66
            
            Friction between two brothers was only a small part of the conflict caused within the 
                        Indianapolis
                     business community by the issue of Branch Bank reform. Calvin Fletcher made his first
                    substantial move toward reform in mid-1840, when, in his position as a member of the State Bank
                    Board, he obtained the appointment of Ovid Butler and Corson Vickers as Branch Bank directors.
                    Butler was Calvin Fletcher's partner in the collection agency, and Vickers was a successful
                    businessman interested in several enterprises, including merchandising. Both were sympathetic to
                    Calvin Fletcher, who stated that the purpose in their appointment was "to check the
                    merchants influence in the Branch" and to end large loans to merchants, directors, and
                        stockholders.67 Other directors viewed their two new colleagues with
                    disapproval and fear.68 As for himself, Calvin Fletcher noted: the attempt at
                    "reform has brought me into bad odor with some of my best friends." McCarty
                    especially was "so injured in his feelings that he does not wish to see me on the

            Appointment of two new directors did not immediately change Branch Bank practices. In late August,
                    1840, the branch approved large discounts for merchants "to go to 
                        Philadelphia
                     for goods." Calvin Fletcher was dismayed. "It must be
                    stopped," he vowed.70

            After planning his strategy, Calvin Fletcher met on December 15 with Alexander Worth and Samuel
                    Herriott. Both had been branch directors since 1834. Fletcher gained their support for an attempt to
                    replace as directors his wayward brother, Stoughton, and McCarty's representative,
                    Williams. On the same day and with the support of Worth, Herriott, Butler, and Vickers, Calvin
                    Fletcher attended "a meeting of old friends," held in Alfred Harrison's
                    dry goods store. The informal gathering had been "very prudently called" by Ray,
                    cashier of the State Bank and a large stockholder in the Branch Bank.71
                    According to Fletcher, Ray was, throughout the reform campaign, the "promoter of
                    peace" and the intermediary between the reformers and the people they alienated.72 His pacificatory talents were especially needed at the December 15 meeting.
                    In attendance were Benjamin I. Blythe, A. W. Russell, Bates, Blake, Harrison, McCarty, Ray, and
                    Fletcher, all leaders of the business community and all debtors to the Branch Bank.73 They argued long over the question of discounts to merchants, and while there was
                    considerable disagreement, a majority eventually conceded the necessity of reducing loans. Calvin
                    Fletcher also presented his proposal not to reelect his brother and Williams. This, too, generated
                    "much heat," but most of those present eventually consented.74
            
            Although the meeting of December 15 was a major victory for the reformers, they continued their fight
                    for several years, gradually effecting measures that substantially reduced criticism of the Branch
                    Bank. In late December, 1840, 
                        Butler
                     persuaded his fellow directors to ascertain the total amount owed by Blake and to set
                    rates for systematic repayment. McCarty and other large debtors also agreed to repayment schedules,
                    and although it required several years, these debtors eventually repaid their loans.75 The reformers'

                     policy of reducing discounts to merchants was also put into
                    effect, although the achieved reduction was undoubtedly due largely to the depressed nature of the
                        economy.76 In a direct attempt to mollify political discontent with the
                    Branch Bank the reformers gradually succeeded in replacing old directors with new ones, some of whom
                    were Democrats and none of whom was a large debtor.77 The old officers were also
                    forced out. Bates had been president of the branch since its organization, but the reformers
                    considered him too willing to extend credit. In early 1844 they met, again informally at
                    Harrison's store, and decided "they would invite H. Bates to resign the
                    Presidency. …"78 Bates accepted the invitation, and the
                    reformers succeeded in getting Calvin Fletcher elected in his place. Later they also replaced Morris
                    as cashier.79
            
            By the mid-1840s Fletcher and his associates had completed their reforms. They had corrected the
                    major abuses of personal favoritism by setting and obtaining agreement to loan repayment schedules
                    for long standing debtors and by curtailing new loans to merchants and bank directors. And they had
                    reduced partisan discrimination by adding Democrats to the bank's board of directors.
            In carrying out these measures the reformers stole much of the Jacksonians' thunder and
                    perhaps prevented more far reaching changes. Democratic criticism of the Branch Bank had been
                    sufficiently strong and valid in the early 1840s to threaten drastic changes in the institution and
                    perhaps even the entire state banking system. Such indeed was the result of Jacksonian attacks in
                    many other western states where the failure of reform efforts contributed ultimately to successful
                    movements to abolish banks. That Indiana was spared drastic measures in the early 1840s was
                    doubtless the result of many factors, most notably the strength of the Indiana Whig party, the
                    weakness of hard money sentiment

                        prosperity.80 Yet failure to change the banking system dramatically was due
                    also to the shrewdness of Fletcher and his associates. Quietly and privately these 
                        Indianapolis
                     businessmen effected measures that met most of the valid criticism directed against the
                    Branch Bank and the business community. The success of these reform measures is indicated by the
                    fact that from the mid-1840s until the charter expired in 1859 neither the bank nor the business
                    community was subject to the kind of vituperative criticism that plagued them in the late 1830s and
                    early 1840s. The Democratic press in these later years was nearly silent on such subjects as large
                    loans to bank favorites and the alleged Junto of businessmen using the bank for selfish purposes.

            Sheep without Shepherds: Letters of Two Lutheran Traveling Missionaries, 1835–1837
            Edited by R. F. Rehmer*
            
            In 1838 the Reverend Daniel Scherer, president of the Lutheran Synod of the West, summed up the
                    religious situation regarding Lutheran mission efforts in Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Missouri
                    : 
                        The state of our church in the West is such that it requires missionaries. Those missionaries
                            ought to be appointed to labor in certain spheres where there is prospect of doing good, and
                            be stationed there for at least one year or more at a time, until it could be ascertained if
                            congregations could be formed. It is found that missionaries, sent out merely to explore the
                            country and to make reports, do but little or no good at all to the church. They only raise
                            the expectations of our dispersed people, scattered as they are throughout the wilderness,
                            and then disappoint them. The consequence of this is that they despair of ever getting a
                            minister of our church to live among them. The tendency of this is to excite prejudice in
                            their minds against the missionary cause.1
                  
                     Yet during the early decades of the nineteenth century Lutheran missionaries in the area of
                    the Old Northwest were for the most part traveling missionaries. And they were few in number. The
                    tardiness of Lutheran efforts in the West was due not so much to lack of willingness or of concern
                    for the spiritual well being of the dispersed brethren but to the small number of Lutherans in the
                    country. By the year 1800 there were approximately 100,000 Lutherans in the entire United

                                The Life Story of John Christian Frederick Heyer ([
                                Philadelphia

                     States; yet, the number of Lutheran pastors totaled only 153,
                    even as late as 1820.2
            
            Other considerations also retarded Lutheran efforts in the western areas. The use of German in
                    synodical meetings and worship services created a language barrier and, allied with the tendency of
                    many Lutherans to isolate themselves in their own communities, also alienated a nativist element on
                    the frontier which condemned such denominations as Lutheran and Catholic as immigrant or
                    "foreign" churches. Like other confessional churches, Lutherans relied on an
                    educated clergy, were less effusive in their beliefs and worship services than many of the early
                    Baptists and Methodists, and were therefore somewhat "out of place" on the
                        frontier.3 L. C. Rudolph wrote of the Presbyterian church in pioneer
                    Indiana: "Calvin never had it so hard in 
                        Geneva
                     as some of the Presbyterian missionaries had it in Indiana."4 Similarly, Martin Luther may have had an easier time of it in 
                        Wittenberg
                     than some Lutheran pastors and missionaries experienced on the American frontier.
            In addition, synodical feuding and competitiveness complicated progress in the West. With some
                    variations there were three major trends in Lutheran thought in 
                        America
                     during the early 1800s. At one extreme was the viewpoint that Lutherans had much in
                    common with members of the German Reformed church and therefore could unite with them in 
                        America
                     just as they had done in some areas in 
                        Germany
                    . This procedure had been followed in the 
                        North Carolina
                     Synod during at least one period in that state's Lutheran history, and in
                    rural areas where population was scarce, union between Lutherans and members of the German Reformed
                    church seemed merely a matter of common sense.

                     At the opposite extreme were those Lutherans who stressed
                    exclusive adherence to the doctrines and official documents of the sixteenth century without
                    modification. These individuals not only rejected union with members of the German Reformed church
                    but also refused to cooperate with Lutherans who were willing to adapt their doctrinal beliefs
                    somewhat to American religious customs. The 
                        Tennessee
                     Synod, formed in 1820, the Joint Synod of 
                        Ohio
                     (1833), and later the Indiana Synod (1835) would have neither fellowship nor union with
                    those Lutherans who were not in complete doctrinal agreement with them. Representatives of the third
                    trend in Lutheran thought did not believe in joining the German Reformed church but would fraternize
                    with its members. Although they followed traditional Lutheran doctrine, they accepted differences of
                    opinion on some confessional and practical matters, advocated adjustment to American customs and the
                    English language, and wanted to cooperate with all Lutherans for the purposes of work and
                    fellowship. Members of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Ministerium and the Synod of the West (1835) were among these more middle of the road
                    Lutherans. The first federation of Lutheran synods in 
                        America
                    , the General Synod, begun in 1820, was an attempt on their part to achieve the unity
                    and union which they advocated. Not all synods joined the General Synod, however, and for a number
                    of years, the organization was general in name only. All three synodical trends appeared in the
                        Ohio Valley, and feuding among advocates of each retarded Lutheran progress
                    in the West.5
            
            Despite these problems traveling Lutheran missionaries were working among congregations in the lower
                    Old Northwest at least as early as the initial decade of the nineteenth century.6 Among the first such men to enter the Indiana area were the Reverend Paul Henkel and his six
                    sons who logged innumerable miles in their missionary journeys

                            Kentucky
               , Indiana, and farther west.7 John Stauch, who is regarded as the Father of Lutheranism in 
                        Ohio
                    , is reported to have traveled approximately 100,000 miles in the interest of Lutheran
                    home missions in the Ohio Valley.8 Lutheran missionaries
                    undoubtedly also crossed into Indiana from the 
                        Kentucky
                     area, where the first known Lutheran congregation, Hopeful Church, near Florence in 
                        Boone County
                    , was founded in 1806.9
            
            Little evidence has been found of the travels of Lutheran pastors in Indiana during the decade when 
                        America
                     was engaged in the War of 1812 and in which Indiana was admitted to the Union (1816).
                    After the General Synod was organized, however, interest in missionary efforts to the West stepped
                    up considerably. Both the 
                        Ohio
                     and the 
                        Tennessee
                     synods, which did not join the General Synod, became more aggressive in such missionary
                    work, perhaps to save the West for "sound" Lutheranism.10 The 
                        Ohio
                     Synod directed Andrew Henkel, Henry Heineke, John Casper Dill, and Jacob Gruber to go
                    into Indiana during the 1820s. Most of their energies were expended near 
                        Richmond
                     in 
                        Wayne County
                    .11 In 1832 five congregations farther west along the 
                        Wabash
                     requested a missionary of the 
                        Ohio
                     Synod.12 The 
                        Tennessee
                     Synod was stimulated in its outreach by the appeals of the Reverend Henry Kurtz, pastor
                    of congregations in 
                  Jefferson County, Kentucky
               , around 1819. When his first appeals to the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Synod seemed to go unheeded, Kurtz turned

                        Tennessee
                     Synod.13 During the 1820s this synod sent out at least five
                    missionaries. Jacob Zink made journeys extending from 
                        Louisiana
                     to Indiana. By 1823 he settled near the middle of Indiana, but he died in 1827. The
                    next petitions directed to the 
                        Tennessee
                     Synod were those from settlements of Lutherans in 
                        Kentucky
                     and Indiana who asked specifically for Philip and David Henkel.14
                    Abraham Miller settled and preached near 
                        Columbus
                     in 
                        Bartholomew County
                     in 1838, and Christian Moretz, ordained a deacon in 1822 and a pastor the next year,
                    served congregations in 
                        Greene
                     and 
                        Morgan counties
                    .15
            
            The 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Ministerium, however, had by no means given up its concern for the settlements in the
                    West. It commissioned the Reverend John Christian Frederick Heyer and the Reverend Michael Wachter
                    to make a three months' tour of 
                        Kentucky
                     and Indiana in 1820.16 In 1821 its appointees were Jacob Schnee of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     and Ludolf H. Myers of 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Traveling together at first across southern Indiana, Schnee and Myers separated at
                    Paoli. Schnee remained on a westward course to the 
                        Wabash
                     while Myers visited 
                        Washington
                     and 
                        Harrison
                     counties. Myers again made a two months' tour in 1822.17
            
            A year that was most significant for Lutheran missionary endeavors in Indiana and westward was 1835.
                    In that year two more synods were organized, both of them in the Indiana area. The Synod of the
                    West, an organization of Lutheran pastors related to the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Ministerium, was formed and held its first session in a Methodist church in
                            
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               .18 The second was the founding of the
                    Indiana Synod at a meeting in 
                        Johnson County
                    , Indiana, of pastors related to the 
                        Tennessee

            In 1835 the Synod of the West commissioned the Reverend Jacob Lehmanowsky and the Reverend Peter
                    Rizer to travel through the states of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     to ascertain the actual conditions of Lutheran settlements in those states and to make
                    a report at the next meeting.20 When the synod met again at Hopeful Church,
                            
                  Boone County, Kentucky
               , in 1836, a guest in its midst was the Reverend Ezra Keller,
                    a young graduate of 
                        Gettysburg
                     Seminary, who was on a six months' journey under the auspices of the Executive
                    Society of the Missionary Society of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Ministerium.21 A year earlier the Central Missionary Society, an
                    organization formed in 1835 by a group of Lutheran ministers attached to the Synod of West 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , had sponsored the more seasoned missionary, the Reverend John C. F. Heyer, to make a
                    six months' tour of the western area.22 Both Heyer and Keller sent
                    regular letters reporting on their travels to their sponsoring bodies. These letters were turned
                    over to the Reverend Benjamin Kurtz, editor of the Lutheran Observer, who printed
                    them in full in the journal.23
            
            Heyer resigned his pastorate in 
                  Somerset, Pennsylvania
               , and began his missionary journey
                    to the frontier areas of the 
                        United States
                     on December 30, 1835. His first letter to Simon S. Schmucker, a close friend and the
                    secretary of the Central Missionary Society, is dated January 28, 1836. Five more letters followed
                    at approximately one month intervals. Traveling west from

                            Society was threefold: "to send the gospel of the Son of God, to the destitute
                            portions of the Lutheran church in the 
                                United States
                            , by means of missionaries, and by assisting for a season, such congregations of
                            said church as are not yet able to support the gospel, and ultimately to cooperate in
                            sending it to the heathen world." The Central Missionary Society did not supersede
                            any of the different synodical societies but was an effort to strengthen and unify them.

                    .24 Keller, who began his travels on August 26, 1836, a few days
                    after his graduation from the Lutheran seminary in 
                  Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
               ,
                    followed much the same route as did Heyer. His six letters, possibly also written to Schmucker who
                    was a professor at the 
                        Gettysburg
                     school, are dated approximately three weeks apart from October, 1836, to February,
                    1837. Although both missionaries experienced similar hardships on the frontier and encountered
                    similar problems among the Lutheran communities, Keller's youthful intensity provides an
                    interesting contrast to Heyer's experience and maturity. Keller concluded his tour near the
                    end of April, 1837.25
            
            Heyer's and Keller's letters are particularly valuable because they bring to light
                    the numerous problems confronting the Lutheran church in its infancy and early childhood in Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        Missouri
                    . They describe the location of the various Lutheran settlements and provide some
                    information as to the background and points of origin of the settlers. The letters also tell of the
                    traveling missionaries' contacts with clergy and laity of other denominations and give
                    interesting and perhaps exaggerated accounts of the moral and spiritual laxity of the frontier. The
                    writers point to rivalries between the Indiana Synod and the Synod of the West, both of which were
                    founded in 1835 and both of which operated in the Indiana area.
            The two missionaries' letters also reveal the early Lutherans' reluctance to
                    becoming too Americanized. Although they were loyal citizens of the state of Indiana and of the
                    republic, Lutherans frequently isolated themselves in small communities, and Lutheranism in the 
                        United States
                     soon took on an immigrant complex. Carl Mauelshagen in two separate works written in
                    1935 and 1936 concluded that the thrust of an immigrant Lutheranism in the nineteenth century was

                     25 In addition to the six letters to the Central Missionary Society,
                            Keller kept an account of his missionary journey in his diary, parts of which are published
                            in his biography. Keller, who later founded and became the first president of Wittenberg
                            College, 
                        Springfield, Ohio
                     , also made an extensive oral report on his
                            travels to the meeting of the Synod of 
                                Pennsylvania
                             in May, 1837. In this address, also printed in part in the biography, he
                            describes places which he visited other than those mentioned in the letters. Diehl, Biography of Rev. Ezra Keller, 57–63, 66–82, passim.
                  
               
                     toward stronger confessionalism and away from
                        Americanization.26 In 1973 Kendall F. Svengalis reemphasized this thesis
                    when he wrote: "By 1870 the ‘American Lutheran position’ was no
                    longer entertained by any sizeable portion of the Lutheran population in the 
                        United States
                    . A lack of effective leadership, combined with the tremendous increase in German
                    immigration after 1850, relegated the liberal viewpoint in Indiana and elsewhere to an isolated
                        position."27
            
            Other prominent religious and intellectual historians have also noted that midwestern Lutheranism in
                    particular may early have avoided coming to grips with the social issues of American life. This
                    "turning away," they suggest, may first have occurred in the midnineteenth century
                    and may have continued thereafter in varying degrees. Vergelius Ferm concluded that this crisis in
                    Lutheran theology probably occurred around 1855, and Martin Marty and Sydney Ahlstrom have
                    elaborated on the same theme.28 The twelve Heyer and Keller letters which are
                    reproduced below signal that the crisis was already underway by 1835, and the two missionaries
                    anticipate the difficulties which the Lutheran church would encounter in confronting American
                    society. In a way, the letters also provide a possible explanation for—or at least a
                    basis for understanding—the Lutherans' personal beliefs and theological
                    schizophrenia, topics which were treated by Sidney Mead in two separate addresses in 1973.29
            
            That Heyer, an advocate of the more "liberal" Lutheranism of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Ministerium and the General Synod, recognized the trend away from unity and union among
                    the Lutheran immigrants on the frontier is evident. In his letter of February 29, 1836, he described
                    a group of German families so strenuously Lutheran "that they positively declare they
                    cannot receive the Lord's Supper from any minister,

                    from 
                        North Carolina
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    , where they have imbibed prejudices against every thing connected with the General
                    Synod. On various occasions I have conversed with these people, and pointed out to them wherein they
                    misapprehended things." His expressed hope for a union between the Indiana Synod and the
                    Synod of the West, however, did not materialize.
            Keller also expressed the need for a closer union among Lutherans in the West. In his initial letter
                    he commented: "It is to be regretted that those men, who have charge of the German
                    Congregations, cannot preach in the English language; if they could, they might whilst they are
                    tending to and supported by the Germans, also gradually raise English congregations."
                    Keller was even more distressed by the fact that the Lutheran church was not well known or well
                    accepted in many frontier areas. About northern 
                        Kentucky
                     he wrote: "So shamefully ignorant are Christians in this part of the country
                    that some do not know that the Lutheran is the oldest Protestant
                    Church in existence; and others think that the Lutheran and Catholic Churches are the same." Many individuals thought him "a catholic
                    priest, or a Cambelite or a former of a new sect."30 Perhaps most revealing are the young missionary's statements regarding the type of
                    Lutheran minister which was needed on the frontier. Keller concluded his enumeration of necessary
                    qualifications: 
                        Let no one entertain the opinion that the weaker instruments should be sent to the West. This
                            erroneous notion has been too prevalent in the ecclesiastical bodies of the East. If there
                            be talent, learning and eloquence necessary in any part of the land, it is West of the
                            Alleghany and in no place are eminent ministerial qualifications so much appreciated and so
                            highly estimated as in this. In most places … a Lutheran minister should be able
                            to preach in both languages, to endure privations, to suffer hardships and to labor with
                            patience amidst many discouragements.
                    
            
            
               
                  30 The term "Cambelite" probably refers to a follower of
                        Alexander and Thomas Campbell, leaders of a movement in the early 1800s to discard all human
                        creeds and return to the Bible as the sole source of authority in religion. This movement
                        eventually led to the formation of the Christian church (Disciples of Christ). Heyer, too, found
                        a lack of knowledge of Lutheranism on the frontier. In his letter of March 28, 1836, he wrote:
                        "A Lutheran preacher in this county [
                     Sangamon
                            County, Illinois
                  ] appeared to
                        be a novelty; but very few had ever heard a minister of that denomination."

                        Dear Brother:—
                        In accordance with the instructions received, I herewith communicate my first monthly
                                    report, as exploring Agent of the Central Missionary Society of the Evangelical

                        My pastoral charge in

                                    I commenced my journey to the far west, on Wednesday, Dec. 30. The first Sunday in
                                    1836, I spent in 
                                        Washington
                                     co. Penn., preaching to one of br.

                                    's Congregations. When I arrived in 
                                        Wheeling
                                     [
                                        Virginia
                                    ], it was stated, that the roads to 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    , after leaving the national turnpike,3 would be
                                    almost impassable, on account of the mud. In consequence of this information, I took
                                    steamboat, 
                              
                                 1 For the purposes of the following transcription the
                                            editor used photocopies of the microfilm edition of the Lutheran Observer in which the original Heyer and Keller letters
                                            were published. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation have been
                                            reproduced as they were found in the newspaper version of the letters; no
                                            attempt has been made to determine whether the errors were due to the letter
                                            writers, the editor of the Observer, or the typesetter. A
                                                [sic] has been used only if it was thought that
                                            readers might attribute the error to the Indiana Magazine of
                                                History. Dashes which were obviously fillers at the end of a line
                                            of type in the newspaper have been omitted. Whenever it was impossible to
                                            ascertain from the photocopy whether a period or a comma had been used, the
                                            editor selected whichever mark best contributed to the clarity of the
                                            paragraph. In a number of instances beginnings of words were obliterated
                                            from the photocopy. The missing letters have been supplied in brackets.
                                            Elsewhere bracketed letters indicate the correct spelling of place names.
                                            Heyer's initial letter of January 28, 1836, was printed in the Lutheran Observer of March 18, 1836. A microfilm edition
                                            of this newspaper is located in the Corpus of American
                                                Lutheranism, Unit 3 (1835–1837), Roll 9 (University of

                                            Lutheran Church in the 
                                                United States
                                             was formed in 1835 by a convention of Lutheran ministers in 
                                                Pennsylvania
                                            . Although in 1837 the society reported that it had employed six
                                            missionaries, its chief accomplishment was the missionary journey undertaken
                                            by Heyer. Because the Central Missionary Society failed to gain the support
                                            of all of the various Lutheran synods, its work ceased within a few years.

                                    English Lutheran Congregation could be formed in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    , brother Crigler is willing to resign his present charge, and have it
                                    connected with 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    . On Monday morning br. Crigler accompanied me some distance on my way
                                    to 
                                        Louisville
                                    . His parting remark was, "Remember, brother, that you have the
                                    prayers of the church." In all the different stations which I have
                                    occupied, since I entered the ministry, I never thought it more necessary to say,
                                    "Brother, p[r]ay for me," than at present.

                                 4 A real plague to the Lutheran church in the early
                                            nineteenth century were itinerant ministers who posed as bona fide pastors
                                            but who were "wolves in sheep's clothing." In his
                                            final letter, dated July 1, 1836, Heyer mentions an Uhnholz or Hohnholz who
                                            was at St. Omar, 
                                                Decatur County
                                            , Indiana. In his letter of January 28, 1837, Keller writes of
                                            the same man as one who had preyed upon the faithful in the German
                                            settlement of 
                                    Quincy,

                                            fifty foot brick church was built from bricks made near the church. Henry G.

                                     Roads bad, accommodations indifferent, and
                                    charges high. From 25 to 28 miles was all I could go; which, to one who has been
                                    accustomed to fast riding, appears slow travelling. One night I was obliged to stop
                                    at a house which had no window, and use my saddle bags instead of a pillow.
                        On Thursday, Jan. 4th I arrived in 
                                        Jeffersontown

                                    ], where I was kindly received by br. G. Yeager and his lady.6 Taking all circumstances into consideration, we concluded,
                                    that I ought to tarry over Sunday. Spent some time in visiting the brethren in town
                                    and country, with whom I became acquainted in 1819, when I travelled as Missionary
                                    in this section of country.7 On Sunday I preached to a
                                    respectable congregation in the English language, and delivered also a short address
                                    in German. Brother Yeager has labored with perseverance and considerable success,
                                    for several years, among his people, and it appears to me that their prospects are
                                    brightening.
                        Monday, Jan. 18th, I crossed the Ohio river at 
                                        New Albany
                                    , Indiana state, where br. Lehmenowsky had been preaching on Sunday.8 On Tuesday I arrived in

                            co. Ind. where I found br. P. Rizer, who is
                                    both pedagogue and divine.9 The harvest being great, and the
                                    laborers so few; methinks that our young brethren ought to

                                             and Indiana. From July to October Heyer traveled approximately
                                            2,500 miles, primarily in

                                             for a number of years. Later, using money provided by various
                                            benefactors, he purchased land near

                                            , Indiana, where he farmed and practiced medicine. In 1836
                                            Lehmanowsky was ordained as a minister of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of
                                            the West. After his second marriage he resided near Corydon, Indiana. Jens

                                                Maryland
                                             in 1812. He attended the theological seminary at
                                                    
                                    Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
                                 , from which
                                            he graduated in 1832. After serving as missionary to the Indians in 
                                                South Carolina
                                             and

                                            , Rizer accepted a call to Indiana where he worked for several
                                            years. In addition to being a minister Rizer was a distinguished linguist
                                            who could speak six languages. Ibid.,

                                     be wholly given up to the work of the gospel
                                    ministry. This is what br. Rizer desires, and I would therefore recommend him to the
                                    Central Missionary Society, to engage his services. After leaving some appointments
                                    with br. R. for the first and second Sunday in June next, to be sent to Corydon,
                                    Harrison co. Ind., I proceeded mostly on by-roads, to shun the mud, and through
                                    thinly settled parts of Indiana, to the Wabash river, where I
                                    arrived on Saturday evening, Jan. 23.
                        As far as my information goes, with respect to the state of Indiana, there are German
                                    settlements in the following counties:—
                              Jefferson, Scott,
                                            Clarke, Harrison, Washington,
                                            Bartholomew, Morgan, Greene, Fountain, Dearborn,
                                            Henry, Johnson, Monroe, Rush, Vermillion
                           , Vigo, and 
                                        Wayne
                                    . How strong these settlements are, I could not yet ascertain, but some
                                    of them I expect to visit next spring when I shall be able to learn the particulars.
                                    I am satisfied that there is much work to be done in Indiana, but when, how, and by
                                    whom it is done, these are questions which I shall be better able to answer, after
                                    exploring the state more extensively than I have yet had time to do. On Sunday, Jan.
                                    24th, I preached to the Germans in Mount Carmel, 
                                        Wabash
                                     co. 
                                        Illinois
                                    . The number of German families in this place amount to about 25, mostly
                                    Europeans. I was introduced to, and kindly entertained by the Rev. T. S. Hinde, who
                                    has manifested his desire that the German population in the far west should be
                                    provided with suitable ministers of the gospel.
                        On Monday, Jan. 25th, I visited a German settlement about 12 miles from
                                        Mount Carmel, appointed preaching for Wednesday. The number
                                    of persons present yesterday, amounted to about one hundred. I have baptized eleven
                                    children since Sunday. I am now on my way to visit other German settlements about
                                    eight and ten miles distant,—and I have made appointments for Saturday,
                                    Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. After attending to these
                                    appointments, I design to visit 
                                        Jonesboro
                                    . Brother Haverstick is expected to arrive here in a few days, and it
                                    will be desirable that I should see him, for he will be able to communicate some
                                    information which may be of great benefit to me in my travels.10

                                            the German population in 
                                                Illinois
                                             and adjacent states. His journey lasted about nine months and
                                            occurred at approximately the same time as did Heyer's trip.

                        DEAR BROTHER:—
                        My last communication was dated on the 28th of January, from 
                                        Wabash County
                                    , Ill. I remained in that section of country until the 9th of February.
                                    During which time I visited parts of 
                                        Lawrence
                                     and 
                                        Edwards Counties
                                    , where I found a few German families, who might occasionally be
                                    attended to by a minister residing in Mount Carmel. During the
                                    last week of my stay, I preached twelve times, baptized nineteen, married one
                                    couple, attended one funeral, obtained two subscribers for the Observer,13 who paid in advance, and received donations in aid of our
                                    Western Missions, from the following persons, viz:—Messrs. J. Glick, John Seibert, Jacob Seibert, S. Seibert, G. Slenker, J. Dorney, F.

                                        Wabash County
                                     contains about sixty German families, including those who live in
                                        Mount Carmel. The majority profess to be Lutherans, some of
                                    them so strenuous that they positively declare they cannot receive the
                                    Lord's Supper from any minister, except one who belongs to their Church,
                                    nor would they be persuaded otherwise. There were some persons who expressed a
                                    desire to be instructed, and wished to be received as members of the church. Brother

                                 11 Since Heyer's given name was John

                                 12 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, April 15, 1836.
                              
                                 13 The Lutheran Observer was begun

                                 , in 1831.
                                            Except for a few years in the possession of the

                                            conservative elements of the General Synod. Its editor from 1833 to 1861 was
                                            the controversial Dr. Benjamin Kurtz. Wentz, Basic History of
                                                Lutheranism in

                                     who was daily expected, and had promised to
                                    spend some time among the people, will no doubt attend to them.
                        In an agricultural point of view, this county holds out many inducements to the 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     farmer. Much of the land is yet to be entered, at one dollar and
                                    twenty-five cents per acre.14 A purchaser can have his choice
                                    and select all wood land, or take one half prairie, and the other half timber. The
                                    latter I should think preferable, for in this case a man has nothing to do but to
                                    fence his prairie land and enter with the ploughs, where neither stump nor stone
                                    will hinder him in his labor. Mount Carmel affords a ready market for the
                                    farmer's produce. In a commercial point of view this town will likely
                                    become a place of some importance. Situated on the banks of the Wabash
                                        river, it possesses the advantages of navigation. A company is
                                    incorporated to make a rail road from Alton, on the Mississippi
                                    river, to Mount Carmel, which will open a connexion
                                    by way of Lake Erie, with 
                                        New York
                                    . A branch of the 
                                        Illinois
                                     State bank is to be opened this spring in 
                                        Carmel
                                    ; besides other improvements spoken of.15
                        
                        Tuesday, February 9th, I left 
                                        Wabash County
                                    , and pursued my journey by way of Carmi, Shawnee town and 
                                        Vienna
                                    , to 
                                        Jonesboro
                                    , mostly through a very thinly settled country and light soil, the most
                                    of which will probably not be settled for a long time to come. I did not arrive in
                                    the German settlement until the 14th of February, much fatigued, and too late in the
                                    day to collect the congregation. I sent appointments for Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday,
                                    and Monday, to different places. I have since been engaged in visiting, exhorting,
                                    preaching &c.
                        The German emigration to Union [County], commenced about eighteen years ago,
                                    principally from 
                                        North Carolina
                                    , and the number of families may now amount to 150 or 200; most of them
                                    professedly Lutherans. There are two congregations organized, and two other
                                    settlements where churches may be formed as soon as a minister can be obtained 
                              
                                 14 According to the land law of 1820, which was still
                                            in effect in 1836, the price for public lands was established at
                                            $1.25 per acre and the size of a purchasable tract was eighty

                                     to settle in this county. The distance from one
                                    meeting house to the other will be about five or six miles. At present the people
                                    are scattered, and it will take time and labor to collect and unite them as they
                                    ought to be. The congregations have suffered from various causes. At different times
                                    they were imposed on by men who professed to be German ministers, but who did not
                                    walk worthy of their high vocation. There was also a season when a preaching spirit
                                    possessed some of the members of the church, without succeeding in the attempt; the
                                    Methodists, Baptists, Cumberland Presbyterians and Old Presbyterians, have also made
                                    various attempts to gather the people into their respective churches; but scarcely
                                    any could be induced to forsake the original connexion which they had formed. During
                                    the last two or three years these congregations have occasionally been visited by
                                    Br. D. Sherer, who resides in 
                              Hillsboro, Montgomery
                                    County
                           , at a distance of 150 miles.16 It is
                                    owing in a great measure to the laborious and self-denying exertions of Brother
                                    Sherer, that the flock in 
                                        Union County
                                     has not been altogether scattered.
                        My intention is to spend two or three weeks longer in this part of 
                                        Illinois
                                    , then, by Divine permission, cross the Mississippi
                                    river and visit some German settlements in 
                                        Missouri
                                    . If your committee had not enjoined it upon me to visit 
                                        Jonesboro
                                    ' and settlements around, I should have travelled more at the
                                    commencement of my missionary undertaking in the northern parts of 
                                        Illinois
                                     and Indiana, where the emigrants from Europe and different parts of the
                                    U. States are principally settling at this time. I hope to reach some of those new
                                    settlements during the months of May and June.
                        A few days ago I received a letter from Brother H. W. Lauer,17
                                    who is pastor of the German congregation in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    ,

                                            . Here he ministered to a number of churches and also made many
                                            long missionary journeys throughout the state at his own expense. Roseland,

                                            Free Synod of the German Reformed church, later joined the Lutheran
                                            denomination. After working for a number of years in

                                            , Lauer moved to

                                     containing the pleasing information that a
                                    Missionary society had been formed in his congregation, designedly to aid the
                                    Central society of our church, in sending the gospel to our German brethren in the
                                    far West. The society numbers sixty members, and is increasing. The letter speaks in
                                    terms of approbation relative to the appointment for five years which your committee
                                    has made; it contains an invitation for me to visit the brethren in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    , and an offer to hand over to me the amount of funds which might be
                                    collected and in the hands of the treasurer, at the time of my arrival among them. I
                                    have written on to brother Lauer that I will be in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     the third Sunday in June next, the Lord willing, on my return to 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                    .
                        I have not spoken, nor do I intend hereafter to say much about the hardships and
                                    privations which must necessarily be endured by one who undertakes an exploring
                                    agency in the far West. It requires an excellent constitution and an enthusiastic
                                    zeal, to persevere in an undertaking of this kind. You are not hence to infer that I
                                    feel discouraged; no, through the grace of God I am resolved to go on, and hope that
                                    much good will result from our Missionary exertions.
                        Permit me to give it as my opinion, that it will not be advisable for the executive
                                    committee to send out ministers with families to these new countries. More on this

                                    Zion with suitable laborers.

                        Dear Brother:—
                        The latter part of March, finds me in one of the upper counties in this state, not
                                    very far from where Black Hawk and his warriors commenced their depredations three
                                    or four years ago.19 Instead of enjoying the quietude 
                              
                                 18 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, May 6, 1836.
                              
                                 19 For a complete discussion of the causes, nature,
                                            and results of Black Hawk's War, the last major Indian war in the
                                            Old Northwest, see Buley, Old Northwest, II,
                                            59–80.
                           
                                     of a study, as brethren generally do, when
                                    writing official letters, I am surrounded by a family of children, and rather
                                    uncomfortably seated, to make my third monthly report.
                        The first week in March I remained in 
                              Union
                                        County, Illinois
                           ,
                                    preached eight times, and obtained the following subscribers for the Observer, who
                                    paid in advanced, namely: * * * *20 For Missionary purposes I received one dollar from Henry
                                    Sowers and one dollar from David Miller. After promising to spend a few days more
                                    with the brethren in 
                                        Union County
                                     during April, and leaving some appointments accordingly, I pursued my
                                    journey to some of the more northern counties in this state. On the 10th of March, I
                                    attended the funerals of a mother and her grown son, in 
                                        Jackson County
                                    . In attempting to speak at the grave, I was prevented from proceeding
                                    by the noisy lamentations of the mourners.
                        Jackson County, like Union, is a hilly, timbered, tract of country, except towards
                                    its north-eastern parts, where the prairies commence. Some of these prairies contain
                                    a few German families, but their number at present is not sufficient to form
                                    Congregations. Pursuing a direct north course, I travelled across large prairies,
                                    through Perry, 
                              Washington, Clinton
                           , and 
                                        Bond
                                     Counties, to 
                                        Montgomery County
                                    , where I arrived the 13th of March. In 
                                        Hillsborough
                                     I found Br. Daniel Sherer, at present the only resident Lutheran
                                    Minister in the state of 
                                        Illinois
                                    . The members of Br. Sherer's congregation have commenced
                                    building a large two-story frame meeting-house, and appear in other respects willing
                                    to do their part, in promoting the good cause. A few weeks ago, when brother
                                    Haverstick preached here, the people contributed about five dollars to aid in
                                    sending the gospel to our destitute brethren. This is more than some of our
                                    congregations in the old states appear willing to do.
                        Hillsborough is a healthy and flourishing town, situated in an elevated region,
                                    containing about 250 inhabitants. On Tuesday evening, March 15th, I addressed a part
                                    of brother Sherer's congregation; and on Wednesday morning continued my
                                    journey towards 
                              Springfield, Sangamon County
                           —High waters
                                    and bad roads prevented me from travelling as speedily 
                              
                                 20 Asterisks, such as are used here, were apparently
                                            substituted for the names of the subscribers when Heyer's letter
                                            was printed in the Lutheran Observer.
                              
                           
                                     as I otherwise should have done. Four miles
                                    north-east from 
                                        Springfield
                                     is a place called 
                                        Germany
                                    ; and according to Peck's 
                                        Illinois
                                     Gazeteer is settled by 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     Germans.21 But when I arrived in this section of
                                    country and inquired for Germans, I found but few of them. Being kindly received by
                                    an old Kentuckian, I appointed preaching in his house on Sunday morning, March 20th.
                                    When the people assembled, there appeared to be no need of German preaching; and I
                                    became acquainted only with one Lutheran family, from 
                                        Ohio
                                    . A Lutheran preacher in this county appeared to be a novelty; but very
                                    few had ever heard a minister of that denomination. On Monday morning, March 21st, I
                                    directed my course towards Beardstown, on the Illinois river.
                                    Here I found a number of European Germans, many of whom desire that a Lutheran
                                    minister might be settled among them. The number of Germans in and around
                                    Beardstown, is said to amount to about 200. After visiting a number of families, I
                                    appointed preaching on the 30th March, when I expect to be on my way back towards 
                                        Union County
                                    . In the afternoon of the 22d March, I crossed the Illinois
                                        river and lodged all night with a Mr. Cruse, a pious German, who
                                    collects his children and a few German neighbors on Sundays to engage with them in
                                    religious exercises. By way of Lewistown, in 
                                        Fulton County
                                    , I continued my travels to Peoria, where I arrived on Friday, March
                                    25th. Hearing of a German settlement on the east side of the river, I resolved to
                                    spend Sunday among them. The number of families settled on a circumference of 3 or 4
                                    miles, amounts to twelve or fifteen, all new beginners, but truly desirous to enjoy
                                    the means of grace. On Sunday morning, I administered the Lord's Supper to
                                    about twenty communicants, in a section of country where but a few years ago the
                                    savage roamed and heathenish darkness reigned. A few individuals to express their
                                    gratitude, contributed two dollars without my request. After the congregation was
                                    dismissed, I received a pressing invitation to visit a few German families twenty
                                    miles south of this, who had

                                    reach the appointment in

                        And now, dear brother, permit me to take a general view of our ecclesiastical
                                    prospects in the far West. It appears that we have eight or ten stations west of the
                                        Wabash river, consequently west of the state of Indiana.
                        1. 
                              Union County, Illinois
                           , 150 families, requires English and
                                    German preaching. Two congregations and two other preaching places.
                        2. 
                              St. Clair County, Illinois
                           , contains the greatest number of
                                    Germans of any other county in the state. Many of them are nominally Lutherans;
                                    besides these, there are Atheists, Deists, and Romanists. This will be a difficult
                                    station to manage. The following remarks, published in a German paper printed in 
                                        St. Louis
                                    , will give you an idea what manner of spirit they are of. Speaking of
                                    Missionary exertions, the Editor remarks: "Die deutsche
                                    Bevölkerung ist dort zu aufgeklart um sich in den Fanatismus des
                                    Sectenwesens verwickeln,—zu tugendhaft um sich in den Schlemm der
                                    Heucheley hinabsinken,—zu stolz um durch irgend eine Synode ueber sich
                                    verfuegen und in Heerden eintheilen zu lassen."22 The
                                    number of Protestant families amounts perhaps to 150.
                        3. 
                                        St. Louis
                                     has a considerable number of Lutherans and should be supplied with a
                                    minister of our Church.
                        4. St. Charles on the Missouri river, desires to be supplied;
                                    there are three congregations, who have subscribed about two hundred dollars.
                        5. Beardstown and neighborhood, in 
                              Morgan
                                        County, Illinois
                           ,
                                    abounds with Germans, and may become an important station.
                        6. 
                                        Tazewell County
                                    , above Peoria, also on the Mackinaw river, and 
                                        Putnam County
                                    , west from Hennepin, 
                                        Illinois
                                    , contain German settlements, which ought not to be overlooked.
                        
                           
                              22 The editor's remarks can be translated as
                                        follows: "The German population is there too well informed to get
                                        itself wrapped up in the fanaticism of the sects,—too virtuous to
                                        sink into the degradation of hypocrisy, too proud to allow any Synod to Subject
                                        it and to divide it into groups (herds)."
                        
                        
                        7.

                                     and neighborhood, has Germans.
                        8. 
                              Wabash County, Illinois
                           , with parts of Lawrence and
                                    Edward's County, will make a pleasant station.
                        9. Hillsborough, 
                              Montgomery County, Illinois
                           , under the pastoral
                                    care of brother Daniel Sherer.
                        10. A small settlement of Lutherans in 
                                        Marion
                                     and Rail's County, Mo. between Han[n]ibal and 
                                        New London
                                    , who desire to be attended to, and where a station might be formed.
                        11. On the waters of Crooked Creek and white water, in the South-eastern parts of 
                                        Missouri
                                    , a German minister resided for a number of years, who died some time
                                    since. I have not yet been able to ascertain the actual state of the people in a
                                    religious point of view.
                        Have we men and the means speedily to supply these stations? This your committee will
                                    best be able to answer. In my opinion, young men of suitable qualifications should
                                    be sent, under the direction of our Central Missionary Society. An elderly brother
                                    ought to travel from station to station, be present at communion seasons, report to
                                    the Executive Committee, and assist the young brethren who might from time to time
                                    exchange stations, as much as lay in their power. If this be done, we shall soon be
                                    able to form a Lutheran Synod in the state of 
                                        Illinois
                                    , and continue to extend the borders of our beloved Zion in the far
                                    regions of the West.
                        I would again remark, that ministers of ours, who have families, ought not for the
                                    present at least, to think of moving to this western country, unless they intend
                                    farming. The stations are too weak to support a man with family, and the increase
                                    will not be so rapid as some imagine. The living in this 
                                        Western country
                                     is far from being cheap; store goods sell a hundred per cent higher
                                    here than to the east; grain and other provisions are likewise high at this time,
                                    and I find travelling as expensive here as in the eastern states. The country
                                    otherwise is a pleasant one, containing large bodies of rich land; some sections
                                    however are sickly.
                        With sentiments of Christian affection, yours, &c.

                        Dear Brother:
                        After closing my letter, dated on the 28th of March, I proceeded in the afternoon of
                                    the same day, to the Mackinaw River, where I had promised to
                                    visit a small German settlement. On Tuesday morning, March 29th, I preached and
                                    administered the Lord's Supper to a few Lutheran families, who had been
                                    living in 
                                        Tazewell County
                                    , for five years, without hearing or seeing a minister of their own
                                    Church. Immediately after service I started, without waiting for dinner, taking a
                                    crust of bread in my pocket, still indulging the hope that I should be able to reach
                                    my appointment in 
                                        Beardstown
                                    , on the 30th of March, by riding part of the night. About sundown I got
                                    to Salt Creek, 25 miles from the Mackinaw river, where the
                                    people told me that it would be very difficult to travel the road from thence to
                                    Beardstown, in day-time, on account of high waters, sloughs, &c. and
                                    altogether impossible to proceed during the night. The distance I desired to go yet,
                                    by next morning, 11 o'clock, was 40 miles. Compelled to yield, though
                                    reluctantly, to the difficulties in my road, I found that by undertaking too much,
                                    we sometimes accomplish the less. A poor but pious family, by the name of Ingel,
                                    entertained me kindly during the night. The Germans, however, who expected me to
                                    preach for them in 
                                        Beardstown
                                    , on the 30th of March, were disappointed; nor has it been in my power
                                    to visit them since.
                        Beardstown is situated on the Illinois river, in 
                                        Morgan County
                                    , on elevated ground, sandy soil, entirely above the highest floods. It
                                    has several steam mills, a printing office, nine stores, & c. The population
                                    of the town is about 700. The Germans in and around Beardstown, are estimated at
                                    200, among them a number of young persons, who desire to be instructed, and to be
                                    received as members of the church. As soon as possible, your Executive Committee
                                    should send a minister of our connexion to reside among them.
                        On Good Friday, I addressed a few persons in 
                                        Montgomery County
                                    . April 3d, being Easter Sunday, I preached for brother Daniel Sherer,
                                    in 
                                        Hillsborough
                                    , to a respectable and attentive audience. Brother Sherer would be
                                    willing to 
                              
                                 23 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, June 10, 1836.
                           
                                     spend two or three months during the summer, as
                                    Missionary in the middle and upper counties of this state; and for the present your
                                    committee could not find any one more conveniently situated, to engage in such an
                                    undertaking, than said brother appears to be. Traveling south towards 
                                        Jonesborough
                                    , I visited a colony of 
                                        New England
                                     people, lately settled in Jackson Co. The most of them profess to be
                                    Congregationalists; and finding our mode of worship similar to theirs, they
                                    expressed the wish I would visit them again. Ministers of our Church will be kindly
                                    received by them; inquire for Mr. Lovejoy, or Mr. Tuthill, twelve or fourteen miles
                                    north from 
                                        Brownsville
                                    . Friday, April 8th, I preached on the ridge, in the southern extremity
                                    of 
                                        Jackson County
                                    , where I found some Lutheran families from 
                                        North Carolina
                                    . A minister residing in or near 
                                        Jonesborough
                                    , would consider this as one of his preaching places. April 9th, I
                                    attended according to appointment, in Union church, and preached Mrs.
                                    Lehty's funeral. On Sunday, April 10th, my appointment was in St.
                                    John's church, where I officiated in both languages, and informed the
                                    people that by Divine permission, the Lord's Supper would be administered
                                    in the same place next Sunday.
                        Desirous to visit some German settlements in 
                                        Missouri
                                    , I crossed the Mississippi river, April 12th. At
                                    Major Bullinger's it was stated that a young German minister had been
                                    laboring among the people for two or three years past, and that they were well
                                    pleased with him. Not wishing to make appointments without his knowledge, I inquired
                                    for his place of residence, and set out to visit him. After crossing the Castor, I
                                    rode near to the St. Francis river, about sixty miles west of
                                    the 
                                        Missouri
                                    , in 
                                        Wayne County
                                    , Mo. before I found the Rev. F. Picker. He informed me that he had
                                    attached himself to the 
                                        Tennessee
                                     Conference, attended to eight or nine different settlements, and
                                    received 75 or 80 dollars a year for his services. Mr. P. is a regularly educated
                                    German, a man of popular talents and industrious habits, well spoken of by his
                                    parishoners. Twenty miles farther west, beyond the St. Francis
                                    river, a Mr. Conrad has taken up his residence, who preaches
                                    occasionally, and calls himself a Lutheran, but is not so well spoken of as Mr.
                                    Picker. In order to reach my appointments in 
                                        Illinois
                                    , I found it necessary to return and move towards the east next morning,
                                    without preaching in this section of country. As far back as 1799,  Germans from 
                                        North Carolina
                                     commenced to settle here; consequently, at a time when the Spaniards
                                    had possession of 
                                        Louisiana
                                    . Girardeau, 
                                        Wayne
                                     and other adjacent counties, may be rich in minerals, but with the
                                    exception of some bottom land along the water courses, I saw little else than ridges
                                    of flintstone and hills of gravel. Earthquakes have frequently been felt in this
                                    region of country; and some years ago, New Madrid was much injured by one of
                                        them.24 At this time the current of emigration is altogether
                                    to the more northern counties in 
                                        Missouri
                                    ; hence the settlements here appear to be stationary, and are not
                                    increasing.
                        Late on Friday evening I arrived in 
                                        Union County
                                    . On Saturday I attended to the preparatory exercises; and on Sunday,
                                    April 17th, after preaching twice, I administered the Lord's Supper to
                                    between thirty and forty communicants. The season was solemn and interesting. The
                                    members of this church enjoined it upon me again to state their case to your
                                    Committee, and earnestly desire that a minister may be stationed among them, without
                                    delay. The collection taken and handed over to me, amounted to $9.45.
                        My last appointment in 
                                        Union County
                                    , I attended to on Tuesday, April 19th. Here I received for Missionary
                                    purposes, from Theob. Lentz 1 dollar; from Jacob Single 50 cts; from Zach Lyerley 25
                                    cts. and from some other individuals $2.20.
                        From Wednesday morning to Friday evening, I travelled 130 miles, in order to meet
                                    brother Haverstick in 
                                        Wabash County
                                    ; and on Saturday, April 23d, the long desired interview between the
                                    first Lutheran Missionaries in the far West took place. In the afternoon we attended
                                    to the preparatory exercises, inaugurated two elders and four deacons, and admitted
                                    fifteen new members, who had received religious instruction during brother
                                    Haverstick's six weeks residence in 
                                        Wabash County
                                    . During Sunday we both preached, and administered the Lord's
                                    Supper to about sixty communicants. 
                              
                                 24 In 1811 an earthquake centered at
                                                    
                                    New Madrid, Missouri
                                 , on the
                                                Mississippi River below the mouth of the 
                                                Ohio
                                             sent shocks along the entire Ohio River
                                            Valley. The earthquake began on the night of December 15, 1811,
                                            and a succession of shocks was felt for several days. According to one
                                            description, the ground around New Madrid opened at many places, emitted
                                            sulphurous fumes, then closed again, with a loud noise, throwing jets of mud
                                            and water high into the air. Rufus Blanchard, History of

                                            , 1883), 49.
                           
                                     Next day, April 25th, we laid the corner stone
                                    for a new brick church, and were assisted on the occasion by two Presbyterian and
                                    three Methodist ministers.25 The collection taken on this
                                    occasion amounted to more than thirty dollars. The members of this newly organized
                                    congregation, have also purchased eighty acres of land, intended for a parsonage.
                                    One of the brethren present promised to write an account of the important and
                                    appropriate exercises of this day, for the Observer, which no doubt, will be read
                                    with much interest. On Tuesday morning, brother Haverstick left 
                                        Wabash County
                                    , on his return to 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                    . The members of the congregation were very reluctant to part with him.
                                    This day, April 28th, I am attending a meeting of the Palestine Presbytery, in hope
                                    of receiving some information relative to German settlements. By request I preached
                                    the first sermon on this occasion.
                        In justice to myself and horse, I must rest a few days, and have therefore resolved
                                    to remain in 
                                        Wabash County
                                    , until the second week in May, intending to urge the brethren onward in
                                    building their meeting house.
                        During the month of April, I have travelled more than 600 miles, preached 14 or 15
                                    times, baptised 13, and administered the Lord's Supper to more than 100
                                    communicants. But unless some of our young brethren can be induced to come to the
                                    West and take charge of these new congregations, it cannot be expected that our
                                    cause will prosper. I would therefore in behalf of our destitute brethren, raise the
                                    Macedonian cry "Come over and help us!" Indeed the harvest is
                                    great, but the laborers are few. I would say unto our young brethren in the
                                    ministry, remember that we are not our own; we are bought with a price; let us
                                    therefore glorify God in our bodies and in our spirits, which are God['s].
                        
                                    Respectfully yours in the Redeemer,
                                    F. HEYER.

                  , in the middle
                        of March, 1836, Haverstick at least helped to organize the 
                            Jordan

                            Illinois
                        . Both Haverstick and Heyer were present when the cornerstone of what Heyer
                        described as the first Lutheran church built of brick in 
                            Illinois

                        Dear Brother—
                        From the information communicated by the members of the Palestine Presbytery, it
                                    appears that a few German families have settled in 
                                        Illinois
                                     above 
                                        Wabash
                                     Co., along the Indiana State line; but I heard of no Lutheran
                                    settlements in that direction, where, at present, congregations could be organized.
                                    Therefore, on Saturday, April 30, having delivered another message by request of the
                                    Moderator, I returned to 
                                        Wabash
                                     Co., and preached once more to the brethren who are engaged in the
                                    building of a brick church. The services were conducted both in the German and
                                    English language.
                        The first week in May, though not without employment, was a week of comparative rest.
                                    I spent my time agreeably and I trust usefully, in visiting the members of the
                                    congregation; writing letters for them to their friends in 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     relative to the Lord's doings among them; giving advice and
                                    encouragement concerning the building of the meeting house, &c. &c.
                        Sunday, May 8, I preached in 
                                        Mt. Carmel
                                     twice, and attended a third appointment in Centreville, between three
                                    and four o'clock in the afternoon. It is but just to state, that our
                                    Methodist brethren in 
                                        Mt. Carmel
                                     have been very accommodating in putting off their own appointments to
                                    let me occupy their meeting house, on various occasions. In addition to this they
                                    contributed liberally to the collection which was taken after the English sermon to
                                    aid our Central Missionary Society. (Amount collected—$7.25.)
                        After taking an affectionate leave from the brethren in 
                                        Wabash
                                     Co. I entered the State of Indiana, at 
                                        Vincennes
                                    . I found a Lutheran congregation of fifty or sixty members on the
                                        White River, in Davies[s] and Green[e] county. This
                                    congregation was formerly attended to by Mr. Moretz, a member of the 
                                        Tennessee
                                     Synod; but at present, it is vacant.27 I preached
                                    in the English language, baptised one child, and received $1.80. In 
                                        Monroe
                                     Co., three miles from Mt. Tabor, 
                              
                                 26 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, June 24, 1836.

                                     a Lutheran congregation is organized under the
                                    pastoral care of Rev. Eusebius Henkel.28 The people are engaged
                                    in building a two story meeting house, and have attached themselves to the Indiana
                                    Synod, formed last fall, by ministers who did belong to the Tennesee Synod.29 The pastor loci requested me to preach, and a goodly number
                                    attended on Thursday, May 19. The services were conducted in both languages;
                                    collection $1.62. In Owen Co., on the west side of the White
                                        River, Mr. Henkel attends to another respectable Lutheran
                                    congregation.
                        Travelling north east I met with Rev. Abr. Miller, in Johnson Co., who is likewise a
                                    member of the Indiana, 
                                        Tennessee

                                    to Mr. Miller's charge assembled on Sunday, and I officiated both in
                                    English and German. Collection $1.62.
                        Continuing to travel north, I passed through 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , and met Br. Abr. Reck on Monday afternoon, in sight of his dwelling,
                                    as he was returning from an appointment 
                              
                                 28 The Henkels were among the most prominent families
                                            in early Lutheran church history. Paul Henkel, probably the best known of
                                            the family, was a Lutheran minister who served in 
                                                North Carolina
                                             and 
                                                Virginia
                                             and who helped to organize the 
                                    North Carolina, Tennessee
                                 , and 
                                                Ohio
                                             synods. Five of his six sons became Lutheran ministers. His
                                            grandson, Eusebius S., also a Lutheran pastor, served a number of churches
                                            in the Indiana area—including St. George Evangelical Lutheran
                                            Church near Edinburg and St. Mark's Lutheran Church of Whites-town.

                                            trend in the Lutheran church which tolerated differences of opinion on some
                                            confessional and practical matters, advocated adjustment to American customs
                                            and the English language, and believed in union among Lutherans for the
                                            purposes of work and fellowship. The Indiana Synod thus opposed the General
                                            Synod, which had been organized in 1820; the Synod of the West, also
                                            organized in 1835; and the

                                     he had been attending to in the morning.31 We had both been exposed to a soaking rain; but
                                    notwithstanding our joy was great when we met for the first time in this western
                                    region to shake hands, and sing and pray and preach together. Br. Reck has three or
                                    four regular preaching places, and preparatory steps have already been taken in two
                                    of the settlements to erect new meeting houses. I have no doubt our zealous and
                                    active brother will also succeed, by divine assistance, in collecting a Lutheran
                                    congregation in or near 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    . On Wednesday morning, May 25, I addressed an attentive little audience
                                    collected at the house of Mr. King English, mostly members of the Lutheran church.
                                    In the afternoon I travelled twenty two miles east to 
                                        Greenfield
                                    . After riding sixteen miles on Thursday morning I found brother
                                    Lemanowsky and his family about two miles from 
                                        Raysville
                                    , right in the woods amidst some of the tallest timber in the eastern
                                    country. But even here a comfortable house, well furnished table, clean bed, and
                                    pious company, afforded good entertainment. I tarried until this morning, when I set
                                    out for 
                                        Germantown
                                    ; where I expect to preach to-morrow. Brother Lemanowsky has no income
                                    as minister of the gospel; he preaches in different places through the country, but
                                    depends on his little farm and the practice of medicine for support.
                        In addition to the places I have named I would mention that there are Lutheran
                                    congregations in the following counties, viz:

                                     Co., north east from Jamestown.

                        The Lord willing, I shall travel south from this next week, and report in my next
                                    letter accordingly.

                                        Lutheran seminary at 
                                 Gettysburg,
                                                Pennsylvania
                              , came
                                        to 
                                            Indianapolis
                                        , Indiana, in 1836 and established nine Lutheran churches in the
                                        surrounding area. He later moved to 
                                 Cincinnati, Ohio
                              , where he established a Lutheran congregation in
                                        1841, thence to other communities in 
                                            Ohio
                                        , where he died in 1852. Roseland, American Lutheran

                        As far as my information goes there are ten ministers in the State of Indiana, who go
                                    by the name of Lutherans.
                        Rizer, Lemanowsky, Reck, and Huber, who have been members of eastern Synods.
                        Merkel, Moretz, Henkel, and Miller, who have been members of the 
                                        Tennessee
                                     Synod.32
                        
                        Many of the Lutherans in Indiana State have emigrated from 
                                        North Carolina
                                     and 
                                        Tennessee
                                    , where they have imbibed prejudices against every thing connected with
                                    the General Synod. On various occasions I have conversed with these people, and
                                    pointed out to them wherein they misapprehended things. However, I think it is very
                                    important that an understanding should take place between the Indiana Synod and the
                                    Synod of the west; and I am pleased to learn that negotiations are now pending
                                    between some of the brethren to unite these two Synods into one. The brethren Henkel
                                    and Miller are much in favor of such a measure, and I hope the object will be
                                    accomplished. Without this union some of the ruinous transactions which occurred in 
                                        North Carolina
                                     might be witnessed again in Indiana.33 May the
                                    Great Head of the church bless our endeavors to promote peace and harmony within the
                                    borders of our beloved Zion. Sincerely yours in the Lord,

                        Dear Brother:
                        After an absence of six months from my family, I arrived safely at 
                                        Somerset
                                     on last Tuesday evening about 11 o'clock, to enjoy for a few
                                    days at home,—where friends of [?] meet to share their mutual joys. To
                                    receive and 
                              
                                 32 Since Heyer states that there were ten ministers,
                                            it is unknown why he mentions only eight.

                                            , formed in 1803, participated in the founding of the General
                                            Synod in 1820. This association with the more liberal wing of the Lutheran
                                            church caused the withdrawal of the Henkels and later in 1820 the formation
                                            of the 
                                                Tennessee
                                             Synod, which was characterized by its zeal for the Lutheran

                                            between the Indiana Synod and the Synod of the West was not realized.

                                    "welcome home!"—has prevented me for a day or two from
                                    writing my monthly report, which I am now about to make.
                        As stated in my last, I bid adieu to Br. Lehmanowsky on the 28th of May. At parting
                                    he wished me God speed and put into my hand five dollars, to be applied to
                                    missionary purposes. May 29th, I preached in a new brick church, the property of the

                                    were not as many people present as otherwise would have been. A few individuals
                                    contributed $1.7 cts. This Congregation which consists almost exclusively

                                        Ohio
                                    , about 36 miles from 
                                        Germantown
                                    .36 It was reported that Mr. G. had some idea of
                                    moving into this neighborhood, which would enable him to preach more frequently in
                                    this congregation. There are other settlements within reach of 
                                        Germantown
                                    , where the people would be glad to have a minister of our church, and
                                    where congregations could be organized. 
                                        Wayne County
                                     borders on the state of 
                                        Ohio
                                    ; the soil is generally rich and well adapted to the culture of grain of
                                    all kinds. Improved lands sell for thirty dollars per acre. One third of the present
                                    population belongs to the Society of Friends or Quakers. Monday, May 30th, I took a
                                    south course in order to reach my appointments in Harrison Co. Indiana. Two miles
                                    from Waterloo, 
                                        Fayette County
                                    , I found Rev. Mr. Merker, who was one of the first Lutheran Ministers
                                    in this state.37 Being well advanced in years, he is not able to
                                    travel and preach as he formerly did; and depends principally on a small farm for
                                    his family's 
                              
                                 35 This congregation was probably the present Pershing
                                            congregation near 
                                                Richmond
                                            , Indiana. Possibly the oldest Lutheran parish in continuous
                                            existence in Indiana, the church at Pershing was founded around 1822. See

                                            Indiana line as part of his parish. He was probably instrumental in the
                                            formation of the congregation at Pershing. Ibid.; Willard

                                    services, except what a certain Uhnholz, or Hohnholz is doing among them.38 My previous appointment in

                                     however would not admit of my staying. Six miles east from Edinburgh, a

                                    minister. Enquire for Mr. George Werner.

                                    supplied with a Moravian minister, whose name I do not now recollect. I heard of
                                    some other scattered German families in 
                                        Bartholomew County
                                    , but as far as I had time to go, I found no settlements where
                                    congregations could be formed at present.
                        Near Rockford, a village in

                                    Europeans, who are very desirous to have a minister stationed among them. Brother
                                    Rizer lately visited this settlement and administered the Lord's Supper to
                                    the people. Enquire for Mr. Mathias Freihoffer, or for Mr. Bruener. Friday, June 3,
                                    I arrived in

                                    , having been exposed to the rain more or less every day for two weeks.
                                    Br. Rizer accompanied me the same evening to Mr. Nagle, four miles from town. We
                                    likewise visited Rev. Mr. Moretz, a member of the

                                     Synod, who has resided for a number of years in the state of Indiana.
                                    He also depends on his farm for a support. June 4th, Br. Rizer and myself rode to
                                    Corydon, Harrison Co. where we were received and entertained with much kindness by
                                    Mr. Jordan and his family. According to appointment, I preached on Sunday morning in
                                    the Presbyterian church, in English, and gave a short exhortation in German. About
                                    three o'clock in the afternoon, I preached four miles from town in a
                                    School-house. Br. Rizer officiated in the evening in town. The week following was
                                    spent in visiting different

                                             in 1833. In addition to his activities in Indiana, Hohenholz a
                                            short time later served as the first Lutheran pastor in

                                            expelled from this charge for immoral practices, and still later warnings

                                     on Monday, met me again on Saturday evening, and on Sunday we
                                    administered the Lord's Supper to forty communicants. The season was
                                    interesting and solemn, although for want of a more convenient place, our meeting
                                    was held in a barn. The holy ordinance of baptism was administered to five children.
                                    During the week I received from an individu[a]l 25 cts; collection at the house of

                                    broken and hilly. The soil in the low grounds is a rich loam; the higher grounds
                                    consist of a mixture of gravel and clay. The timber consists of beech, poplar, ash,
                                    sugar-tree, hickory and oak. This county contains a considerable German population,
                                    who belong to various Christian denominations. Lutheranism has got somewhat into
                                    disrepute, on account of unsuitable men, who at different times have visited this
                                    section of country, and preached among the people as Lutheran ministers. But
                                    notwithstanding there are four congregations still in existence, which no doubt
                                    would greatly increase, if a pious and active minister were stationed among them.
                                    The people were quite anxious that Brother Rizer should take charge of this

                                    , who ought to be attended to. Monday, June 12, I visited Rev. Mr.
                                    Brandon, a young German minister, who has lately settled in 
                                        Louisville
                                    . He appears to be piously inclined, of pleasing manners, and more
                                    likely to succeed in forming a German congregation in 
                                        Louisville
                                    , than any one who has heretofore attempted it. A few weeks ago between
                                    50 and 60 communicants attended the Lord's table; and there are 16

                                     Elders accompanied me to this city on the 19th
                                    of June, where I preached morning and evening in Brother Lauer's church.
                                    The congregation in Boon[e] County, Ky. which numbers about sixty communicants,
                                    lately collected 18 dollars in aid of the Central Missionary Society, thereby
                                    manifesting greater zeal in this important undertaking, than many of our larger
                                    congregations to the East. Of this collection eight dollars had been sent on to the

                                    , or rather the Missionary Society, connected with his Church, has done
                                    still more. The treasurer of this society, Mr. Koenig, in accordance with a
                                    resolution passed, paid me twenty-five dollars, in aid of our Western Missions. This
                                    will appear the more remarkable, when it is recollected that a year or two ago it
                                    was thought that the church must be sold for debt, and the congregation be
                                    scattered. But since Br. Lauer has commenced his labors here, things have taken
                                    quite a favorable turn;—the congregation is increasing—the
                                    debt is greatly reduced, and a willingness is manifested to aid their German
                                    brethren who have removed to the West. It has afforded me much pleasure to become
                                    acquainted with some pious and zealous members of this congregation, and I trust
                                    that they will find from happy experience, what others can testify, that giving unto
                                    the Lord does not impoverish a congregation. Rev. Mr. Raschig of the German Reformed
                                    Church, who at one time was in the employ of the American Home Missionary Society,
                                    but at present is not thus engaged, still continues his ministerial labors in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    .40 Whether it will be practicable, and if
                                    practicable, whether it would be advisable to build up a new congregation, so near
                                    the old one, is a doubtful 
                              
                                 40 The American Home Missionary Society, the first
                                            home missionary organization in America on a national scale, was formed in
                                            1826 and was interdenominational. At first the society was largely
                                            Presbyterian in membership, but during the 1830s the Lutheran church became
                                            affiliated with it as did the missionary societies of numerous other
                                            denominations. The society did great work in spreading Christian
                                            institutions in the West and supported weak churches in all sections of the
                                            country. One of the first German missionaries employed by the American Home
                                            Missionary Society was Francis M. Raschig who came to America in 1834.
                                            Although he belonged to the German Reformed church, the Reverend Raschig
                                            founded a combined Reformed and Evangelical church in 
                                                Cincinnati
                                             called the Protestant-Evangelical-Christian Church, William W.

                                     case in my mind. The congregation who have Mr.
                                    Houser for their minister, and whose meeting house is in a more distant part of the
                                    city, inhabited by many Germans, I think will and ought to be sustained. If Mr.
                                    Houser should not succeed, an attempt ought to be made by some other suitable
                                    minister. Monday morning, June 27, before day I passed through

                                    myself; and on Tuesday evening I reached my present place of residence, thankful
                                    that thus far the Lord had led me on—that thus far his power prolonged my
                                    days, and rejoicing to find all well at home.

                        BELOVED BRETHREN:
                        In compliance with your request, I herewith commence to communicate to your Society
                                    such facts as I think will be of interest and importance to you. I entered on my
                                    tour on the 12th of Sept. I arrived one evening of the first week, at 
                                        Wheeling
                                     where I stopped to rest according to the Lord's command, on
                                    his holy day. This place, which is the general thoroughfare between the East and
                                    West, has already about twelve thousand inhabitants, and it growing fast in
                                    population and commercial importance. The number of Germans residing here is about
                                    600, mostly protestants, and the few who are members of the Roman Church, are quite
                                    liberal, and count it no "mortal sin" to worship with protestants,
                                    to read 
                              
                                 41 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, January 6, 1837.
                           
                                     their bible and hear their preaching, although
                                    the priest of this place, has actually, in several cases, FORBIDDEN his members to peruse or keep
                                    the bible which their protestant friends had presented to them. This, with other
                                    instances of ghostly tyranny in the Roman priesthood, has already induced some to
                                    exchange the Papal for the Protestant creed. The Germans here
                                    have, for several years, been under the pastoral care of Mr. Swartz, who came here
                                    as a layman, but through his own exertions prepared himself to minister to these
                                    people in holy things. When I came to 
                                        Wheeling
                                     he had not yet connected himself with any Synod, and of course, had no
                                    authority from any such body to perform ministerial functions.
                        But through the persuasion of myself and one of his Elders, he was induced to visit
                                    the Synod of the West and apply for license, which he did and was licensed by that
                                    body. He is a man who seems to love the spiritual welfare of his flock. He loves
                                    their souls and they love him. Among his people I found some of the Pietists of 
                                        Germany
                                    . They are persons who love the Lord in sincerity and delight much to
                                    speak of his name. They meet every Sabbath morning to learn the English la[nguage].
                                        …42 I asked them why, in their advanced age, they
                                    were so anxious to learn English language. They replied that they found among their
                                    English neighbors a number who loved the Lord, and they wished to be able to
                                    converse and worship with them. If all Christians were so minded as these people,
                                    they would, like the saints of old, (Mal. 3–16) "speak often one
                                    to another" of the things which concern their peace, teaching and
                                    admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and thus
                                    strengthen, encourage and edify each other in the service of their Lord. Mr. Swartz
                                    has so far preached in a school-house, but his congregation is now building a brick
                                    house, forty by fifty, which will be ready for use in a few months. In the afternoon
                                    I preached, by request of the Rev. Browning, in the Meth. Ep Church and became
                                    acquainted with a few English families, who belong to the Lutheran Church, but are
                                    obliged to go elsewhere to enjoy the means of grace. They expressed a great desire
                                    that a Lutheran congregation should be organized among them; but this I think,
                                    cannot be done 
                              
                                 42 Because of a flaw in the photocopy the remainder of
                                            this sentence could not be transcribed.
                           
                                     unless a man be stationed here as a missionary
                                    and be supported from abroad a few years. There are materials enough in 
                                        Wheeling
                                     to form an English congregation, but it will take much labor and
                                    patience to organize such an one as will be able to support a minister. I was told
                                    that not more than one half of the permanent residents of the place belong to the
                                    church of Christ. But in the West, it is not so easy to bring persons into the
                                    church as in the East. The fever of enterprise and speculation rages among the
                                    western folks to such a degree, that most are unwilling to devote any of their time
                                    and much less any of their money to religious matters. This is a fact which should
                                    be particularly noticed in calculating our prospects of organizing congregations in
                                    the West, and especially in the Western cities. Our congregations as a general
                                    thing, must be formed out of materials that are yet unoccupied, and of such there is
                                    a great abundance in the western towns and cities; but to bring them into proper
                                    shape and form, is a work attended with more difficulties than persons in the East
                                    generally suppose.
                        I would say the same things in reference to organizing an English Lutheran
                                    congregation in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     and also in 
                                        Louisville
                                    . It is to be regretted that those men, who have charge of the German
                                    Congregations, cannot preach in the English language; if they could, they might
                                    whilst they are tending to and supported by the German, also gradually raise English
                                    congregations. There is a vast deal of immorality in each of these rapidly growing
                                    cities, and if the Christian community do not co-operate with zeal and energy to
                                    stem the torrent of vice, and make their various moralizing
                                    operations commensurate with the demands of a rapidly growing and mixed population,
                                    there will be such a moral wilderness in these western cities as will be exceedingly
                                    difficult yea, impossible to change to any extent into a garden of the Lord. And I
                                    do most earnestly wish that the great Head of the church would enable by some means
                                    or other, our zion to do something in this great and necessary work.
                        In passing through the State of

                                    , I became acquainted with a number of our clerical brethren. I was
                                    kindly received and politely treated by them all. The ministers in this State, and
                                    in the West generally, have more laborious charges than those in the East. The
                                    congregations are small and they must attend to many to get a competent support.
                                    Some have charge of 7 and 8, and these at great 
                                    distances from each other, and the roads generally are very bad, and sometimes
                                    impassable. This makes their work arduous and very severe. The church of this State
                                    is already large, and probably destined to be as numerous as in any state in the 
                                        United States
                                    . It was divided into two distinct Synods, which meet separately twice
                                    in succession, and every third year jointly. An English Synod has also been formed,
                                    which is already pretty numerous and seems to be quite active in promoting the
                                    welfare of our destitute brethren in the West. They have lately had the Augsburg
                                    Confession translated into English, and also an English Liturgy prepared. They are
                                    also making efforts to supply the destitute in the States west of 
                                        Ohio
                                    . May the Lord speed them.43 The Theo. Seminary of
                                    the 
                                        Ohio
                                     Synod has already been the means of sending out some efficient laborers
                                    into this part of the Lord's vineyard, but is much embarrassed in its
                                    operations by a want of funds. It has now, I believe, 12 or 15 students. Professor
                                    Smith is highly spoken of as a very amiable and learned man.44
                                    His efforts to be useful in the station, which he occupies, are very laudable. He
                                    attends to both the classical and theological education of his pupils, and besides
                                    this, has charge of several congregations. The ministers of this State also complain
                                    that they are not able to find a sufficient number of young men who are willing to
                                    dedicate themselves wholly to the Lord in the Gospel ministry. And hence the
                                    desolations of our zion cannot be repaired and her walls not built up and
                                    strengthened. The

                                             in 1520, the Augsburg Confession was the first specific
                                            confession of the Lutheran church. Characteristics of the confession include
                                            objective universality, emphasis on personal salvation through justification
                                            by faith, air of reverent freedom, and spirit of catholic continuity. The
                                            Augsburg Confession became the confessional basis for most all Lutheran
                                            groups, and the major Lutheran bodies in the 
                                                United States

                           Beloved Brethren:
                        Before I proceed farther with my journal I would inform you, that I saw, at
                                            
                              New Lancaster, Ohio
                           , one of our brethren of the
                                    Basel Missionary Institution, by the name of Garver, who, with Mr. Metzger of the
                                    same Institution, labored a few years in the service of the 
                                        London

                                    , on the coast of Africa.47 Mr. Garver after having
                                    endured many trials and buried two wives, who fell victims to the climate, was
                                    obliged to leave this important field of labor, to forsake the groves

                                 47 The Basel Evangelical Missionary Society, one of
                                            the oldest missionary societies in the world, was organized in 
                                                Germany
                                             in 1815 and began sending out missionaries in 1822. The society
                                            opposed the narrow confessional distinctions of its day and was not
                                            concerned about the denominational affiliation of its graduates.
                                            Basel's catholicity was manifested in its close cooperation with
                                            the 
                                                London
                                             Missionary Society and the Church Missionary Society, the
                                            latter representing the evangelical wing of the Church of 
                                                England
                                            . Although the original interest of Basel lay in foreign
                                            missions and missionaries were sent to such places as southern Russia, 
                                                Liberia
                                            , the Gold Coast, and 
                                                China
                                            , the society also gradually developed the policy of assisting
                                            German colonists in America. The first missionaries from Basal arrived in
                                            the 
                                                United States
                                             around 1833. In 1834 Johannes Gerber, who settled in New Basel
                                            (Chilicothe), 
                                                Ohio
                                            , and Georg W. Metzger, who went to 
                                    Liverpool, Ohio
                                 , also came to America from Basel. Gerber
                                            ministered to a number of Reformed churches in 
                                                Ohio
                                             before moving to

                                    in whose service he labored in Africa, promising to support him in part until he
                                    could support himself, this advice he followed and is now in 
                                        Ohio

                                    that he might gradually establish himself among them. I advised him to apply to the
                                    American Home Miss. Society for employment, which after having heard the plan of
                                    that society, he cordially consented to do, and I hope and pray that this devoted
                                    brother, who has surely the cause of God at heart, may by the direction of 
                                        Providence
                                    , be placed in a station of great usefulness in the western and
                                    destitute part of our land. Mr. Metzger also soon lost his wife and then married a
                                    native mulatto of the colony, but was soon compelled on account of ill health, to
                                    leave this unhospitable clime and is now located in the northern part of 
                                        Ohio
                                    , but is much embarrassed and suffers many inconveniences from the fact
                                    that his companion is an African. It is to be regretted that American Christians are
                                    so apt to forget that the royal law is "love thy neighbor as
                                    thyself," and that it is written "God made of one blood all
                                    nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth." (Acts
                                    17–26.) We hope that Mr. Metzger, by preaching these cardinal, prominent
                                    truths of the Christian system, will soon be able to put away that unreasonable
                                    prejudice which now militates so much against his usefulness. I would also inform
                                    you that there has lately been a large society formed in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     for the purpose of opening free schools in the different towns and
                                    cities of our country for the benefit of emigrants. It has been discovered that most
                                    of the children of emigrants are made the objects of scorn and ridicule in our
                                    ordinary schools on account of their language, peculiar dress and manners, and hence
                                    many are prevented from enjoying the means of instruction which are extended to
                                    them. To remedy this difficulty, this noble society is endeavoring to raise funds
                                    sufficient to open schools, in which none but emigrants' children are to be
                                    taught, and in which the bible is to be a text book; and thus
                                    these neglected ones of our infant population will not only be made acquainted with
                                    the elements of learning, but also with the Holy Bible, and thus will not remain nor
                                    become the slaves of papal tyranny, but will become good
                                    protestants, good republicans,  good citizens and
                                    good Christians. It is expected that Col. Lemonowsky will be appointed general agent
                                    of the society. May the Lord prosper their philanthropic cause and make much good to
                                    flow from it.
                        From Boone Co. where the Synod met, I proceeded through the northern part of 
                                        Kentucky
                                     to 
                                        Louisville
                                    , a distance of about one hundred miles. In this part of the state I
                                    found no members and no knowledge of our church. Several times, when I told the
                                    people that I was a Lutheran minister, I was asked whether I was not a catholic priest, or a Cambelite or a former of a new
                                    sect. So shamefully ignorant are Christians in this part of the country that some do not know that the Lutheran is the oldest
                                    Protestant Church in existence; and others think that the Lutheran and Catholic
                                    Churches are the same. The latter however are somewhat excusable,
                                    for there are many works published which slanderously accuse us of holding and
                                    teaching many of the errors of the Roman Church; among these works is
                                    Buck's Theological Dictionary and a work of the same kind, just published,
                                    which is called the Religious Gazeteer, this work is extensively distributed in this
                                    part of the country.48 I spent several days with brother Yeager
                                    at 
                                        Brunerstown
                                    . It was a sacramental season, and one of great interest and much
                                    edification. An aged mother was received into church by the solemn rite of
                                    confirmation. Mr. Yeager is about relinquishing one of his congregations and is
                                    opening an Academy in this place. The German congregation at 
                                        Louisville
                                     is under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Brandou, who became a member
                                    of the Synod of the West.49 The congregation has about 100
                                    communicant members and is about building a house of worship.
                        On the 12th of October, I crossed the 
                                        Ohio
                                     and [sic]

                                     and entered my field of labor, thankful to God for health and
                                    protection and especially for the privilege of

                                            dictionaries appeared every few years and apparently circulated widely on
                                            the frontier. Generally two volumes bound in one, the various editions had
                                            different though similar titles. See, for example, Charles Buck, A Theological Dictionary, Containing Definitions of All

                                    a detailed account of all my travels, but only a statement of such facts as will be
                                    of importance to you and for a full account of all my journeyings shall refer you to
                                    my report to the Synod.50 The first German settlement which
                                    deserves notice is found in 
                                        Jackson county
                                    , near a post-town called Rockford on the east branch of White
                                        river. The settlement is composed of about fifteen families of Swiss
                                    and some more families are expected to locate in this neighborhood—they
                                    live in a fertile land but are destitute of one who would break unto them the bread
                                    of life. About fifty more have been confirmed, which would already constitute a
                                    pretty large congregation. They have been in the habit of meeting every other
                                    Sabbath to exercise themselves in vocal music, and every other Sabbath for divine
                                    worship, at which time, they usually sing a few hymns, one reads prayers and a
                                    discourse out of a book of sermons. They more lately formed themselves into a
                                    society for the purpose of supplying the necessitous and providing for the education
                                    of their children. They are anxious to have a minister to preach to them in their
                                    own language and to catechise their children. They promise to furnish him with a
                                    house and with all things that table and stable may require. Money they do not
                                    promise for most of them invested their whole capital in land, but they ensure a man
                                    a good school, which would yield a considerable income. I would recommend this
                                    destitute flock in a particular manner to our German Reformed brethren. It is true,
                                    they would receive a German minister of any orthodox denomination, but as they were
                                    taught and reared in the German Reformed Church, a minister of that order could be
                                    most useful among them. Inquire for M. Feghoeffer or Bruener.
                        In 
                                        Marion County
                                     I found several settlements which have never been visited by a Lutheran
                                    minister and are quite destitute. One is twelve miles south-east of 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    . This settlement was commenced five years ago and contains between
                                    twenty and thirty families of European Germans. These, as a general matter, are in a
                                    deplorable state, they scarcely regard the Sabbath more than a day of sport and
                                    urgent manual labor. I rode a considerable distance through the worst of roads and
                                    high waters to visit them and preach 
                              
                                 50 Much of the text of Keller's report can be
                                            found in his biography. See M. Diehl, Biography of Rev. Ezra

                                            (Spring-field, 
                                                Ohio
                                            , 1859), 66–82.
                           
                                     to them, but because I could not wait until
                                    Sabbath they would not come to hear me, although by means of a sale they all know
                                    that I was in the neighborhood. It is high time that something be done for these
                                    people. They are generally in good worldly circumstances and some of them quite
                                    uneducated. This will undoubtedly be a difficult field of labor, but should not on
                                    that account be neglected. There are several other settlements of Lutherans in this
                                    country which have been visited by the Rev. A. Reck. This venerable father in our
                                    church came into this state last spring and lives within five miles of 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , where he found some Lutherans, whom he organized into a congregation,
                                    to which he lately added sixteen by the rite of confirmation. Through ill health he
                                    has been hindered much in his labors, but, if he should recover his health he will
                                    organize several more congregations.51
                        
                        I also found a settlement of American Germans in 
                                        Hamilton County
                                    , about five miles North-west of a post-town called Strawtown. This
                                    settleMent [sic] was commenced three years ago and now contains
                                    about twenty-four families of German descent, half of which are members of the
                                    church. They have no preaching of any kind, but are anxious to obtain a minister but
                                    cannot do much towards his support. They lodged here in the woods a few years ago,
                                    laid out their money in lands and have now little cabins to live in with a little
                                    clear ground to raise as much grain as will support their families. In one of these
                                    little cabins I preached to a large and attentive audience who were seated around me
                                    on rails, for they have no boards to make benches. They received the word with much
                                    readiness of mind and gladness of heart. After service I was obliged to leave them
                                    immediately to meet an appointment in the evening eight miles further. When I gave
                                    them all my hand to bid them adieu, they, with tearful eyes, said "come
                                    again or send us another," and with sorrowful hearts they seemed to gaze on
                                    me whilst 
                              
                                 51 On December 7, 1836, the Reverend Abraham Reck sent
                                            a letter to the Reverend Benjamin Kurtz, editor of the Lutheran
                                                Observer, describing something of his missionary work in the 
                                                Indianapolis
                                             area. On October 30, 1836, Reck had held the first services in
                                            a new "house for worship 30 by 35 feet, of logs," which
                                            one of his congregations had constructed just east of the Indiana capital.
                                            What had made the occasion even more interesting, Reck wrote, was that
                                            "our young brother Ezra Keller just happened with us, as Missionary
                                            of the East Pa. Synod, and preached and aided in the solemnities of the
                                            occasion, much to the satisfaction of the hearers. …"
                                            And he added: "I hope their edification too." Lutheran Observer, December 30, 1836.
                           
                                     I mounted my animal and rode away. This, dear
                                    brethren, is one of the greatest hardships I have to endure. It is painful to leave
                                    those who are hungering after the bread of life, as sheep without a shepherd. Often
                                    have I been able to realize the feelings of our blessed Lord when it is said of him,
                                    "that when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them,
                                    because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no
                                    shepherd." (Math. 9–36.) I was, at this place, a short distance
                                    from the Miami Reserve. This reserve is thirty-six miles square and contains about
                                    2500 Indians.52 I was told that there is no Missionary among
                                    them. I had a great desire to preach to them but could not make it suit to do so.
                                    There are many French traders among them, who have amalgamated with them by marriage
                                    and have much degraded them both physically and morally. It is indeed deplorable to
                                    hear how these noble-minded children of the forest have been demoralized, instead of
                                    improved by the white people. These traders give them so much liquor as will
                                    intoxicate them and then defraud them in a most shameful manner. Every vice they
                                    teach them. Many species of wickedness of which the Indians know nothing, these
                                    traders introduce among them, and at the same time are devoted beadsmen and have
                                    their god hanging on their breast in the form of a crucifix. This is a very noble
                                    tribe of Indians. They have a very friendly disposition, and indeed would be happy
                                    if it were not for the spirituous liquors in their reach of which they are so very
                                    fond. Every thing they see, seems to delight them. They are continually smiling and
                                    talking. O that they were converted to God and had his love shed abroad in their
                                    hearts, what an amiable, cheerful, happy race of men they would be!
                        I have another station to point out to you, which deserves attention. It is a
                                    post-town on the 
                                        Wabash
                                     called 
                              
                                 52 By a series of treaties which were negotiated
                                            during- the early decades of the nineteenth century, Indians in Indiana
                                            relinquished title to most of their lands in the Hoosier State. The Miami
                                            Indians, however, retained a large reservation in north central
                                            Indiana—with present day 
                                                Kokomo
                                             as its approximate center—for many years. They held
                                            tenaciously to this reservation until the final cession of their title in
                                            1840. Keller's estimate as to the number of Indians on the reserve
                                            in 1836 may be somewhat exaggerated. See John D. Barnhart and Donald F.

                                     Attica. Here are about twelve members of our
                                    church and some of the German Reformed church, who wish to be organized into one
                                    congregation by a minister of either of these two churches. The town is rapidly
                                    growing in population and commercial importance. There are five or six towns in the
                                    vicinity around, at each of which it is highly probable that congregations might be
                                        organized.53 The Missionary Board of the German Reformed
                                    Church has been applied to for a Missionary, and if they do not furnish them one,
                                    our church should endeavor to do so. With the aid of $150 from a
                                    Missionary Society a man might be supported here for the first year and perhaps
                                    after that he would not need foreign aid. Inquire for Messrs W. Hoffman and Uhler.
                                    Thus far I have acted the part of an exploring missionary, but in a few days I
                                    expect to leave this state and enter upon trodden ground in 
                                        Illinois
                                    . The roads are very bad and waters high. Thus far the Lord has brought
                                    me safely, whereof I am glad and thankful. Pray for me, dear brethren, that the Lord
                                    may spare my life and health amidst the many dangers which I have to encounter and
                                    that he may prosper his cause in the hands of his unworthy servant and of your

                           Beloved brethren,—
                        From Attica I went by way of 
                                        Covington
                                    , twenty one miles down the 
                                        Wabash
                                     to a post-town called Perrysville. In this town and its neighborhood, I
                                    found fifteen communicant members of our church who are all 
                              
                                 53 In his diary Keller relates how he went from 
                                                Indianapolis
                                             to 
                                                Boone County
                                             where he found a settlement about six miles southeast of 
                                                Lebanon
                                            . These people had been visited occasionally by the Reverend
                                            Eusebius Henkel. Keller continued from 
                                                Lebanon
                                             through 
                                                Boone
                                             and

                                             counties. Then he wrote: "The next place I visited was

                                            . Here I found about seven members of our Church, who despair of
                                            getting a minister, and speak of uniting with other Churches. May God raise

                                 54 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, February 24, 1837.
                           
                                     able to understand English preaching. Some of
                                    these members are truly pious, and are very anxious to have a minister and are able
                                    and willing to contribute to his support. Inquire for S. Watt and J. Fultz.
                        On my way to this place I heard of a German settlement on Mill-creek near a little
                                    town called 
                                        Jacksonville
                                    , in 
                                        Fountain
                                     Co. These people I intended to visit but was unexpectedly prevented
                                    from doing so. Inquire for Mr. Meyers.
                        I have now through the kind providence of God, visited nearly all the settlements of
                                    destitute members, in this state, as far as I have been able to get information.
                                    There are some in the southern and south-eastern part which I did not visit, but
                                    will do so on my return.
                        In my travels I availed myself of every opportunity to get information concerning the
                                    moral condition of Indiana and the results of my inquiries and observations I shall
                                    now communicate to you.
                        I am confident that fully two thirds of the adult population of the
                                    state belong to no church whatever. These persons, who are properly termed
                                    Nothingarians, are generally not avowed infidels or scepticks, but are men who fully
                                    credit the Bible and manifest considerable respect for the Christian religion and
                                    take some interest in its promotion. Others and perhaps the large majority of this
                                    class, whilst they admit the divine origin of the Christian religion, care nothing
                                    at all about its promotion, injunctions or requirements. They are perfect worldings,
                                    spend all their strength in Mammon's sinful empire and waste their thoughts
                                    in buying and selling and getting gain. Others are grossly immoral and are running
                                    fast to perdition. The religious class of the community is very much divided. The
                                    Baptists are perhaps the most numerous and are divided into the regular, Cambelite
                                    and Dunker Baptists. The regular Baptists in this state and in 
                                        Kentucky
                                     do not deserve the praise which their brethren in the East do.
                                    Charitably speaking they are a people of whom it is hard to say good things. They
                                    exert an influence, and a powerful influence, which is decidedly detrimental to the
                                    moral welfare of Indiana. They discourage all those schemes of doing good which
                                    characterize the present glorious age. Bible, Tract and Temperance Societies they
                                    hate with a perfect hatred. To subscribe a temperance pledge is a crime sufficiently
                                    heinous to expel any member from the  church. In
                                    many places they have formed societies for the express purpose of suppressing these
                                    wicked plans of doing good. In their estimation a missionary is a perfect scoundrel,
                                    a base villain—a pest to human society. The Sabbath of the Lord they
                                    totally disregard and an educated ministry they will not have. The character of the
                                    Cambelite and Dunker Baptists in the West is the same as in the East.
                        The Methodists rank next to the Baptists in number. They have displayed a laudable
                                    degree of zeal and enterprize in building up churches in every part of this state.
                                    In every village and neighborhood almost, is found a society of Methodists, but
                                    generally small. In this state there are more preachers among [the]m than any where
                                    else. Every town, vil[la]ge and neighborhood has one, two, three or four local
                                    preachers. In fact, in some places all seem to be preachers. Why this policy has
                                    been adopted I am at a loss to tell, I am sure it is not a good one. Among this host
                                    of preachers there are very many who are by [no] means able to discharge the
                                    important functions of the ministry. They wish to preach but cannot.
                        They are an object of pity to some and a laughing stock to others. The multitude run
                                    not because it is interesting, but because it is ludicrous to
                                    hear. The pulpit is made a stage of clowns, preaching an amusement and the gospel
                                    ministry an office of no importance nor dignity. The truth of these remarks is
                                    evident to all who are acquainted in this part of the country and it is a matter of
                                    regret to all who wish to see Zion prosper and her ministers respected that they may
                                    be useful.
                        The Presbyterian church is also pretty strong in some parts of this state. Many of
                                    their ministers support themselves in part, from the produce of their farms, others
                                    are partly sustained by the Home Missionary Society. They have several colleges
                                    established, which are under the supervision of able professors and promise to be
                                    very useful.55
                        
                        There is also, in this state, a class of Christians called New-lights, what they
                                    believe I cannot distinctly tell, some 
                              
                                 55 Presbyterians were especially active in the
                                            leadership of Indiana's early colleges.

                                                Presbyterians in Early Indiana (
                                                New Haven

                                            , was dominated by the Presbyterians during its early history.
                                            Barnhart and Carmony, Indiana, I, 273.
                           
                                     say they are people who wish to have a new creed
                                    but do not know how to make one which will abide the text of the Bible. In this
                                    state there are not many Roman Catholics.
                        The vices which prevail to the greatest extent in this state are, 1st. Sabbath
                                    breaking. The Lords day is most shamefully profaned. Often do I hear guns discharged
                                    when preaching on the Sabbath. To go to mill, to make contracts, to chop wood, to
                                    hunt game, &c, are the common employments of many people on the Sabbath.
                                    They do not like the practice of esteeming one day above another. 2d. Intemperance
                                    also prevails in some parts of this state and particularly in the country of the 
                                        Wabash
                                    . In the Eastern part of Indiana I did not discover much of this vice.
                                    In some parts indeed whiskey is not at all used. But in towns and villages along the 
                                        Wabash
                                     many groceries are found. These groceries are nothing but grog-shops,
                                    filthy sinks of sin, the wretched hovels of vice. In some villages containing about
                                    three or four hundred souls I have counted six and seven groceries. In the morning
                                    you see scores flocking thither like so many thirsty swine to their troughs. In the
                                    evening you hear the muttering voice of the reeling drunkard, the sound of the
                                    violin and of the angry words of the quarrelling multitude. 3d Frolicking is another
                                    vice which prevails much in this state. Balls, cotillion-parties, &c, are
                                    very frequent. To these bacchanalian feasts old and young men, women and children
                                    resort. Mothers I am told, go with their infants on their arms, lay them down for a
                                    while and dance with merriment around the altar of their father—their
                                    god, the devil.
                        Alas! for them! for they destroy not only themselves but also their children. There
                                        [sic] gatherings are kept in some villages along the 
                                        Wabash
                                     with much regularity, in some weekly, in others semi-monthly and
                                    monthly. The whole live-long night are they heard thumping on the floor, too drunk
                                    to dance. In the morning the streets are filled with drunken men and perhaps the
                                    chambers with drunken women. These parties are the destruction of the youthful part
                                    of the community. They create luxury, indolence and wastefulness—they
                                    discourage industry and thriftiness. It is to be regretted that in many parts of our
                                    land these gatherings are supported and encouraged by Christians who hold them in
                                    miniature or with a better name when they call them religious  parties, or social meetings for spending an evening in
                                    friendly intercourse, when it is spending an evening in idle talk, courtship and
                                    spending money for luxuries which might have been thrown into the Lord's
                                    treasury.
                        The difficulties with which a minister of our church will meet in this state will
                                    arise firstly from the small number of members in one place.
                        Our members are much scattered about. There are not very many at one place and they
                                    are generally so circumstanced as not to [be] able to give much to support a
                                    minister. Many too, who have been living some years in this country, have lost the
                                    habit of supporting the gospel and of course, would contribute very sparingly.
                        The distances between the settlements are generally great and the roads bad. A
                                    minister must ride much and through the worst roads. I frequently travelled for
                                    miles in mud knee-deep and had myself and horse all o'er bespattered with
                                    mud and water. It will perhaps be more expensive for a minister in the West than in
                                    the East. Living at this time is an high as in the East. Clothing and horses will
                                    not wear long here for a man who wishes to do much.
                        A minister in this country is not so much respected as in the East, which operates
                                    against his usefulness. There have been and still are so many pretenders, persons,
                                    who gave themselves forth to be preachers of the gospel, and yet by their walk and
                                    conduct disgraced even the Christian name and much more the Christian ministry, so
                                    that the sacred office has been brought into great disrepute, and those even who
                                    hold it worthily do not command that degree of respect and influence, which their
                                    office should give them and which they must have to be useful. A man can not expect
                                    to be very useful in this community for the first few years. He must first show to
                                    the people his private character to remove their suspicions & gain their
                                    confidence. Among the qualifications which a man, who wishes to labor in this field
                                    should have, is much knowledge of human nature, to be able to awaken an indifferent
                                    people to the importance of religious matters and spiritual things. This cannot be
                                    done by vain declamation, but by reasoning with the people and addressing those
                                    feelings and passions of the human heart which will excite attention and interest.
                        
                        The people in this part of the country are also very fond of popular eloquence and learning. There is no community which execrate pretenders
                                    more than the western folks. As man should also be very well versed in the
                                    scriptures to support with divine authority the doctrines he preaches, for there has
                                    been so much wrangling and controversy on doctrinal points, that the people are not
                                    satisfied with mere assertions or with a small portion of proof, but they require an
                                    overwhelming amount of evidence and proof.
                        An intimate acquaintance with Natural Religion is also necessary. There are many
                                    persons in this community, who are perfect children of nature they have a good
                                    portion of native talent, of common sense, they have no artificial education, but
                                    are guided entirely by the light of Nature and place much more confidence in the
                                    teachings of reason, than of revelation.
                        To influence such persons, the dictates of reason and the lessons of Natural Religion
                                    must be mingled with those of the Bible. Let no one entertain the opinion that the
                                    weaker instruments should be sent to the West. This erroneous notion has been too
                                    prevalent in the ecclesiastical bodies of the East. If there be talent, learning and
                                    eloquence necessary in any part of the land, it is West of the Alleghany and in no
                                    place are eminent ministerial qualifications so much appreciated and so highly
                                    estimated as in this. In most places in this state a Lutheran minister should be
                                    able to preach in both languages, to endure privations, to suffer hardships and to
                                    labor with patience and hope amidst many discouragements.
                        Dear brethren, I cannot but recommend to your serious attention this state as a field
                                    which needs many efficient laborers. No state west of the mountains deserves more
                                    attention from the church in the East than this. The population is of such a
                                    character and society is in such a state that much ministerial labor should be
                                    expended here. Our German brethren are fast declining in piety and morality. The
                                    weeds of wickedness are springing up in every form and in frightful numbers.
                        If they be yet long neglected, the work of reforming them will be doubly great and
                                    tenfold more arduous. Already some have lost all hunger for worship and soon every
                                    door of access will be closed and they will be hardened people.  Now some are still crying for the bread of life, but
                                    soon they will cease to hunger and refuse to take, when it is appeased. Who will go
                                    to feed these lambs? Yes, the Lord asks, who will go? yes he actually commands us, like Peter to feed these his sheep and take care of these his
                                    lambs. Brethren let us pray more, that a way may be opened for each one of us to do
                                    something in this great work. Let us pray the Lord of the harvest that he may put it
                                    into the hearts of many young men in our church to devote themselves to God in the
                                    gospel ministry. In your prayers remember me, who, in the providence of God have
                                    been appointed to a work which I feel to be almost too great for me, after the flesh
                                    become unwilling and the spirit faint in this arduous task, but I have hope in the
                                    all-sustaining grace of God. Jesus hath said, "I will be with you"
                                    and so far I have realized his promise. May the Lord prosper you.
                        
                                    Yours with much affection,

                           Dear Brethren,—
                        After I left Perrysville, I entered into this state at 
                                        Danville
                                     and crossed the 
                                        Grand Prairie
                                     to Peoria on the Illinois river, a distance of 130
                                    miles. This journey I long dreaded on account of the snow and cold. But being
                                    blessed with pretty good weather and very good company, I made it as pleasantly and
                                    safely as could be expected. If any of you should ever be obliged to make this
                                    journey in the winter I would advise you not to undertake it without company. If any
                                    thing like a deep snow falls, no road can be discerned in these prairies and the
                                    traveller must guide himself entirely by the compass and one alone is apt to become
                                    bewildered. These prairies are very extensive, often in a distance from 14 to 20
                                    miles no house, no tree, nor shrub 
                              
                                 56 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, March 24, 1837.
                           
                                     is seen. The sloughs are also bad, horses are
                                    frequently swamped, as it is called in western phraseology, and
                                    one man is often unable to get his animal out of the mud. The cold also is very
                                    great on these immense plains and not unfrequently proves dangerous to the
                                    traveller.
                        The first German settlement, I found in this state is that which Rev. Hyer [Heyer]
                                    visited in the spring of 1836. These people live about seven miles north-east of
                                    Peoria on Farm creek. They were very glad when they heard who I was and that I was
                                    sent by a Synod in the East to visit them and minister to their spiritual
                                    wants—several with tearful eyes remarked; "this is not from man
                                    alone, it is from God. The good Lord led these men to provide for our spiritual
                                    destitution:" In this neighborhood there are about 50 families of Germans
                                    but most of them belong to the Ahmish Baptist church who, in spirit and practice,
                                    are like the Menonites and will hold no communion with other Christians. There are
                                    about 85 members of our church in this vicinity. I continued among them six days,
                                    visited most of the families and preached to them a number of times, baptised four
                                    infants and administered the Lord's supper to 29 communicants. I never met
                                    a people more hungry for the bread of life than these, and my joy in breaking it to
                                    them was commensurate with their hunger. So delightful it is to preach to hungry
                                    souls that I forgot the sufferings of my journey to them. They are very anxious to
                                    have regular preaching and would reward a man for his labor to the utmost of their
                                    ability. Their children are growing up without religious instruction and their dead
                                    are buried without the presence of a minister of peace to give consolation to the
                                    distressed and instruction to the living. When I bid them adieu they surrounded me
                                    weeping and asking most importunately that they might not be forgotten but soon
                                    visited again. The scene was one of great distress to my soul and I shall not soon
                                    forget it. Oh that Christians would weep more over the desolations of our Zion, then
                                    would the Lord raise up laborers to repair her walls and fasten her gates and make
                                    her glorious in the earth. These people formerly gathered every Sabbath to read a
                                    church-service, but a certain Mr. Staubus, a vagabond preacher, came among them and
                                    caused some disturbance, and put an end to this excellent practice. Enquire for
                                    Messrs. Gimmel, Koek, &c.
                        
                        From this place, I was kindly conducted by one of the members into a settlement about
                                    14 miles north-west of this on Blue Creek. Here I found 15 members and some more are
                                    expected. The people had not heard a sermon since they are in this country. In this
                                    neighborhood there are some Catholic families, who are quite liberal.—I
                                    baptised their children and they communed with us at the Lord's table.
                                    Inquire for Sciford, Brownfield, &c.
                        From this place I had intended to proceed up the 
                                        Illinois
                                     as far as Attowa [Ottowa], but on account of the snow and ice it was
                                    dangerous to go on horse-back and the boats have been stopped by the ice on the
                                    river, so prevented from going. At Attoway, I was told, are many members of the
                                    church from 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                    , who are anxious to have a minister. At Heniken and Black-Partridge are
                                    also some, which should be visited.
                        From this, I went to Peoria or Ft. Clark, which is one of the most flourishing town
                                    in the West. It enjoys the advantages of a very fertile vicinity, and of a stream
                                    that is navigable eight months in a year, and is undoubtedly destined to be very
                                    great in population and commercial importance. Here I found 20 communicant
                                    members—some from the East and some from 
                                        Germany
                                    . They are very anxious to have a minister who can preach in both
                                    languages and offer to contribute very liberally to his support. A man of suitable
                                    qualification located at this place and preaching for the two settlements already
                                    mentioned, would have a large field of usefulness before him and undoubtedly find a
                                    sufficiency of temporal support. The tide of emigration to this place and the
                                    surrounding country is extraordinary. House, smoke-house, and shop are filled with
                                    families. A room of ten feet square rents for seven and eight dollars. Every thing
                                    is so crowded with people that it is difficult for travellers to get lodging.
                                    Inquire for Meyer, Miller, &c. Peoria has 1500 inhabitants.
                        From Peoria I proceeded down the 
                                        Illinois
                                     to 
                                        Pekin
                                    . This place contains a population of 500, but does not enjoy regular
                                    preaching and wickedness prevails. I found only two Lutheran families here. Enquire
                                    for the firm of Henkle & Rupert. I found a small German settlement 96 miles
                                    northeast of this, on Mackinaw river. Here I found 15 members,
                                    but only 9 appeared at the Lord's table. These were vis[i]ted by the Rev.
                                    Hyer last spring. In this neighborhood, which, 
                                    in the course of time will be an earthly paradise, I found many good people of
                                    different Christian denominations. Enquire for Weirick or Shaumlefel.
                        From this place I went by way of Lewistown, to Beards-town, a distance of 80 miles.
                                    At this place, I was much surprised to find the Rev. F. W. Bolenius who was formerly
                                    a fellow-student with us. He came to this place last July, with his family, and
                                    became the pastor of the Germans in 
                                        Beardstown
                                     and its vicinity—has been very much afflicted with
                                    sickness—lost his wife and two children, the whole amount of his family,
                                    by death. He has organized two congregations—one in the town containing
                                    42 communicants—and one in the country, containing 31 communicant
                                    members. In Beardstown and its neighborhood there are about 240 Germans, adult
                                    persons I pray that our brother may be useful in this community for it very much
                                    needs the [s]anctifying influence of divine truth.
                        Yesterday (Sabbath) I preached twice, once in German and once in
                                    English—preaching was tolerably well attended —but scarcely as
                                    well as the slaughter-house and game-field, for there were about 400 hogs
                                    slaughtered here yesterday and how much game was caught I [c]annot tell. This is
                                    nothing unusual for this place in this season. Laborers get twenty-five cents more
                                    on Sabbath than on other days and thus for twenty-five cents they profane the holy
                                    day of the Lord, and surely [s]uch persons would not hesitate for 30 piecee [sic] [o]f silver to betray their Christ as Judas did of [o]ld.
                        Perhaps, dear brethren, you are ready to [a]sk me questions about the hardships of
                                    such [a] tour as has been assigned me to make. You may easily conjecture that in
                                    making [s]uch a journey many things must be done and [ejndured which are unpleasant
                                    to the flesh [a]nd grievous to the spirit. And were these [t]hings performed and
                                    suffered in the service [o]f any other being but of the Lord, I should much and
                                    loudly complain of hardships, [c]rosses and trials; but in the cause of Christ
                                    [t]oils become delightful and sufferings sweet to the soul of the Christian. To
                                    travel alone [t]hrough mud, and snow and ice and rain—to [f]ace the
                                    piercing winds of the prairies when [t]he mercury in Farenheit's
                                    thermometer is [b]elow zero, as it has been for the last two weeks,—to
                                    rest one's head on his saddle-[b]ags and his limbs on the floor of an open
                                    [c]abin, after having  been fatigued by a
                                    day's travel and exhausted by the cold—to cross large rivers on
                                    thin ice or shattered boats or to swim one's horse across rapid [s]treams,
                                    are things which are unpleasant to the flesh and trying to the
                                    spirits—but the thought that Jesus suffered ten thousand times more than
                                    all this amounts to, to purchase for us a crown of glory, makes
                                    all these sufferings comparatively delightsome.57 The greatest
                                    hardship I must endure, and the only one of which I am disposed to complain, arises
                                    from the spiritual destitution of our members in the West. To see settlements of
                                    from 15 to 30 families entirely destitute of preaching, adult persons become
                                    reckless about the precepts of the gospel and the salvation of their souls, and the
                                    children growing under the destructive influence of bad example and without any
                                    religious instruction,—to hear pious mothers complain with tears that
                                    they have no one to take care of the souls of their children—to hear the
                                    petitions of hungry souls who have no one to break unto them the bread of life
                                    statedly—to preach to such people awhile, ascertain their wants and then
                                    leave them, as sheep without a shepherd, is a trial which my spirit can scarcely
                                    endure. This is truly a hardship. It has given me many a sorrowful hour. Frequently
                                    I have been able to realise the feelings of the blessed Saviour, when it is said of
                                    him "that he had compassion on the people because they were as sheep having
                                    no shepherd." I must now close the present letter. Continue, dear brethren,
                                    to remember me in your supplications whenever you address a throne of grace and
                                    especially at your monthly meetings of prayer for the cause 
                              
                                 57 In his diary Keller described, quite graphically,
                                            many of the hardships which he endured while on his missionary tour:
                                            "In crossing streams, I was several times in great danger of
                                            perishing," he wrote. "I crossed the Kickapoo
                                                River where the water was ten feet deep. I sat in an Indian
                                            canoe holding the reins in my hand while my horse swam after the canoe.
                                            … At another time, I crossed the 
                                                Wabash
                                             when it had overflowed its banks, in a shattered ferryboat.
                                            Several yokes of oxen were on the boat; they became restless; the drivers,
                                            who were half drunk, commenced abusing them, and the boat was nigh upsetting
                                            in the midst of the river." Of crossing a prairie near
                                                    
                                    Urbana, Illinois
                                 , with a
                                            companion, Keller wrote: "We were both near freezing. It was a
                                            gloomy hour; I felt sick at my stomach; had great difficulty in breathing;
                                            was very chilly and drowsy: [sic] and yet I was afraid to
                                            yield to sleep. We could see nothing but the canopy above, bounding, in
                                            immense distance, the grassy plain beneath. We spurred our horses. My
                                            companion fortunately had with him a vial of the decoction of cayenne
                                            pepper. We drank its contents; and, perhaps, owe our deliverance to

                           Dear Brethren,—
                        In my last I gave you an account of the German settlements on the 
                                        Illinois
                                     as far south as Beardstown. South of this not many Germans are found on
                                    this river. There are a few families in Naples and Meridosia and Carrollton. The
                                    next large settlement of Germans which I found in this state (Ill.) is at 
                                        Quincy
                                     on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                    , about 150 miles north of 
                                        St. Louis
                                    .
                        In this town, which has between 1000 and 1200 inhabitants, and its neighborhood there
                                    live about 50 families of European Germans and more are expected as soon as the
                                    navigation on the 
                                        Mississippi
                                     opens. Perhaps the half of these families are catholics, and all are
                                    without the regular preaching of the gospel and the stated administration of its
                                    sacraments and ordinances.
                        Among these people there are many who truly love the Saviour and his holy things.
                                    Last summer a man made his appearance among them in a garb of a minister of Christ;
                                    they soon made him heartily welcome as a messenger of God, and sincerely thought
                                    that the Lord had remembered their wants and supplied them; but it was a deception.
                                    The man was a genuine minister of satan, a missionary of the evil one, it was the
                                    notorious Hohnholtz, who for his ungodly deeds, was deprived of a catechet license
                                    by the Synod of 
                                        Ohio
                                    . This is a most wicked and immoral man, he is given to every species of
                                    vice and gross wickedness. He continued among this people about two months, enjoying
                                    their kindness and 
                              
                                 58 The following letter appeared in the Lutheran Observer, April 21, 1837.
                           
                                     abusing their munificence. At last like
                                    Esop's fabled ass, he lost his hypocritical garb and appeared in his true
                                    form and character, namely, a vile, wicked, abandoned wretch—a man who
                                    used the most sacred things and the most sacred office to accomplish the vilest
                                    purposes and achieve the most vicious deeds. His base actions I will not mention,
                                    they are not for the virtuous eye to read, nor for the holy heart to contemplate.
                                    After having been confined in prison several weeks he was released upon promise to
                                    flee the neighborhood. The last I heard of him was that he had been in Vandalia and
                                    attempted to preach. Such men have done a vast deal of mischief among the Germans in
                                    the West. Indeed, when I look upon the havoc, which such Iscariots have made upon
                                    immortal souls, I am astonished at the long suffering of God which permits such men
                                    to live and so to act. It is a wonder that they are not sent to perdition at the
                                    very commencement of their ungodly career. Surely God is not man, else this would be
                                    the case.
                        Forty miles south of 
                                        Quincy
                                     in 
                                        Pike
                                     co., near a town called Atlas, I found six German families and also
                                    some unmarried persons. At Salmyra, sixteen miles from 
                                        Quincy
                                    , in the state of 
                                        Missouri
                                     are eight or ten families. The places which I have now mentioned
                                    constitute a large field of labor and of usefulness.
                        At Alton I found Mr. Rieger from the Basle institution, who, with Mr. Wall came from
                                    Europe last summer. At this place there are about 60 Germans for whom Mr. Rieger
                                    preaches every Sabbath. Most of the persons are without families and not permanent
                                    residents and therefore Mr. Rieger has concluded to locate elsewhere. He seems to be
                                    a man of the right spirit. He has already gained the confidence and esteem of the
                                    whole Christian community of Alton, and I have no doubt he will, if spared, be an
                                    instrument of great usefulness among his countrymen in the West. In 
                                        St. Clair county
                                    , near Belleville is Mr. Reese also from Basle, who has been in the
                                    country above three years and has organized a number of congregations in the county.
                                    What I have said of Mr. Rieger I could also say of Mr. Reese. He seems to be a very
                                    useful and excellent man.59
                        
                        
                           
                              59 Johann Georg Joseph Anton Rieger and Georg Wall, the
                                        two oldest students of the Basel Institute, were ordained and commissioned to
                                        America in 1836. Both were extremely influential in working among
                        
                        
                        At 
                                        St. Louis
                                     I found Mr. Wall, who preached for the congregation as supply and not
                                    as pastor, but I expect he will be elected by the congregation when they will make
                                    choice of a pastor. It is difficult to tell how many members this congregation has,
                                    perhaps between 3 and 4 hundred regular communicant members. Hitherto they have
                                    worshipped in the Methodist Episcopal church, but they intend to build a house next
                                    summer. On Sabbath morning I attended, in the Presbyterian church a Sunday School
                                    into which none but Germans are admitted as pupils. It contains at this time, about
                                    120 scholars and is designed to teach them the English language in order to enable
                                    them to enjoy the religious advantages of which ignorance of the English deprives
                                    them. Its design is very good, and our prayers are for its prosperity.
                        
                           
                                        St. Louis
                                     is a beautiful and rapidly growing city, it has already ten thousand
                                    inhabitants. From this place I had intended to go to St. Charles and thence up the 
                                        Missouri
                                     to Boonville, and then to the middle and southern parts of the state,
                                    but various circumstances brought me to the determination to close my tour and

                                    me are at present supplied and was not absolutely necessary for me to visit them.60
                        
                        It is true that the whole state of 
                                        Missouri
                                     should be travelled through by a Missionary; for I have sufficient
                                    reason to believe that there are hundreds of Germans scattered through the interior,
                                    southern and western parts of the state, which have not yet been visited. But this I
                                    cannot, at this time, do. The ground is thawing, mud is becoming deep, 
                              the German communities in the West, particularly those in southern

                                    time. I must therefore leave this important work for some other one to do, or for
                                    myself to do some future period.
                        I will now give a general statement of the moral condition of 
                                        Illinois
                                     as I did of Indiana. From the information I could get I would judge the
                                    former to be far in advance of the latter in respect to morality and religion. Many
                                    of the inhabitants of this state and particularly of the northern part are from 
                                        New England
                                    , and have brought with them that desire for intelligence, good order,
                                    good morals and improvements of every kind, which so much distinguished the states
                                    of their nativity. In this state, plans for disseminating wholesome knowledge and
                                    promoting morality and religion, are formed in great number and executed with much
                                    vigor and efficiency. Temperance, Tract, and Education Societies exist and operate
                                    in every county. It is somewhat surprising how liberally some congregations
                                    contribute to encourage these schemes of doing good. I know one congregation,
                                    composed in all of but 150 members, who give their minister $600; last
                                    new year, threw for a new-years gift to the Lord $600 into the Treasury
                                    of the Missionary Society; and besides this to support a general Missionary for the
                                    current year, which will cost them at least $400; to support a man to
                                    lecture on the Abolition of Slavery; and how much they give to the Education Society
                                    and other Societies I cannot tell. This is not the only congregation that
                                    contributes so liberally to the Lord but others could be mentioned with equal
                                    praise. And what should be especially noticed is that no congregations are becoming sa [sic] wealthy as those of the
                                    character just described.
                        In this state I became acquainted with several ministers of the Cumberland
                                    Presbyterian church. I was received by them with the greatest kindness. The friendly
                                    correspondents between the editor of our periodical and the editor of theirs has
                                    been of much utility. Frequently did I experience "how good and how
                                    pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." It is to be
                                    regretted that all Christian denominations do not forget their shiboleths and live
                                    in peace and friendship. In this state they have about 30 ordained ministers, 16
                                    licentrates, 1 Synod and 5 Presbyteries. They are  distinguished for their piety, humility and zeal. And these are the qualities
                                    which make them successful in doing good. It is indeed astonishing how fast their
                                    number multiplied.
                        Twenty six years ago (1810) the church was organized by three
                                    ordained ministers, and now as far as I can learn they have 1 Gen.
                                    Assembly—9 Synods—35 Presbyteries—300 ordained
                                    ministers—100 licentrates (catechists—and 50,000 communicants.
                                    They have also done something for Foreign Missions. May the Lord continue to prosper
                                    their efforts. The jerks which were formerly so prevalent in the
                                    West and so particularly among the Cumberlands are becoming less frequent. As this
                                    singular mental phenomenon is not known to most persons in the East, and as it is
                                    important for ministers to know it, I think it proper to give you a history of it.
                                    The person who has what in western parlance, is called the jerks,
                                    at once commences to swing his head with so much violence and frequency that
                                    spectators are astonished and alarmed. Sometimes females, who have the jerks, swing
                                    their head backwards and forwards with so much violence that their hairs crackle
                                    like a teamster's whip. This disease comes upon persons of every character
                                    and at all times and places. Persons who would curse the jerks, would get them most
                                    violently, sometimes at worship and sometimes in the field at work. They made their
                                    first appearance in the year 1800 in 
                                        Tennessee
                                     at the time and place where the great revival of 1800 commenced under
                                    the immortal McGready.61 What the real cause of this singular
                                    phenomenon is has been a matter of dispute. It sems to me to have been one of those
                                    demonical possessions which were so numerous in the days of the Savior and we are
                                    nowhere assured that they were entirely confined to that age but have reasons to
                                    believe that they still exist and not in small numbers.
                        
                           
                              61 James McGready, a Presbyterian minister of Scotch-Irish
                                        parentage, was one of the outstanding leaders in the great religious awakening
                                        which swept the 
                                            United States
                                         around the turn of the nineteenth century. Characterized in the
                                        West by camp meetings, mass conversions, and strange manifestations of religious
                                        ferver, this great western revival spread rapidly throughout

                                         and

                                        and camp meetings in the West during this period. They have been described, in
                                        much the same manner as Keller has done, by many other missionaries and
                                        preachers of all denominations. See, for example, ibid.,
                                        332–33; Buley, Old Northwest, II, 423.
                        
                        
                        Besides Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists, there are also some
                                    Congregationalists in the state. They have twelve or fifteen congregations and one
                                    association. This association displays in its transactions a spirit which is worthy
                                    of imitation by ecclesiastical bodies. They seem to act as the word of God and the
                                    voice of duty directs without regarding the frowns or favors of men.
                        This state has also a number of literary & theological institutions.

                                    time become one of the most important in the Union. Its natural resources are such
                                    as will enable a greater number of inhabitants to live in it than in any other
                                    state.
                        It has thirty two millions of acres of arable land and most of it very fertile. It
                                    has all the advantages of anvigation that a state could well have. The current of
                                    emigration into this state is very strong and hence it is highly important to build
                                    religion and morality early on a firm foundation in a state which is destined to be
                                    so important a one in our confederacy. It will also be interesting for you to learn

                           Dear brethren,—
                        Thus far I have come on my return to the East. Unable to travel farther on
                                    horse-back, I disposed of my beast at 
                                        St. Louis
                                     and we went on board a steamboat. But on account of the ice and low
                                    water we were eight days in travelling a route which is usually run in four. As the
                                    river is not yet quite open to 
                                        Wheeling
                                    , I am obliged to remain in this place and neighborhood a few days. In
                                    this letter I wish to communicate to you the result of my inquiries concerning the
                                    numerical strength and operations of the Roman church in the Valley of the

                                    . I shall make no statement without having sufficient data to establish
                                    their correctness.
                        In the Valley there are several papal diocesses, including the one at Mobile.

                                    congregations and 33 priests. They have a convent of six Jesuit priests at 
                                        Lebanon

                                     has 15 members and two institutions in this
                                    state. I have no data to show with any accuracy the Roman Catholic population of
                                    this state. Perhaps 4000. In

                                    out of Indiana and

                                    Mary" who have about 50 pupils and are putting up a fine building. This
                                    diocess has about 500 members.

                                    , established by bishop Du Bourz in 1822. Including the nunnery and
                                    school for females, the number of teachers and students is about 200.
                        3. A Noviciate for Jesuits under St. Stanislous in

                                     under the direction of various orders of Nuns. Their number of pupils I
                                    cannot give.

                                    .—This diocess as far as I could learn has one bishop with
                                    the usual subordinates—26 congregations—27
                                    priests—with several convents, female seminaries, asylum, &c.

                                    census of 1830, be about 71,000.
                        7. Mobile.—About the statistics of this diocess I could get no
                                    information, a splendid cathedral has been commenced at Mobile.64
                        
                        From the most accurate information I could get, I would judge the Roman Catholic

                                     Now it can be plainly seen that the Roman
                                    Catholic population is by no means proportionate to the formidable machinery of
                                    literary, theological and monastic institutions here exhibite[d]. All this array of
                                    colleges, seminaries, convents and nunneries is for the sake of proselyting. Upon the rising generation they have fixed their eyes and
                                    centred their projects and plans. This should induce Protestants to open schools
                                    themselves in which their children could be educated without becoming contaminated
                                    with the deleterious errors of papacy.
                        I have nothing more to communicate which would be of interest or of advantage to you.
                                    I would merely state, at the close of this series of letters to you, that in the
                                    West there is a large field of morals to be cultivated and improved. This field can
                                    and must be operated upon by two classes of persons in the ministry. There must be
                                    some who will enter into this field, who must take up their residence within its
                                    confines and operate directly upon it. But another class who do not live in the
                                    boundaries of this field. But still can do much to cultivate it. Those of you whose
                                    lot it is not to locate in the far West, can do much for this part of our land. You
                                    can do much with earnest prayers; for the prayer of the righteous man, when fervent,
                                    is effectual and availeth much. You can also do much by inducing young men to
                                    prepare themselves to preach the gospel. The want of laborers is the great
                                    hindrance. If there were only faithful laborers there would be wages; the Lord would
                                    give them souls for their hire and bread for their sustenance and garments for their
                                    clothing. There would be no lack of these things. I dont think there is enough
                                    fervent prayer and travail of souls on this subject among our ministers and people.
                                    I would also remark that those of you who wish to missionate or locate in this part
                                    of the land must expect to suffer some privations and hardships. You must suffer the
                                    taunts of mockers and the inveterate suspicions of good people who have been imposed
                                    on and deceived by wicked men. You [mu]st be contented with many things which [in]
                                    the East would be considered discomforts. [I] have seen ministers living with a
                                    consider[ab]le family in a cabin 15 feet by 20, the whole [in] one apartment. This
                                    was their kitchen, [th]eir parlor, their dining-room and their stu[dy]. Men, women
                                    and children lodge in one [ap]artment. But these things are easily  borne [w]hen the soul is full of love to God and to
                                    [im]mortal souls. I would once more caution [yo]u not to be deceived in the vain
                                    thought [th]at in the West, inferior ministerial qualifica[ti]ons are unnecessary to
                                    be useful. Those of [y]ou who wish to make the West your sphere [of] labor should be
                                    most diligent to get a large [st?]ock of information and much mental discip[li]ne.
                                    The latter is particularly necessary as, [it] will give facility in studying human
                                    nature. [A]n intimate and critical acquaintance with [t]he Bible is also absolutely
                                    necessary. In [a]ddition to these and above all these, deep [to]ned, ardent piety is
                                    everywhere necessary [f]or a man to be successful in the ministry and [p]articularly
                                    in the West. May the Lord who [c]alled us to the work, qualify us well for it [?] no
                                    make us strong in the power of his right [to] pull down the strong holds of satan
                                    and in[iq]uity and to save many immortal souls from [si]n and ruin.
                        
                                    Truly yours,
                                    ERZA KELLER.
                                
                     
                  
               
                
         
         
         
            Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation for Contributions to Indiana History,
                    1945–1974
            Since 1945 the American Association for State and Local History has annually given Awards of Merit
                    and Certificates of Commendation to individuals, companies, and organizations for their
                    contributions to state and local history. (For an explanation of the current basis for these awards
                    and certificates, see the announcement regarding them for 1975 on page 88 of this issue.)
            The roster which follows is an attempt to list all awards and certificates which have been granted
                    since 1945 for contributions to Indiana history. Though based on information received from the
                    Awards Liaison Office of the American Association for State and Local History, the listing is
                    probably incomplete, and it may contain errors. The editor of the Indiana Magazine of
                        History would much appreciate information about apparent omissions or possible errors.
            The cumulative listing for 1945–1973 indicates only the names and addresses of persons,
                    companies, and organizations which have received either awards or certificates. In most instances
                    citations indicating the basis for the recognition extended are lacking, incomplete, or uncertain as
                    to their accuracy; hence, none are given. The listing for 1974, however, includes the explanatory
                    citation. For subsequent years, either annually or at intervals, the editor plans to add new
                    listings in the same manner as for 1974.
            Publication of this roster should serve several purposes. First of all, it gives additional
                    recognition to persons, companies, and organizations who have received awards or certificates for
                    their contributions to Indiana history. Second, it is hoped that it will stimulate increased efforts
                    on the part  of individuals and groups to merit such recognition.
                    Third, it serves as a guide to the kinds of contributions which are expected from persons,
                    companies, and organizations which are considered for awards and certificates. Fourth, it calls
                    attention to one of the varied and important contributions which the American Association for State
                    and Local History makes to historical study throughout the 
                        United States
                     and

            Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation from American Association for State and Local
                    History
            All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and postmarked by not later than May 21, 1975. Each nominator must include a supporting letter
                    which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nominator is also
                    responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements directly to the state chairman. Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.
            1. Certificate of Commendation. The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of overall excellence in the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        Canada
                     as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."
            2. The Award of Merit. This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."
            Nomination forms are available from Donald F. Carmony, Ballantine Hall 731, Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , Indiana 47401. Mr. Carmony is chairman for nominations from Indiana for 1975.

                            role in the American Revolution and a key part in the creation of the American Union

                  the Indiana American Revolution Bicentennial Commission and numerous local groups and
                            organizations throughout Indiana have made plans for a variety of programs and observances
                            appropriate to the American Revolution Bicentennial; and
               
               
                  WHEREAS,
                  the Indiana General Assembly in 1967 enacted a resolution calling upon the Governor
                            annually to declare April to be Hoosier History and Heritage Month;

            This volume supplements Richard E. Banta's compilation of Indiana Authors and
                        their Books, 1816–1916, and includes some names omitted from the earlier period.
                    It follows the pattern established for the original volume, excluding textbooks, genealogies,
                    laboratory manuals, spellers, pamphlets of less than twenty-four pages, articles in periodicals and
                    serials, and "state or federal publications and addresses, unless the latter were obviously
                    intended principally for publication" (p. ix). An author was considered eligible for
                    inclusion if he or she was born in Indiana or had lived half of his or her life in the state. Since
                    this is a fifty year supplement, the authors had to have had at least one book published by 1966.
            The names of the authors are arranged alphabetically followed by the date of birth and death, if
                    deceased, and by a biographical sketch. Included also is a bibliography of the author's
                    published works arranged by place and date of publication. In Banta's volume 950 Indiana
                    authors were listed, and in Thompson's volume there are 2,751.
            In a study made by John Moriarty on the best selling novels between 1895 and 1945, Moriarty devised a
                    point system to determine which state had been most productive in this field. Only 
                        New York
                     state with 218 points surpassed Indiana with 213 points. Banta followed the same system
                    for the best sellers between 1895 and 1965. In the fiction category 
                        New York
                     state was first again with 460 points and Indiana was second with 288 points. In
                    non-fiction Indiana was in eighth place, but when both categories were combined, Indiana remained in
                    second place.
            The names and information about authors was obtained from academic, public, and special libraries in
                    Indiana; historical societies in the state; newspapers; and numerous

                            not for general sale. Indiana Authors and their Books,
                            1816–1916 has been reprinted and will be available free on a limited basis,
                            particularly to those libraries that did not receive a copy of the first printing. Requests

                     other publications. The inclusion of pseudonyms and writing
                    names in the present volume is an invaluable addition to the supplement.
            Thompson and his committee are to be commended for the present tome which will serve as a sturdy
                    crutch for libraries, collectors, and scholars engaged in research pertaining to Indiana. Since
                    hundreds of additional names have already been collected, it is to be hoped a second supplement will
                    follow this volume.

            Ralph Olmsted has written the first complete history of the second largest private institution of
                    higher education in Indiana. The Methodist school operated in the small southeastern Indiana town of
                        Moores Hill until World War I, and its only previous published history
                    (John W. Winkley, Moores Hill College: An Intimate History, 1954) included just
                    these pre-
                        Evansville
                     years. The present volume is only a modest improvement over the Winkley book in
                    describing the Moores Hill years; its major contribution is its discussion of
                    the heretofore unrecorded 
                        Evansville
                     period. The author nowhere clearly states the audience for whom he has written the
                    book; however, internal evidence suggests that he is addressing primarily—although not
                    exclusively—the 
                        Evansville
                     College "in group" (students, alumni, faculty, Indiana Methodists,
                    and 
                        Evansville
                     residents).
            The book reflects the author's experience with the school. His four undergraduate years
                    coincided with the college's first four years in 
                        Evansville
                    , and he has spent most of his adult years as business manager at the school.
                    Olmsted's narrative for the years after he arrived at the college is more dynamic than it
                    is for the earlier period. Also, as an administrator, he has emphasized the organization and
                    management of the school more than the learning processes.
            
            In many ways this volume reminds one of a college yearbook. Its physical dimensions are large; it is
                    lavishly illustrated (368 pictures); it was privately printed; it contains almost no footnotes (most
                    of the twenty-three footnotes are explanatory in nature); its prose is informal; it mentions a very
                    large number of people (including, for example, the successive chairmen of the Library Committee);
                    it gives much space to trivia (for example, "three American elms planted on the front
                    campus in 1922 died in 1969 and 1970," p. 248) and little space to describing the long
                    range goals and the evolving distinctive characteristics of the college.
            The major weakness of the book is its organization. Olmsted's unsatisfactory mix of topical
                    and chronological chapters results in duplication and fragmentation. Some of the chapters are too
                    short (2–4 pages); some of the chapter titles are imprecise ("Rough Diamond
                    Polished"); and some are misleading (the chapter on "Students" describes
                    only extracurricular activities). Also, many of the illustrations do not correlate with the
                    narrative of the pages on which they appear.
            The best parts of the book are the descriptions of the unique events in the college's
                    history: the move from Moores Hill to save the institution from demise; the
                    enthusiastic promotional efforts of leading 
                        Evansville
                     citizens—including Mayor Benjamin Bosse—to bring the school to
                    their city; the competition with DePauw University for the financial support of the Indiana
                    Methodists; the vocational pursuits and achievements of the alumni, including Vance Hartke and Frank
                    Milhous, the maternal grandfather of Richard Nixon; the contribution of benefactors such as Andrew
                    Carnegie and Mrs. Robert Lansing; the seriously debated proposals to merge the school with DePauw or
                    to convert it into a junior college, a municipal college, or a branch of Indiana University; and the
                    evolvement from being a small (400–500 students), largely commuter college before World
                    War II to being one of the largest Methodist institutions of higher education in the country by the
                    late 1960s.
            For many years the University of 
                        Evansville
                     has not had a record of its past that was commensurate with its age, size, and
                    influence, but now Olmsted's book fills this need. Those interested in obtaining a copy may

            William Downard's study of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     brewing industry attempts to demonstrate how one urban industrial enterprise can
                    influence the economic life, institutional development, and "tone" of a city.
                    Beginning with the establishment of the first brewery in 1812, Downard carries his narrative through
                    the growth decades of the 1870s and 1880s to prohibition and concludes with the revival of the
                    industry after 1933. Special attention is given to the influence of German immigrants on brewing
                    after 1840, the changing organizational structure of the industry, the impact of such technological
                    developments as pasteurization and refrigeration, the workers' attempts to unionize and the
                    brewers' responses, and common business practices designed to limit competition from
                    breweries in other cities and discourage price wars in 
                        Cincinnati
                    .
            Histories of this type are frequently less significant than they should be because authors fail to
                    place their studies in a broad perspective. Although this is not a major weakness in
                    Downard's study, it does cause some problems. Downard does not always successfully relate
                    his study to the general economic development of 
                        Cincinnati
                    . With the exception of the first chapter few references are made to other industrial
                    enterprises in the city. Perhaps it is too much to expect in a history of one industry, but
                    seemingly some general comments on the nature of industrialization in 
                        Cincinnati
                     and some comparative statistics for such factors as capital investments, gross output,
                    marketing practices, size of labor force, and the number of competing firms within each major
                    industrial group would contribute to a better understanding of the economic importance of brewing in
                    the city. This is particularly true for periods of growth and retrenchment.
            
            Downard is generally very careful, however, to relate the growth of 
                        Cincinnati
                     breweries to the development of the industry nationally, particularly in his analysis
                    of marketing procedures, volume of production, and unionization. By concentrating on 
                        Cincinnati
                    , where brewers produced primarily for the local market, he is able to draw some
                    interesting comparisons with brewers in other cities (Milwaukee and 
                        St. Louis
                    , for example) who competed mainly in the national market. These discussions are well
                    balanced and contribute significantly to the general history of the brewing industry.
            Downard's handling of the social-cultural impact of the industry is also excellent. He
                    discusses in detail the role of brewery owners in social and philanthropic activities, the cultural
                    contributions of the German population, and the influence of the Over-the-Rhine district and the
                    hilltop resorts (with their beer gardens, saloons, and entertainment) on the character of the city.
                    Downard concludes that the importance of beer and breweries in the social life of the community
                    peaked in the 1890s and declined significantly thereafter because of suburbanization and pressure
                    from the Sabbatarians to enforce Sunday closing laws. This analysis clearly demonstrates the
                    intricate relationships between economic activities and the cultural development in an urban
                    setting.
            The book is well written and carefully documented. It makes a significant contribution in the field
                    of urban history as well as the history of economic institutions. It will particularly appeal to
                    readers who have wandered through the old sections (those that have not fallen victim to urban
                    renewal) of

                        Louisville
                     in the early years of the twentieth century was controlled by a Democratic machine and
                    a local "boss" named John Whallen. The excesses of the city's boss ridden
                         government were sensationally displayed in the local and
                    state elections of November, 1905. In that election—one of the
                    "rowdiest" in 
                        Kentucky
                     history—the Democrats managed to overcome their Republican-Fusionist
                    challengers, but only, as a state court later observed, by sounding "every note on the
                    gamut of election crimes" (p. 89). "It appeared," Professor Clark writes,
                    "that the Democratic machine had thought up about every device possible for stealing the
                    election at the polls in the less reputable precincts in 
                        Louisville
                    . Rascals must have worked overtime in the saloons and brothels thinking up schemes to
                    prostitute the objectives of the democratic process" (p. 41). An indignant group of
                    business and professional men organized a protest movement that eventually succeeded in reversing
                    the election results in the 
                        Kentucky
                     Court of Appeals.
            This citizens' uprising or "reform" movement and its chief of counsel in
                    the long legal battle between 1905 and 1907 provide the focus for Clark's interesting
                    little volume. Helm Bruce was a respectable 
                        Louisville
                     lawyer, a descendant of pioneer 
                        Kentucky
                     forebears, and a man who somehow managed to oppose the state's three sacred
                    institutions of tobacco, horse racing, and whiskey distilling. Although Clark sketches
                    Bruce's career and describes his legal arguments in the citizens' case against the
                    Whallen machine, he has written neither a biography of Bruce nor an account of the reform movement
                    in which the lawyer participated, though he throws light on both. Instead, he has written an essay
                    on the historical background and the urban context that produced the heated political struggle of
                    1905. Not surprisingly, the work bears the mark of Clark's unsurpassed knowledge of 
                        Kentucky
                     history and his deep understanding of its people and culture.
            The book is not documented, except for a short bibliography, but it is obviously based on extensive
                    research in newspapers and court records. More careful proofreading would have eliminated a number
                    of typographical and spelling errors, but the author has written a useful introduction to a
                    neglected chapter in 
                        Louisville
                     history. Perhaps it will stimulate more sustained historical study of the
                    city's political culture, including a book on bossism and reform during the progressive
                    era.

            He was, even to his good friend David Davis, "the most reticent, secretive man I ever saw or
                    expect to see." And Leonard Swett stated: "He told all that was unimportant with a
                    gushing frankness, yet no man kept his real purposes closer."1 After
                    the opening of the vast Robert Todd Lincoln Collection in 1947 and the publication of a definitive
                    edition of Abraham Lincoln's works in 1953, President Lincoln's "real
                    purposes" remain so sufficiently hidden that he can be at once the touchstone for 
                        Lowell
                     Weicker's and for Richard Nixon's views of proper presidential
                    behavior. It would be asking too much of this volume's several hundred Lincoln
                    "finds" of the last twenty-one years that they reveal those long sought
                    "real purposes" and dispel the reticence and secrecy.
            As President Gerald R. Ford seeks every opportunity to dust off Lincoln portraits and sit under them
                    for photographs and as television warms up for the Revolution's bicentennial with a series
                    of specials on the only president who quashed an American revolution, one is reminded that the
                    efforts to understand Lincoln must go on. Roy P. Basler has spent his life trying to aid that
                    effort. His edition of The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln (8 vols., 1953) is
                    the basis of all current Lincoln scholarship, and it is the rarest of occasions when a historian
                    questions Basler's judgment in dating or verifying a Lincoln text.
            Read in isolation, the Supplement gives a somewhat distorted picture of Lincoln. He
                    seems overly preoccupied with Yankee inventions only because this volume publishes the letters
                    uncovered by Robert V. Bruce's research for Lincoln and the Tools of War
                    (1956). He seems extraordinarily consumed with the "same everlasting
                    subject;—that of filling offices" (p. 6) only because the more statesmanlike

                     and letters have long ago been published, and all that is left
                    are administrative fragments.
            Read as it should be, the Supplement fills in gaps in the previous eight volumes
                    and solves a few problems. The more perplexing ones remain. Was Lincoln, for example, a humanitarian
                    liberal who risked the nation's existence for the black man's freedom, or was he
                    Edmund Wilson's prophet of the Union as religious mysticism, an ambitious frontier Carlyle
                    who admired the hero in history? Basler features as his frontispiece a remarkable letter to Charles
                    Sumner filled with humanitarianism and concern for legality: "The bearer of this is the
                    widow of Major Booth, who fell at Fort-Pillow. She makes a point, which I think very worthy of
                    consideration which is, widows and children in fact, of colored soldiers who fall
                    in our service, be placed in law, the same as if their marriages were legal, so that they can have
                    the benefit of the provisions made the widows & orphans of white soldiers" (p.
                    243). Present also is Lincoln's thank you note to Charles Janeway Stillé, whose
                    pamphlet How a Free People Conduct a Long War Lincoln found "the best
                    production upon the subject it treats which I have seen" (p. 171) and which George M.
                    Fredrickson finds remarkable for its admiration of monarchy and its worship of force! Puzzles
                    remain, but the road to understanding begins with Basler's masterful editions of
                    Lincoln's works.

            Whenever one undertakes a study of the history of the 
                        United States
                     Army, the aspect most difficult to cover, in many ways, has been the Indian wars during
                    the thirty-five years after the Civil War. A great amount of material has been available, but
                    accounts have tended to be one sided, incomplete, incorrect, and biased. It has seemed that many of
                    those who have set out to write about the army and the  Indian
                    have done so as a matter of special pleading to establish or rehabilitate some reputations while
                    destroying others, to justify or to attack some policy, or to develop some preconceived lesson.
                    Robert M. Utley has taken a major step to fill that gap. We now have a chronicle and an analysis of
                    the Indian wars to equal those of the other major operations of the army.
            Beginning with a clear explanation of the army's administrative, territorial, and tactical
                    organization as well as a description of its arms, uniforms, and equipment, the book sets a proper
                    stage for the narrative of action in the West. Here, unlike too many military histories, the reader
                    is kept aware throughout of the problems of supply and transportation in mounting and sustaining
                    campaigns over the vast distances of the Great Plains and the western mountains. In the account of
                    the conquest of the Sioux, 1876–1881, this recurring theme is noted thus: "But
                    once again the campaign demonstrated truths that so often eluded the frontier generals: heavy
                    conventional columns rarely succeeded against the unconventional foe; the logistical requirements of
                    provisioning so many men and horses so far from their bases usually turned such operations into
                    exercises in self-preservation" (p. 271).
            All of the well known, old tales are retold with a detachment, an attention to detail, and a clarity
                    which provides new understanding and perspective, and scores of lesser known campaigns and battles
                    receive the same careful treatment. Undoubtedly some readers will immediately look for the account
                    of "Ouster's Last Stand." Appropriately this comes not under that title
                    but in the chapter called "Sitting Bull." The battle comes out the same way, but
                    the explanation is clearer and rings truer than in many longer volumes on the subject.
            To an extent Utley joins the line of critics of Congress, such as Emory Upton and Frederic L.
                    Huidekoper, for the military unpreparedness of the 
                        United States
                    . But his is a more solid position, for his criticism is in terms of the actual
                    requirements of the frontier, not in terms of the potential of a war against 
                        Spain
                     or an attack by a major European power. Consciously avoiding the stereotypes of
                    nobleness or savagery on either side, Utley gives the most balanced and probably  the best general survey of the Indian Wars that one is likely to find.
                    He concludes: 
                        Thus the frontier army was not, as many of its leaders saw it, the heroic vanguard of
                            civilization, crushing the savages and opening the West to settlers. Still less was it the
                            barbaric band of butchers, eternally waging unjust war against unoffending Indians, that is
                            depicted in the humanitarian literature of the nineteenth century and the atonement
                            literature of the twentieth. Rather, the frontier army was a conventional military force
                            trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like a
                            conventional enemy at all. … In the process they wrote a dramatic and stirring
                            chapter of American history, one that need not be diminished by today's recognition
                            of the monstrous wrong it inflicted on the Indian (p. 411).

            There is a widespread belief in 
                        Wisconsin
                     that the state has had a unique history, that it has been a progressive state because
                    of "cheese, peas, and Germans." Many citizens speak with pride of the "
                        Wisconsin
                     Idea" as something that separates the state from others. Some say that it was
                    the La Follettes that stamped the state and gave it a claim to uniqueness. Readers of

                        : A History will not deny these beliefs, but they may modify them.
            The writing and publishing of state history has been regarded as a parochial pursuit by many
                    historians and as a precarious venture by many publishers. The teaching of 
                        Wisconsin
                     history is hardly flourishing though it is found in many elementary schools and
                    occasionally in high schools. Most of the colleges and universities in 
                        Wisconsin
                     teach Asian and African history, but only a handful offer 
                        Wisconsin
                     history. Consequently, it is not surprising that an earlier manuscript on 
                        Wisconsin
                     lay on one author's desk for over a decade, finally being published in a state
                    history series in 1940. During 
                        Wisconsin
                    's centennial year (1948) the Milwaukee Journal published a
                    popular history of the state which has been reissued several times. Nesbit's present volume
                    is the most recent, the most complete, and the most mature in 
                    its scholarship of the three or four volumes now extant, and it is likely to stand for a long time.
            Professor Nesbit, who teaches history at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    -
                        Madison
                    , takes a long view of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's past, places it in the Great Lakes geographic province, and writes it into
                    the nation's history. If more historians could see state history as national history in
                    microcosm, as he does, the role of state and local history might prosper instead of being regarded
                    as irrelevant by many. In 
                  
                            Wisconsin
                        : A History Nesbit covers the three and one half centuries of 
                        Wisconsin
                     history to 1970 in thirty-one chapters. He states that he is least satisfied with the
                    historical evaluations of the recent years. This reviewer found the final chapters least rewarding
                    of all.
            While this study of national history in a state laboratory may not interest readers in other states,
                    nevertheless they may find the following views of interest and want to compare their history with
                    that of 
                        Wisconsin
                    : the French and English empires left little behind them; the Yankee emigrants from
                            
                  New England, New
                    York
               , and 
                        Ohio
                     built 
                        Wisconsin
                    's institutions and shaped its early history; the largest immigrant
                    groups—Germans, Norwegians, Irish, Poles—have influenced politics more than
                    anything else, and their customs have largely been assimilated into the 
                        Wisconsin
                     culture; the legend of the La Follettes as innovators has been overdone. The author
                    even raises his eyebrows about the claim that 
                        Wisconsin
                     has been a unique state, or if it has, he feels that it more and more reflects national
                    norms rather than ethnic influences.
            The book is well written, and the language and style is informal and easy to read. It does not
                    attempt to deal with such topics as art, literature, or drama. Not even the Paul Bunyan legends or
                    the lore about the origin of "Badger" are discussed. The book pays little
                    attention to education, especially to higher education beyond the 
                        Madison
                     campus. Folklife, folkways, or folk beliefs that affected history receive scant
                    mention. There is a heavy orientation toward political affairs. Despite this, it is an imposing
                    volume, with hundreds of insights into the process of building the Badger State, and it has been
                    written without looking over the shoulder at any ethnic group, family, or friend who might think
                    differently. It is scholarly state history at its best.

            The central figure of this trilogy is a Lutheran pioneer missionary from Norway who, in August, 1844,
                    came to southern 
                        Wisconsin
                     to gather Norwegian immigrants into Lutheran congregations. J. W. C.
                    Dietrichson's eagerness to journey to America, Editor Nelson explains, "sprang
                    from the conviction that religious life among his countrymen in the New World was desolate, and that
                    the way to remedy the situation was to transfer as far as possible the Church of Norway to the woods
                    and prairies of 
                        Wisconsin
                     and 
                        Illinois
                    " (p. 21).
            Various factors combined to make that goal practically unattainable: Dietrichson's own
                    Grundtvigian theological background and impervious character, his lack of sympathy for the Haugean
                    lay religion approach of Elling Eielsen who was already at work among the immigrants, his lack of
                    real understanding of religious freedom in America, and his militant opposition to certain American
                    sects, particularly the Mormons. As a result, Dietrichson stayed in the 
                        United States
                     only six years, but during that time he did accomplish a great deal. He organized
                    several congregations (Koshkonong parish, southeast of 
                        Madison
                    , and the Spring Prairie church, north of 
                        Madison
                    ); he introduced the Sunday School movement among Norwegian Americans; he founded a
                    reading society and a library; and he provided a model constitution for Norwegian Lutheran churches
                    (Spring Prairie's constitution). He also was intent on founding a Norwegian Lutheran synod.
                    Although this did not occur until 1853, Dietrichson did lay the groundwork.
            The book is a trilogy. The first part consists of a preface and a concise and well illustrated
                    introduction by Professor E. Clifford Nelson. In the preface Nelson relates how the book came into
                    being; in the introduction he sets the  nineteenth century
                    background against which the Norwegian immigrant is to be seen, provides a biography of Dietrichson,
                    and gives an assessment of Dietrichson's contribution to the immigrants' life in
                    the New World. The second part of the volume is Dietrichson's own Travel
                        Narrative, carefully edited and footnoted by Nelson after he obtained a recent English
                    translation from Malcolm Rosholt. The third part is the Koshkonong Parish Journal,
                    translated and edited by Professor Harris E. Kaasa.
            For the student of American church history, especially Lutheran church history, the book is very
                    valuable. One notes, for example, the limited contact between German and Norwegian immigrants in the 
                        Wisconsin
                     territory and state, the more authoritarian type church government of the Norwegians,
                    and the difficulty Dietrichson experienced in maintaining church discipline. It is revealing, too,
                    that Dietrichson continued to be a controversial figure in Norway and demitted the ministry in 1873
                    after being refused communion by the recently appointed neighboring pastor, the Reverend Adolf Carl
                    Preus, on the grounds that Dietrichson was "heterodox."
            The book also possesses more than passing interest for any serious student of social, intellectual,
                    and religious history of nineteenth century America. Dietrichson did have a sense of
                    history-in-the-making as he penned his Travel Narrative and carefully kept the Koshkonong Journal. The book demonstrates, too, what significant contributions to
                    historical writing are being made by the Norwegian-American Historical Association, which has
                    produced fifty-three volumes in its forty-eight years of activity. If there is a weakness in the
                    volume, it is the duplication of narrative and detail in the Travel Account and
                    the Parish Journal.
