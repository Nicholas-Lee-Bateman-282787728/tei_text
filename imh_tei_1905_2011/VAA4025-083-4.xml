                    </placeName> were sometimes relegated to the back seats of public buses. In some cities railroad
                    stations displayed signs designating waiting rooms "For Colored." Numerous
                    complaints about the denial of access to public parks and recreational facilities were sent by
                    Hoosier blacks to the national NAACP office. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> a separate park (Douglass Park) and golf course were developed "for colored
                    people." When blacks sought to use facilities in other parks, authorities made it clear
                    that they were not welcome and refused to issue permits for such events as picnics.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Gary there were numerous racial incidents over the use of public parks. Park police drove black
                    children away from public playgrounds. In 1937 state troopers were used to drive blacks away from
                    public beaches. Another continuing grievance was the denial of use of hospital facilities. Blacks
                    were admitted to Jim Crow wards in the <placeName>

                    An 1879 law permitted, but did not mandate, authorities to maintain segregated school systems.
                    Following the increase in black population that began with the "Great Migration"
                    during World War I, segregation in schools as well as other areas of society tightened during the
                    1920s. In <placeName>

                    school systems were segregated. There were many complaints over the dilapidated and inferior school
                    facilities and the unequal educational opportunities for blacks in these schools. As high school
                    athletics became a subject of major interest and school pride, the rule that barred teams from black
                    schools from participation in tourneys with teams from white schools became an added grievance.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In 1933 Freeman Ransom, a lawyer and one of the most highly respected members

            <p>From the foregoing it is apparent that in spite of its northern location Indiana was indeed a
                    segregated society. Segregation in public education was authorized by state law, but other forms of
                    segregation and discrimination persisted and increased in spite of a state civil rights law that was
                    enacted in 1885 and never repealed or amended. The law declared that all persons were
                    "entitled to the full and equal enjoyments of the accommodations, advantages, facilities
                    and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating-houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land and
                    water, theaters, and all other places of public accommodations and amusement, subject only to the
                    conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all citizens."
                    Violation of the law was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars or imprisonment
                    for thirty days or both or by payment of a forfeit of one hundred dollars to the injured party.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the time of its enactment the law was generally a dead letter, so widely ignored that most
                    citizens were probably unaware of its existence. Because enforcement was almost entirely a
                    discretionary matter on the part of the county prosecutor and because nearly all prosecutors
                    hesitated or refused outright to act, it was almost impossible to get the law before the courts to
                    establish a precedent-making rule. On the rare occasions when a case was tried the law was given the
                    narrowest possible interpretations. In 1920 the Indiana Appellate Court ruled that an ice cream
                    parlor was not an "eating place" within the meaning of the 1885 law. In 1941 the
                    state Supreme Court ruled that requiring "colored persons" to occupy a separate
                    section of a theater was not a violation of the law and that the injured party did not have the
                    right under common law to sue for damages in excess of the amount provided for in the law. Most
                    blacks lacked the money and the will to prosecute seemingly hopeless cases. In the unlikely event
                    that a successful suit appeared probable the defendants usually preferred to settle out of court
                    rather than risk the publicity of a trial which might have the effect of opening their establishment
                    to unwanted black patrons.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For blacks the only answer appeared to be a stronger civil rights law with machinery for enforcement.
                    This necessitated action by the state legislature. Blacks were politically weak, but in spite of the
                    other legal and extralegal disabilities which they suffered, they could exercise the right to vote
                    without restrictions. From the time they first acquired the franchise through the adoption <list type="footnotes">

                    like most members of their race in the nineteenth century, were nearly all loyal to the Republican
                    party. In a period when political power was almost evenly balanced between the Republicans and
                    Democrats in Indiana, Republican politicians sought their votes and awarded a few with minor
                    political appointments. After 1896, when the Republicans entered upon a long period of dominant
                    status and the "lily white" movement in the party spread northward, black voters
                    and issues of concern to them were ignored. In the 1920s the close identification of the Republican
                    party with the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana caused many blacks to defect from the GOP and vote the
                    Democratic ticket for the first time.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The Great Depression and the relief
                    programs of the New Deal brought a permanent exodus of the rank and file of black voters from the
                    Republicans to the Democrats. After 1930 both parties began for the first time to seek black votes
                    actively and to nominate a few black candidates.</p>
            <p>From 1896 until 1932 not a single black candidate had been nominated for the state legislature, but
                    in 1932 both parties named black candidates. Two black candidates, both Democrats, were elected to
                    the lower house, the first Democratic members of their race to serve in the Indiana General
                    Assembly. In every campaign during the 1930s blacks from <placeName>

            <p>At the next session, after his reelection in 1934, Richardson with six other legislators cosponsored

                    At a public hearing before a packed gallery Richardson challenged his colleagues to follow the
                    example of other northern states and "put teeth" into the 1885 law, declaring that
                    denial of rights ostensibly protected by law was "unconstitutional, un-Christian and
                    anti-social." Few members of the House were willing to voice open opposition to the
                    measure, but according to the black press, they were under pressure from a lobby representing

                    even if the bill had passed the House. A motion to postpone action on the bill indefinitely by a

                    the House. In a roll call vote 43 members voted for the bill, 45 voted against it. A motion to call

            <p>In a speech following the defeat of his bill Richardson declared that the record of both political
                    parties in Indiana was "one of shameless exploitation of the colored vote and a brazen
                    insult to colored voters." He also offered a stinging rebuke to members of the black
                    community who had been reluctant to support his efforts. "‘Negroes have made
                    invaluable contributions to America,’" he proclaimed. "‘Why
                    in God's name should they cringe, fawn, and beg some one, possibly a foreign born, for the

                    elected to the legislature. During the single term he served he sponsored no controversial bills and
                    remained inconspicuous.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> After Richardson's abortive attempt in 1935

            <p>On the home front the most insistent demands of blacks were for equal job opportunities in the

                    treatment of the struggle for a fair employment program is beyond the scope of this paper, but a
                    brief summary will be attempted since employment practices and access to public accommodations were
                    often related.</p>
            <p>Unemployment among blacks declined as Indiana factories received war contracts. There was some
                    upgrading of the kinds of jobs held by blacks and some opening of training programs for jobs in
                    industry. These came about in part due to a voluntary program for the employment of blacks in
                    industry instigated by the Indiana State Chamber of Commerce and the Indiana Defense Council and
                    President Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order establishing a Fair Employment Practices
                    Commission and prohibiting discrimination in companies with war contracts. Probably the most
                    important reason for hiring blacks was simply the shortage of white workers as the labor demands of
                    war industries grew while more and more men were being called into military service. This situation
                    allowed employment of some blacks in factories formerly closed to them, and enabled other blacks to
                    take other nonfactory jobs as whites went into the service or found better jobs in war
                        industries.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>In their efforts to find employment in war industries blacks found valuable allies in the state

                    which was organized on the principle of incorporating all workers in a given industry into the same
                    union, had opposed racial discrimination in determining its membership, but local unions were not
                    always cooperative with national and state efforts. Entrance of blacks into factories and unions
                    also brought questions of social relationships. Eating together as well as working together raised
                    the possibility of "social equality," which working-class whites had long
                    resisted. In some unions blacks were excluded from all but the nominal privileges of membership.
                    They were told by white members that they were not welcome at social events and were barred from

            <p>Developments during the war years and protests such as the ones described above (usually isolated and

                    overall economic status of blacks and a growing black middle class made blacks more assertive of
                    their rights. It was a period of rising expectations. Among whites also there was a new awareness of
                    racial injustice and its incompatibility with American ideals.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Discrimination in public accommodations was but one of the practices to be eliminated. Other
                    objectives were fair employment legislation, abolition of segregated schools, and access to decent
                    housing on a nondiscriminatory basis. A weak, though much publicized, fair employment act was passed
                    by the state legislature in 1945, and a law abolishing segregation in public education was enacted
                    in 1949. However, it was not until 1963 that legislation creating a Civil Rights Commission with
                    enforcement powers in employment and public accommodations was enacted, and it was 1965 before a
                    housing law was passed.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile other, nonlegislative methods of ending discrimination and winning access to places of
                    public accommodation were undertaken. A small group of civil rights activists from the <placeName>

                    by a loose coalition of members, black and white, of NAACP branches, other black social and
                    fraternal organizations, members of CIO unions, and a variety of church-related groups.</p>
            <p>The NAACP had a long but uneven history in Indiana with periods of vitality followed by periods of
                    decline. During the 1920s, a period when segregationist measures were being strengthened, a vigorous
                    NAACP had successfully challenged an <placeName>

                    segregation in the public schools. In the depression years of the 1930s membership had dwindled, and
                    efforts at fighting discrimination had lagged. The failure of the civil rights bill sponsored by
                    Henry J. Richardson, Jr., in 1935 was attributed in part to the absence of a strong local NAACP.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The preeminent figure among civil rights activists in the state was Willard Ransom, the son of
                    Freeman Ransom. The elder Ransom, a lawyer, executive director of the Madame Walker Co., and
                    influential community leader, had become prominent in Democratic circles in the New Deal years. The
                    son, after graduating with honors from Talladega College, had attended <placeName>

                    War II he rose to the position of captain in the department of the judge advocate general. Most of

                    to drafting civil rights legislation and planning strategies, he was an activist. Because of his
                    activism, and especially because he supported Henry Wallace and the Progressive party in 1948 and
                    1950; he was vilified by some as a dangerous radical. Certain NAACP members regarded his leader-ship
                    as a dangerous liability. But in spite of efforts to oust him he was elected state president five
                    times in the years when the NAACP enjoyed its greatest influence and success in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    in Indiana because of its location in a city that was both the state capital and the city with the

                    of Robert Lee Brokenburr, the first black state senator and the most prestigious of black
                    Republicans. Jessie Jacobs, another Republican, who had sought nomination to the state legislature,
                    was an especially dynamic and indefatigable member of the board. Henry J. Richardson, Jr., continued

                    "We must show him [the black worker] by our good faith and our good works that his
                    interests, our interests and our country's interests are one and the same," said a
                    CIO report. At the state level a vigorous antidiscrimination committee worked for these objectives

                    bring about compliance with the 1885 civil rights law was begun by private groups. There were
                    meetings with the managements of establishments that barred blacks and with government officials in
                    efforts to negotiate with them to persuade them to observe the law. These were followed by
                    nonviolent attempts, usually by racially mixed groups, to secure service in the establishments. If
                    they were refused service, an appeal to law enforcement officials for help might follow. The

                    </placeName> movement and those in the border cities was that its efforts were directed at securing
                    compliance with a state law, whereas in the other cities there was no such legal basis. The
                    nonviolent direct action campaigns in the other cities were often accompanied by picketing and
                    demonstrations to gain public attention. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> there was almost no newspaper publicity except in the black press. Perhaps out of
                    deference to white businesses which might be embarrassed by reports of efforts of blacks to gain
                    service, the nonviolent direct action campaign was ignored by the "white" press.</p>
            <p>The most obvious targets of the movement were restaurants, lunch counters, and hotels. Motives for
                    ending discriminatory treatment in these establishments were partly ideological but also practical.
                    No doubt the most important reason for securing service at eating places (the right to sit down at a
                    table or a counter and receive service) was simply that educated middle-class blacks were fed up
                    with being subjected to indignities and humiliation and being treated as second-class citizens. In
                    the postwar years more of them had sufficient money to patronize the better
                    "white" establishments. Prevailing segregation was also embarrassing to whites who
                    could not invite black friends and associates to "white" establishments. The
                    United Council of Church Women, for instance, was reported to have canceled plans for a national
                    board meeting in <placeName>

                    </placeName> because the city's hotels refused to accommodate the black members of this
                    racially mixed group.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Discrimination was particularly burdensome to travelers. In urging the enactment of a stronger civil
                    rights bill, black representative Jesse Dickinson told his fellow lawmakers: "There are
                    hardly any drive-ins, especially south of U.S. Highway 40, where I can stop and get a sandwich.
                    There are more motels where I'd be denied admission than where I could get

            <p>The first concerted attack on discrimination in hotels and restaurants was made by the CIO. In 1942
                    when two member unions were forced to move their convention from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> because the Claypool Hotel refused to house black delegates, the state CIO had
                    protested publicly over the "vicious Jim Crow policies" of the hotel. In 1946
                    plans were carefully drawn for an attack on Jim-Crowism at the time of the state convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, recognizing, as the antidiscrimination committee put it, that this city "with
                    the largest percentage of Negro population of any city in the mid-west also has the reputation of
                    being one of the worst of-fenders against equal rights." At a meeting attended by trade
                    union leaders, representatives of Negro organizations, veterans' groups, and civil rights
                    attorneys, a strategy to break down discrimination in restaurants was planned. CIO representatives
                    first met with city and county law enforcement officials to ask assurances of legal redress if
                    service was refused. The police "flatly refused" to promise to make arrests. The
                    prosecutor grudgingly agreed to issue arrest affidavits. After the meeting CIO representatives
                    informed the Chamber of Commerce of their plans. At the convention volunteers were invited to form
                    racially mixed groups to seek service at six of the best downtown restaurants. "The
                    restaurants chosen," reported the antidiscrimination committee, "were not little
                    one-arm joints or greasy spoons. They included some of the fanciest in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    had to borrow money to pay their checks." In all cases the racially mixed groups were

                    </placeName> was still a key concern before the committee. An incident a few weeks later furnished

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials to enforce the law. The chief of police refused to issue a permit for a dance
                    for a racially mixed CIO group, declaring that it was his "personal policy" that
                    there would be no mixed dancing. The mayor, who backed the decision, was reported to have said that
                    his term of office was almost over and he did not want a race riot to mar his administration.
                    Although a judge issued a temporary injunction barring the police chief from refusing to grant the
                    permit for the dance at a downtown hotel, the latter avoided complying with the order. When no

                    that proved to be more effective and to produce more lasting results. A Civil Rights Committee drawn

                    table" which "happened" to be behind a screen. In other places the
                    crusaders were sometimes served but were offered seats behind screens or in partitioned areas. The
                    management of one chain of drugstores promised that in the future they would comply with the law,
                    but in practice they continued to refuse service until threatened with a lawsuit.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>The reluctance of "white" establishments to comply with the law and accept black
                    patrons stemmed in part from simple race prejudice and stereotyped images of the consequences of
                    interracial social mixing. However, a more important reason, though it was seldom stated explicitly,
                    was the perceived threat to business—the fear that black patronage would drive away that
                    of whites. One evidence of the apprehension aroused in the white establishment by the
                    "eating crusade" was the abrupt dismissal of Wilson Head from his position at
                    Flanner House. The excuse used to justify his dismissal is not clear. One reason appeared to be that
                    Flanner House stationery had been used by the Committee for Civil Rights, though without
                    Head's knowledge. Whatever the excuse, he was dismissed without an open hearing on the
                    causes. A letter written by William T. Ray, president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the NAACP, with the support of Willard Ransom, the president of the Indiana
                    NAACP, to Robert L. Brokenburr, chairman of the board of trustees of Flanner House, declared that
                    Head had been one of the most active leaders in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> against "second class citizenship" and suggested that his leadership
                    in the drive against discrimination in eating places might "quite conceivably have roused
                    the ire of interested parties." Ray said he sought assurances that Head was not to be
                    "victimized for his civil rights activities." Nevertheless, in spite of protests

                    discriminatory treatment, but the fight continued. Foremost among the fighters was Jessie Jacobs,
                    who temporarily took over the position of executive secretary without pay. In a letter to Gloster
                    Current at the national office of the NAACP, she deplored the unwillingness of most members of the
                    NAACP, black and white, to participate actively. "Truly," she wrote,
                    "about six people are actually carrying the load, with another six helping at
                    times." But, she added: "If I don't break under this load I believe I can
                    make NAACP mean something here. The dozen of us have sure raised enough H— in the city.
                    People believe we are 10,000 strong in numbers and cash. (Smile)."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>Some attempts were made to file suits against businesses that flouted the law. Public officials,
                    however, were reluctant to prose-cute, and there appeared to be no way under the existing law to
                    compel them to act. In 1947 the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> prosecutor was quoted as saying to a reporter, "I'm for the
                    enforcement of all laws, but this is a delicate question." He also cited the 1920 Appellate
                    Court decision that ice cream parlors did not fall within the scope of the 1885 law. Under pressure
                    he finally said he would prosecute, but he added that he hoped there would not be a
                    "deluge" of cases. When cases involving refusal of service at drugstore lunch
                    counters were filed, another prosecutor said that the law prohibiting discrimination in public
                    places did not apply to drugstores; an interpretation without any recognizable precedent and one
                    with which the state attorney general disagreed. Finally, in 1950 a restaurant employee who refused
                    service to a black high school teacher was found guilty in municipal court and fined ten dollars and
                    costs. But the judge criticized the man who had brought the suit for having waved a mimeographed
                    copy of the civil rights law in the face of the defendant, saying "the problem could not be
                    worked out by such methods."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>In some communities discrimination went unchallenged. At a regional conference of state NAACP
                    branches in 1949, an attorney from the national headquarters emphasized the need for action to
                    enforce civil rights statutes. A branch had a duty "to see that there is not segregation
                    and discrimination in theaters, restaurants, and other public accommodations." Yet branches

                    Negroes cannot eat in restaurants, live in hotels, or buy first class tickets in local
                        theaters."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Efforts against discrimination in places of recreation and amusement were carried on as well as
                    campaigns for access to restaurants and hotels. In some places blacks were simply refused ad-mission
                    to motion picture theaters; more often they were seated in segregated sections. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with its large black community, there were a number of black-owned or black-operated
                    theaters that showed the same films as the downtown "white" theaters that refused
                    to sell tickets to blacks. The presence of large numbers of black soldiers during World War II and
                    the lack of any kind of recreational facilities for them led to changes. The leaders of the
                    Federation of Associated Clubs succeeded, without publicity, in opening many theaters to black
                    patrons through negotiations with the managers of the theaters. In black neighborhoods black-owned
                    theaters continued to operate successfully. In white neighborhoods most theaters continued to bar
                    blacks, but this situation rarely caused friction. An exception was the Esquire Theater, the only
                    one in the city which showed foreign films. When Wilson Head, with the assistance of Willard Ransom,
                    began a suit after he was denied admission, the Jewish Community Relations Council intervened to
                    persuade the theater owner, a member of the Jewish community, to change his policy. The case was
                    settled out of court, but the negotiations and the outcome established a precedent for ad-mission to
                    other neighborhood theaters.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    dissatisfaction and complaint. In <placeName>

                    parks and one golf course were "for colored" and other public recreational areas
                    were for whites. In 1945 representatives of the local NAACP met with city officials to seek changes
                    in these segregated practices, but their efforts met with no immediate success. In 1947 the same
                    Civil Rights Committee which launched the "eating crusade" appealed to local
                    groups to use all city parks and recreational facilities and not accept segregated arrangements.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                    In 1946 two black girls were excluded because of their race from participation in the Ice-O-Rama, an

                    went to the mayor in protest, he told them that it was too late to do anything since the Ice-O-Rama
                    had already taken place. He was reported to have added that, "agitation of Negro groups in
                    certain cases in the past has [had] a corrupting influence on racial attitudes in the community and

                    </placeName> was Riverside Park, a privately owned amusement park open to white patrons only. For
                    several years the management opened the park to blacks once a year on Negro Day, an occasion used
                    for fund raising by black charitable organizations. As blacks became increasingly sensitive to
                    discrimination during the war, resentment against Negro Day and all it symbolized mounted, and the
                    Federation of Associated Clubs and the NAACP began a campaign to discourage blacks from attending
                    it. "It is hard," said the FAC newsletter, "for well thinking, liberal
                    whites, to understand a race of people" who would support campaigns to end segregation in
                    drugstore lunch counters, theaters, and parks and then "turn right around and spend money
                    to be insulted and to promote racial separation." In 1945 a boycott of Negro Day reduced
                    attendance to about fifty persons, most of them children. "Riverside Park's
                    ‘jimcrow season’ was dealt what may be a mortal blow," exulted the <placeName>

            <p>The boycott of Negro Day did not cause the Riverside management to change its policy of barring
                    blacks on other days. Signs saying "White Patronage Only Solicited" were not
                    removed. A fifteen-year campaign by blacks and sympathetic whites resulted in reducing the size of
                    the signs but not in eliminating them. The manager insisted that he was not breaking the law by
                    posting signs that said "solicit," and that his use of the signs was merely an
                    exercise of his constitutional right of free speech. Since the signs were not a clear-cut violation
                    of the civil rights law, the <placeName>

            <p>In the years following the war moves for nondiscriminatory access to parks were made all over the
                    state. When the CIO sought to hold camp schools in the state parks, it was refused access. The
                    governor insisted that the decision was not racially motivated and that it was state policy to limit
                    use of the parks to groups interested in nature study and conservation. But in many places
                    restrictions began to ease. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, a Mayor's Commission on Civil Rights created in 1948 reported
                    that segregation in public playgrounds had ended, ovens for picnics in public parks were now being
                    assigned on a nondiscriminatory basis, and segregated washrooms in the parks were being eliminated.
                    In Gary use of public beaches was a continuing source of friction. Although black use of the public
                    facilities was not prohibited, there was a strong feeling against their presence, and use of the
                    beaches by blacks was likely to precipitate racial incidents.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whites were more sensitive to attempts by blacks to use public swimming pools than to their presence
                    at public beaches. After they had gained access to most other public recreational facilities in the
                    1950s, blacks began to demand use of the pools. Their demands were sometimes answered by the offer
                    of the use of the pools on certain days or hours, arrangements which were unacceptable to black
                        leaders.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The most notable controversy occurred in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>, where armed attendants barred blacks from using a pool in a public park. At the
                    instigation of the recently formed local branch of the NAACP, a suit was filed in federal court
                    against the mayor, members of the city council, the president of the park board, and the park
                    superintendent, charging them with violating the <placeName>

                    the president of the park board resigned, and the city offered part-time use of the pool to blacks.

            <p>In 1952 Willard Ransom wrote to Jack Greenburg of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund that
                    there was no doubt that the Indiana civil rights law was being violated in most communities in
                    Indiana but that progress in enforcement was being made. He continued: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Although the methods Ransom described produced results, they were usually localized and sometimes
                    temporary. A stronger civil rights law was clearly needed to bring about general, statewide
                    compliance, a fact which led to increasing emphasis on political action beginning in the 1949
                    session of the General Assembly. Enactment that year of a school law abolishing segregation in
                    public education was a significant victory, but effective fair employment legislation and a strong
                    public accommodations law eluded the civil rights forces for many years.</p>
            <p>The 1948 state Democratic platform declared that the denial of the rights of minorities,
                    "most overtly asserted in the fields of employment, education and in the full use of the
                    public conveniences," was a direct contravention of the rights of these citizens. The
                    platform pledged "to work unceasingly to end all discrimination on account of race, color,
                    creed, or national origin or sex," and to try to rewrite the 1885 civil rights law at the

                    action." However, the anticipated fight in the 1951 session, in which Republicans had
                    majorities in both houses, did not occur. NAACP lawyers drew up a bill, but the three black members
                    of the legislature were unable to find a white member who was willing to act as cosponsor;

            <p>By 1956 civil rights as a national issue had begun to attract some attention. In Indiana both
                    political parties sought to use the issue to their advantage. Republicans tried to appeal to black
                    voters by campaigning against white Southern Democrats. Although Republican Homer Capehart had
                    refused to vote for the cloture resolution that would have stopped a southern filibuster against a

                    progress in federal civil rights legislation. At the state level Harold Handley, the Republican

            <p>In addition to supportive legislators and more effective lobbying, the chances of new civil rights

                    accommodations bills in both houses. In the Senate, Jesse Dickinson, now a member of the upper

            <p>The civil rights issue, and in particular the campaign for a strong public accommodations law, seemed
                    to have little appeal for either white or black voters. Black leaders were constantly chiding black
                    voters for their apathy and failure to retaliate against white politicians who ignored them and
                    their needs. Only a tiny fraction of the black community belonged to the NAACP, and only rarely was
                    there any kind of mass action against discriminatory treatment. Although the attitudes of whites
                    were changing and there was a growing awareness of the injustice of racial discrimination, few white
                    citizens were actively engaged in civil rights causes. Among white lawmakers only a few were
                    genuinely committed to the cause. In contrast to the campaign for a fair employment law, which was
                    widely denounced in editorials in the press and vigorously opposed with much publicity by the
                    Indiana Chamber of Commerce, there was little overt lobbying against public accommodations
                    legislation. However, while lawmakers did not want to be recorded as voting against measures which

                    alienate white voters. Politicians resolved their dilemma by avoiding both direct confrontation with
                    civil rights issues and overt opposition to civil rights legislation on the one hand, while on the
                    other hand they used the legislative tactics of delay and inaction to defeat all civil rights bills.</p>
            <p>The Republican party was clearly politically dominant in the years between 1949 and 1959. It
                    controlled both houses of the legislature except when the Democrats had a majority in the House of
                    Representatives in 1949 and 1959. Republican efforts to woo black voters back to their traditional
                    allegiance to the GOP were usually halfhearted and futile. In every election a large majority of
                    black votes went to Democrats, and this fact allowed the Democratic party to take the black vote for
                    granted. The Democrats included civil rights planks in their platforms, but when the legislature
                    met, they gave priority to other issues. In his weekly column in the <placeName>

                    Indiana blacks, observed that politics for blacks was a "one way street." Party
                    workers depended on black "ward heelers" to deliver the black vote and rewarded
                    them with minor political jobs, but once the election was over, the black constituency as a whole
                    was ignored until the next political campaign.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fact that the black population and black voters were concentrated in a few areas undoubtedly
                    influenced political attitudes and contributed to indifference or opposition to minority rights. By
                    1960 over 85 percent of the black population was found in only seven highly industrialized counties.
                    Census figures also showed that in about one third of the counties in the state there were no blacks
                    or only two or three. Some rural communities had a reputation of hostility toward blacks, and
                    so-called "sundown laws" in these towns prevented blacks from settling in them or
                    even staying temporarily. Moreover, there had been no legislative reapportionment in Indiana since
                    1921; hence, rural areas and small towns were overrepresented in the General Assembly, while urban
                    areas and their growing black populations were underrepresented.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                    fields of employment, education, and public conveniences." In more ambiguous language the

                    endorsed the right of any citizen to "exercise all of his talents and rights, anywhere, at

            <p>For the first time a governor included a plea for civil rights legislation in his inaugural address.
                    "My administration," said Welsh, "will make a determined effort to secure
                    for all our citizens the rights and the privileges now arbitrarily denied to many. For if we fail to
                    achieve this, we fail not only our own high principles, but we fail our nation in its struggle
                    against both those here and abroad, who would strip from man all his rights as an individual and
                    make of him only a tool of the state." He asked for legislation that would create a Civil
                    Rights Commission, guarantee freedom from discrimination in private facilities and accommodations,
                    and empower the state to initiate proceedings when local authorities failed to act.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Senate, where Democrats were in a majority, a public accommodations bill was introduced under
                    bipartisan sponsorship. It was a strong measure that stiffened penalities, gave the right to file
                    civil suits, and contained a section modeled after a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> law on discrimination in housing, including public housing, publicly assisted housing,
                    and developments of five or more units. A second bill principally dealing with fair employment
                    provided for a Civil Rights Commission. After surviving efforts to weaken it by amendments, the
                    public accommodations bill passed the Senate by a vote of 40 to 8 on February 14, early enough to
                    give the lower chamber ample time to consider it. In the House the measure was drastically altered.
                    The enforcement provisions were deleted and the language on housing amended to include only
                    facilities owned by city, town, or state.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

                    lobbying efforts that were taking place. While the Senate considered the bills before it, for

                    show of support. The Reverend Ford Gibson admonished the crowd not to make any noisy demonstrations.
                    "We just want them (the legislators) to know we're here," said the state
                    NAACP president. Also, an audience of about one thousand attended a public hearing sponsored by the
                    Indiana Conference on Civil Rights Legislation, and another crowd of six or seven hundred NAACP
                    supporters from all over the state staged a march. And after the House amendments were made a rally
                    was sponsored by the NAACP at a Methodist church. At this rally a standing-room-only crowd cheered
                    the Reverend Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference when he declared:
                    "walls of segregation are popping and cracking all around us. We are going to bury it in
                    our generation. We want our freedom now, not next month, next year or next century.<hi rend="sup">"65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before a final vote was taken, strenuous efforts were made to kill the proposed amendments. A long
                    list of speakers urged adoption of the Senate version at a public hearing. But the pleas, pro-tests,
                    and efforts of Democratic members in the House were futile. A minority report by Birch Bayh and
                    James Hunter that sought to restore the language of the Senate bill was rejected by a vote of 62 to
                    30. The vote was almost entirely along party lines: twenty-nine Democrats and one Republican voted
                    in favor of the minority re-port. The weakened bill then passed the House by a margin of 82 to 9.
                    Some Democrats in the Senate were so bitter at what they considered the emasculation of the bill by
                    the House that they wanted to scuttle it, but Welsh urged its adoption as the best possible bill
                    under the circumstances. The House version was then approved by the Senate by a vote of 36 to 11. In
                    addition to providing for criminal action and penalties, the public accommodations measure (an
                    amendment to the 1885 law) in its final form enabled injured parties to bring civil suits, a
                    provision which made it possible for individuals to initiate legal actions if the county prosecutor
                    was reluctant to do so.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>A second measure adopted at the 1961 session created the Indiana Civil Rights Commission. The law
                    creating the Civil Rights Commission said that its function was "to discourage any person
                    from engaging in discriminatory practices by informal methods of persuasion and conciliation, to
                    induce compliance with this act." In <list type="footnotes">

                    was authorized to receive written complaints of violations of the public accommodations law or
                    "other discriminatory practices based upon race, creed, color, national origin or
                    ancestry" and to investigate them. The commission might also conduct investigations
                    "in the absence of complaints whenever it deems it in the public interest" and
                    transmit recommendations to the legislature for aid in removing such discrimination. However, when
                    it began operations in Au-gust, 1961, no research had been done on the extent of discrimination in
                    public accommodations in Indiana. Information of this sort was necessary if the commission was to
                    carry out its functions. In particular, it wanted information about the effect of compliance with
                    the law on business operations and white patronage.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

            <p>Groups which had worked so tirelessly for a strong, enforce-able public accommodations law
                    "with teeth" were disappointed and skeptical about the watered down version
                    finally enacted. However, the 1961 law and the bill creating the Indiana Civil Rights Commission
                    proved to be much more than meaningless gestures: they paved the way for a stronger civil rights law
                    adopted at the next session of the General Assembly.</p>
            <p>The personality and performance of Harold Hatcher, the man whom Welsh appointed as the first director
                    of the Civil Rights Commission, did much to convince the public as well as the law-makers that civil
                    rights legislation served a legitimate and worth-while purpose. Hatcher, a <placeName>

                    Friends Society and as director of the Association for Merit Employment, a private fair employment

                    investigating all kinds of discriminatory practices, not merely those in employment. He also saw his
                    role as an educational one—to inform the public about the need for civil rights
                    legislation and the function of such legislation.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>During its first two years the commission received numerous complaints, nearly all of which were
                    resolved voluntarily. In fact, in about one half of the cases no evidence of discrimination was
                    found. Out of about two hundred cases of alleged discrimination during the first year only one
                    progressed to the calling of a public hearing. The operator of a skating rink in <placeName>

                    court to force him to comply with the law. Apparently, he simply ignored the finding of the
                    commission. This case illustrated so well the inadequacy of the 1961 law that it helped create
                    support for a stronger law.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

            <p>At a Governor's Conference on Civil Rights attended by more than three hundred people in
                    September, 1962, Welsh promised to work for stronger laws when a new legislature met after that
                    fall's elections. However, civil rights was not a major issue in the 1962 political
                    campaign, and the governor's party lost control of the Senate, thereby giving the
                    Republican party control of both houses of the legislature. Nevertheless, a new civil rights bill
                    was introduced in the Senate early in the next session with the backing of the Indiana Civil Rights
                    Commission. The bill contained enforcement provisions but fell short of the expectations of some
                    black leaders because it did not cover discrimination in housing. After some amendments that
                    strengthened the enforcement provisions were made, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 45 to 2
                    early in the session and was sent to the House. In the House it appeared that the bill was bogged
                    down, and some intense personal lobbying efforts were initiated. The Indiana Conference on Civil
                    Rights, the same coalition which had worked for a strong law in 1961, was again active. During the
                    closing days of the session, by a vote of 80 to 7, the House passed the Senate bill with some slight
                    amendments, which the Senate later concurred in.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>

                    empowered, upon receiving written complaints, to make preliminary investigations into charges, to
                    hold public hearings, subpoena witnesses, take testimony under oath, and examine books and papers
                    for matters relating to the investigation. Refusal to obey a subpoena constituted contempt
                    punishable by a circuit or superior court. The commission could issue cease and desist orders
                    against persons found to have engaged in discriminatory practices and order them "to take
                    such further affirmative action" as would "effectuate the purposes" of
                    the act. Decisions of the commission were subject to court review, but in the absence of an appeal
                    for judicial review the commission could obtain a court decree for enforcement of its orders if the
                    per-son charged failed to make efforts to comply. If there was insufficient evidence to support
                    charges of discrimination, the commission was to issue an order dismissing the complaint. The law
                    also authorized the commission "to promote good will and minimize or eliminate
                    discrimination" through the creation of advisory agencies and conciliation councils and
                    through research and publication.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>After enactment of the law Governor Welsh issued executive orders to strengthen enforcement of it. He
                    ordered all departments of state government involved in supervising or licensing organizations or
                    persons that operated places of "public accommodation" to take the actions
                    "necessary and appropriate to prevent at all times discrimination because of race, color,
                    creed or national origin" and to implement his order with the "appropriate action
                    permitted by law." This meant that businesses which did not comply with the civil rights
                    law jeopardized the renewal of their licenses. In the case of restaurants, hotels, and bars the
                    Indiana State Board of Health and the Alcoholic Beverages Commission were ordered to assist in the
                    enforcement of the public accommodations provisions of the law.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

            <p>With the adoption of the 1963 law a major step toward long-sought goals had been taken. The president

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the NAACP said that that organization "was totally satisfied that
                    Indiana had taken another step forward in its drive for equality of opportunities of its
                    citizens." Why did the General Assembly make this major step; why did it give an
                    overwhelming endorsement to a strong bill "with teeth" when it had rejected a
                    similar measure two years earlier? Examination of the member-ship of the legislature shows that
                    there had been no significant redistribution of political power. In 1961 there were twenty-six <list type="footnotes">

                    there were twenty-six Republicans and twenty-four Democrats. Republicans held sixty-six of the one
                    hundred seats in the House in 1961; in 1963 they held fifty-seven. There were a few new faces in
                    both houses, but most members of the 1961 session returned in 1963, although some of them had
                    changed their views about civil rights legislation. In 1963 twenty-three of the same House members
                    who had voted down the strong bill sponsored by the Democrats in 1961 voted for the 1963 measure. In
                    the Senate of the eight members who had cast votes against the 1961 bill before it was weakened by
                    amendments, four voted for the 1963 version. Of the two senators who voted against the 1963 bill,
                    one was reported to have explained his vote by saying the measure was hypocritical because it
                    exempted private fraternal and religious organizations, while the other one refused to give a reason
                    except to say it had nothing to do with race. Both were Republicans.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, one reason that some lawmakers found the 1963 bill more acceptable than the original
                    version of the 1961 bill was that it did not cover discrimination in housing. Another reason,
                    already suggested, was the record of the Civil Rights Commission, which had helped to educate the
                    legislators and the public and to alleviate the fears of both that, if given enforcement powers, it
                    might act in an arbitrary fashion. Also, the experience of other states with strong civil rights
                    laws was demonstrating that all par-ties preferred administrative enforcement to litigation.</p>
            <p>Black civil rights lawyers had framed the successive civil rights bills introduced in the legislature
                    from 1935 to 1963, and most of these bills had been sponsored by black members. The NAACP and its
                    allies had lobbied tirelessly. Democrats had pushed civil rights more vigorously than had the
                    opposing party, but it had been a bipartisan coalition of whites who enacted the laws. Many white
                    legislators were ready to accept in 1963 what they had formerly opposed or evaded. Their own
                    attitudes and what they perceived to be the attitudes of their white constituents had gradually
                    changed.</p>
            <p>The attitudes of Hoosiers about civil rights were influenced by the tide of events nationally. The
                    most significant domestic development in the <placeName>

                    press whites witnessed the realities of racial injustiee and oppression of which they had been
                    ignorant or which they had chosen to ignore. At the national level the Kennedy administration,
                    compelled to assert the authority of the federal government at OI' Miss in 1962, was moving
                    toward support for strong federal civil rights legislation. In the <list type="footnotes">

                    consistency oppose equal rights in Indiana while denouncing racism in the South. For many whites
                    racial justice had become a compelling moral issue. At a White House Conference on Civil Rights held
                    in 1963 after the adoption of the Indiana law, Governor Welsh spoke of the part that churches had
                    played "in working with what was essentially a moral question" and asserted that
                    the "forthright role played by the men and women of all faiths" was a major factor
                    in the passage of Indiana's civil rights bill.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of course all whites did not agree. An indignant owner of a beauty shop in Gary wrote to Welsh to
                    protest the civil rights law and the governor's executive order implementing it. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In reply Welsh admitted that some whites might be "inconvenienced" or
                    "displeased" as rights they had formerly enjoyed exclusively were extended to
                    blacks, but he added, the continued denial of these rights to blacks was "a deep cutting
                    insult" that tended to destroy the self-respect and ambition of black citizens. As for
                    him-self, the governor said: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Others recognized that lawmakers, in supporting civil rights, were not motivated solely by moral
                    considerations but were also influenced by what they had come to perceive as the self-interest of
                    all Americans and the position of the <placeName>

                    national levels, Willard Ransom said that it had come about because "the power structure
                    … now recognizes that these things must be done to maintain our image of leadership at

                    most complete summary at the time of the actual availability of equal access to public
                    accommodations. The survey, conducted by about two hundred volunteers in sixteen cities, showed that
                    blacks might expect to be served in about ninety-nine out of one hundred lunch counters in drug and
                    department stores in the larger cities, and that they could eat in about 80 percent of the
                    restaurants surveyed, although they were less likely to be received in small establishments in
                    all-white neighborhoods. They would probably be turned away from at least three out of five cocktail
                    bars or taverns, exclusive of cocktail bars in major hotels. Black travelers could expect to find
                    lodgings in about 80 percent of major downtown hotels, but in only about two thirds of
                    Indiana's motels. Motels identified with national chains were more likely to accept them
                    than smaller, locally owned ones. Nearly all theaters, public parks, public recreation centers, and
                    bowling alleys in or near larger cities accepted blacks, but only about one fourth of roller skating
                    rinks. Responses to questions about the effect of serving all patrons without regard to race
                    indicated that businesses which complied with the law did not suffer loss of white patronage. The
                    report concluded that, "While a significant number of taverns, motels, roller skating rinks
                    and places of personal service still discriminate, the new enforceable Civil Rights Act and the
                    Governor's Executive Order against discrimination in Public Accommodations …
                    have greatly accelerated the adoption of equal accommodations policies." It added that
                    "on the basis of present trends, all of Indiana's public accommodations should be
                    available to its citizens regardless of color at an early date."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report, which was drawn from data collected in larger communities, was not entirely
                    representative of the state as a whole and probably somewhat too optimistic. In many communities
                    blacks would probably have been refused service in spite of the law. Assessing conditions early in
                    1964, Governor Welsh spoke of the civil rights movement as "a great revolution of the
                    American conscience," adding, "one may not pass a law requiring brotherly love,
                    but one may legislate to insure the basic rights of all citizens in a free land." If gains
                    had not been spectacular, progress had been achieved without strife.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

            <p>By 1963 Indiana, a state that had before lagged behind other northern states in civil rights matters,
                    had become one of the few states with enforceable laws in the areas of fair employment, public
                    accommodations, and school desegregation. The Indiana laws were adopted before the landmark federal
                    Civil Rights Act of 1964, <list type="footnotes">

                    al-ready covered in Indiana by state law. Nevertheless, the existence of the federal law undoubtedly
                    served to reinforce the authority of the state law by outlawing discriminatory treatment nationally.</p>
            <p>Complaints over refusal of service in public accommodations steadily declined. The Indiana Civil
                    Rights Commission reported that whereas in 1963, 32 percent of complaints filed with it had been
                    about public accommodations, by 1965 that figure had declined to 15 percent. By 1967 there were only
                    occasional, isolated complaints, which were resolved by negotiation. The general acceptance of the
                    law on public accommodations permitted the commission to direct most of its resources to the areas
                    of employment and housing.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1965 the General Assembly passed a measure outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of
                    private housing and an-other measure to strengthen the 1949 law so as to assist school
                    desegregation. Finally, at the same session, Indiana, the only state outside the South with an
                    antimiscegenation law, repealed the prohibition against interracial marriage. By the mid-1960s
                    racism was not dead in Indiana, but the more overt manifestations of it were no longer evident. In
                    larger communities, at least, the presence of blacks in restaurants, hotels, and theaters no longer
                    caused comment. Many people had forgotten that it had not always been that way.</p>

                    the adversary process if truth is ever going to be reached. A defense means little without a

                    sue for libel in a court of law today. Whether justified or not, his unsavory reputation<hi rend="sup">13</hi> has led to the suspicion of some scholars that, after reading Heckewelder, he

                            Rafinesque" scheduled for 1988 publication in Holland by the D. Reidel Company in a
                            volume edited by Joan Leopold about the French Volney Prizes in linguistics. The subject is
                            a 256-page manuscript in Rafinesque's hand, written in French and unknown until it

                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi> Rafinesque alienated many contemporary naturalists by publishing
                            scathing reviews of their books in which he censured them for ignoring his own discoveries.
                            Shortly after his death the botanist Asa Gray and the zoologist S. S. Haldeman each
                            published a review of his life's work in their respective disciplines suggesting
                            that naturalists disregard his publications. He largely was ignored until the 1930s, when
                            revisionists, acting under more elaborate international rules of nomenclature, found that so
                            many of his discoveries had been validly published that they could no longer be neglected.
                            This unleashed a second anti-Rafinesque outcry and led to an attempt at the 1950 Stockholm
                            International Botanical Congress to declare him a non-person, which, however, failed to
                            carry when calmer heads prevailed. Since he had been accused of mental illnesses ranging
                            from monomania to madness—a "lunatic, who wrote botany because he was of
                            unsound mind," declared one botanist in 1948—his writings were subjected
                            to post-mortem analysis by a <placeName>

                            neurotic; affirmed that he was a genius; and, what may be most significant in this context,
                            wrote that "I can find no evidence for dishonesty." He concluded that
                            Rafinesque "was not a charlatan inasmuch as there was no conscious desire to
                            misrepresent." Henricus Quatre [pseud. of Leon Croizat], "Rafinesque: A

            <p>However, there is also circumstantial evidence to argue forcefully that, whatever else it might be,
                    the Walam Olum is not a Rafinesque hoax. He did not invent it–rather, he was pleased to
                    see it so closely paralleled Heckewelder's account—and he believed in its
                    essential veracity himself. Yet, until reliable correlative evidence appears—evidence
                    from someone contemporaneous with Rafinesque himself—there always will be doubts so long
                    as his is the only testimony available. This is one reason the search for Dr. Ward has gone on so
                    long, and why it is worth continuing the pursuit. Somewhere, lost among forgotten archives, may be a
                    document showing that another person once had the Walam Olum in his hands early in the nineteenth
                    century. Such a person certainly was Dr. Ward, whoever he may have been. However, the correct
                    identification of Dr. Ward, humanly interesting as it is, has little historical significance unless
                    it leads to further documentation of the Walam Olum.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="u">An alternative candidate.</hi> Probably for lack of space, Barlow and Powell could not
                    review the evidence supporting another candidate who must be rejected if their identification of
                    Malthus A. Ward is accepted. Nor did they hint at the magnitude of the effort already expended to
                    reach a different conclusion. Some attention to earlier attempts to solve the puzzle of Dr.
                    Ward's identity will at least suggest caution in reaching too-facile a conclusion now.</p>
            <p>The search for Dr. Ward began when Daniel G. Brinton decided to reprint Rafinesque's
                    transcription along with the pictographs supporting it in his book <hi rend="i">The
                        Lenâpé and Their Legends</hi> (1885), which included his own translation.
                    As the Lilly team was to do half a century later, Brinton devoted much of his attention to the
                    linguistic plausibility of Rafinesque's transcription of Lenape words. He sent copies to
                    "several educated Delawares" and satisfied himself that the Walam Olum was
                    "a genuine native production, which was repeated orally to some one indifferently

                            was seriously compromised by his indiscretion in providing an introduction to the second

            <p>Was Dr. Ward an indifferent linguist? Not necessarily; in fact, there is no need to attribute to him
                    any knowledge of the language at all. Rafinesque wrote that he had "obtained, through the
                    late Dr. Ward of Indiana, some of the original <hi rend="i">Wallam-Olum</hi> (painted record) of the
                    Linapi [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] tribe of Wapahani or <geogName>White River</geogName>" in
                        Indiana.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Farther on he remarked that "these actual <hi rend="i">Olum</hi> were at first obtained in 1820, as a reward for a medical cure; and were
                    unexplicable." That is, nobody known to Rafinesque could understand it; probably he means
                    that Dr. Ward got them in 1820—not that he did—if, in fact, Dr. Ward, and not
                    someone else, was the physician who rendered the medical cure. At any rate, "in 1822 were
                    obtained from <hi rend="i">another individual</hi> the songs annexed thereto in the original
                        language.…"<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Therefore, Rafinesque had both parts of
                    the Walam Olum, the mnemonic pictographs and the songs which went with them, in his possession only
                    in 1822.</p>
            <p>It has never been sufficiently appreciated that all Rafinesque claimed he got from Dr. Ward in 1822
                    were 184 pictographs, with the result that Dr. Ward can be only one of <hi rend="i">two</hi> sources
                    for the Walam Olum. Nor has any attempt been published to identify the other individual who, in
                    Brinton's opinion, was "indifferently conversant with the <placeName>

                    originated in Indiana; it may have come from anywhere in the widespread area where there were <placeName>

                            language need not detain us here, but an unfortunate slip was made by the staff of the IMH
                            when they composed the caption that appears beneath the portrait of Rafinesque in the
                            article by Barlow and Powell. There it is said that Rafinesque completed his translation
                            "with the help of two other men and a Lenape-English dictionary written by Moravian
                            missionaries." Barlow and Powell, "‘The Late Dr. Ward of
                            Indiana,’" 187. This line is a paraphrase of Rafinesque's
                            statement that "I had therefore to learn the language since [1822], by the help of
                            Zeisberger, Heckewelder and a manuscript dictionary," by which he meant their
                            writings and not the men themselves. Rafinesque, <hi rend="i">The American Nations</hi>, I,
                            151. David Zeisberger, a Moravian missionary, died in 1808, but his Lenape Grammar was
                            published during Rafinesque's lifetime, and Rafinesque journeyed to <placeName>

                            until 1887. John Heckewelder, also a Moravian missionary, published a glossary of Lenape
                            place names and other linguistic articles in addition to his "History, Manners, and
                            Customs." He died in 1823, and there is no evidence that he and Rafinesque ever
                            met. Rafinesque's "manuscript dictionary" was one he compiled
                            himself, probably from these and other sources. Three years before his death he offered it
                            for sale for $20. C. S. Rafinesque, <hi rend="i">Bulletin Nr. 4 of the Historical

                    and wrote a comment on each of them, most critical attention has focused on the Lenape text, not the
                    pictographs. Since this text had been filtered through the imperfect understanding of some unknown
                    person - probably a Caucasian—before reaching Rafinesque, there is greater historical
                    reason to search for his identity than that of Dr. Ward, who only contributed the pictographs. Had
                    Paul Weer been less haunted by Dr. Ward, perhaps he would have done so; that no one has since is

                    the Pacific, and from whom Rafinesque obtained brief vocabularies of four Indian dialects. One of
                    these he called "Chinuc," which, he wrote, was "one of the Lenapian
                    languages of the West, one of the fragments of that vast ancient nation that has spread from the
                    Pacific to the Atlantic." Especially relevant to the Walam Olum was Rafinesque's
                    added comment that the Chinooks "appear to be" descendants of the "Ainus

            <p>At any rate, Brinton did try to identify Dr. Ward even though he made no effort to discover the
                    source of the text he himself again translated. His search focused on Rafinesque's equally
                    ambiguous comment in the Walam Olum manuscript itself that "this M[anuscri]pt &amp; the

                    no longer extant, because his own manuscript where the quotation appears is dated 1833. For that
                    matter, the wooden sticks on which the pictographs were inscribed also have never been found, with
                    the result that the 1833 Walam Olum manuscript in Rafinesque's hand is a recension from and
                    combination of two earlier sources. It was here, too, that Rafinesque penned the name "Dr.

            <p>Having been unable to identify any physician named Ward in the early medical annals of Indiana,
                    Brinton lit on "an old and well-known Kentucky family of that name" in
                    "the neighborhood of Cynthiana," and decided that "one of these, in
                    1824-25, was a friend of Rafinesque, invited him to his house, and shared his archaeological
                    tastes"—all of which is no more than conjecture based on a sentence in
                    Rafinesque's autobiography where he says that at about that time "my friend Mr.
                    Ward took me to Cynthiana in a gig, where I surveyed other ancient monuments"<hi rend="sup">23</hi>—and conveniently overlooks the fact that Rafinesque says he got the two
                    components of the Walam Olum in 1822. Nevertheless, Brinton concluded that it was in the
                    neighborhood of Cynthiana, "no doubt," that Rafinesque "copied the signs
                    and the original text of the Walam Olum"<hi rend="sup">24</hi>—presumably both
                    in the possession of <hi rend="i">Mr</hi>. Ward's physician relative, who remained unnamed.</p>
            <p>There the matter rested until Paul Weer took up the quest as part of the Lilly team effort, which,
                    fortunately, he was able to recount in some detail in his contribution to the <hi rend="i">Walam
                        Olum</hi> (1954). As he said, "since this study is primarily a scientific investigation
                    … and further researches will doubtless be made, every line of study we have followed has
                    been included here in order that future workers will know what has already been done."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> What was done can be quickly summarized now, and savored at length in
                    Weer's essay.</p>
            <p>He and his associates searched every conceivable record which might reveal an Indiana physician by
                    the name of Ward: they pored over records of the medical schools of the time that might have
                    educated him (recognizing at the same time that he might merely have apprenticed himself to an older
                    physician); they examined court and other legal records in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and census records in Indiana; they engaged the help of both amateur and professional
                    genealogists to ransack the complicated Ward family tree; and they even queried every Ward listed in

                  <item>booklet consists of forty pages measuring 6½ by 7¾ inches. Although
                            there are a few emendations, it is apparent that the manuscript is "clear
                            copy," possibly prepared for publication. In it each numbered verse consists of
                            several phonetically spelled Lenape words followed by an English translation of these words
                            and usually a pictograph, though in a few instances two pictographs are used to express a
                            verse. If the present order of the three elements represents Rafinesque's work
                            methods, it means that he fitted the pictograph to the verse only after he had achieved a
                            satisfactory translation, and this assumption, in turn, implies greater importance for the
                            text (and its unknown agent of transmission) than for the pictographs transmitted by Dr.
                            Ward. Usually listed as belonging to the Brinton Library of the University Museum, the

                    and supposes that Weer and his assistants never considered him. If they missed Malthus A. Ward, it
                    may be because he did not take his M.D. degree<hi rend="sup">27</hi> until after he returned to New <placeName>

                    Indiana residence—though, as a healer, he may have been called that.</p>
            <p>The upshot of Weer's research was the reluctant conclusion that Brinton had at least
                    stumbled on to part of the truth. For lack of a better candidate Weer settled on Dr. John Russell
                    Ward, a physician almost wholly unknown to fame, who was living in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>—a village nearer to Cynthiana than to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>—until 1829, when he moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1834. When Rafinesque wrote, in 1837, of "the late Dr. Ward of
                    Indiana," there is no question that John Russell Ward qualified as then deceased, but
                    nothing has ever linked this Ward with Indiana.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Weer's identification
                    hinges on the unproved—and so far unprovable—assumption that it was Dr. John
                    Russell Ward who, visiting relatives (might we now guess, Malthus A. Ward?) in Indiana's
                        <geogName>White River</geogName> Valley in 1820, was given some form of the pictographs either

                    in 1822, the same year Rafinesque obtained the songs. This is a formidable string of assumptions.</p>
            <p>Although Weer reported "scientifically" on what he had accomplished, he could not
                    describe fully the unresolved problem that must have plagued him the rest of his days. Even though a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Ward seemed to be the only likely candidate, Weer could not understand why
                    Brinton—in seeming contradiction of Rafinesque's own words—had
                    located him in <placeName>

                    of Brinton's aged daughter at the time Weer was pursuing his research. Weer felt he had to

            <p>Anyone who has been denied access to extant unpublished materials which might—just
                    might—illuminate a problem he has mulled over for years knows how easy it is to develop
                    an obsession about them. After all other approaches failed, Weer, with Eli Lilly's support,
                    proposed an elaborate scheme to have the papers examined by a blue-ribbon committee under the

                    previously told. With Lilly's moral and financial support the late John Fliegel dug

                    reference to Rafinesque, the Walam Olum, or to Dr. Ward! With the same source of support, Josephine

               <hi rend="u">A New Candidate.</hi> Since neither Weer's defense of John Russell Ward nor
                    that of Barlow and Powell of Malthus A. Ward is wholly compelling, it is worth mentioning the name
                    of one more candidate unknown to all previous researchers in this field. He is named here not
                    because the evidence is any stronger for him but to highlight some issues that have not received
                    enough attention in the case of either of the other two Wards. Moreover, as Paul Weer believed, the
                    more these lines of research are described the greater the likelihood of final success.</p>
            <p>Weer mentions, but does not appear to attach any significance to, the fact that Rafinesque wrote in
                    an unpublished list of plant names (now at the American Philosophical Society) "LOPHACTIS,
                    N[ew] Genus] by C.S.R. I noticed in 1818 this plant on the <placeName>

                    from White R. Indiana." As Weer says, Rafinesque further corrected his note by penning a
                    "D" over the "M" to make the collector Dr. Ward.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>While this emendation could represent a correction, it could equally indicate that someone known to

                    University—achieved the doctorate and thereafter was given the full honor of his degree

                    Barlow and Powell have noted, there is no evidence that Malthus A. Ward ever published anything on
                    botany, but, like most physicians of the time, he was keenly interested in it. The same assumption
                    is equally reasonable for Dr. John Russell Ward and, especially, for Dr. William Ward, who we know
                    was a Transylvania student when Rafinesque gave his first course on medical botany in
                    1823–1824, a course in which he pioneered the laboratory method of instruction by
                    illustrating his lectures with specimens he himself had gathered.</p>

               <hi rend="u">What conclusions should be drawn?</hi> In the first place, unless more evidence turns

                                for anything concerning Indians, she turned up such stories as those about love-sick
                                maidens throwing themselves off cliffs but nothing qualifying as serious ethnology or
                                history. Indicative of Ward's kind of interest in Indians was a story about a
                                Chippewa warrior whose wife died while their child was an infant. Filled with tender
                                compassion, the warrior prayed with such vigor that milk began to flow in his breasts,
                                and he suckled the baby himself.</p>
                            <p>However, if Ward's ethnological interest was romantic, he did have a serious
                                concern with the Lenape language, which would be useful to him in dealing with the
                                    <geogName>White River</geogName> Delawares. Owens found a page-long description of
                                the grammatical structure of Lenape. It is not clear whether this description was based
                                on original observations or copied from some unidentified source. Such characteristics
                                as the distinction between animate and inanimate modes, the bewildering number of
                                plurals, and the striking characteristic of compounding many concepts into a single word
                                which led P. S. Du Ponceau to label the language polysynthetic—all these were
                                well known by the 1830s. No allusion to pictographs, talking sticks, or anything else
                                implying an acquaintance with the Walam Olum was found in the notebooks.</p>

                    letters. His full name appears in none of Rafinesque's published or unpublished writing,
                    and no one has found Rafinesque's name in his.</p>
            <p>The most damaging evidence against the candidate of Barlow and Powell is that Rafinesque believed Dr.
                    Ward was dead by 1837 (as, in fact, was true of John Russell Ward), while Malthus A. Ward lived
                    nearly three more decades, until 1863. Throughout an international correspondence among botanists
                    Rafinesque and his acquaintances kept each other pretty well informed about the demise of
                        co-workers<hi rend="sup">41</hi> because such information might have practical as well as
                    emotional value. In one instance, Rafinesque was able to add the valuable herbarium of Zaccheus
                    Collins to his own shortly after the latter's death. Hence, when he included Ward among
                    botanists "who have fallen victims to their zeal in arduous travels, or from diseases
                    contracted by their labors,"<hi rend="sup">42</hi> he likely spoke from some source of
                    information no longer available to us. While Rafinesque was never quite as adroit in English as he
                    was in his native French, it is probable that "the late Dr. Ward of Indiana" means
                    the deceased Dr. Ward, rather than Dr. Ward, lately of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Valuable as it has been for Barlow and Powell to publish their speculations and bring to light
                    another plausible candidate, what their research and all the other efforts to identify Dr. Ward
                    should lead to is the conclusion that the jury is still out. A jury should not rule conclusively,
                    based on the evidence at hand, for any Ward so far nominated. It can only adopt that middle ground
                    once observed in Scottish courts: case not proved.</p>

                    1760–1768), many British officers prepared comprehensive reports about the
                    crown's new territory for their superiors and for posterity, and several Anglo-American
                    travelers, such as Indian agent George Croghan and merchant George Morgan, also wrote relations that
                    have proven as useful for scholars as for their correspondents. Notably, all such descriptions date

                    and waging war against others. Consequently, while the numerous early British accounts offer
                    excellent information about travel routes, distances, and locations, they do not always present
                    reliable evidence about populations and conditions that had altered before the outbreak of the

            <p>Little is known about Paul Des Ruisseaux. A native of Quebec City or its environs, he moved
                    permanently to the upper country in 1756. Eventually he settled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he married Marie Louise Bauvais, daughter of Jean Baptiste Bauvais, head of one
                    of the village's wealthiest families. Entry into the Bauvais clan installed Des Ruisseaux
                    among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s social elite, and his writing reveals him to have been a man of some
                    education as well. He evidently engaged in the Indian trade and June, 1765, saw him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he gave financial assistance to George Croghan, a British Indian agent whose
                    party had been attacked and captured by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribesmen. No doubt because of the Bauvais family's extensive property
                    holdings, its members, including Des Ruisseaux, chose to remain in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> after the arrival of British troops and to make their peace with the new regime.
                    Because of their economic stake in the area, however, they probably came to resent the influx of
                    Anglo-American merchants who soon arrived to attempt to engross the territory's Indian
                    trade and to speculate in its lands. Certain it is that Des Ruisseaux supported Rocheblave, whom the
                    last departing British commander left in charge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                    despised. When Rocheblave needed a responsible and trusted individual to undertake a special mission
                    in June, 1777, he turned to Des Ruisseaux.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    as well as his own person by fortifying his cabin, requested that Rocheblave send him some of the
                    artillery left be-hind at Fort Gage by the last British garrison. Kaskaskia's acting
                    commandant promptly had two 3-pounders, two swivels, and their attendant gear and munitions loaded
                    on boats. To Des Ruisseaux he entrusted the task of taking them to <placeName>

                    without incident, although he was pursued for some distance by fifteen scouts from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s backcountry settlements. In mid-July, while Des Ruisseaux was still at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Abbott received an alarming message from Rocheblave that reported rumors about

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. In order to carry this letter and his own report to Governor Carleton without delay,
                    he engaged Des Ruisseaux, who may have intended to visit Quebec on his own business anyway. During

                    </placeName> and then down the Maumee, stopping on the way to counsel on Abbott's behalf
                    with the Indians at Ouiatanon and Miamis Town. By August 13 he had reached Quebec and delivered the
                    dispatches into Carleton's hands.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While waiting at Quebec for the governor's reply, Des Ruisseaux wrote down his
                    "Memoire D'observations" about the territory through which he had just
                    passed. He very likely did so at the behest of Abbott, who had promised, but had not yet found time,
                    to send Carleton full and up-to-date intelligence about the region that had only become part of
                    Quebec Province on May 1, 1775. On his part, Des Ruisseaux prepared an unpretentious relation of the
                    route from the mouth of the Maumee to all the <hi rend="i">Canadien</hi> settlements in the

                    stressed the region's future value to the British crown and the dangers it then faced from
                    possible Spanish or rebel aggression. Nevertheless, the memoir he submitted on August 23 seems to
                    have carried little weight with Carleton, who had two months earlier resigned his office in a bitter
                    dispute with Britain's colonial secretary and was biding his time until his successor

                    rebels' military occupation, Des Ruisseaux managed to survive the dangerous war years, but
                    shortly afterward he fell victim to the incessant hostilities that persisted and intensified between

            <p>Des Ruisseaux left a worthwhile legacy, however, on the pages of his "Memoire
                    D'observations." Ironically, the document survived to the present day largely
                    through the disinterest of its intended recipient, Governor Carleton. During the Revolutionary years
                    the official correspondence that came into a royal governor's office was considered to
                    belong to his personal records rather than to the archives of the colonial or central government.

                    </placeName> were reports from Quebec's western posts preserved in Britain's
                    government repositories. The great majority of such western documents from the early years of the
                    Revolution were lost, however, because the secretive Carleton, unlike his successor Haldimand,

                    "conquered" in 1778. Especially important is Des Ruisseaux's number for

            </p>
            <p>Of even greater relevance to the history of the Revolutionary-era West are Des Ruisseaux's
                    few remarks about the situation he had witnessed during his journey from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the mouth of the Maumee. His comments stress three issues. First, Des Ruisseaux
                    echoes the oft-stated views of royal commandants Abbott and Rocheblave, who championed the
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>-<region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> country, and especially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as a notably valuable corner of Britain's American empire, both for its
                    strategic location from which to control numerous Indian nations and for its agricultural potential
                    with which to support thousands of additional white settlers. British officials far away in Quebec
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who perhaps appraised the hinterland of Quebec only for its fur trade, however, never
                    heeded this outlook, a perception Des Ruisseaux, Abbott, and Rocheblave seem to have shared only
                    with George Rogers Clark, his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> backers, and his supporters among the region's Anglo-American merchants.
                    Second, Des Ruisseaux reiterates Abbott's and Rocheblave's fears that the
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>-<region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> country was threatened by aggression from both the American
                    insurrectionists to the east and the ambitious Spanish across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, but, like the two officials, he clearly worries most about the intentions of
                    Britain's traditional enemy, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Third, Des Ruisseaux nevertheless plainly points out the growing presence in the area
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> frontiers-men. Most of these Virginians passed themselves off as hunters, but some,
                    like those who pursued him, were undoubtedly rebel "scouts." Among them, however,
                    he also identifies a number of family groups who claimed to be—and probably
                    were—refugees from fighting and political intimidation in the East. Interestingly, at a
                    time when Clark's spies reported Rocheblave to be urging the region's Indians to
                    raid frontier settlements, Des Ruisseaux describes him as actually offering aid and protection to
                    some Anglo-American frontier families.</p>

            <p>Given twelve other biographical/critical works on Theodore Dreiser—including <hi rend="i">chef-d'oeuvres</hi> by H. L. Mencken (1924), Alfred Kazin (1965), John J. McAleer
                    (1968), Robert Penn <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> (1971), and Donald Pizer (1976); not to list Dreiser's
                    autobiographicals—one may ask, is Richard Lingeman's entry supererogatory?</p>
            <p>No! It integrates, illuminates, sometimes corrects its predecessors. Except for McAleer's,
                    with which it competes, Lingeman's surpasses the others in literary distinction. Aside from
                    his impeccable accuracy (expected from an editor on <hi rend="i">The Nation</hi>) he creates the
                    poignancy of a <hi rend="i">Bildungsroman</hi>. ("He [Theodore] saw himself a failure,
                    after nineteen years… he had no skills, no place, no prospects" [p. 84].)
                    Indeed, <hi rend="i">At the Gates of the City</hi> reads like a novel; page after page, one
                    excitedly anticipates what happens next.</p>
            <p>Lingeman also achieves a charming poetic: "He [Theodore] could escape from his fears in
                    rambles about the countryside, rising early when the horizon was streaked with pink and orange, and
                    the grass… beaded with dew" (p. 43). Yet, he avoids rhapsody and the explicit
                    sex that Warren, for example, indulges in ("From lies, masturbation… / dreams of
                    ladies… with asses ample and sweet," <hi rend="i">Homage to Theodore
                    Dreiser</hi>, p. 3.)</p>
            <p>No prude, however, Lingeman deals honestly with Dreiser's sex life and dependence on women.
                    As a twelfth child, Theodore clings to the skirts of Sarah Schänäb, his
                    solicitous Mennonite mother, who shields him from his harsh father and from the chicaneries of his
                    generous but libertine brother Paul ("Dresser," co-author with Dreiser, of
                    "On the Banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>"). Theo idolizes his sisters Sylvia and Emma, is devastated by their
                    extra-marital pregnancies. (Emma's predicament inspires <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi>.)

            <p>As for Dreiser's socioeconomics, in all the big cities where he works as a reporter he
                    observes that the titans of industry grow rich at the expense of oppressed laborers. These
                    observations Lingeman renders graphically, suggesting how they will contribute to such novels as <hi rend="i">The Financier</hi> (1912) and <hi rend="i">The Titan</hi> (1914).</p>
            <p>Finally, Lingeman's triumph: his explication of <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi>, harvesting
                    the fruits of his <hi rend="i">selective</hi> plantings ("the [<hi rend="i">random</hi>]
                    seeds had been planted" [p. 421]); harvesting Dreiser's experiential inferences
                    ("stubbornly telling the truth as he knew it" [p. 421]) that only the
                    fittest—no ordinary mortals—survive in a chancy naturalistic/industrial
                    universe. Lingeman adds, "Only George Ade at this time had recorded the speech [and
                    behavior] of ordinary Americans so truly" (p. 255).</p>
            <p>If the excellences demonstrated in Volume I are sustained in Volume II (1908–1945)
                    Lingeman should be a shoo-in for a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

            <p>In one of the better volumes of the Constitutional bicentennial, <hi rend="i">Beyond
                    Confederation</hi>, Richard Beeman, one of its editors, points out perceptively that Constitutional
                    studies heavily tilted toward the Supreme Court are beginning to give way. And while studies
                    focusing on the evolution of federal power continue to appear, it is becoming increasingly apparent
                    that only through studies of legal and constitutional development in the individual states will we
                    be able to discover where we have been, constitutionally, in this country. This revival of interest
                    in local applications of constitutionalism gets refreshing and valuable emphasis in this volume
                    through its focus upon constitutionally significant cases that arose in Indiana. Except for Alan T.
                    Nolan's essay on <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi>, the cases here are seldom mentioned
                    in standard constitutional histories. But, as the editor of this volume properly points out, they
                    are representative of general constitutional developments in the United <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-083-4-089"/> States, as well as being relevant to Indiana and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution.</p>
            <p>The essays, originally delivered as lectures, run an interesting gambit. Patrick J. Furlong, by
                    focusing upon fugitive slave cases, presents a useful case study of constitutional insolvency,
                    demonstrating that the Constitution was not an instrument providing a workable solution to the
                    slavery question. Moral imperatives conflicted with legal duties with the result that a law that was
                    not delivering ethical outcomes proved unimplementable in terms of public support and public
                    sympathy.</p>
            <p>The Milligan essay has somewhat similar overtones, but with a happier ending. Here the issue is
                    raised of the Constitution in a crisis. Milligan's trial, which was prompted by political
                    motives and held before politically biased military officers without rules of evidence, used
                    questionable informers as witnesses, and was surrounded by lurid publicity. It could hardly produce
                    a constitutionally neutral outcome. But here the Supreme Court, in quieter times, came through
                    remarkably well, with a statesmanlike ruling, which helped the nation avoid the risk of a future
                    president abusing power in a crisis situation.</p>
            <p>Kenneth R. Steven's article on the trials and tribulations of Alfred Kinsey also has some
                    encouraging dimensions as to out-come. The federal courts, by establishing the concept of
                    "variable obscenity" in censorship law, created a precedent for the freedom to do
                    scholarly research and recognized in the process that Kinsey's long work in the sex
                    research field was a valuable and a defensible attempt to deal with important social forces within
                    our society.</p>

                    Explaining the multidimensional aspects of desegregation, particularly when the issue becomes

                    tensions and cross tensions and of the eventual remedy to these tensions that reduced the

                    state—where tempers run strong and commitments deep. Here the behavior of participants,
                    troubled by fear of recrimination if they stated their positions strongly, adds a human element but
                    also showcases the importance of recognizing the difference between emotionalism and rationality and
                    the fact that the First Amendment can and should come down on the side of the latter.</p>

                    document—the Constitution as icon, as text, and as law—and draws a series of
                    perceptive distinctions regarding the complexity of the document, its role, its purpose, and its
                    function. As a lawyer, he is particularly interested in issues of strict and loose construction, the
                    way the framers understood the Constitution as a "social contract," and the way
                    the Constitution has emerged as a guide to those looking at the nation's interests broadly
                    and generally. He correctly sees all three concepts as empowering the document. He ends on a note
                    stressing the Constitution's openendedness and fluidity and its role as a device for
                    actualizing the preamble's values in American life.</p>

            <p>Geography, like history, is a point of view, an approach to understanding our changing world.
                    Geography with its focus on the spatial dimension and history with its focus on the temporal
                    dimension together give a sense of order among places and events. Many good volumes have been
                    published on the history of the state of Indiana, and many of these have incorporated some
                    geographic perspectives. Only two or three books on the geography of Indiana ever have been
                    published. <hi rend="i">Indiana: The American Heartland</hi> (1986) is the most recent; sadly, it is
                    but a reprint of <hi rend="i">Indiana: Crossroads of America</hi> (1978) by geographers at Ball
                    State University. The only significant changes in this brief text are in the title, the re-versed
                    order of the two editors' names, a new publisher, and three new appendixes: 1)
                    "The Setting"—two pages of locational facts that belong in Chapter One;
                    2) "The Glossary" containing only terms in <hi rend="u">physical</hi> geography;
                    and 3) "The Types of Farming" based on 1969 data and belonging in Chapter Eight on
                    "The Agriculture." Unfortunately, dozens of typographical and writing style errors
                    are continued from the 1978 text. No statistical data, no maps, no pictures, no topics have been
                    updated or revised. The bibliography remains unchanged except for eleven new references given under
                    a new heading called "General."</p>
            <p>The original publisher (Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co.) of this geography of Indiana as well as of other
                    states essentially left organization, content, style, editing, and marketing up to the authors,
                    editors, and sponsors. The <placeName>

                    geography within a historical perspective. Although attempts have been made in every state to
                    produce a state atlas and/or a state geography, such volumes rarely have been "best
                    sellers," no doubt in part because of public misunderstanding of geography and maps as well
                    as because of the failure to teach much geography in school and college.</p>
            <p>The lonely Indiana geography reviewed here does offer an invitation to geographers to assemble a
                    colorful atlas with historical-geographical interpretations in text and maps. The state has had no
                    atlas since Robert C. Kingsbury's underfunded but effective <hi rend="i">Atlas of
                    Indiana</hi> (1970). Usually funded by a state agency and/or by a state university, geographers in
                    the 1970s and 1980s have prepared some excellent state atlases; e.g., <placeName>

                    cultural geography, including settlement geography similar to what certain historians have termed
                    "above ground archeology." Perhaps with the assistance of historians, geographers
                    can remedy the Indiana situation soon so that the diverse natural <hi rend="u">and</hi> cultural
                    landscapes of the Hoosier state may be portrayed innovatively—especially on maps but also

            <p>This small volume by Hester Anne Hale, a teacher and local historian, is a revision of a work
                    originally written for high school students. In its rambling character and determined optimism it
                    resembles more the traditional city biography than the tightly written, analytical studies favored
                    by academic historians of urban life. It furnishes little insight into the essential dynamics of
                    development in early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On the other hand, Hale's book also demonstrates some of the merits of the
                    city narrative, particularly as a stage on which to present characters and characteristics of
                    interest to the general reader.</p>
            <p>Four scattered chapters record the expansion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from its beginnings as a planned frontier capital on a minor river <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-083-4-092"/> to a thriving commercial and industrial as well as political center
                    whose character was shaped by its extensive rail system; in this context Hale introduces various
                    matters such as the Ralston Plan for the capital city, the local theatrical scene, charitable work,
                    and the effort to rationalize the street system. Interspersed among these four chapters are others
                    dealing with the planned suburb of Woodruff Place, a mansion and its occupants, architectural
                    styles, the advent of the automobile age, and the diversity of immigrant groups. Scattered
                    throughout are biographical sketches of Calvin Fletcher, James Woodruff, Madame C. J. Walker, and
                    other wellknown citizens.</p>
            <p>There are some important gaps in this local parade. For a book written by an English teacher
                    originally for high school students, there is notably little attention to the world of youth,
                    particularly public education, and to the important turn-of-the-century literary scene; although
                    Booth Tarkington is frequently quoted, there is no discussion of the contributions that he and
                    others made to the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a capital of regional culture.</p>
            <p>On the whole, however, Hale provides an interesting introduction to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in its first century, one that serves her stated aim of stimulating "curiosity
                    about our city; to see clues in landmarks, older neighborhoods, even in the patterns of its
                    streets" (p. ix). Her book should be read by anyone interested in the past of one of
                    today's most successful cities.</p>

                    and sketches of the principals make memorable reading now. Martin wandered Indiana with
                    Bobby's 1968 presidential primary road show, finding "backlash factory

                    Martin contends that when Bobby spoke of Appalachia, starving Indians, and jobless blacks,
                    "half the Hoosiers didn't have any idea what he was talking about" (p.
                    296).</p>
            <p>Martin remains hopeful for the nation he loves, having found "much that was wrong, but never
                    doubting it could be made better" with proper leadership (p. 212). For Indiana, he ventures
                    no forecast at all.</p>

            <p>This pictorial history of the three cathedrals that are intimately related to the history of the
                    Archdiocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was published to commemorate the recently completed renovation of Saints Peter and Paul
                    Cathedral. In a brief but interesting account Professor James J. Divita intertwines the history of
                    the diocese <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-083-4-095"/> with the story of the construction of its three
                    cathedrals. Beginning with the establishment of the first Indiana diocese in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the construction of its cathedral, St. Francis Xavier, Divita traces the unofficial
                    transfer of the seat to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the eventual dedication of St. John's "Cathedral" in
                    1871. Although never recognized as the diocesan cathedral, this eclectic structure served as such
                    until the 1890s. In that decade Bishop Francis Chatard determined to construct a new cathedral at
                    14th and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Meridian</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the growing residential area north of the Circle.</p>
            <p>The most interesting part of Divita's history deals with the construction of Saints Peter
                    and Paul Cathedral. The American Catholic hierarchy of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                    centuries were builders who not only cared for their flocks but raised cathedrals in the tradition
                    of medieval bishops, albeit on a smaller scale. Such a man was Bishop Chatard. Divita entices the
                    reader with a brief insight into Chatard's character, his devotion to the papacy, and his
                    plans for a cathedral designed by James Renwick, Jr., in the style of St. John Lateran, the great
                    basilica in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Renwick and his nephew, W. W. Renwick, architects of St. Pa-trick's Cathedral
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, proved worthy of Chatard's trust. The firm employed the best artists of the
                    day to complete the interior of the structure. Interestingly Chatard conceived the project and hired
                    the Renwicks prior to receiving official approval for the transfer of the diocesan seat from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Unfortunately Divita does not explore this question, but one may surmise the bishop
                    felt the need to begin construction of a great church in order to facilitate the long-delayed action
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Papal approval for the transfer finally came in 1898. Although the facade remained
                    unfinished at the time of the dedication of the cathedral in 1906, W. W. Renwick considered the
                    structure as one of his masterpieces.</p>
            <p>The recent renovation of Saints Peter and Paul is a worth-while study of accommodation between the
                    traditional-minded forces and the advocates of liturgical change. The excellent selection of
                    photographs and the quality of the printing enrich Divita's study. Indeed, there is a
                    fertile field for the writing of the biographies of other American cathedrals.</p>

                    libraries—one public, the other private—dedicated to the collection and
                    preservation of materials that document Indiana history.</p>
            <p>The volume begins with a short informative "History of the Collections" that
                    describes the interrelationship of the two organizations, the division of collecting
                    responsibilities agreed upon in the 1930s and 1940s, accelerated acquisition programs of both
                    collections in the mid-1960s, and the most recent "negotiated areas of collecting
                    emphasis" (p. xv) as determined in the early 1980s.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> proper consists of descriptions of 809 major collections—major
                    being defined as more than twenty items or at least .25 linear feet in size—of original
                    manuscripts. Collections consisting only of copies, unprocessed collections, manuscript genealogies,
                    and local histories have been deliberately excluded. A brief description entitled "Use of
                    the Guide" explains the format of the entries and each element therein. Information
                    provided for each collection includes name, inclusive dates, number of items or size, shelf number,
                    what in-house finding aid exists, biographical sketch or organizational history note, and
                    description of contents. Two other elements that would have been of interest, and that this reviewer
                    definitely missed, are date and source of acquisition, including designation of whether a gift or
                    purchase.</p>
            <p>The descriptions are arranged alphabetically by collection title, but in two separate files: that is,
                    first the Society Library collections, designated by "A" and a numerical entry,
                    followed by the State Library collections, designated by "B" and a number. As the
                    two collections often complement, or even overlap one another, and as both are physically located in
                    the same building, it might have been beneficial to have presented a single alphabetical listing,
                    with the unique A—B entry designations used to specify repository location. Thus,
                    collections such as Amos <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Schuyler Colfax, Ed-ward Eggleston, etc., that exist in both repositories, would
                    appear together in description form for the researcher.</p>
            <p>The above critique is not to say that the arrangement is a weakness of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>,
                    as it has an excellent index which serves the researcher well in locating pertinent materials in
                    both repositories. The index would be even more useful, however, if some cross references for
                    subjects had been made. For example, "insurance" is found only as a subheading
                    under the entry "business," as is "theaters"; yet,
                    "banking, finance, and economics" is a separate index entry unto itself. In fact,
                    at first sight there seems to be some inconsistency in entering subjects directly or as subheadings
                    of a broader topic. For example, under "religion" the various denominations are
                    listed as subheadings, while churches are listed under specific name.</p>
            <p>But to put aside these minor carpings, the fact remains that this is an excellent, well-prepared and
                    presented, and much-needed <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-083-4-098"/> guide to two of the most important
                    collections of Indiana materials in the state. If only the third such collection could be so well
                    represented through a guide to its holdings.</p>

            <p>It is ironic that more is known about slave women than about post-Emancipation black women. The Black
                    Women in the Middle West Project is one attempt to fill in a portion of this lacuna by organizing a
                    grass roots collecting effort in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The resulting guide is not just a description of the documents collected and their
                    disposition; it is also a detailed account of how the project was organized so that it might be used
                    as a model to be duplicated elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and directed by historian Darlene Clark Hine, the
                    project recruited over a thousand volunteers to set about the task of collecting letters, photos,
                    school report cards, account statements, newspaper clip-pings, etc. A copy of the
                    "Collector's Manual" explains how items were obtained. Both individuals
                    and organizations like the Citizens Forum founded by Mattie Cooney and the Gary softball team called
                    the Steel City Chicks are represented. Conference work-shops to train volunteers as field workers
                    were held throughout the two states. These meetings included an address on the state of black
                    women's history plus the presentation of oral histories by local women. Two addresses and
                    three representative oral histories are included in the guide.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest is the speech presented by historian Juliet Walker because it provides an
                    agenda for future research in black women's history by detailing a large number of specific
                    questions that have yet to be answered. She also points out the need for new paradigms for black
                    women's history. The racism and sexism experienced by black women prevent them from fitting
                    neatly into the framework used to narrate the broader topic of American women's history.</p>
            <p>The volume also provides a delightful sampling of photographs. Unfortunately, however, the
                    biographical profiles cannot be used to construct the typical black volunteer involved in this
                    effort, since race is not designated. The documents themselves reflect <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-083-4-099"/> largely the lives of church-going, educated women and so leave a large
                    segment of the population still unrepresented. Nevertheless, the materials which have now been
                    deposited in historical societies and libraries provide a counterpoint to the archival materials of
                    well-known black women achievers. It is hoped that what this project has done for Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> will be only a beginning and that others will take up the challenge to document the
                    lives of ordinary black women in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>

            <p>The Hicksite Separation of 1827–1828 is the central event of the history of the Society of
                    Friends in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It sundered American Quakerism and started the two contending parties down divergent
                    paths that even in the twentieth century have yet to meet: the larger Orthodox faction in the
                    direction of evangelicalism, the minority Hicksites toward religious liberalism. H. Larry
                    Ingle's book raises hope of the long-needed definitive treatment of this event.
                    Unfortunately, while Ingle's book is impressively researched, cogently argued, and
                    unusually readable, it is not quite definitive.</p>
            <p>The strength of this work is its treatment of the Hicksites, followers of the Long Island minister
                    Elias Hicks (1748–1830). Focusing on events in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, where the separation began, Ingle argues that Hicks and like-minded Friends
                    perceived American Quakerism in the early nineteenth century as contaminated by the encroachments of
                    materialism and evangelicalism. Thus a reformation of the society was necessary to return it to
                    first principles. Here Ingle offers a number of new and valuable in-sights, especially concerning

            <p>Ingle's treatment of the Orthodox party is not as convincing. He argues that they, in
                    contrast to the Hicksites, had successfully adjusted to the changing American economy. This
                    adjustment entailed contacts with non-Quakers that moved such Friends closer to the predominant
                    evangelical culture. The Orthodox, moreover, entrenched in leadership positions in the society, saw
                    the Hicksites as a threat to their power. This is quite plausible. The problem lies in
                    Ingle's depiction of the Orthodox as "evangelical," a term that he
                    defines so broadly that few in the 1820s would have accepted it. Some Orthodox Friends were
                    undoubtedly evangelical. But when such Friends became more open in such beliefs in the 1830s, other
                    Orthodox leaders, such as Jonathan and William Evans of Philadelphia, <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-083-4-100"/> fought them just as bitterly as they had fought the Hicksites. A strong
                    case can be made that the Orthodox were no more guilty of departing from
                    "traditional" Quakerism in the 1820s than were the Hicksites.</p>

            <p>Here is a book difficult to set aside until fully read. Not that the author presents a work
                    astonishing in conceptualization. He offers little not already familiar to most American historians
                    concerned with the nineteenth-century middle western frontier. What captures the reader's
                    imagination is the thoroughness with which the author examines the important themes of contemporary
                    frontier scholarship within the context of area: the Sugar Creek valley south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Nicely written, the story of Sugar Creek comes alive as an epic tale relating culture,
                    society, economy, and environment. The work has been meticulously researched and is presented with a
                    flair for the dramatic.</p>
            <p>Chapters are numerous (twenty in all, organized into five sections). Each chapter serves as a
                    vignette to capsulize some aspect of pastness. And yet they all interrelate, interwoven to create a
                    fabric of stimulating interpretation. Part One deals with both the physical environment and the
                    historic Indians, their hunting, sugar-making, and warring in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth centuries. Part Two concerns the coming of American pioneer hunters, a kind of
                    "Tartar" movement into the wilderness. Part Three treats the rise of farming with
                    special attention given to the institution of marriage and to woman's role in forging an
                    agrarian world. The evolution of rural community with a focus on geographical and social mobility is
                    the subject of Part Four. The railroad's arrival in the 1850s strengthened commercial
                    agriculture and launched a new era of town building, the subject of Part Five.</p>
            <p>Throughout, John Mack Faragher emphasizes the common-place rooted in the growing sense of locality
                    that made Sugar Creek and its principal town, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                    </placeName>, memorable to those who lived its history. Faragher allows representative actors to
                    step forward, but only to illustrate the common picture: for example Robert Pulliam (initial
                    settler), Angus Langham (land surveyor), the Drennon family (early farmers), Charlotte Jacobs
                    (pioneer wife and mother), Cornelius Lyman (early schoolmaster), and Daniel Wadsworth <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-083-4-101"/> (would-be town builder). Faragher shows how a sense of community
                    emerged, forged of neighboring and kinship linkages, but hammered out in the local churches and in
                    local politics.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Sugar Creek</hi> paints a clear picture of a changing rural landscape. Emergent economic
                    and technological responses to the physical environment created an ever-changing geography. Certain
                    families prospered and multiplied on the land. Others migrated in and out adding substantially to
                    the sense of regional flux in the decades prior to the Civil War. By his own admission, Faragher
                    paid special attention to aspects of place in his archival delvings and carefully surveyed the
                    present-day terrain of his study area, inspecting the land firsthand. What he derived from his
                    research is a local history of the highest order.</p>

                    $19.95.)</head>
            <p>In this book Robert E. Bieder examines the history of American ethnology in the middle years of the
                    nineteenth century primarily through the careers of five men: Albert Gallatin, Samuel G. Morton,
                    Ephraim George Squier, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, and Lewis Henry Morgan. Bieder states in his
                    introduction that the eighteenth century provided early-nineteenth century ethnologists with a
                    collection of intellectual arguments, and that how these arguments "were combined and
                    recombined, —how they were tailored to meet contemporary needs and how they were applied
                    to the study of American Indians and their cultures—is the subject of this book"
                    (p. 12).</p>
            <p>Bieder's pervasive theme is the role of evolutionary thinking in early ethnology, but he
                    also discusses other themes that enlivened ethnological discussion in the midnineteenth century,
                    particularly the argument between polygenists and monogenists. An effective aspect of the book is
                    the way in which Bieder demonstrates that environmental ideas of the Enlightenment persisted in
                    ethnological thinking long after many ethnologists had rejected them in favor of a belief in
                    inherent, unchangeable differences between human races.</p>
            <p>The book is soundly based on both primary and secondary sources. Bieder has examined the relevant
                    private papers of those men in whom he is interested as well as their published works, and he
                    demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the secondary literature. His footnotes provide a useful
                    introduction to the writings on nineteenth-century ethnology.</p>
            <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-083-4-102"/>
            <p>One limitation of the book is its structure. Except for the introduction and the conclusion, each
                    chapter is centered around one of the men Bieder has chosen. The careers and writings of each are
                    discussed, as are the themes which they help to illuminate and the writings of others engaged in
                    related work. This means that the author cannot always show the full history and development of the
                    ideas which he discusses.</p>
            <p>In his introduction Bieder argues that "this book does not constitute a biographical
                    approach to early-nineteenth-century ethnology" (p. 13). Rather, he states, the book is
                    structured by fields: "The subject of each chapter, like a fugue, is presented with various
                    ethnologists' ideas as a counter subject and, finally, considered juxtaposed in free
                    counterpoint" (p. 14). Yet, this is an examination of some of the main themes in
                    nineteenth-century American ethnology largely through the careers and writings of five major
                    figures. If this does not constitute a biographical approach, then what does?</p>
            <p>Bieder, however, has succeeded in presenting a balanced and sensible appraisal of some of the main
                    questions in nineteenth-century American ethnology.</p>

                    General Philip Sheridan, privately published an account of the experiences of the trip as <hi rend="i">Ten Days on the Plains</hi>. The primary mission of this hunt was to slaughter
                    game—particularly buffalo. This fitted with Sheridan's belief that to destroy

                    account is an intimate and favorable cameo of Cody before he became an American legend.</p>
            <p>Professor Paul Andrew Hutton's comments and notes are a major portion of this edition of <hi rend="i">Ten Days on the Plains</hi>. Hutton, the author of <hi rend="i">Sheridan and His

            <p>In her own time Frances Willard was a nationally known figure. As the president of the Women
                    Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), the largest women's organization in the country, she
                    commanded a respect and following unmatched then by any other woman in American history. Yet, within
                    a half century her fame had disappeared. Biographer Ruth Bordin attributes this turn of events to
                    the nation's disillusionment with prohibition. Now that alcoholism is again a troublesome
                    national issue, Bordin reflects, the opportunity exists for an objective evaluation of Frances
                    Willard's life and accomplishments. In her work, <hi rend="i">Frances Willard</hi>, Bordin
                    presents the temperance leader as a person of great personal gifts, as a feminist, and as the
                    embodiment of the progressive ideal of womanhood.</p>
            <p>When in 1879 at its annual meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> the WCTU elected Frances Willard its new president, the membership chose as leader a
                    woman already well known as an educator and evangelist. In addition to her background as the first
                    dean of the Women's College at Northwestern University and her fame as a public speaker,
                    Willard brought to the position energy, charm, and a political astuteness that enabled her to manage
                    and direct the organization during the years of its greatest growth and influence. Moreover she
                    brought a social consciousness formed by family and religion that enabled her to see the temperance
                    cause as linked to a broad spectrum of social concerns and persuasive power that caused her to
                    influence many women and men to her viewpoints. In later life she summarized hers as "The
                    Do Everything Policy" and took pride in the success of her lobbying efforts and the scope
                    of her civic involvements.</p>
            <p>The most important of her social concerns was the "women question." Reared to value
                    herself and act independently, Willard had had two unhappy experiences working with strong-willed
                    and intelligent men easily challenged by an equally strong-willed and intelligent woman. Her
                    decision to choose a woman's organization as her arena of activity was probably deliberate.
                    From her earliest years she supported women's education and suffrage. Throughout her life
                    she formed close associations with other women both within and outside the WCTU. During the 1890s
                    when she traveled in Europe and the Near East, her greatest outrage was the victimization of women
                    in the Islamic countries. Willard believed firmly in the notion of "separate
                    spheres" and looked confidently to the day when the country and the world would be enhanced
                    by the addition of women's special graces and viewpoints to society.</p>
            <p>Bordin presents Willard as the embodiment of the ideal of womanhood most popular in the late
                    nineteenth century. Attractive, <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-083-4-104"/> idealistic, and concerned about
                    others, she did not question the cultural norms of the time but instead used a militant organization
                    to foster these standards as they related to family life, poverty, and international understanding.
                    She enjoyed her involvements and grew from her experiences, but she never fore-saw the challenges
                    future social critics would hurl at her most cherished beliefs.</p>
            <p>Bordin's work is a fine study of an outstanding American woman. It extends but does not
                    contradict the interpretation Willard presented earlier in her work <hi rend="i">Woman and
                        Temperance</hi>. It is based on a wealth of resource material. The most important feature of the
                    work is that it casts Willard's life into a perspective that acknowledges and highlights
                    her gifts while noting their limitation to and rootedness in a distinct historical time period.</p>

            <p>No historian has made more of an impact on the American historical scene during the past century than
                    Frederick Jackson Turner. Thus, despite the books and articles written about Turner and his famous
                    frontier thesis, Martin Ridge is on firm ground when stating in his excellent introduction that
                    there is little need to justify the publication of this volume of essays by and about this noted
                    historian.</p>
            <p>Ray Allen Billington's contribution, entitled "Young Fred Turner," ably

                    the effect this environment exerted on his later work.</p>
            <p>Whether read for the first or fifth time, Turner's essay on the "Significance of
                    the Frontier in American History" can readily be appreciated. At the heart of his argument,
                    first presented at a meeting of the American Historical Society in 1893, was the thesis that the
                    process of moving westward in a succession of frontiers from the Atlantic had been of paramount
                    importance in forming the American character and nation. After years of discussion and controversy,
                    most present historians accept the general validity of this premise, while often also giving
                    emphasis to other elements they believe were decisive in determining the uniqueness of American
                    development.</p>
            <p>The last essay is Turner's "The Significance of History," published in
                    1891, in which he challenged the then prevailing schools <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-083-4-105"/> of
                    historical thought. History, he says, "is to be taken in no narrow sense. It is more than
                    past literature, more than past politics, more than past economics. It is the self-consciousness of
                    humanity—humanity's effort to understand itself through the study of its
                    past" (p. 61).</p>
            <p>It perhaps would have been more logical to have placed Turner's two articles in
                    chronological order, but that is a minor point. This book will be of value to anyone interested in
                    the study of American history.</p>

            <p>This is the eighth and final volume of Page Smith's <hi rend="i">A People's History
                        of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, published over the past ten years. This volume tells the story of the
                    tumultuous period 1922 to 1941, beginning with the flamboyant Roaring Twenties, which sets the stage
                    for the devastating depression that shook the very foundation of the Republic. The author could not
                    resist, however, the urge "at least to sketch in the interval between the entry of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into World War II and the present day," which comprises the volume's
                    final fifty pages. This work is so exhaustive that an adequate review within normal space
                    limitations is impossible.</p>
            <p>The presidency of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Delano Roosevelt is covered in depth. He is portrayed as the dominant figure of the
                    1930s, whose New Deal gave hope and purpose to the nation, preparing it to assist the Allies in
                    their 1939–1940 fight against the fascism of the Axis powers. The author goes so far as
                    to call FDR "our ablest and most visionary president," a judgment which is, of
                    course, clearly subject to challenge.</p>
            <p>A major theme of the work is that "The history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> can be seen as a prolonged contest between the value of community and the code of
                    individualism." The author obviously is a proponent of the values of community. And he has
                    a definite left-of-center viewpoint. Much of his discussion of communism, for ex-ample, both Russian
                    and American style, is not unfavorable in tone. Smith states that "considering the
                    requirements of the times and the contingent character of all human enterprises, the various
                    de-nominations of communists served their country well." The penultimate chapter is
                    significantly entitled "Postwar America: Suppressing the Left"—clear
                    proof of the author's sympathies.</p>
            <p>Smith's history-writing is unusual in that he provides neither footnote references nor
                    bibliography; yet, he is able to recite numerous minute factual details and direct quotations in a
                    well-organized <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-083-4-106"/> way. All in all, this massive work is a
                    sweeping, panoramic view of two of the most engrossing decades in our history.</p>

            <p>Few state histories venture far beyond the turn of the twentieth century. Historians, whether
                    dilettantes or professionally trained, far too often focus on the frontier period or emphasize early
                    territorial, economic, and political developments. This pattern is particularly true for the state
                    histories in the trans—<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West. Indeed, while the twentieth century is nearly over, few historians have written
                    book-length studies about their respective states for this period. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, however, the story is different. Two major studies that deal with the twentieth
                    century have appeared within the past year. The first, David A. Thelen's <hi rend="i">Paths
                        of Resistance: Tradition and Dignity in Industrializing <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, analyzes the state during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
                    The second is Richard A. Kirkendall's volume in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> sesquicentennial series. It covers much of the midtwentieth century. Both prove that
                    state history, broadly written and interpreted, is a legitimate area for scholarly research.
                    Moreover, it also is a field of study that has a large audience of general readers.</p>
            <p>Richard S. Kirkendall, Henry A. Wallace Professor of History at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa State</region>
                    </placeName> University, has written a wide-ranging book on the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> from the end of World War I through the Truman administration. Kirkendall stresses the
                    significance of economic change in shaping the history of the state. In many respects, he sees <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> as a have-not state because poor lands in the Ozark Plateau, insufficient natural
                    resources, and inadequate technological adjustment have kept it relatively poor. Economics, however,
                    is not Kirkendall's only focus. He traces the major political issues that have influenced <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s course through much of the twentieth century, and he evaluates social change
                    in the "Show-Me" state. Kirkendall uses the life of native son Harry Truman as a
                    focal point around which to craft his narrative, always relating the events in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> to those of the nation as a whole. The result is a detailed state history that is
                    integrated into a broader, national history.</p>
            <p>Kirkendall's study is heavily statistical, and it is not light reading. He is most
                    interpretative and the narrative most engaging from the period of the Great Depression to
                    midcentury. Over-all, however, Kirkendall has provided a solidly researched and thoroughly written
                    history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> from 1919 to 1953. It will provide an excellent reference for the study of the economic

                    </placeName> during more than three decades of rapid change. Kirkendall's study should be a

                                    Theisen's review of that volume in the September 1987 issue (83:3), p. 298
                                    of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Theisen writes that "Only one of the writers, Ames, is even associated with
                                    a museum. None of the rest of the contributors are museum professionals or seems to
                                    have any museum experience." This is not true. With but one exception, each
                                    of the authors in his career, has been either a staff member, a guest curator, or a
                                    consultant in numerous history museums. Several of the authors have worked in each
                                    of these capacities at institutions such as Cooperstown, The Henry Ford Museum, The

                                    Schlereth) have held National Endowment for the Humanities Research Fellowships at
                                    the Winterthur Museum for extended periods of time.</p>
                        <p>Theisen also claims that "Schlereth should be familiar with <hi rend="i">Ordinary People and Everyday Life</hi>, edited by James B. Gardener and George
                                    Rolle Adams (<placeName>

                                    </placeName>, 1983), but the work is not cited." This is also not true. If
                                    Theisen had read carefully to p. 21 of the book, he would find that this work is
                                    indeed cited. To be specific, it is found in Chapter 1, Note #60, which provides the
                                    full scholarly reference on p. 32. It should be pointed out that the Gardener/Adams
                                    anthology, while an excellent historiographical survey of recent trends in labor,
                                    ethnic, women's, political, urban and rural history, is not, as Theisen
                                    implies, a book devoted primarily to "the study of material
                                    culture." Rather it is a work written by nine social historians whose
                                    professional base is in academia, not museums. Only one chapter, that written by
                                    Barbara and Cary Carson, addresses material culture in any systematic way. That is
                                    the essay that Schlereth cites.</p>

                                    museums and museum collections. Museums, for their part, often do not interact with
                                    the academic community.</p>
                        <p>I would add that whatever Dr. Schlereth says in his letter about the various
                                    author's museum experience is not in his book. How is the reader to know?
                                    As to the citation of <hi rend="i">Ordinary People and Everyday Life</hi>, I
                                    don't regard a footnote as a substitute for a bibliography. An artifact and
                                    a museum exhibition must be taken in the context of use and function. Material
                                    culture and academic research should go hand in hand.</p>
