            <p>On a cold afternoon in late November 1903, an overflow football crowd on the campus of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, grew restless when the end of the season contest against archrival DePauw
                    College failed to start on time. While the spectators waited impatiently, DePauw players, university
                    officials, and several religious leaders argued vigorously at the edge of the stadium. This
                    disagreement centered around the presence of one African American, end Samuel S. Gordon, on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> squad. Upset at the possibility of competing against a black, the DePauw players and
                    coaches demanded that Gordon be benched for the game. When <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> administrators defended his right to participate, the angry DePauw contingent
                    threatened to drive home. Since DePauw was affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, local
                    Methodist leaders were part of the crowd, and several of them joined the spirited debate. Retired
                    Gen. Lew Wallace, a Civil War hero, famed novelist, and prominent layman, strongly urged the
                    visitors "not to disgrace a Christian college by drawing the color line" and
                    condemned their "cowardice and barbarism." Almost one hour after the scheduled
                    kickoff time, the DePauw squad finally relented and took the field. Although <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> won the argument over Gordon's right to play, Coach Ebin
                    "Tug" Wilson withheld him from the match, probably fearing for his safety.
                    Gordon's absence did not hinder his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> teammates, who won a 10-0 victory.</p>
            <p>The possibility of conflict between the two schools surfaced again at the end of the 1904 season.
                    Gordon failed to return to <placeName>

                    joined the football squad. As the traditional November contest approached, administrators at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and DePauw began to worry that several years of increasingly hostile relations between
                    their students and Cantrell's presence on the current <placeName>

                    </placeName> roster might result in an embarrassing incident. After considerable deliberation, these
                    officials reluctantly agreed to cancel the contest. The following year, however, when the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and DePauw exemplified the resistance that black athletes encountered around the turn
                    of the century when they attempted to participate in college athletics at northern universities.
                    What contemporaries referred to as "the color line," that is, the practice of
                    either excluding African Americans from selected public activities or segregating them into separate
                    programs and facilities, clearly extended to American colleges and even their sports programs.
                    Moreover, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>-DePauw controversy demonstrated that the color line in intercollegiate athletics
                    existed not just for contests between southern white teams and northern opponents but also at times
                    for games played between two northern squads. This essay will examine the role of predominantly
                    white universities located in the greater midwest region in practicing, supporting, or resisting the
                    policy of racial exclusion in college sports from about 1890 until 1960. Although this color line
                    within the Midwest has not received much attention from scholars, it lasted in some form for nearly
                    six decades and reflected the second-class status to which most African Americans in the area were
                    relegated.</p>
            <p>During the 1880s and 1890s, the new American sport of football spread from its original home in the
                    northeastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to the Midwest and then the South, quickly becoming the number-one sport on most
                    college campuses. Basketball followed in football's footsteps some ten to twenty years
                    later but remained a distant second in popularity until after World War II. Male students in the
                    Midwest responded enthusiastically to the roughness and frequent violence of football and eventually
                    formed school teams in order to test their skills against squads from other colleges. In 1879 the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and Racine College of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> staged what most scholars consider to be the first official college football game in
                    the region. Three years later, the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> fielded its first school team. Other midwestern schools that soon added teams included <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College in 1884, Indiana University and Purdue University in 1887, Beloit College in
                    1889, and the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1890. Also in 1890, football successfully invaded the Great Plains when the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> formed competitive teams. After the University of <placeName>

                    rules and procedures were common. In order to exercise greater control over institutional practices
                    and reduce complaints, representatives from seven of the most important midwestern universities met
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1895 and established the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives, or
                    Western Conference, which eventually became known as the Big Ten Conference. The new league soon
                    became the most influential association in the Upper Midwest.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the time college football arrived in the Midwest, the small black population living there found
                    itself mostly restricted to second-class citizenship. Although they possessed equal voting rights,
                    black Mid-westerners found themselves subjected to racial discrimination in many areas, including
                    public accommodations, employment, and housing. Public education tended to be segregated, especially
                    on the elementary school and junior high levels. Those dedicated black students who finished high
                    school and enrolled at public universities before World War II discovered that discrimination on
                    campus was commonplace. African Americans frequently found themselves excluded from university
                    housing, dining facilities, swimming pools, and some student activities, including intercollegiate
                    sports. Although information is sketchy for the period before 1920, it is also safe to assume that
                    at least a few aspiring black athletes were turned away from their college teams and quietly
                    accepted their fate without protest, leaving no public record of their personal humiliation.
                    Although such exclusion undoubtedly happened in football, it eventually became primarily identified
                    with basketball and even continued in the latter sport for a while after World War II.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to sometimes rejecting African Americans for their athletic teams, some midwestern
                    colleges also attempted to draw the color line when competing against other universities within the
                    region. Officials at these schools considered African Americans to be a socially inferior race and
                    hence viewed competition against black players as "lowering" the status normally
                    associated with whiteness. In the <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, a handful of African Americans appeared on
                    university teams in the North. Though few in number, their occasional presence proudly wearing their
                    school's colors on the playing fields represented an important symbol of racial equality.
                    Moses Fleetwood Walker was probably the first black athlete in any organized team sport at a white
                    northern college. Walker starred on the first varsity baseball team at Oberlin College in 1881
                    before transferring to the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> for the following season. Weldy Walker, his younger brother, also played on the 1881
                    Oberlin squad. The first African Americans known to have played football in the northeastern U.S.
                    were William H. Lewis and William T. S. Jackson, both of whom joined the Amherst squad in 1889.
                    Thomas Fisher (also known as Daniel W. Brown) began his varsity career that same year for Beloit
                    College of <placeName>

                    an especially hostile atmosphere. For example, Boilermaker fans loudly chanted "Kill the

                    apparently played the game without protest and won by a score of 34-0. No confrontations were

            <p>The 1896 contest between the two teams proved to be quite different and produced numerous complaints
                    about racial bigotry, violent behavior, and biased officiating. At the start of the season, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> coaches moved Holbrook to the right halfback position, which gave him an important and
                    highly visible role in the Hawkeye offense. In early November, when the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> squad arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the visitors received a hostile welcome. At their hotel, several local residents
                    repeatedly voiced disapproval of Holbrook's presence and expressed the hope that the local
                    squad would "kill the Negro." At the football field the following day, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> officials demanded that the talented halfback be benched, but the Hawkeye coaches
                    adamantly stood their ground. Despite loud and repeated demands from the stands that Holbrook be
                    barred, the home team grudgingly agreed to play, probably in fear of sanctions from the conference.
                    The resulting game proved to be a wild affair. Fans yelled vicious abuse at the <placeName>

                    The physical contact between the players was extremely rough and resulted in numerous penalties. Yet
                    Holbrook refused to be intimidated. He scored one touchdown and was described by the <placeName>

                    had created much of the problem. The paper also emphasized that "the unpleasantness of the

            <p>Six years later, the two schools resumed their annual game. In 1909, after seven years of relatively
                    peaceful competition, the problem resurfaced when the Hawkeye squad included another black player,

                    athletic events at home. Since university officials also had decided to avoid competing against
                    African Americans in away games, they requested that the Hawkeyes withhold Alexander from their

            <p>These universities' refusal to defend their black players consistently reflected the
                    marginal status of African Americans on northern campuses and the widespread racism of the era. The
                    experiences of Samuel S. Gordon at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College in 1903 further illustrates the difficulties faced by pioneering black
                    athletes. As noted earlier, the initial refusal of the DePauw squad to play against Gordon in the
                    two colleges' end-of-the-year contest created a minor controversy and attracted media
                    attention. But what most newspapers failed to report was that DePauw was not the first midwestern
                    college to challenge Gordon's presence in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> lineup that fall. During the first part of the 1903 season, several opponents protested
                    his participation, perhaps because he may have been the first black player on the small-college
                    circuit in Indiana. Upset by these complaints, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> students staged a campus rally to support Gordon. According to one source, Coach Wilson
                    delivered a powerful speech to the crowd, "placing the Negro in a very favorable light and
                    showing the latent hopes and ambitions of the colored race." Apparently, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> students greatly respected the West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> native, since the student newspaper described him as "a gentlemen in every
                    sense of the word and one by whom all loyal <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> men will stand." At mid-season Rose-Hulman Institute suddenly canceled its
                    contest with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. Wilson responded by withholding Gordon from the following two games, perhaps for his
                    protection.</p>
            <p>When the season finale against archrival DePauw arrived, however, Wilson apparently decided he would
                    no longer allow opposing teams to dictate his team's lineup. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> officials may also not have fully anticipated a protest from DePauw, since the
                    church-related school had previously enrolled at least four African Americans. The ensuing challenge
                    to Gordon's participation by the DePauw squad did not necessarily reflect campus opinion at
                    the Greencas-tle school. In fact, the student newspaper roundly criticized the football squad for
                    attempting to draw the color line and defended Gordon. The newspaper declared that the
                    "colored man was exactly like every man on the DePauw team except in that his skin was dark
                    and his hair curly—and every whit as good." <placeName>

            <p>By World War I, as a few more black athletes appeared on mid-western football teams, this
                    intraregional resistance to African Americans' participation seems to have disappeared.
                    Instead, a new source of conflict over the color line involved midwestern football games against
                    major southern universities, all of whom were racially segregated. These North-South contests in
                    football during the fall (and in baseball during the spring) were rather limited before the 1920s.
                    From the first, however, southern schools vigorously protested the occasional inclusion of African
                    Americans on northern squads. At the start of a new century, when southern legislatures were
                    constructing an intricate web of Jim Crow laws segregating black and white southerners in almost
                    every area of public life, equal competition on the gridiron violated the basic principles of white
                    supremacy. In order to avoid friction and the possibility of last-minute cancellations, participants
                    in interregional play gradually reached an informal compromise in the early twentieth century,
                    commonly referred to as the "gentlemen's agreement." According to this
                    unwritten understanding, northern universities were expected to withhold any black player from their
                    roster when competing against a southern squad in order to avoid embarrassing the southerners. This
                    rule applied even when the athletic event was held in the North. The gentlemen's agreement
                    attracted little attention in the Midwest during the 1920s, due to the tiny number of black players,
                    the indifference of university administrators, and the limited number of major interregional
                    contests. In the early 1930s, though, the number of black players and the frequency of these
                    contests both increased, touching off several incidents which clearly exposed the color line.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    </placeName>. Upon learning about Bell's possible benching, Walter White of the NAACP
                    quickly wired President George W. Rightmire, urging him not to "yield to racial

                    </placeName> State planned to discriminate against the junior lineman. Instead he cleverly explained
                    that the university was actually protecting Bell "from [the] unpleasant experience of
                    probable race discrimination manifested in a southern city." Rightmire also told several
                    other correspondents that Bell agreed with the school's decision. Nonetheless,
                    Bell's absence from the match irritated many Buckeye fans, and several <placeName>

            <p>While southern colleges tolerated considerable racial discrimination in football before World War II,

                    competition posed a greater threat to racial etiquette than football, especially in the Big Ten, is
                    not completely clear, especially since football involved considerable violent contact between
                    players. Of course, basketball did include some physical contact, and it was normally played
                    indoors, in smaller and more intimate settings. Furthermore, basketball players wore much briefer
                    uniforms which exposed more of their bodies than did their counterparts on the gridiron. According
                    to one black tennis player at <placeName>

                    </placeName> during the 1930s, black students there speculated that the basketball ban existed
                    because whites were frightened at the thought that their exposed skin might actually have contact
                    with a black player's skin. In a somewhat similar vein, journalist John Gunther wrote in
                    1947 that the Big Ten color line sprang from strong social taboos in the region "against
                    contact between half-clad, perspiring bodies" from different races.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>A 1934 incident involving the University of Notre Dame sheds further light on white midwestern
                    attitudes about interracial basketball competition. Apparently because of its small-town location
                    and interest in recruiting white students from the South, the Catholic school refused to admit
                    African Americans until the 1940s. Although the Fighting Irish were willing to play against
                    integrated football teams, the school tried to draw the color line for basketball. In February 1934,
                    the University of <placeName>

                    Dame Coach George Keogan was shocked to discover that the home team included Laurence Bleach,
                    "the sensational negro sophomore." Keogan immediately protested about this

                    </placeName> athletic director, Gus Dorais, a former Notre Dame quarterback, promptly wrote Father
                    John O'Hara, acting president of Notre Dame, to apologize for the incident. Dorais pleaded
                    that he "knew nothing of this ‘gentlemen's agreement’ among
                    coaches—not to use colored boys— which George says actually exists"
                    and was "mighty sorry" that the problem had arisen. However, Dorais confessed that
                    he could not see the logic or justice of such a policy, since whites regularly competed against
                    African Americans in football and track and field. Notre Dame officials were also initially puzzled
                    by the incident. But after further investigation, Father O'Hara replied: "At
                    first, I could see no objection to your using a negro on your team, but George [Keogan] pointed out
                    to me that there is a difference in a game where there is such close physical contact between
                    players scantily clad and perspiring at every pore." Yet it should be noted that other
                    white coaches and school officials in the upper Midwest apparently did not share these fears and
                    accepted integrated basketball competition.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    Americans in American sports actually increased during the 1930s. In a similar action in 1934, the
                    National Football League reversed its earlier practice and quietly imposed a new policy which
                    completely excluded black players from its ranks. And, of course, major league baseball and its
                    affiliated minor leagues continued to enforce a rigid color line, as they had done since the late

            <p>This new stand against racial exclusion on the gridiron by Big Ten schools did not affect the status
                    quo in the gymnasium, however, since conference basketball teams remained all-white. Northwestern
                    University proves an excellent illustration of the differences in racial policies between football
                    and basketball. From 1893 through 1941, sixteen African Americans played at least one season of
                    football for Northwestern, but during the same period no black athlete competed for their basketball
                    team, or any other Big Ten squad. Furthermore, the willingness of schools from the lower Midwest

                    players leaked news of this arrangement to their classmates in October, the NYU campus, one of the
                    most radical in the country, erupted in protest. Outraged students circulated stacks of petitions,

                    during the 1940-1941 school year, it represented the strongest attack on the color line in college

            <p>World War II proved to be a watershed for race relations in college sports. The democratic values for

                    on which the color line was based. In the immediate postwar years the gentlemen's agreement
                    was discarded for games played in the North and even became endangered for competition held in the

            <p>The growing trend against discrimination in college sports eventually forced Big Ten members to drop
                    their color bar in basketball and pushed Big Six schools to abandon their more comprehensive
                    restrictions for all varsity sports. In the 1944-1945 season, the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> became the first Big Ten school to field an integrated basketball team. Joining the
                    Hawkeyes that year was Richard T. Culberson, who transferred from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Union University. A graduate of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> City's public high school, the 6'-3" center was well known
                    to local basketball fans. Coach Lawrence "Pops" Harrison never expressed to
                    Culberson any fears about the reactions of rival coaches, and opposing players treated the center
                    like other competitors. Harrison exercised considerable care in planning the team's road
                    trips; consequently, Culberson normally shared meals and accommodations with his teammates. The main
                    exception came in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where a local athletic club refused to allow him to stay with the rest of the team.
                    Culberson averaged just under three points per game and saw regular action as a substitute on the
                    Hawkeyes' 1945 championship squad. He returned for his senior year but remained in a
                    supporting role. Apparently because Culberson never became a starter and wartime conditions produced
                    a scramble to find healthy young men, most Big Ten basketball coaches viewed his participation as a
                    temporary aberration and did not immediately change their recruitment policies. Curiously, most
                    written accounts of Big Ten sports eventually forgot about his appearance for <placeName>

            <p>Indiana University became the next Big Ten member to drop the color line for basketball. In the
                    summer of 1947, Coach Branch McCracken signed Bill Garrett to a scholarship agreement. A
                    6'-2" center, Garrett had led <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School to the Indiana state basketball championship several months earlier.
                    Despite Garrett's obvious talent, not a single Big Ten college initially offered him a
                    scholarship. Eventually several black alumni from Indiana University contacted President Herman B
                    Wells about Garrett. After Wells and McCracken discussed the issue, the two agreed to recruit
                    Garrett, even though they worried that some opponents might drop IU from their schedules. These
                    fears proved false, but on road trips across the Midwest the Hoosiers did occasionally experience
                    difficulty in finding hotels and restaurants that would accept an integrated team. Nonetheless, the
                    university was well rewarded for its policy. The first black star in the Big Ten, Garrett led
                    Indiana in both scoring and rebounding during all three of his varsity seasons and eventually earned
                    all-conference first team and All-America second team honors.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two years after Garrett appeared in his first varsity game for the Hoosiers, <placeName>

                    </placeName> State became the third Big Ten school to field an integrated basketball team. In the
                    summer of 1950 the university awarded a scholarship to Rickey Ayala, a 5'-5" guard
                    from <placeName>

                    </placeName> John Codwell, Jr., and Donald Eaddy both joined the varsity for the 1952 season. The
                    remaining Big Ten schools gradually began to recruit black players during the decade, and by 1960
                    the color line on the basketball court had finally disappeared. Notre Dame, the most prominent
                    independent school in the Midwest, admitted its first black students in the mid-1940s, and athletic
                    integration began a few years later. Joe Bertrand and Ente Shine became the first black varsity
                    basketball players for the Irish during the 1952 season, while Dick <placeName>

                    </placeName> Edmonds joined the football team for the 1953 season. Another Catholic college,

                    learned that regulations established by the governing boards of the three southern colleges
                    prohibited integrated competition, consequently denying I.U. catcher Eddie Whitehead of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, the right to play. As the team's departure approached, several
                    organizations including the campus chapter of the NAACP and the IU student senate urged university
                    administrators to resist racial discrimination and cancel the tour if necessary. Wells declined to
                    keep the baseball squad at home, explaining that it was "impossible to change the
                    team's spring schedule in time for them to get some practice before the regular
                    season." However, Wells did issue a statement declaring that in the future Indiana would
                    not schedule opponents who refused to play against black athletes. Purdue, Notre Dame, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> promptly announced that they too would follow a similar policy in scheduling southern
                    opponents. Wells's statement prompted several hostile letters, including one note from the
                    "K K Klan," which labeled him a "cheap negro loving son of a
                    bitch" and urged him to "keep your teams out of [the] South." The public
                    outcry over the Whitehead incident forced many midwestern colleges to take a strong public stand
                    against honoring the color line in those few Deep South states where legislatures or boards of
                    regents still maintained Jim Crow on the playing fields.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beginning in the late 1940s, members of the Big Seven conference (later known as the Big Eight)
                    slowly moved to integrate their football and basketball teams. In 1946, following inquiries about
                    the continued exclusion of African Americans in sports, the conference unanimously adopted a policy
                    that was only slightly less restrictive than the previous unwritten understanding. The new
                    regulation stated that "the personnel of <hi rend="i">visiting</hi> squads shall be so
                    selected as to conform with any restrictions imposed upon a <hi rend="i">host</hi>
                    institution" by its regents or state government. This meant that any Big Seven school
                    hosting a conference game had the right to bar black players on the visiting team, if there was a
                    state or university policy against interracial competition. Small wonder then that one observer
                    dismissed the new statement as merely "the gentlemen's agreement in
                        writing."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    </placeName> had previously adopted resolutions endorsing the participation of black athletes in the
                    league. Resistance to the official policy was especially strong on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> campus. In November 1947, the student council there adopted a resolution urging
                    university officials to work to have the Big Seven repeal its racial ban and to consider withdrawing
                    from the league "if the action is not taken." The <hi rend="i">Daily
                    Nebraskan</hi> strongly supported the student government's position and published a poll
                    showing that 58 percent of students questioned favored their school's dropping out of the
                    conference unless the color line was eliminated. At a late November meeting of student
                    representatives from five league schools in Lincoln, participants adopted a resolution urging the
                    Big Seven to replace its exclusion clause with one which guaranteed that "any eligible
                    student of a member institution shall be allowed to participate in all competitive athletic events
                    at any member institution." In a surprise move, the student government at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> endorsed the meeting's resolution. The following month, the athletic board of

                    </placeName> State then took the lead in challenging the Big Eight's color line. During the
                    summer of 1948, the football coaching staff urged local star Harold Robinson of Manhattan High
                    School to join the university team. Despite not receiving a scholarship, Robinson nonetheless
                    enrolled at the university and started on the freshman team, paying for his expenses by washing
                    dishes and mopping floors. After a coaching change at the end of the season, new head coach Ralph
                    Graham decided to grant Robinson a scholarship. Graham then sent a letter to the next Big Seven
                    meeting, boldly announcing his intention to use Robinson during the fall season of 1949.
                    "Since there is no ruling against the use of Negro players," he explained,
                    "we plan to use Harold except at universities where there is a definite rule that decrees
                    otherwise." When the league did not respond, Graham continued with his plans, and Robinson
                    started at the center position during his sophomore and junior seasons. During these two years he
                    experienced rough play and racial taunts in several games, and on trips to <placeName>

                    he met conference eligibility requirements. But Phog Allen, the highly successful basketball coach
                    of the Jayhawks, publicly denied that there had been any change in policy for his teams and instead
                    recommended that African Americans participate in track and field, because that sport
                    "didn't require as much body contact as basketball." Despite the liberal
                    student atmosphere in Lawrence and the support of administrators, neither the football nor the
                    basketball program at KU successfully recruited black players for their varsity teams until the
                    mid-1950s. Several other Big Eight members also were slow to desegregate their football and
                    basketball teams. A key breakthrough came in 1956 when Coach Charles "Bud"
                    Wilkinson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>

                    after the school admitted its first black undergraduates. By 1960, every conference school had
                    fielded integrated teams, finally ending the era of segregation in the Big Eight.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reflecting on the period from 1890 to 1960, it is clear that the color line played an important role
                    in intercollegiate and interregional sports. During the 1890s and early 1900s, the color line
                    existed in the Midwest, since some universities in the region denied black athletes the opportunity
                    to compete. By 1920, such Jim Crow policies appeared primarily in competition against college teams
                    from southern and border states. Yet exclusion continued on a reduced level inside the Midwest,
                    especially in Big Ten basketball and from 1928 onward in both football and basketball in the Big
                    Six. After World War II, however, racial exclusion came under widespread attack outside the South.
                    During the 1950s, midwestern universities gradually integrated their athletic programs and
                    eventually helped force the abandonment of racial discrimination in interregional contests. The
                    slowness with which some of these universities acted against Jim Crow should remind us that before
                    1960 the color line in big-time college sports was not exclusively a southern phenomenon but in
                    reality an American phenomenon.</p>

                    </placeName> National Military Park. Thousands heard Vice President Adlai Stevenson, members of
                    Congress, including a significant number of Confederate and Union veterans of the battle, and
                    military leaders address the crowd at the foot of Chickamauga's famous Snod-grass Hill, in
                    the country's first military park. From the speeches and the sentiment noted, it was clear
                    that former Confederate and Union soldiers were standing arm in arm in a spirit of national unity
                    and reconciliation. There was little hint of sectional differences during the three-day event. On
                    the contrary, the nation and its Civil War veterans were commemorating the courage and valor of
                    Americans both blue and gray.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Few were aware, however, that during this time of high spirits and patriotism a pen-and-ink war was
                    raging, and it had nothing to do with sectional politics. It was instead a conflict between the
                    National Chickamauga Commission and the Indiana State Chickamauga Commission, representing the Ninth
                    Indiana Regiment. The dispute involved the location of the regiment's monument within the
                    Chickamauga battlefield and the inscription on this prominent marker. At the time of the dedication,
                    few monuments honoring the participating units had been placed within the park. This was an ongoing
                    process supervised by the National Chickamauga Commission acting on behalf of the secretary of war.
                    The Ninth's veterans had not yet erected their monument and wanted it placed on Snodgrass
                    Hill, the site of General George Henry Thomas's famous stand during the closing hours of
                    the battle. The law establishing the park gave authority to the national commission, with the
                    assistance of state commissions, to locate, record, and erect regimental markers and monuments.

                    regiment's bid for Snodgrass Hill as well as its historical account of the
                    regiment's role on the hill. The basis for the conflict was a difference in memories about
                    the closing hours of the battle, as well as a difference in interpreting the law that established
                    the authority of the respective commissions. Over the course of a two-year period, the national
                    commission increased its power through political maneuvering, and the Ninth Indiana lost its
                    political momentum and resolve. Eventually, the Ninth was forced to choose an alternate monument
                    site and to curtail the monument's inscription. Ironically, though unsuccessful, the
                    regiment's resistance to the national commission's authority helped to preserve a
                    record of its version for future historians. The Indiana regiment's experience reveals the
                    political struggle for the control of the historical meaning of this important battle.</p>
            <p>At the time of the park's inception the nation was going through a period in which pride and
                    respect for the soldiers who fought in the Civil War, both North and South, was being revived.
                    Memorials to those who fought in the war and commemorations to its citizen-soldiers were taking
                    place throughout the country, initially on the local, then on the state level. The country underwent
                    a transition from sectional and political divergence to a greater national unity. The "New
                    South" was emerging, and its ties to the North were becoming stronger, based on both
                    economic and political interests.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It was during this time that John Tigert
                    suggested in <hi rend="i">The Century Magazine</hi> that the country and specifically the federal
                    government should mark Civil War battlefields. His motive was more to preserve the sites for future
                    historians and students than to honor the battles, and he felt that steps needed to be taken
                    immediately to keep the sites from being ruined.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    act quickly while veterans who remembered the conflict were still alive. Boynton first suggested

                    committee, which included the general and his Army of the Cumberland colleagues, met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., and proposed taking steps to purchase the battleground and erect monuments and
                    markers to note the positions of both Confederate and Union troops during the battle. At these
                    meetings prominent Confederate veterans were invited to join the movement, and together the two
                    groups formed the Chickamauga Memorial Association. This committee evolved into the Joint
                    Chickamauga Memorial Association with a mandate to "mark and preserve the battlefield of
                    Chickamauga … to commemorate the valor displayed by American soldiers on that
                    field." Eventually, the scope of the project grew to include Missionary Ridge and the

                    </placeName> Park would highlight both armies' battle lines. Since powerful Union and
                    Confederate veterans sat in both houses of Congress, it was not surprising that the
                    project's sponsors asked the federal government to appropriate funds to support it. Located
                    in the South, it would also be the western theater's commemorative battlefield honoring
                    American valor as well as serving as a teaching tool for future military students and historians.
                    The time was ripe for ending sectional enmity, and establishing this park was the perfect overture
                    to reconciliation.</p>
            <p>The bill creating the park was written by Boynton himself and submitted to Congress through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> congressman Charles Grosvenor, a former Union general. It rapidly went through both
                    houses and was signed by President Benjamin Harrison on August 19, 1890. Besides establishing
                    objectives, allocating money, and marking park boundaries, the act established a three-member
                    commission supervised and directed by the secretary of war. This commission was composed of three
                    men who had been active participants in the battle, two of whom were now civilians and one career
                    military officer. The civilian commissioners were former generals Joseph Fullerton and Alexander
                    Stewart; the military representative was Col. Sanford Kellogg, later replaced by Maj. Frank Smith.
                    The bill also authorized a historian, who was to have been a "well informed"

                    commission. The historian would confirm the accuracy of the established markers and lines of battle,

                        <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>). This role fell to Boyn-ton, who during the battle had been

                    </placeName> Regiment.</p>
            <p>The bill authorized the states to enter the boundaries of the proposed park to mark specific
                    positions and lines of battle for their respective troops. This was done in order to assist the
                    national commission in providing a historically accurate account of the battle. Even with the
                    comprehensive <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> in hand, the national commission felt they needed
                    the various states' veterans' contributions to create a truly accurate picture.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately after passage of the law authorizing the park, the participating states set about
                    creating commissions to work in conjunction with the national commission. In Indiana, a provisional
                    commission was created that became the Indiana Chickamauga Commission after the governor signed the
                    state law authorizing money and resources for the project. The Indiana commission's job was
                    to help in "locating with sufficient accuracy the positions of the Indiana regiments and
                    batteries on the said battlefields that historical tablets may ultimately be erected to the memory
                    of Indiana soldiery."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The state allocated money and established
                    guidelines for the state commission, which had eight members, all participants in the battle,
                    including General Morton C. Hunter, former commander of the Eighty-second Indiana as president, and
                    Judge Dyer B. McConnell, former captain, Company K, Ninth Indiana Infantry, as member-at-large.</p>
            <p>In October 1893 the national commission met with several of the state counterparts, including
                    Indiana's, on the battlefield to begin locating regimental positions for the various state
                    units. This was no small task. Although the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> would be the
                    foundation of much of the work, the site visits of the veterans and consideration of unpublished
                    accounts by combatants were felt to be essential in clarifying regimental positions during the
                    battles. In the early stages of their relationship, the national commissioners and their Indiana
                    peers appeared to be on excellent terms. At the first meeting of the two commissions in 1893, all
                    five of the Ninth's positions, chosen by the state commission, were marked and recorded by
                    the national authority without conflict. Although there was some discussion about the precise
                    position of the Ninth Indiana on <geogName>Snodgrass Hill</geogName>, the national commission and
                    its historian Boynton specifically, did not protest the regiment's claim for a marker on
                    that battle site. Commissioners understood that the national body had to approve <list type="footnotes">

                    assumed that national commissioners would give significant latitude to the states in the final
                    decision. This view was reflected in Boynton's 1895 publication, <hi rend="i">The National
                        Military Park, Chickamauga-<placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, in which he stated, "As a rule, the regimental monuments are erected
                    where the representatives of the regiments think the organizations made the most notable
                        record."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over several years the two commissions worked together to establish an accurate picture of the
                    battle. The controversy surfaced only after monument sites had been chosen and the Indiana
                    commission requested that the Ninth's monument be placed at Snod-grass Hill. During the
                    spring of 1895 the designs and positions of the Indiana units' monuments were submitted to
                    the national commission for approval. As the dedication ceremony drew near, the Indiana
                    commissioners realized they would not be able to erect most of the permanent markers and monuments
                    in time. They therefore focused on fine-tuning the historical accuracy of the temporary
                    markers' positions and writing the inscriptions for the regimental monuments that would be
                    on temporary wooden tablets. In a letter responding to Commissioner McConnell's request for
                    a minor positional change in the proposed Ninth Indiana monument, the national commission first
                    disapproved Snodgrass Hill as the site for the Ninth's monument. Boynton, acting on behalf
                    of the national commission, wrote that the monument should be where the regiment did its
                    "best fighting." He further commented that the national commission's
                    judgment was not a "special decision" in the Ninth's case and that the
                    decision was based on "a general rule by which they have been guided. Namely,—
                    To place monuments for organizations at the points of their best fighting, and markers at as many
                    other places occupied, as the members of the organization desire."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    McConnell's reaction was shock and disappointment. Neither he nor any other member of the
                    state commission had heard of the alleged rule. Essentially, the state commissioners felt they had
                    the mandate to determine the site for the monument under the guidelines established by the national
                    commission and the law. While there was obviously a disagreement between the two
                    commissions' interpretation of the law, there was also a difference in their
                    interpretations of the closing hours of the struggle on the hill. The Indiana commission members
                    challenged the national commission's right to discount or minimize the role of the Ninth
                    Indiana during the battle solely on the basis of the commissioners' interpretation of the
                        <hi rend="i">Official Records.</hi> Essentially the controversy is about events on the day of

            <p>By late afternoon of the second day of the battle, the Ninth Indiana Regiment had lost almost one
                    third of its veteran force. They were attached to Gen. William Hazen's Second Brigade of
                    Gen. John M. Palmer's Second Division of the Twenty-first Corps. At about 4 p.m.,
                    Hazen's entire brigade was transferred from Kelly's field, where they had held off
                    Gen. Patrick Cleburne's men, to the Snodgrass farm. Here they fired by volley for thirty
                    minutes along with Gen. Charles Harker's brigade to stop Gen. James Longstreet's
                    last concentrated attack of the battle. As Hazen's brigade was about to leave the small
                    ridge, later called Harker Hill, the Ninth Indiana was detached from Hazen's unit to assist
                    and support Gen. John Brannan, Third Division commander of the Fourteenth Corps.</p>
            <p>Throughout the afternoon, Brannan had held the ridge just southwest of the Snodgrass farm, called
                    Horseshoe Ridge, later Snodgrass Hill. With men from his own division and remnants of fleeing
                    regiments from the Union right, he along with Gen. Thomas Wood, First Division commander of the
                    Twenty-first Corps, held the hill against Longstreet's repeated attempts to turn the
                    Union's right flank. By mid-afternoon Colonel <placeName>

            <p>Col. Isaac Suman, commander of the Ninth Indiana, described in the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>
                    what happened next: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My regiment was then ordered still farther to the right, on a high hill. It was while in this
                            position that my attention was drawn to my right by an unnecessary amount of talking. I went
                            over to see what it meant, and, to my surprise, I found the enemy demanding our troops to
                            surrender. At that moment a rebel officer pointed a pistol at my head and demanded my
                            surrender. I informed him that I had surrendered some time ago. He appeared satisfied with
                            my explanation. At that moment something drew his attention, and I slipped away from him and
                            brought two of my right companies to bear, and opened fire on them and scattered the party.
                            Our men ran one way and the rebels ran another. The officer with whom I talked reported
                            himself as colonel of the thirty-fifth [Fifty-fourth?] <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                            </placeName> Regiment, and said he was attached to Buck-ner's corps. He said he was
                            only off of the cars seven hours. One of my lieutenants went over to see what was going on,
                            and the same officer took his sword from him. One of his men fired on the rebel colonel and
                            killed him, retook the lieutenant's sword, and took the rebel's sword and
                            pistol. At this moment the officer [Lieutenant Colonel Boynton] came up that I had reported
                            to at that point. He appeared to think it impossible that the enemy had gained that point. I
                            informed him that he had but 30 steps to walk to convince himself, but he seemed not
                            inclined to convince himself by going to see. Immediately afterward I was ordered to retire
                            with my command, which I did in good order.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> In Boynton's report describing the same events, he stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was near dark. The troops having been removed on the right of our line, the thirty-fifth
                            was ordered to protect the right flank and was wheeled accordingly. The hill was immediately
                            occupied by a rebel regiment, whose right flank rested only 50 yards from the front of the
                            thirty-fifth. A rebel general, believed to be General Gregg, here rode up and asked whose
                            troops we were; at the reply, "thirty-fifth <placeName>

                            riddled him and his horse and raked the line of the rebels, striking them at an angle of 30
                            degrees, breaking their line, and sending all but three companies down the hill in
                            confusion. The three remaining companies poured a volley into our front and left. With this
                            fire the engagement ceased, it being 7 p.m.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Though they are talking about the same place at the same time, the accounts are quite different. The
                    sequence of events appeared to differ considerably and though Suman acknowledges his encounter with
                    Boynton, the converse is not true. In fact, there is no clear indication from Boynton's
                    report that the Ninth was even on the hill. Written by his adjutant, the discrepancy between

            <p>Based on the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, there was very little to support the
                    Ninth's position that the hill was anything more than the last position the regiment held
                    before leaving the battlefield. The key components of Suman's report are his near capture,
                    the encounter with the rebels, the scattering of both opponents, and the meeting with Boynton, in
                    that order. It is not until one examines the unofficial accounts of the Ninth, a history closer to
                    Boynton's, ironically, that one begins to understand why the men of the Ninth wanted their
                    monument on the hill and why they believed they had a legitimate claim to Snodgrass Hill.</p>
            <p>By the last decade of the nineteenth century, the Civil War had become a subject of nostalgic
                    reminiscence. Many, from generals to the lone citizen-soldier, had written impressions of the war in
                    books, magazines, and newspaper articles. Whether it was a <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi>
                    "Battle and Leaders" article or a memoir by a Civil War veteran such as Sam
                    Watkins or John Billings, the war was being reviewed and re-examined by veterans and the public. The
                    war was also being studied from the point of view of the ordinary soldier, whose account was
                    considered valuable.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Though not widely known, by 1895 the Ninth Indiana
                    Regiment had a history, despite the fact that a book was never written about them. Through reunion
                    minutes, "campfire" accounts, and <hi rend="i">National Tribune</hi> articles, the
                    Ninth's service in and viewpoint regarding the battle at Chickamauga was well established
                    even before the creation of the park and the publication of the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>
                    of the battle.</p>
            <p>McConnell was the author of this unofficial regimental history. His version of the closing hours on
                    the ridge is a detailed and comprehensive account that includes those events described by both Suman
                    and Boynton. In his narrative, the regiment was rapidly moved to the middle hill to relieve the
                    Thirty-fifth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, which was low on ammunition. On arrival, the Ohioans voiced some concern that the
                    Hoosiers were not going to be able to hold the hill. Why this was a concern is not clear. However,
                    the Ninth's men assured them that they could do the job, and the Ohioans departed towards
                    Snodgrass Farm over the crest of the hill to the northeast. As darkness fell and the
                    Ninth's men were aligned in a southwesterly direction on the hill, McConnell heard
                    Suman's voice behind him and to the right. He heard the colonel say, "I am not
                    going to surrender my regiment." It was clear by this time that the Union units on the
                    right had been quietly captured and the Ninth was about to experience the same fate. McConnell

                        relieved the 34th <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        </placeName>], but it fell off again a little to the north, causing a depression, and in that
                        depression the regiment which we had relieved was lying. The men of that regiment jeered us for
                        falling back WHEN THERE WAS NO ENEMY. At this the men began to murmur, and called out to be led
                        back. We came into line, faced to the front and started forward. At this moment a mounted
                        officer started across the ravine in front of the companies on the right, calling: "Lay
                        down your arms, men, and you sha'n't be hurt." Some of the men called
                        out "Who the—are you?" He replied, "I am Gen. Gregg of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>." [He could not have been Gregg and most likely was an orderly named James
                            Chenault.]<hi rend="sup">12</hi> With that they fired on him, and by the light of the guns
                        he and his horse were both seen to fall. The rebels then opened fire on us from their line and
                        the regiment returned the fire. The bullets from the enemy passing through us reached the 34th

                        in five minutes we had the enemy driven off. The men on the right went up to the fallen officer,
                        and it is reported that he moved his head and said: "Oh, what did you shoot me
                        for?" The men secured his sword and pistols. We put out pickets and lay there for some
                        time. We could hear the enemy drawing his lines closer to us on our left, and in one case our
                        pickets were on one side of the fence and the enemy's on the other. At last we called
                        in our pickets and withdrew. We found everything in our rear gone except the wounded and the
                        hospital attendants. So, again, as at <geogName>Stone River</geogName>, we held the post of
                        honor, and were the last regiment to LEAVE THE FIELD OF CHICKAMAUGA.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                            Thirty-fifth. His own regiment had one round and one in the guns. This was placed in front.
                            The others, with fixed bayonets, were formed in the rear. Just before dark a rebel officer
                            rode in on the line and asked what troops were here. He was shot by the near outposts.</p>
                        <p>Then came a scattering fire from the flanks of the rebel line along the ridge, next a volley
                            from the Thirty-fifth, and a silent awaiting results behind its line of bayonets. The volley
                            had scattered the enemy on the ridge, and the force in the rear had withdrawn. These were
                            the last shots on the right. There, after these, was absolute quiet everywhere on the field.
                            The stillness was painful and awful. Brannan's officers and men, peering down into
                            the dim and smoking ravine, saw long lines of fire creeping over the leaves, and in and out
                            among the wounded and the dead. It was a sight far more horrible than any of the pictured
                            presentations of Dante's Inferno. From this scene, with the low wailings of the
                            sufferers in their ears, they turned in triumph and exultant to form the rear guard of

                            sides and the top of the spur, and then it stood like a wall against any more surprises from
                            the rear, pouring in a galling fire as often as Kelly and Trigg attempted to move the
                            western slope of the hill. It was the quick eye and the military sagacity of Boynton, which
                            saved the summit of Snodgrass at the critical moment. The military education he had received
                            in his youth stood him well in that emergency. Thomas saved the center and left of the Union
                            army on Sunday afternoon. Boynton held the hill on the only side where the Confederates
                            could have effected anything and made the withdrawal the complete success that it was. Yet

                            closely surrounded by the Confederate lines. This was the end of the withdrawal and the end

            <p>Indiana's commissioner, McConnell, had lobbied for the position, believing from the
                    beginning that there might be opposition to the Ninth's bid for representation on the hill,
                    since much of the popular history had excluded his regiment, hi view of the accounts by Boynton and
                    the <hi rend="i">Globe Democrat</hi>, the Ninth was going to need an advocate on the commission if
                    its history was to be preserved. Even with the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> plainly placing
                    the Ninth on the hill it was not certain the Ninth would be satisfactorily represented on the
                    battlefield. McConnell was, therefore, surprised when the two commissions agreed to the Snodgrass
                    Hill marker for the Ninth after the first site visit in 1893. But after the national commissioners
                    acknowledged the Ninth's presence on the ridge, McConnell and the Indiana commission were
                    confident that the state's choice for the Ninth's monument position would be
                        unopposed.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <geogName>Snodgrass Hill</geogName> was not the unanimous choice of the Ninth regiment. There were
                    some veterans who preferred Kelly field, while others preferred Brock and Brotherton fields. When
                    the choice had to be made, the Ninth Indiana veterans could not come to a consensus and therefore
                    asked McConnell to decide for them. McConnell deferred the responsibility to the Indiana
                    commissioners, who chose the Snodgrass Hill marker for the monument site. Undoubtedly they wanted to
                    honor the regiment and the Hoosier state as well. At that time, Snodgrass Hill was probably as well
                    known to the public as Little Round Top or Cemetery Ridge. It was the most prominent site on the
                    entire battlefield, and any unit that fought on the hill deserved honor and respect. So when Boynton
                    rejected the state commission's choice for the Ninth, it came as a significant blow, both
                    to the Ninth and the Hoosier state commissioners.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately after receiving Boynton's letter, McConnell, representing the Indiana
                    commission, sent his rebuttal to the national commission and awaited its response. Shortly
                    afterwards, Fuller-ton, the chairman of the national commission, responded to the Indiana commission
                    by saying that though the Ninth "did but little fighting" he had no objection to
                    its request and would notify the other members of the national commission of his suggestion to allow
                    the Ninth's monument on the hill.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Having acquired the support of the
                    national commission's chairman, the Indiana commissioners believed the matter was closed.
                    Unfortunately, less than two weeks later, Boynton, on behalf of the national commission, again
                    rejected the Ninth's request. For the first time, the national commission's
                    specific rule for the placement of monuments and markers was made official. Boynton stated that the
                    monuments must be placed "first, upon <list type="footnotes">

                    most notable fighting." The national commission's historian said that in the past
                    the requirements were "in the form of verbal suggestions and not in printed
                        regulation."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> At this point the pen-and-ink war between Boynton
                    and McConnell heated up. Boynton appeared to be stepping back from the guidelines he had proposed
                    earlier. He also appeared to have significant influence within the national commission, beyond the
                    scope of an historical advisor; Fullerton seemed easily swayed while Stewart and Smith kept silent.
                    In regard to the Indiana commission and the Ninth's monument, Boynton was clearly the
                    leader of the opposition force within the national commission.</p>
            <p>By the winter of 1895, the Indiana commission had refused to hand over the Indiana markers and
                    monuments to the federal government until the Ninth regiment's issue was satisfactorily
                    resolved. Both Indiana's governor and one of its U.S. senators had become involved in the
                    controversy and had written to the secretary of war. Governor Claude Matthews was more than
                    forthright in his opinion that the Ninth and Indiana were being mistreated. In his letter to the
                    secretary of war he stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The governor was not alone in thinking that Boynton was biased; most of the Ninth's veterans
                    felt Boynton was waging a personal war against the regiment. The disagreement that had taken place
                    thirty years before between Colonel Suman and then-Lieutenant Colonel Boynton was resurfacing on a
                    much larger scale. The Indiana commission proposed that a representative of the secretary of war
                    hear the argument of the state commission, and in February 1896 the secretary formed a
                    "tribunal" to meet in <placeName>

                    war's representative and heard testimony from many Ninth Indiana veterans. Their accounts
                    of the battle and specifically those events on Snodgrass Hill during the closing hours of the battle
                    were the central topic of this investigation. McConnell observed that, although he was supposedly an
                    objective investigator, Fullerton came to the hearing to convince the state commissioners to change
                    their stance. He quickly realized that the Ninth and the Indiana commissioners were not going to be
                    easily swayed. He left Indiana with significant eyewitness testimony from the men of the Ninth
                    regiment. The investigation and the testimony would later become the basis for Indiana's
                    formal appeal to the secretary of war when the national commission again denied the Ninth Indiana
                    Regiment a monument on Snodgrass Hill.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>From the Indiana commission's perspective, the law gave them the authority to select the

                    spirit and intention that they based their opinion. The law stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>To the Indiana camp this meant that the state was authorized, with the secretary of war's
                    approval, to determine the positions of its units and to decide the locations of its various
                    monuments. Based on regulations and guidelines given to them by the national commission they
                    believed that they were well within their rights to make the decision about the monument site.
                    Moreover, during their two-year collaboration before the conflict, the newly cited rule for monument
                    placement had not been mentioned. The Indianans believed that the guidelines had been established
                    specifically to block the Ninth's monument position. To the state commission, the rule
                    served no legitimate purpose. For historical accuracy, the important aspects of the project were to
                    mark the regiment's position and describe its role in the battle, not to designate the site
                    of the regiment's most ornate marker. Who was better qualified to judge its position than
                    the regiment's own veterans?</p>
            <p>The state commission also argued that, assuming the regulation or rule was legitimate, the Ninth
                    Indiana Regiment met the criteria <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> unit that the regiment met the second criteria, that is, "did notable
                    fighting" or "best fighting." The Indiana commission contended that the
                    Ninth knew they were about to be captured by a superior force of rebels and still they went back to
                    the battle line. Unlike the Ohioans, the Hoosiers knew they were facing Confederates at brigade
                    strength and were risking capture and death. This did not stop them from adjusting their line,
                    marching back, and firing into the rebel forces. The Ninth Indiana veterans believed that they had
                    stood a test of courage and deserved recognition. Besides, why should it be valorous for the
                    Thirty-fifth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to fire the same volley and hold the same Confederates at bay and not the Ninth?</p>
            <p>The final issue of concern to the Indiana commission was the proposed inscription on the monument. In
                    addition to the Snodgrass Hill site, the national commission rejected portions of the proposed
                    inscription submitted by the Indiana commission. The area of controversy was of course the
                    regiment's account of the closing hours on Snodgrass Hill. The Indianans initially proposed
                    the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>… [J]ust before dark, the regiment was "loaned to Brannen" and
                            reached this point about dusk. Soon after, it having become quite dark, the enemy advancing
                            from the right rear, captured the three regiments on the right front, taking in as he
                            passed, the outlying guards of this regiment at the right rear, and some of the men at the
                            right. This regiment was asked to surrender by the captors, but it answered by musketry, in
                            which some troops on higher ground behind it, joined, quickly causing the enemy with his
                            prisoners, to disappear. The regiment remained here probably thirty minutes after this, and
                            then withdrew.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>To the state commission, Boynton's alternative account was wholly unacceptable. It

            <p>They felt that the national authority and Boynton specifically were actively distorting the facts and
                    minimizing the Ninth's contribution to the scene on the hill. In its appeal, the Indiana
                    commission rejected the inscription proposed by the national commission's historian and
                    identified Boynton as their chief adversary in the entire controversy.</p>
            <p>The national commission's position in the controversy was that the law plainly gave them the
                    supervisory authority for the entire park, including determination of marker and monument position,
                    as well as other regulatory aspects. Though the states were invited to participate in the decisions
                    for marker and monument placement, the secretary of war and his representative, the national
                    commission, held final authority. The national commission further argued that the circulars and
                    guidelines sent to the participating states had made this plain and that the rule for monument
                    placement had been in effect from the beginning. While the Ninth was not the first unit to have its
                    choice rejected by the national commission based on the "brigade line and best
                    fighting" rule, it was the first unit to challenge the federal decision and take exception
                    to the national commission's authority. This prompted a written rule establishing the
                    guidelines. The federal commission further argued that if they made an exception for the Ninth, the
                    result would be confusion, embarrassment, and anger regarding prior decisions.</p>
            <p>Regarding the rule and the Ninth Indiana, the national commission and specifically Boynton felt the
                    Hoosier regiment definitely did not meet the criteria for monument placement on the hill. More
                    important than the brigade line portion of the regulation was its "best fighting"
                    or "notable service" portion. Boynton felt the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>
                    did not support the Ninth's argument. An eyewitness to the closing hours, Boynton clearly
                    had his own perspective on the hill and the Ninth. His personal views were that Suman had acted
                    disgracefully during the closing hours. In his opinion, Suman and the Ninth tried to abandon the
                    field "without orders in the face of the enemy and before shots had been fired at his
                    line." He further accused Suman of acting less than courageously when he tried to lead his
                    men from the field.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the camps were completely polarized. While the appeal to the secretary of war was
                    pending, Boynton solidified the national commission's position by convincing the Joint
                    Chickamauga Commission in Congress to have the rule become a clearly denned regulation in the law.
                    It therefore came as no surprise when, after a number of delays, the secretary of war denied the
                    appeal. This did not, however, automatically change the state commission's stance. There
                    was another option; they could ask for a congressional investigation.</p>

            <p>By the summer of 1897 it was evident that the Indiana commission had exhausted its options using the
                    chain of authority established by law. If it was to reverse the decision it would have to be through
                    either a congressional investigation or the courts. Faced with the choice of either accepting the
                    secretary's final judgment or asking for a congressional investigation, McConnell went to
                    the Ninth Indiana veterans at their yearly meeting at Hebron, Indiana, to present the situation.</p>
            <p>At the Ninth's reunion, McConnell detailed the history of the controversy and then reviewed
                    the options available to the Indiana commission and the regiment. He explained that a congressional
                    investigation would take time, funds, and influential advocates, and then the best that might be
                    accomplished would be the regiment's history preserved in the <hi rend="i">Congressional
                            Record.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </hi> To resolve the issue, he proposed the creation of a
                    regimental ad hoc committee composed of representatives from every company. Before the adjournment
                    of the gathering the committee would decide whether to continue the fight or to accept the secretary
                    of war's decision and agree on an alternative site. McConnell's suggestion was
                    accepted and the committee was formed.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, the veterans were angry and disappointed with the secretary of war's decision.
                    Though initially divided on monument placement, after two years of fighting with the national
                    commission about their version of the skirmish, they now clearly wanted the monument placed on
                    Snodgrass Hill. Especially adamant in their demand for regimental recognition on the hill were those
                    who were captured that night and survived their imprisonment in Anderson-ville. However, the reality
                    of the situation was clear to most of the members. It was not going to be an easy task, and they
                    were not the only ones affected by the disagreement. As long as the controversy continued, Indiana
                    could not officially dedicate any of its regiment's monuments. In solidarity with the
                    Ninth, the state commission stopped work on all other battlefield monuments. It could take many
                    years for Congress to make a decision, and in the meantime all Hoosier veterans had to wait. After
                    heated debate the ad hoc committee elected to accept the secretary's judgment and to choose
                    an alternative site for the monument, Brotherton field.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>From the tone of his presentation it was obvious that McConnell preferred closure and that meant
                    finding an alternative site. Part of the reason for this change in attitude stemmed from his new

            <p>Just after the meeting, McConnell notified the national commission that the Ninth and the Indiana

            <p>Almost immediately, the national commission approved the Ninth's monument, markers, and
                    inscription. Perfunctory approval by the secretary of war followed, and the issue was officially
                    closed. The secretary also agreed to a special marker suggested by McConnell for the Ninth to
                    describe the Ninth's actions on the hill as written on the monument.</p>
            <p>On September 20, 1899, the Indiana state commission officially turned over all of the markers and
                    monuments of Indiana units to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in a dedication ceremony similar to that seen four years before. Delayed for a year
                    because the battlefield was being used as a training camp for troops participating in the
                    Spanish-American War, the ceremony included Indiana Governor James Mount, who was a veteran of the
                    battle, Boynton, and McConnell. The event was a veritable love feast between the state and national
                    authorities. Speaker after speaker emphasized Hoosier courage and valor during the battle. The Ninth
                    was recognized as the unit which participated in the "closing volley of the
                    battle." It was as if there had never been a dispute between the two commissions.</p>
            <p>Which commission had been right: should the Ninth Indiana Regiment have been allowed to place its
                    monument on <geogName>Snodgrass Hill</geogName> with an unabridged inscription? Unfortunately, the
                    answer is not clear-cut. The basis of the controversy was a difference in historical accounts. The
                    truth of this small historical controversy is a matter of perception. The answer, as Woodrow Wilson
                    suggested, is not acquired by examining the order or line of chronologically related facts but in
                    the "subtle and else invisible forces that lurk in the events and in the minds of men

            <p>From a legal and military viewpoint, the Ninth's monument is appropriately positioned. The
                    law establishing the park was quite clear in the authority given to the secretary of war and his
                    commission. It was explicit in the guidelines for the creation and management of the park. Though
                    the law allowed the contribution of the participating states in the creation of the park, they were
                    subordinate to the national authority. The power to decide marker, monument, and inscription issues
                    lay with the secretary of war and his national commission. More important, the creation of
                    regulations that would aid the commission during the course of developing the park were plainly
                    written into the law. So, as unfair as the "Brigade and best fighting rule" might
                    seem, it was well within the mandate given to the national commission.</p>
            <p>In some ways, the Ninth could not have asked for a more suitable site for its monument. Its actions
                    in Brotherton field prevented a disaster for the entire army on the first day of the battle. The
                    Ninth along with two of its fellow regiments was sent to delay a rapidly advancing superior enemy
                    force. Here it sustained its second highest casualty rate and retreated only after being flanked. As
                    a result of this action, brigade commander Hazen succeeded in consolidating several artillery
                    batteries that stemmed the Confederate advance and prevented the destruction of the Army of the
                    Cumberland.</p>
            <p>Despite this, the men of the Ninth and the Indiana commission felt the monument deserved to be on
                        <geogName>Snodgrass Hill</geogName>. To the veterans it was not a matter of tactical advantage,
                    casualties sustained, or casualties inflicted; instead, it was a matter of personal courage and
                    controlled fear. They had done their best or most notable fighting on <geogName>Snodgrass
                    Hill</geogName>. More important, the national commission could not measure the degree of sacrifice
                    the Ninth Indiana troops accepted when they confronted the flanking rebel units that night. Though
                    the hill's fame may have been a factor, it was not the major reason Hoosiers chose that
                    site: their actions on the hill held more significance to the men than their fighting elsewhere.
                    They were ashamed neither of their actions on the ridge before the confrontation between Suman and
                    Boynton nor their actions afterwards. Their sentiments may be summarized in the statement that
                    "Any man can fight a battle he's sure of winning; it takes a hero to fight one he
                    knows he's sure of losing."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> By September 1863, they had
                    fought courageously in numerous engagements and suffered many casualties in the process. Although no
                    Ninth Indiana soldier was killed on <geogName>Snodgrass Hill</geogName>, it was for their action on
                    this hill that the regiment felt they deserved recognition.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Indiana plainly could have had its monument placed on the hill without any distortion of
                    the battle's history. The battlefield <list type="footnotes">

                    markers, and monuments arranged in line-of-battle. The tablets tell the story of what took place at
                    that site while the markers and monuments identify specific units' positions. Gazing across
                    the fields and hills with the aligned stones, one gains an overview of the Union and Confederate
                    positions but little else. They are not color-coded to clarify the course of the battle, nor does
                    their design give any hint of their historical significance. A person who is not a student of the
                    battle would have little understanding of the importance of the positions or be able to identify the
                    specific unit until reading the tablets or the specific accounts on the monuments. The point is, a
                    monument at a specific position does not add or subtract from the understanding of the battle; this
                    is acquired through the tablets, the position of the various markers, and the wording on the
                    monuments. It did not add to the clarity of the history for the commission to choose the monument
                    site for the participating units, including the Ninth Indiana Regiment. The monument was a personal
                    symbol of the regiment's participation in the battle, its legacy for future generations.</p>
            <p>When the national commission accepted McConnell's proposed inscription, the Ninth Indiana
                    Regiment members believed they had succeeded in maintaining its history. Like other reunion and
                    veterans' organizations, both blue and gray, the Ninth believed getting the story straight
                    was of utmost importance.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Unfortunately, the special hill marker and monument
                    inscriptions give an ambiguous account of the Ninth's role on the Hill, partly because the
                    marker's text was abridged and partly because the history of the battle as it emerged on
                    tablets througout the park reflected Boynton's perspective.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> More

            <p>Since the creation of the National Military Park historians have acknowledged the Ninth
                    Indiana's participation on the ridge in various ways. As a result of his correspondence
                    with veterans of the Ninth Indiana, Archibald Gracie recognized the regiment's version of
                    the events on the hill and believed the Ninth was a victim of a "political, log-rolling
                    compromise"; Glenn Tucker avoided the politics but granted the Ninth its encounter with the
                    rebels and the last shots of the battle. These perspectives reflect, at least partially, the

                    regiment's participation on the hill would have been lost to history. Ironically, almost a
                    century after his death, Boynton continues to resist the Ninth Indiana and its record by influencing
                    contemporary authors such as Peter Cozzens.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is unfortunate for the Ninth that a person who had a vested interest in preserving his own version
                    of the battle served on the national commission. Boynton's influence on the park and the
                    history of the battle extend beyond his responsibility as national commission historian and, later,
                    chairman. Bear in mind that he wrote the law creating the park, established the management
                    guidelines, and was judge for any conflict of historical interpretation. His version of the battle,
                    based on the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, was the standard interpretation both before and
                    after the park was established. It is unfair to attribute his resistance to the Ninth's
                    memorial and inscription solely to personal biases and a vendetta with Suman, whose official report
                    failed to support either the "notable record" or "best fighting"
                    argument for the regiment. However, it is clear that Boynton was an interested party in the bitter
                    controversy that developed over the two-year period rather than an impartial judge. Specifically,
                    had the Ninth's monument been placed on the hill with an unabridged inscription, both
                    Boynton's and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Deveer's roles during the closing hours would have been significantly
                    diminished and therefore made inconsistent with the established history.</p>
            <p>Boynton knew from McConnell's correspondence that Snodgrass Hill was not the Ninth Indiana
                    veterans' unanimous choice for the monument site and therefore was perhaps less important
                    to them than the inscription. He undoubtedly knew, from the bulk of the Ninth's testimony,
                    that veterans were proud of their role on the hill. If the inscription had not reflected, to some
                    degree, the Ninth's role as they saw it, the general ran the risk of a congressional
                    investigation. This possibility may have softened his view of the Ninth and allowed for his
                    acceptance of both the modified version and a special marker on the hill. Though the Ninth was
                    willing to relinquish the hill, it was doubtful that they would have allowed a significant
                    distortion of the inscription without a fight. If a congressional investigation had taken place the
                    testimony of the Ninth Indiana veterans would have been entered into the <hi rend="i">Congressional
                        Record</hi> under oath. It would have legitimized the bulk of the Ninth's testimony and
                    called Boynton's account into question for future historians. However, because of the
                    compromise, Boynton succeeded in perpetuating his version of the closing hours on the ridge.</p>

                        <region type="county">Marion</region>

                    </placeName>. At a bandit's trial for murder and rape, four witnesses provide quite
                    divergent versions of the event, thus underscoring the rather elusive nature of
                    "truth." James H. Madison, who conducted numerous interviews and examined the
                    available records, likewise observes that the various, often conflicting stories that emerged in the
                    wake of the lynching of two African American youths, Thomas Shipp and Abe Smith, for the murder of
                    Claude Deeter and the alleged rape of Mary Ball, "constituted the foundations on which
                    people constructed their understanding of the mysteries of race in this ordinary American
                    community" (p. 111). He concludes, "No one today can be sure exactly what happened
                    August 6 and 7, 1930" (p. 153).</p>

                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> in a broad context, proclaiming, "This is a book about race. It masquerades as
                    a book about a lynching" (p. 1). Relatively few pages are devoted to the actual lynching.
                    The author discusses patterns of lynching, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant County</region>
                    </placeName>'s sanitized understanding of its own history, and the Ku Klux Klan's
                    visible presence in the county during the mid-1920s and its collapse by 1930. Considerable attention
                    is given to the "lines of color" separating African Americans and whites, and
                    black efforts to challenge those lines. Flossie Bailey of the local NAACP is lauded for her
                    courageous, if futile, attempts to bring the lynchers to justice.</p>
            <p>The book also examines two key aspects that have perpetuated the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> story. One was Lawrence Beitler's widely circulated photograph, portraying the
                    "shameless faces and everyday gestures" (p. 115) of white spectators gathered
                    beneath the dangling victims, which has helped keep the memory of the atrocity alive long after the
                    deaths of those photographed. Reproduced in textbooks, magazines, films, and even on a CD cover,
                    this grisly representation has become <hi rend="i">"the</hi> generic lynching photograph,
                    suitable to illustrate the point of white racism and violence without considering when or
                    where" (p. 116). The photo itself has had multiple meanings, once conveying for many quick
                    "justice" and an assertion of white supremacy. James Cameron, the second agent, at
                    sixteen had been the youngest of the three youths apprehended. Although nearly lynched himself, and
                    sentenced as an accessory, he survived to recount his tale vividly. In 1982 Cameron published A <hi rend="i">Time of Terror</hi> and subsequently launched a "Black Holocaust
                    Museum" in Milwaukee. <placeName>

                    </placeName> expresses deep respect for Cameron, whom he interviewed, and acknowledges that <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-098-2-067"/> Cameron's account, also detailed in television
                    documentaries, interviews, and public appearances (including one on the occasion of his 1993 pardon)
                    has become the dominant story. Yet <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> admits that his story differs from Cameron's and that some of
                    Cameron's "details are not corroborated in other extant, firsthand
                    sources…" (p. 119). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, could find no evidence that the Klan played a major role in the lynching
                    and that a mysterious spiritual voice intervened to persuade the mob to release Cameron.</p>
            <p>While the lines of color have not entirely disappeared in <placeName>

               </placeName> argues that by the
                    century's end there were clear signs of local progress, including the election of
                    Indiana's first black sheriff. Yet the awful image of the 1930 lynching persists in the
                    county's and the nation's memory, its meanings still fluid.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> states in his introduction, "I allow the people in this book to tell their
                    stories through their words and deeds and with less of my own analysis and interpretation than some
                    readers might like" (p. 3). The use of multiple narratives might, for some, prove to be as
                    frustrating as attempting to discover the "truth" in a Faulkner novel. This
                    approach, however, does facilitate the author's objective of forcing the reader to reflect
                    and to discern the possibility of different meanings. Others, believing the racist patterns only too
                    self-evident, might be disconcerted by references to the "mysteries" of the color
                    line. Yet the work effectively demonstrates that there are indeed many complexities defying simple
                    categorization. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> writes that the "lines of color caused the fundamental differences in the
                    tales told" (p. 79) but contends that there has been no monolithic response among either
                    blacks or whites. While <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> skillfully probes the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> lynching's broader implications, comparison with other towns contending with
                    lynching legacies might have proved interesting. The book is valuable for anyone interested in the
                    lynching, Indiana history, race relations, and the crucial, complex role of collective memories in
                    cultural history.</p>

            <p>Late in December 1932, regionalist painter Thomas Hart <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> was commissioned to paint a mural for the Indiana Pavilion at the 1933 World's
                    Fair in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, also known as the Century of Progress Exposition. The mural was to be
                    huge—a continuous cycle, <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-098-2-068"/> 250 feet in
                    length—representing "The Social History of Indiana" in two parallel
                    rows, one depicting the state's cultural development and the other illustrating its
                    industrial growth. And it needed to be painted quickly: the World's Fair would open that
                    May. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, fresh from painting two sets of murals in <placeName>

                    </placeName> ("America Today," for the New School of Social Research, and
                    "The Arts of Life in America," for the Whitney Museum of American Art),
                    immediately set to work on the Indiana project: reading books on Hoosier legends and heritage,
                    talking with local politicians and civic bigwigs, and most important, traveling the state for over a
                    month (putting some three thousand miles on his car) to stockpile the specific details that typified
                    his brand of regionalist art.</p>
            <p>Painted in just sixty-two days, "The Social History of Indiana" is full of those
                    details: the steel mills and refineries of the state's northern industrial zone; the coal
                    mines and quarries of the south; scenes of Native American artisans and hunters; historical
                    vignettes of Abraham Lincoln, feminist Frances Wright, and Civil War Governor Oliver P. Morton; a
                    portrait of newly inaugurated Indiana Governor Paul McNutt; and multiple views of Hoosier fur
                    traders, farmers, Rappites, college students, doctors, abolitionists, suffragists, authors,
                    newspaper reporters, Ku KLux KLan members, Speedway racers, labor union activists, and basketball
                    players. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>'s Indiana epic was also testimony to the artist's own political

                    </placeName> Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, unveiled about the same time as his mural, would

                    on political terms: as manifestoes of twentieth-century American republicanism and a celebration of

            <p>Hundreds of U.S. women who dedicated many of their waking hours to the suffrage and peace movements
                    are little known. They are what some historians call the "second-rank activists,"
                    but their contributions were invaluable to the work of both causes. May Wright Sewall was one such
                    woman. An educator and reformer, Sewall campaigned for both suffrage and peace, first in Indiana and
                    later on the international scene. It is her work in education, suffrage, and peace that Ray E.

                    founder and guiding spirit of the Girls' Classical School of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sewall's two-year program trained young women in the classics or English with
                    a third year for those wishing to go on to college. Sewall's interest was in providing
                    Indiana female students with an intellectually rigorous but progressive education. Dress reform and
                    physical fitness were woven into the program, drawing the wrath of some traditionalists.</p>
            <p>Sewall's interest in educational reform for women naturally led her to the struggle for
                    women's rights. She supported the Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association that in
                    1870 affiliated with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony's National Woman Suffrage
                    Association. Although perceived by some as having a difficult personality, Sewall's
                    organizational skills prompted the respect she needed to become a leader in the state's
                    suffrage campaign and then in the national movement. As such, she traveled to many states to
                    campaign for the vote.</p>
            <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-098-2-070"/>
            <p>As with many women, Sewall's interests led her from local and national organizations to the
                    international scene where she conceived of and campaigned for the establishment of the National (and
                    International) Council of Women which supported an ever-expanding dialogue about women's
                    rights. When war erupted in Europe in 1914, some suffragists, including Sewall, embraced the cause
                    of peace, for without it, they felt, women's rights could never be achieved.
                    Sewall's contribution to the cause was her work for the 1915 International Conference of
                    Women Workers to Promote International Peace and in the very controversial Ford Peace Ship endeavor.
                    These efforts added to the larger work of peace carried on by the suffragist-pacifist
                    Woman's Peace Party.</p>
            <p>Boomhower has written an informative book that works to enlighten readers about this lesser-known,
                    but important, activist. Sewall's life represents the path of many second-rank women whose
                    hard work gets lost in the glow of such stars as Stanton, Anthony, Jane Addams, and Carrie Chapman
                    Catt. This volume is a welcome addition to the literature of women's rights activism.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical Association continues its long record of publishing local and state history
                    with this attractive and affordable book about James Whitcomb Riley. This compact work by local
                    historian and newspaperman Robert C. Kriebel is organized primarily by theme rather than
                    chronologically, and, in chapters whose names were inspired by Riley dialect writing, examines
                    aspects of the writer's life and career, such as "Fame ‘n’
                    Repatashun," "Short-comins'," "Jim
                    ‘n’ Luv," and "Rever'nt Riley."</p>
            <p>The book does not plow much new ground; the endnotes and bibliography reveal an author conversant
                    with the secondary literature on "the Hoosier poet" but who provides little
                    indication of having delved into archival sources. In the introduction, Kriebel lists what he sees
                    as Riley's three primary achievements: first, "He freeze-dried and thus preserved
                    a vanished life through his camera-eye reports and his tape-recorder-ear recreations of speech and
                    dialect"; second, "Riley poems show how things remain in human nature unal- <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-098-2-071"/> tered by moonwalks and lasers…"; and third,
                    "As a Christian, Riley has been all but ignored. But those who carry a <hi rend="i">Holy
                        Bible</hi> in the buggies of their lives will forever find a ready witness in Riley"
                    (p. vii-viii). Those who already share Kriebel's admiration for Riley will likely endorse
                    these conclusions, but other students of his life and work may not find sufficiently weighty
                    evidence in Kriebel's text to reach the same conclusions.</p>
            <p>In claiming that Riley's dialect is merely a transcription of what he heard on the streets
                    of small-town Indiana, Kriebel, like others before him, inadvertently undercuts a primary aspect of
                    the poet's creativity. Riley used what he heard as inspiration for a poetic language that
                    was distinctively his own. He was no folklorist, attempting to preserve a record of life as it was
                    actually lived. His career was spent creating an appealing persona both for himself and for the
                    Midwest and then popularizing his creations through his books and on the stage. Kriebel's
                    second point about the enduring truths underlying Riley's writings is true, but surely can
                    be seen as the goal of most literary effort and not at all unique to Riley. Regarding
                    Kriebel's third point, about the degree of Riley's religious faith, others have
                    reached a different conclusion, most recently Elizabeth J. Van Allen in her 1999 book, <hi rend="i">James Whitcomb Riley: A Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are some stylistic lapses in the book that bear mentioning. While the work is documented, many
                    of the quotations used, particularly from newspapers, are not fully cited. In addition, picture
                    credits are often not included. Despite these minor editorial defects, and whether or not one agrees
                    with the author's final assessment of Riley, he does attempt to provide at least a glimpse
                    of all sides of the Riley myth. Readers should look on this work as an aperitif to the fuller repast

            <p>Readers of<hi rend="i">Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History</hi> have been entertained for many
                    years by Ray Boomhower's series of columns titled "Destination Indiana."
                    In crisp, short essays, he has taken us throughout the state to look at Indiana's historic
                    sites and the personalities associated with them. Indiana University Press has now assembled
                    twenty-three of these essays into a delightful coffee-table book. Boomhower limits himself to sites
                    regularly open to the public, and several of his studies take us to places as familiar as the
                    Corydon Capitol State Historic Site, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the Harrison homes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But he is also careful to include less <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-098-2-072"/> familiar
                    sites, such as the Ruthmere mansion in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Colonel William Jones State Historic Site in Gentryville. Most areas of Indiana
                    are represented, with the bulk of twentieth-century buildings drawn from northern counties.</p>
            <p>The best essay is the beautifully focused treatment of the Culbertson Mansion State Historic Site in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the most difficult is the search for meaning in the decisions made by the architects
                    of the current State Capitol building. The text concentrates on the most important individual or
                    family associated with each building, and the resulting capsules are as incisive, skeptical, and
                    entertaining as their subjects. Most essays include brief recognition of the various preservation
                    groups that have secured and maintained these properties.</p>
            <p>Their great variety invites us to review the processes by which we have made, and in the future might
                    make, the decisions to select sites to preserve. Boomhower's selections show a preference
                    for dissenters and eccentrics, writers and artists, politicians and entrepreneurs. The essays remind
                    us that personal associations, rather than historical context, have driven much of the Hoosier
                    preservation scene. Thus they challenge us to ask if we will bring a similar set of attitudes,
                    historical and aesthetic, to the post-World War II built environment as we approach the bicentennial
                    of Indiana's statehood.</p>
            <p>Readers eager to gain a sense of the buildings themselves will be delighted by the eight-to-ten color
                    photographs from Darryl Jones that accompany each essay. Jones is the preeminent local color
                    photographer of Indiana in this generation, and many of the features that distinguish his work are
                    apparent here. In particular, watch his use of both natural and artificial light to evoke the
                    particular effects of shadow, texture, and context sought by the architects and decorators of these
                    sites. Note also his simulation of earlier processes of illustration, from studio art to postcards,
                    as visual linkages to affirm the ties of past and present. Jones's photos and
                    Boomhower's sprightly text make <hi rend="i">Destination Indiana</hi> a good introduction
                    to Hoosier historical tourism.</p>

            <p>This recent addition to the Midwestern History and Culture series, published by Indiana University
                    Press, brings together ten essays originally presented before the "Writing Regionally:
                    Historians Talk about the Middle West" conference held at Miami University in 1998. Two
                    related themes animate these essays: a historical <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-098-2-073"/> dialogue that
                    clarifies recent thinking about the Midwest as a region and an experimental subtext that explores
                    the relationships between writing history and personal experience. The first addresses those with
                    specific interests in the Midwest and regional identity, but the second opens a rarely discussed
                    aspect of scholarly work that has much broader significance. Indeed, this tentative attempt to
                    broach the subject of personal motivations for writing history is the most remarkable aspect of this
                    collection.</p>
            <p>Central to all the essays is an effort to redefine the Midwest as a mental construct, that is, to
                    demonstrate how the various peoples of the region have identified themselves in terms of a
                    particular landscape over the past two centuries. This approach, grounded in the new social history
                    that has dominated historiography for the past several decades, is one way of coming to terms with
                    the diversity and internal contradictions of a region that has traditionally been defined in terms
                    of objective criteria that emphasized only centralizing tendencies.</p>
            <p>Kathleen Neils Conzen's essay on the ransacking of Jane Grey Swisshelm's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> newspaper office in 1858 is perhaps the best example of this approach. Conzen argues
                    that this episode should be interpreted in the context of a larger public debate about the social,
                    cultural, and political identity of frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. Swisshelm and her Yankee supporters struggled to impress Protestant moralism upon an
                    unwilling collection of German Catholics, French Canadians, Winnebagos, and local Democratic
                    territorial officials. Even though Swisshelm and her allies may have prevailed in helping to define
                    the Midwest, pockets of dissenters, like those in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, continued to challenge the region's Yankee hegemony.</p>
            <p>The second theme springs more from personal than professional concerns, as the authors forthrightly
                    admit in their introduction, and for that reason it may be the more controversial aspect of this
                    collection. All of the contributors are self-defined midwesterners whose personal identities are
                    intimately bound up in varying degrees with historical interests in their home region. The editors
                    encouraged them to discuss their own midwestern experiences in the context of their scholarly work.
                    Not all of the contributors were willing to make this part of their work explicit, but those who did
                    raise some important issues about inspiration and insight in historical writing.</p>
            <p>Contributor Mary Neth, for example, grew up on a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> farm and has written about preserving family farms in the early twentieth century in
                    the face of growing agribusiness. This should not be surprising, as many historians choose subjects
                    that are directly or indirectly related to their own background. Neth heard family stories about
                    farming while growing up and was nurtured in the pastoral-ism of midwestern wholesomeness,
                    self-sufficiency, independence, and egalitarianism. Yet she was also aware of the region's
                    penchant for conservatism, intolerance, and a diversity that belied the popular image of regional
                    homogeneity. These contradictory images <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-098-2-074"/> ingrained from personal
                    experience have informed her research and provided particular insights, passions, and an awareness
                    of deeper issues that have undoubtedly made her work more compelling and convincing.</p>
            <p>Much the same can be said for the other contributors, indeed for all historians who draw upon their
                    deep well of personal experience, whether or not they are conscious of doing so or care to admit it.
                    The difference here is that these connections are made more explicit than is commonly the case. The
                    editors and participants in this experiment have taken a risk, as many historians may be
                    uncomfortable with the notion that their personal lives are so much a part of their scholarly
                    endeavors. Yet as this collection demonstrates, the resulting history is richer and more honest for
                    revealing all of the sources of the historical imagination, not just those that can be placed in
                    footnotes.</p>

                    </placeName> women's history. The editors, however, see this volume as more than a standard
                    presentation of information. They envision a "synthesis of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history that provides the beginnings of a new narrative … for understanding
                    the growth and development" of the city (p. xix). This volume succeeds admirably in
                    reaching this goal. It identifies women who lived <hi rend="i">in</hi> the city, but more than that,
                    it depicts how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> women were of the city: their lives and work have been an integral component of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s growth that scholars have too long ignored.</p>
            <p>To accomplish this broader aim, <hi rend="i">Women Building <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> has a superb introduction that gives historical context to its 423 entries.
                    Schultz wrote the introduction but acknowledges that the "major <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-098-2-075"/> themes … emerged from a collective reading of the
                    biographies" (p. xix). The forty-one major identified themes range from the
                    chronological—"Women contribute to the commercial and social development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1790-1860"—to the topical—"Women and
                    work"; from the broadly general—"Women and
                    Modernization"—to the highly specific—"The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Women's Alliance." They include themes of ethnicity, race, religion,
                    and class; suffrage, feminism, and sexual liberation; popular culture, high culture, and political
                    culture; and women as workers, professionals, and volunteers.</p>
            <p>To fulfill the aim of rethinking <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> history through its women, every woman included had to play a role in the
                    city's history beginning with the well known such as Jane Addams and Ida B. Wells-Barnett.
                    Yet, the editors redefine the meaning of "role" beyond a visible public one to
                    include women less evident in the public sphere but whose lives made an impact on their city. The
                    entry for Sister Albertus Magnus McGrath (1911-1978), a history professor at Rosary College in River
                    Forest, is an example. Through her teaching, publishing, and membership in women's
                    organizations, this Catholic nun "exercised a profound influence …. She
                    challenged her women students, especially to use their intelligence to its fullest capacity and to
                    use their hearts, daring, and instinct to transform unjust social structures" (p. 567).
                    Another example is Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse (1909-1981), a Native American woman
                    acknowledged as one of that community's leaders but who, like McGrath in her lifetime, was
                    rarely seen as important to the city's history. Newspapers and politicians rarely
                    acknowledged McGrath and White Horse; their legacy was neither in concrete edifices nor in economic
                    developments. Rather, their work shaped institutions and social structures in the city just as the
                    work of Addams had done earlier in the century.</p>
            <p>This volume is well illustrated with black and white photographs of individuals, women at work, and
                    institutions that women built. The twenty-two color plates include portraits of several women and of
                    works of art produced by <placeName>

                    </placeName> women. Each entry is followed by a list of sources and, when applicable, cross-listing
                    to other women in the volume.</p>
            <p>The price of ignoring women has been an incomplete picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

            <p>Zane L. Miller's <hi rend="i">Visions of Place</hi> belongs neither to the genre of
                    "suburban studies" nor to the body of work that dissects the tragedy of American
                    inner cities. Rather it explores the history of the "outer city," the once
                    estate-ringed village enveloped by nineteenth-century urbanization. Clifton, the subject of
                    Miller's exquisite little study, is one such "outer city" neighborhood, a
                    place where Miller has lived for more than thirty years and that adjoins the campus of the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Miller's compact, delightful excursion into a community's
                    consciousness of space explores Clifton's changing ethos, to use suburban historian Michael
                    Ebner's term. Miller investigates how changing perceptions or altered visions of place
                    shaped Clifton's land-use decisions. In the mid-nineteenth century it was an independent
                    village four miles north of riverside <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but by the turn of the century Clifton had evolved into a thriving urban neighborhood,
                    socially and psychologically an integral part of the burgeoning industrial metropolis. From George
                    Kessler's urban park plans to zoning, to the WPA's treatment of Clifton in its
                    1943 <hi rend="i">Guide Series</hi>, Miller sees Clifton and its parks and thoroughfares neatly
                    enmeshed within the metropolitan system. By the late twentieth century, Clifton had again reinvented
                    itself as a place, complete with its own planning board and a fierce sense of historical integrity.
                    Now, however, as in the mid-nineteenth century, the town was psychologically isolated from the
                    "City as a Whole," a theme that Miller, a distinguished urban historian, has long
                    explored in many distinguished works.</p>
            <p>Miller collapses the Progressive era, the twenties, and the Great Depression together within the
                    compass of metropolitan planning. However, the device slights the impact of the Depression, the New
                    Deal, and the growing influence of federal dollars and federal agencies (the PWA, WPA, HHFA, HUD)
                    upon local planning decisions. The author does astutely hint at the impact, alluding to the
                    significance of public housing and federal highway planning in shaping postwar Clifton. However, in
                    his analysis of an evolving post—World War II neighborhood consciousness, Miller focuses
                    not on the shift from urban to federal control over planning decision-making, but to the shift from
                    Clifton as part of the city-as-a-whole to Clifton as a distinctive neighborhood, a shift encouraged
                    by postwar <placeName>

                    </placeName>-led planning under the Housing and Home Finance Administration and the advent of urban
                    renewal with its emphasis on "maximum feasible participation."</p>

                    community—an apt description for increas- <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-098-2-077"/> ingly
                    socially diverse Clifton, a place that with city and federal help strove to mold itself consistently
                    with the town's ideal image of itself as socially homogenous. The Clifton Town Meeting,
                    founded in the 1960s as a political engine for community rehabilitation, fits the model of a
                    neighborhood community development organization battling to preserve the social and physical
                    integrity of city space, inner and outer, besieged by the modern forces of suburbanization and
                    deindustrialization. Miller discusses Clifton's efforts to oppose physical blight, adapt to
                    racial change, and save historic places such as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Roanoke</settlement>
                    </placeName> Apartments and the Esquire Theatre. Clifton, argues Miller, emerged triumphantly as the
                    desirable, thriving outer-city neighborhood of today, boasting good housing, a busy upscale shopping
                    district, and a vibrant and diverse population.</p>
            <p>Miller's useful and delightful excursion into the world of the outer-city neighborhood leans
                    very heavily on the voluminous papers of the Clifton Town Meeting, while almost heroically
                    attempting to reframe the discussion within the larger context of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s planning history. While the exercise tends to blur the national
                    picture— especially the planning history of the twenties and thirties—his
                    study, nevertheless, successfully analyzes the changing meaning of community and how that
                    discourse/vision of place shaped the planning agenda of one particular outer-city neighborhood. <hi rend="i">Visions of Place</hi> complements Miller's past work on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

            <p>That slaves frequently rebelled is the central message of this examination of slave flight in the
                    U.S. South between 1790 and 1860. The coverage is comprehensive, treating everything from why slaves
                    fled, to where they headed, how they resisted, who escaped, and what means were taken to retrieve
                    them. The whole South is canvassed, encompassing both upper and lower sections, border areas and
                    heartland, urban as well as rural locales. The research is extensive, drawing upon journals,
                    diaries, and correspondence of slaveholders, but even more important, advertisements for more than
                    two thousand runaway slaves in the newspapers of five states and many petitions to legislatures and
                    county courts from all southern states.</p>
            <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-098-2-078"/>
            <p>The profile of the typical runaway was a young man in his teens or twenties, the ratio of male to
                    female fugitives running as high as 3:1; mostly black in appearance, although mulattoes were
                    strongly represented; mostly tall and strong, although a small minority were significantly scarred;
                    possessing a variety of clothing, and rarely meriting much description of hairstyle; self-possessed
                    and articulate, although occasionally speaking slowly and having a downcast look; setting out alone,
                    although sometimes in small groups; leaving at almost any point in the year, although less
                    frequently in the fall, particularly during harvest time. The authors detect few changes in runaway
                    slaves over time. "It would probably be difficult," they note, "to find
                    any group in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> that changed less over a period of seventy years" (p. 233).</p>
            <p>The extent of slave flight and its significance is somewhat murky, despite the wide-ranging research
                    effort. The authors speak of a constant stream of fugitives, of an "enormous"
                    outflow (p. 128), and of some slaveholders' struggles to control "a plague of
                    runaways" (p. 282). Yet they also acknowledge that runaways were a small minority of all
                    slaves, perhaps totaling fifty thousand or 1 percent of the South's slave population in
                    1860. Yet this figure counts all escapees, when the most common form of absconding was not running
                    away but temporary absenteeism. The authors might have probed this distinction more deeply and
                    questioned whether absentees were truly rebels. Slaveowners generally ignored truancy; they offered
                    only modest if any rewards for the recovery of their fugitives, so confident were they of their
                    return; capital losses were minimal. From the slaveholders' perspective, the problem of
                    slave flight posed no serious threat.</p>
            <p>Whatever the dimensions of the practice, <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Schweninger insist that runaways were a constant thorn in slaveholders'
                    sides. Runaways were an ever-present reminder that slaves were restive, far from content in their
                    bondage, defiant. Slaveholders could never fathom why slaves would run away and labeled them
                    "ungrateful." Most fugitives, the authors claim, could count on the support of
                    their fellow slaves. Runaways challenged slavery, although, it must be concluded, without ever
                    seriously damaging the institution.</p>

            <p>To appreciate the dogged research and hard work invested in this book, the attentive reader will
                    start with the endnotes. There <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-098-2-079"/> one finds that Philip J. Schwarz
                    has not only ransacked the archives, but also unearthed midwestern county records, walked the
                    terrain to which his transplanted Virginians moved, and sought to interview their descendants. <hi rend="i">Migrants Against Slavery</hi> more than meets the first test for a serious book: the
                    author has plainly done his homework.</p>
            <p>Schwarz notes that fully half the free Virginians who left their state of origin lived outside the
                    South in 1860. Among the whites were many who "migrated away from
                    slavery—without being expressly opposed to it" (p. 3), a large but hard to
                    define group that remains peripheral to this study. The focus here is black migrants, along with
                    those few whites "who consciously migrated against slavery" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Four particular cases stand at the center of this book. Danger-field Newby was freed by his white
                    father, who moved his mixed-race family to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in 1858. Left behind were Newby's enslaved wife and children. Three rare and
                    moving letters from the "affectionate wife" survive: she pleaded with her husband
                    to raise money to buy her freedom. He accumulated $742, insufficient to meet the
                    owner's asking price. At this juncture the frustrated husband decided to join up with John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had a different plan for freeing enslaved Virginians. Newby was one of the first
                    casualties at Harpers Ferry in October 1859.</p>
            <p>Less dramatic but equally interesting are three other tales. George T. Gilliam also had a white
                    father who married a black woman. The light-skinned George enjoyed a comfortable inheritance. He
                    married a light-skinned free woman with comparably advantaged antecedents. Together, they moved
                    North, where he became a well-to-do doctor and land speculator. The family's mixed-race
                    ancestry ceased to be acknowledged, and they passed for white. After his wife's death,
                    Gilliam married a white woman and raised a second family.</p>
            <p>The prosperous Samuel Gist died in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    and freedwomen were placed on inferior lands in <placeName>

                    individual ownership. An undertaking that had the potential to enable a significant group of African
                    Americans to participate in the American dream was stunted by the executors, who believed that
                    former slaves could never fend for themselves.</p>

                    prison and spent a number of years thereafter more or less on the run. In 1828, he arrived in <placeName>

                    Schwarz adds dimension to the romanticized Coles mural. This book demonstrates that one must address
                    issues of race and slavery to understand the early history of the region.</p>

            <p>Edward Steers, Jr., has written an account of Lincoln's assassination that is compelling,
                    fascinating, and well documented. He notes, "I have relied principally on primary sources
                    and sought independent corroboration of the recollections of those persons who figured prominently
                    in the story" (p. xi). Though threats had been made on Lincoln's life even before
                    he assumed the presidency, the level of danger rose after the issuance of the Emancipation
                    Proclamation. By the end of 1863, "black flag warfare" was apparently officially
                    adopted by each of the belligerents, so that both "Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln were
                    viewed as legitimate military targets" (p. 42).</p>
            <p>John Wilkes Booth, though the key player in the plans to kidnap Lincoln and then to assassinate him,
                    did not act alone. Steers makes a convincing argument that a much larger conspiracy was involved,
                    beginning with Booth's immediate cohorts and going all the way up to at least the
                    Confederate secret service. Dr. Samuel Mudd was not just a doctor who unknowingly treated an
                    assassin's broken leg, but a Confederate sympathizer who knew Booth from previous
                    encounters and was much more involved in the great tragedy than he ever admitted. Mudd escaped
                    hanging by only one vote of the military tribunal. Mary Surratt was not an innocent bystander and
                    thus was hung justly. She was a coconspirator in the plot. Steers has a wonderful ability to make
                    the principal figures in Lincoln's assassination become real people, to sense their driven
                    personalities, to feel their fanatical commitment to a lost cause.</p>
            <p>Steers gives a carefully detailed and well-paced account of Booth's attempt to escape
                    pursuing federal authorities. One can feel <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-098-2-081"/> the pain in the
                    killer's leg as he desperately flees from one hiding place to another. Twelve days after
                    the event at Ford's Theater the perpetrator is shot and killed in Garrett's
                    burning barn in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Steers dismisses some of the erroneous theories that have surrounded the assassination over the
                    years. One such conjecture is that Lincoln's secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, bore
                    responsibility for the murder. Another fallacious theory, at one time given great credence, is that
                    Booth escaped the burning barn and lived on for several years, to die eventually by his own hand.
                    Someone else, this theory goes, was killed at Garrett's farm. Steers effectively
                    demonstrates that such theories bear no basis in fact.</p>
            <p>Relying heavily upon the trial records, Steers tells the story of what happened at that famous
                    military tribunal. The book closes with a moving account of the 1,664-mile journey of
                    Lincoln's body to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Steers has written a good book. Lincoln buffs, as well as general readers, will appreciate his
                    attention to the details and evidence of a well-known story.</p>

            <p>More even than other female reformers, Carry Nation has suffered considerable indignities in the
                    historical record. Wildly wielding her hatchet and Bible, she was a ready caricature, and the
                    newspaper illustrations have become standard fare in history textbooks. Her biographers were not
                    kind; they did not sympathize with her cause or endorse her methods. She has been portrayed, with a
                    few exceptions, as a well-meaning crank, perhaps a little crazy, more than a little ridiculous. She
                    has been an easy target for male critics who dislike uppity women and for those who like a drink now
                    and then.</p>
            <p>Nation's fame, or notoriety, did not come to her until nearly the last decade of her life.
                    Before her first saloon "hatchetation," she had lost her first husband to drink
                    and had moved throughout the Midwest with her second, often barely escaping poverty. She was both
                    active and contentious in local religious and reform circles and by 1900 was president of the Kiowa, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She was fifty-three when she began

                    </placeName> and was soon accepting invitations to visit a town, speak, and destroy property.
                    Saloonkeepers did not always oppose <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-098-2-082"/> her. There was a certain
                    complicity as each side played the other for publicity. Nation preached from pulpits, lobbied from
                    legislative podiums, reenacted her raids on vaudeville stages, and even performed in "Ten
                    Nights in a Barroom." She forced <placeName>

                    complicated.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Carry A. Nation: Retelling the Life</hi>, Fran Grace rescues Nation from her
                    detractors. Tracking down scattered manuscript sources, closely—if
                    uncritically—reading Nation's autobiography, and following the news accounts of
                    Nation's activities, Grace portrays a radical reformer, street performer, and modern
                    feminist who was devout, sincere, and smart enough to exploit her own celebrity for the cause. Grace
                    is not always a fluent writer. There are too many quotations, and it is often unclear whether
                    someone is being quoted or whether the author simply is using quotation marks to reemphasize a
                    point. When she is retelling the life, however, Grace writes the best biography of Nation we have.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, biography is only half of the book. Her attempts at "biography/cultural
                    history" are not as successful, although there are valuable insights. Grace's
                    analysis of the contrasting regional ideals of "true womanhood" and "good
                    womanhood" works well to illuminate the various responses around the country to Nation. But
                    at every turn Grace interrupts her story to find a parallel in Nation's experience with
                    other women, somewhere, anywhere. Nation's mention of a female friend in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> inspires a riff on nineteenth-century female relationships and speculation about
                    speculation about their sexuality. Similarly, Nation's claim that she heard God's
                    voice prompts Grace to comment on the theme of God speaking to women found in the long-running
                    "autogynography" (women's autobiography) literature. This digression is
                    in turn interrupted for a mocking aside on President William McKinley's prayers to God for
                    guidance on the Philippines. At times the text reads like a labyrinth of special-pleading footnotes
                    from which the reader cannot escape. Gender is a useful analytical category; it should not be a
                    bludgeon.</p>
            <p>There are other weaknesses. Nation's adversaries appear not just as disagreeable, but
                    consistently as evil, stupid, or misogynistic. Nation understood better than Grace why the barkeeps,
                    the politicians, and the judges opposed her. In <hi rend="i">Carry A. Nation: Retelling the
                    Life</hi> there is too much heated argument. The book is better where it casts light.</p>

                    orientation. They reject the core elements of the dominant culture, including individualism with its
                    emphasis on personal autonomy, the assumption that progress is inherently good, and that national
                    loyalty should supercede local ethnic identity. According to these scholars the hallmark of being
                    old order is to give up individual identity for the sake of a corporate identity; to submit fully to
                    a church discipline which encompasses nearly every aspect of life; to live a life of nonconformity
                    to the fads and fashions of the world; and never to use any form of coercion to control
                    one's destiny, including the force of the state in a court of law.</p>
            <p>Among the permutations of old order life are systems that differ significantly from one another. In
                    the Hutterite communal system, people live collectively on large agricultural tracts or colonies and
                    farm with the latest and most sophisticated technology available, and they are largely isolated from
                    the world around them. By contrast, their Amish and Mennonite cousins, who share their Anabaptist
                    heritage, live in family units on their own property. These old orders practice symbolic separation,
                    including the use of horse-drawn transportation and the maintenance of a German dialect as their
                    first language, rather than literal isolation from the world. Finally, the Brethren are plain in
                    dress but live in modern homes, drive cars, and speak English in church.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the argument presented here is that to be old order is to share a certain state of mind.
                    The outward symbols vary, particularly the way the boundary between the group and the world is
                    drawn, but the inner life of the member consistently includes a spirit of humility rather than
                    pride, trust in the wisdom of tradition rather than the vicissitudes of change, and above all the
                    assumption that the will of the community is far superior to the interests of the individual.</p>
            <p>The strength of this book is its comparative framework. While much has been written about the Amish,
                    and to a lesser degree about the Hutterites, this book invites the reader to consider four related
                    groups under one umbrella. Most readers will encounter the Old Order Mennonites and Old German
                    Baptist Brethren for the first time. Scholars and a popular audience will not be disappointed in the
                    degree of detail on how and why these groups live the way they do. The concluding chapters provide a
                    fascinating glimpse into the old <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-098-2-084"/> order dance with modernity.
                    The authors try to describe the specific mechanisms of boundary maintenance (that can be strikingly
                    different) that each group employs to maintain its fundamental character. They provide ample
                    evidence to suggest that there is no imminent threat that any of these groups will disappear.
                    Ironically, the old orders are thriving at a moment in history when their way of life is seemingly
                    most threatened by outside intervention, via the tourists who flock to their communities and their
                    movement into the mainstream of the economy.</p>

            <p>Our understanding of unionism in the 1930s is central to our understanding of organized labor in
                    contemporary America. James D. Rose explores the rise of steel unionism from the shop-floor
                    perspective, presenting intriguing findings that engage some of the central interpretive
                    controversies in the field.</p>
            <p>The gigantic Duquesne mill, stretching along the <geogName>Monongahela River</geogName> near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was a key component of the nation's steel industry. Established in the 1880s
                    as a competitor to Andrew Carnegie's empire, the plant soon was absorbed by Carnegie;
                    modernized and expanded, it became one of the most important units in Carnegie Steel and, after
                    1901, in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Steel. Employing thousands, technologically advanced (for a while), and dominating a
                    community with a diverse population of native-born whites, African Americans, and a multitude of
                    European immigrant groups, Duquesne is an excellent platform from which to explore shop-floor
                    activism and steel unionism.</p>
            <p>Rose's study stretches from the appearance of a lodge of the Amalgamated Association of Iron
                    and Steel Workers, two months after the mill's opening, through the successful organizing
                    campaigns of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) in the 1930s, to the union's
                    entrenchment in the plant by World War II. Early sections describe the formation of mill and
                    community, shop-floor operations, unionization efforts, and such conflicts as the Great Steel Strike
                    of 1919. The picture that emerges is a complex one of both a mill and a town divided by ethnicity,
                    skill, and work experiences.</p>
            <p>The book's heart is its treatment of the depression era. Here, Rose enters several
                    intertwined debates about unionism in the 1930s: the <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-098-2-085"/> extent to
                    which rank-and-file militancy, rather than the actions of government and national union leadership,
                    underlay the upsurge of organizing in the early New Deal; whether this militancy represented a lost
                    opportunity for a less-bureaucratized, more democratic labor movement; the degree to which American
                    workers had transcended their diverse ethnic and cultural origins to develop a culture of unity; and
                    the nature of the employee representation plans of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
            <p>Rose's findings contribute substantially to these debates. He describes a workforce that
                    remained deeply divided by ethnicity, skill, and work experience, one not characterized by the unity
                    some historians have described. These divisions had a profound impact on unionization efforts, with
                    both the Amalgamated and SWOC finding it difficult to unite their core
                    constituency—unskilled hourly workers of Eastern European origin and African
                    Americans—with skilled tonnage workers and skilled tradesmen, often native-born of
                    northern and western European ethnicity. A complicating factor was U.S. Steel's Employee
                    Representation Plan (ERP). Established as a mechanism to prevent unionization and dominated to a
                    significant degree by management, the ERP was for many skilled workers an adequate and effective
                    means for meeting their needs for representation—for many, preferable to an independent
                    union.</p>
            <p>This contention challenges the prevailing view, which dismisses ERP-type organizations as simply
                    company unions and their advocates as management lackeys; at Duquesne, activists used the
                    organization to improve the conditions of skilled workers, and they developed work provisions,
                    grievance procedures, and other mechanisms that were adopted by the eventually successful SWOC
                    organization. Further, Rose argues that Duquesne's rank-and-file movement was inadequate in
                    bringing unionization to the mill. Only a favorable national labor policy and a highly structured
                    national union organization could accomplish this. He thus presents a strong alternative reading to
                    those who argue that CIO unions chose a cautious, bureaucratic mode of operation that stifled a
                    genuine grassroots union movement.</p>
            <p>Rose's central assertions are likely to be disputed, and of course the degree to which the
                    Duquesne experience reflected broader patterns in 1930s working-class activism will be debated, but
                    clearly his in-depth analysis of labor activism in this mill is an impressive, challenging, and
                    thought-provoking contribution to our understanding of American working class history.</p>

            <p>This timely book is meticulously executed. It will become a staple monograph on the history of the
                    domestic surveillance of African Americans during World War I and the history of the black
                    leadership's response to the "war to end all wars." Ellis exhibits an
                    uncanny ability to peruse and then tease out an epic narrative of African Americans both as objects
                    and agents that is truly extraordinary and is testimony to his impressive command of government
                    intelligence files, archival sources that center on both black and white racial activists, an array
                    of newspapers that give insights into the struggles and dilemmas, and the standard collected primary
                    and secondary sources.</p>
            <p>This excellent work covers the history of African Americans' reactions to the war from W. E.
                    B. DuBois's early hawkish articles in <hi rend="i">The Crisis</hi> in 1917, referring to
                    its presumably transformative effects on American democracy and government, to the extinguishing in
                    1919 of most "hopes that the war would rapidly advance the cause of black freedom"
                    (p. 225).</p>
            <p>Between these enclosures, Ellis makes his readers aware of the Wilson administration's
                    reluctance to alienate its southern constituencies by refusing either to address the odious domestic
                    problem of lynching forthrightly or to confront—to use Ellis's
                    wording—"the profound sense of alienation which very many African Americans felt
                    from most aspects of American society, at a time when they might have expected to alter their
                    opinions or at least moderate their complaints, for the sake of the war effort" (p. 229).</p>
            <p>The drama of the recalcitrant Wilson administration, which detected unrest among a supposedly docile
                    and impressionable black population believed to be peculiarly susceptible to pro-German propaganda
                    and other forms of instigation, and conservative black racial leaders (such Bookerites as Emmett J.
                    Scott and Robert Russa Moton) are pitted against radical editors and activists, such as William <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Chandler Owen, Cyril Briggs, and Hubert H. Harrison. Floating somewhere between these
                    opposition-al groups are W. E. B. Du Bois, Joel Springarn, and Walter Howard Loving.</p>
            <p>If the book has a hero, it is Loving, who looms over the work in a shadowy way. A former military
                    officer who worked for the Military Intelligence Branch, Loving tried "to bring about
                    adjustments in the tone of black protest so that it would not be misconstrued and suppressed, while
                    at the same time [he tried] to minimize the gross insen-sitivities of the
                    government—virtually impossible objectives in the dual contexts of fundamental racial
                    discrimination and increasing race <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-098-2-087"/> consciousness."
                    Ellis astutely points out that "Loving appears to have some small, but tangible effect on
                    both of his audiences" (p. 119).</p>
            <p>Of particular significance for persons interested in Indiana history is Ellis's sketch of
                    Madame C. J. Walker's International League of Darker Peoples that, because of its embrace
                    of Japanese radicals, came under surveillance and later failed to affect the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Peace Conference.</p>
            <p>In short, Ellis has given us a thorough, judicious work that all serious students of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 2000. Pp. xiii, 400. Notes, tables, figures, index. $34.95.)</head>
            <p>To those who follow religion in America, Jan Shipps is perhaps the best-known non-Mormon historian of
                    and commentator on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Shipps has
                    "sojourned" among the Mormons literally, intellectually, and spiritually for the
                    past forty years. As a consequence, her remarks have a ring of truth that has long resonated with
                    readers both inside and outside the faith. This book offers a cornucopia of observations and
                    insights in nearly twenty essays culled from previously published classics as well as heretofore
                    unpublished gems. It is the harvest of a long and fruitful career. Not surprisingly, this volume won
                    the annual "Best Book" award from the Mormon History Association.</p>
            <p>The book considers a delightful array of topics on both historical and contemporary Mormonism.
                    Shipps's writing style is accessible and engaging, all the more so in this volume because
                    of the conscious insertion of autobiographical material as she reflects on her experiences. One does
                    not have to be a university professor to enjoy this book. The nonspecialist simply curious about the
                    religion of the clean-cut and pleasant young Mormon missionaries who pass through our neighborhoods
                    will learn much by reading <hi rend="i">Sojourner in the Promised Land.</hi> The chapter
                    "Is Mormonism Christian? Reflections on a Complicated Question" (pp. 335-57) alone
                    is worth the price of the volume. Similarly helpful is "Joseph Smith and the Creation of
                    Mormon Theology" (pp. 289-301), which was hammered out on the anvil of Shipps's
                    public communication experience as she attempted to "get all the basic information across
                    without creating confusion and misunderstanding" (p. 283). In the same useful cate- <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-098-2-088"/> gory to readers hoping to get an introductory handle on the
                    Latter-day Saint experience is her "Capsule Bibliography of Mormonism" (pp.
                    164-69).</p>
            <p>Of likely interest to both academics and generalists will be the first section in the book, which
                    contains her seminal studies of how Americans over the years have perceived the Mormons as well as
                    how the Latter-day Saints themselves have viewed those outside their church. Readers interested in
                    the art and challenge of writing history, especially religious history, will find numerous sage
                    observations in <hi rend="i">Sojourner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The glass, of course, is never completely full. No book is without its flaws. To be sure, as a
                    historian of Mormonism, I had my quibbles with some of Shipps's interpretations. Yet, when
                    the glass is 90 percent full, and especially in the compass of a short review like this, it seems
                    petty to focus on them. <hi rend="i">Sojourner</hi> is written by someone at the top of her game. It
                    exudes excellence and deserves a careful read.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I wonder if I might comment on Professor Reed's recent review, which
                                    has only just reached me, of my biography of Alfred C. Kinsey—<hi rend="i">Sex The Measure of all Things.</hi> Professor Reed asserts that James
                                    Jones, the author of a previous biography, "[made] clear his respect for
                                    Kinsey whose ‘great accomplishment was to take his pain and suffering and
                                    use it to transform himself into an instrument of social
                                    reform’." This is a quotation from Jones p. 772.</p>
                        <p>What Reed fails to note, or report since he can hardly have failed to notice it, is
                                    that Jones had spent many of the previous 771 pages in a concerted and misguided
                                    attack, partly on Kinsey's character, but principally on his motives and
                                    his methodology as regards his male homosexual statistics.</p>
                        <p>There are two sides to this—Kinsey's figures and his use of them.
                                    Jones asserted that Kinsey collected far too many male homosexual histories. This is
                                    perfectly true. What Jones did not point out was that Kinsey also collected far too
                                    many sex offender histories and far too many juvenile sex histories. He did this
                                    because he planned full scale books on the influence of child upbringing and sex
                                    education on future sexual development and behaviour, on sex offenders and on
                                    homosexuality. What Jones also failed to point out was that when Kinsey came to his
                                    first published work, the <hi rend="i">Male</hi> report, he did not use the juvenile
                                    or sex offender histories except in individual cases, and he drastically scaled down
                                    the male homosexual figures so that they conformed with the rest of his sample (see
                                    my <hi rend="i">Kinsey</hi> pp. 282-286).</p>
                        <p>The reason, as Reed might have indicated, why Jones did not make the necessary
                                    qualifications to his quoting of these figures is that he had another use for them.
                                    They "virtually guaranteed," wrote Jones, "what he was
                                    looking for" (Jones, p. 533)—that is, too many homosexuals. As a
                                    result his work was seriously "flawed" and
                                    "skewed." (Too many references, but see Jones pp. 349, 376, 387,
                                    516, 522, 533, 541).</p>
                        <p>What the reader is meant to infer is that Kinsey did this so that he could make out
                                    there were far more male homosexuals than there were. And this is precisely what
                                    reviewers <hi rend="i">did</hi> infer. I quoted ten leading reviews from both sides
                                    of the Atlantic—and could have quoted many more. Here are two. Julian
                                    Barnes, <hi rend="i">Sunday Times</hi> (UK), 9 November 1997: "…
                                    resulted in his research being seriously skewed in favour of homosexuals."
                                    Terry Teachout, <hi rend="i">The National Review</hi> (US), 13 October 1997:
                                    "… sought out as many male interviewees as possible…
                                    [and] vastly overestimated the incidence of homosexual behavior in
                                    America." In Britain, <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> (2 January, 1998)
                                    actually ran a leader on the apparently deliberately skewed science of Kinsey. (My
                                        <hi rend="i">Kinsey</hi> pp. 366, 487, 488).</p>
                        <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-098-2-090"/>
                        <p>In fact, analysis of Kinsey's figures and his use of them shows them to have
                                    been scrupulously used and interpreted, and as accurate as they could have been
                                    given the statistical science of the day. Nothing was "skewed,"
                                    nothing "flawed." (See my <hi rend="i">Kinsey</hi> pp. 282-286,
                                    355-369).</p>
                        <p>I answer at some length, not just because the subject is complicated but because to
                                    accuse a scientist of cheating on his evidence is the most serious allegation it is
                                    possible to make. The damage to Kinsey's reputation has been incalculable.
                                    It is in the interests both of science and historical scholarship that this false
                                    accusation is refuted; it should not be defended, which is in effect what Professor
                                    Reed has done.</p>

                        <p>In my short review, I did not deal with the controversies surrounding
                                    Kinsey's statistical methods. I did observe that
                                    "Gathorne-Hardy's case for Kinsey is strong on some issues,
                                    including Kinsey's methodology and the place of his increasingly compulsive
                                    personal sexual conduct within his research…." I do not think
                                    that Jones slandered Kinsey in the way that Gathorne-Hardy implies in his biography
                                    of Kinsey and in his response to my <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> review. My reading of
                                    Jones did not lead me to the conclusion that Kinsey was a scientific fraud. I stand
                                    by my observation that Gathorne-Hardy's "special empathy [for
                                    Kinsey] is a poor substitute for the critical perspective that Kinsey commands as
                                    one of the modern world's most important advocates of sexual
                                    reform."</p>
