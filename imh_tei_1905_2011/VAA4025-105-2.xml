                         make the installation of the mural panels at IU a central feature in his
                         campaign to expand and beau- tify the campus. But the panels were so
                         enormous, so tall and wide, that no single building on campus could display
                         them simultaneously. Since 1940, then, the great bulk of the mural panels
                         have been broken apart. What was shown in <placeName>

                         three discrete venues: the IU Auditorium, the University Theater, and a
                         classroom in Woodburn Hall. Controversial in their day, they serve even now
                         as the focus for continued dispute.</p>
                    <p>Today, the controversial aspect of the mural sequence has little to do with
                         its rough-hewn women or its dignified working folks. It has everything to
                         do, however, with a single feature of one panel--Cultural panel 10,

                         hospital scene, with an attentive white nurse providing a meal to a black
                         child in an integrated hospital. [see plate 9] The juxtaposition and
                         placement encouraged interpretive ambiguity. And, thinking nationally,
                         other cam- puses house far more troublesome artworks--the Tiffany window
                         extolling the Confederacy in Ventress Hall on the Ole Miss campus, for
                         instance, or Dartmouth College&apos;s Hovey murals, representing rum-
                         drunk Native Americans. Still, the mere presence of a burning cross in a
                         public classroom has encouraged generations of students to sit-in, to
                         march, to vandalize, or to petition for the removal of this particular
                         panel.</p>
                    <p>If you look at the murals today, situated unceremoniously in uni- versity

                         From Benton&apos;s perspective, though, it was no surprise:

                         fights with other artists over their work, and adamant political stands. As
                         art historian Henry Adams writes, &quot;from childhood Thomas Hart
                         Benton was constantly engaged in controversy.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >3</hi> Adams and others describe Benton&apos;s artistic
                         production as a problematic in the history of twentieth-century visual
                         expression. This vexing narrative location has received extensive treatment
                         by scholars intrigued by Benton&apos;s chronological and social
                         positioning within the aesthetic and political histories of the 1920s and
                         1930s. Despite his profligacy, despite his fame during his lifetime, and
                         despite his connec- tions amidst the American avant-garde,
                         Benton&apos;s location within the canon--indeed, any canon--seems
                         indeterminate. Enduring praise of his work emphasizes his starring role in
                         the history of Regionalism; more critical appraisals note his loyalty to
                         figuration, his use of religious themes, and his nostalgic celebration of
                         the American past as reasons to exclude him from laudatory histories of
                         modern art. &quot;In the middle of the Machine Age he based his style

                         artistic circles of Alfred Stieglitz and John Weischel. To earn money, he
                         did commercial work, such as designing panels for a Coney Island dancing pavilion and supplying dec- orative pieces for other
                         public spaces; he painted scene backdrops for movies; and he taught drawing
                         classes for adults in one of the Chelsea public schools. During World War

                         history in order to look toward the future&quot; (p. 140). On the one
                         side, cultural history was retold; on the other, industrial history was
                         pictorially related, rolling in opposite directions around the room and
                         meeting in a montage of civilization in the machine age. The effect was
                         meant to be dizzying, but reassuring, too. </p>
                    <p> From a distance, the murals seem charming, slashes of Technicolor in gray
                         institutional spaces. The oversized figures, with their oversized features,
                         enduring outsized wind, rain, smoke, waves, sunshine, and heavy, unceasing
                         toil, seem merrily reposed. &quot;But for Benton,&quot; as one
                         later observer explains, &quot;history is a passage and a movement; he
                         tries to give his works the narrative power of literature .... Figure bends
                         to fig- ure, scene yields to scene, and as one&apos;s eye wanders, led
                         onward by the sequence of forms, group harmonies dissolve and refocus. In
                         the way Benton&apos;s humans and machines contort as they near each
                         other, there is almost relativity, a special gravity that distorts

                         subjects&apos; faces and bodies. Some viewers saw socialist overtones,
                         while others judged his rendition of the Klan too kind. Fair visitors and
                         subsequent commentators on the work claimed that it was either too

                                   attended Saturday morning lectures at the Sorbonne. They
                                   concocted theories, sought histor- ical justifications for these,
                                   and the studios and cafes rang with arguments. Few painters took
                                   their easels before nature without ideas to test or exploit.

                                   ludicrous, they arose from a genuine and lively spirit of
                                   enquiry. And they fed a constant urge toward new and novel

                         interwar era. Benton was adamant about creating a uniquely American art
                         rooted in American life and leg- end: a style of art fixed on the American
                         Scene and, as Benton painted it in his murals of the 1930s, focused on a
                         dynamic national landscape of hard-working men and liberal political

                         through the modern art of Regionalism. It purposefully segued with the new

                         democratic impulses on which President Roosevelt&apos;s New Deal was

                    <p> Benton&apos;s interests in large-scale public wall painting followed in
                         the footsteps of the turn-of-the-century American mural movement, repre-
                         sented in the decorative, pastel-toned, and classically themed panels that
                         Gilded Age artists like Edwin Blashfield and Kenyon Cox painted for
                         worlds&apos; fairs, municipal buildings, and public schools. Yet the
                         dynamic rhythms and bright colors of Benton&apos;s murals, with their
                         energetic scenes of everyday American life and their focus on the tense and
                         often fraught conditions of American history, demonstrated
                         Benton&apos;s keen interests in the active and affective conditions of
                         American modernity. </p>
                    <p>Among the American Scene moderns, Benton was especially engaged in historical
                         narrative, which he first pursued in <hi rend="i">The American Historical
                              Epic</hi>. [plates 11, 12] Begun in 1919 and abandoned, unfin- ished,
                         in the late 1920s, this multi-paneled mural embodied Benton&apos;s
                         conviction that American history &quot;was not a scholarly study . . .
                         but a drama.&quot; American history, said Benton, was &quot;a
                         continuous flow of action having its climax in my own immediate
                              experience.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi> As he later explained, this
                         first mural was intended &quot;to present a peoples&apos; history
                         in contrast to the conventional histories which generally spotlighted great
                         men, political and military events, and successions of ideas. I wanted to
                         show that the people&apos;s behaviors, their action on the opening
                         land, was the primary reality of American life.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         the Civil War, and the emergence of modern American industry. Benton
                         completed only three chapters, however, ending with colonial history. In
                         1928, he explained that the mural&apos;s style, which he called
                         &quot;representational dynamism,&quot; combined the
                         &quot;extensive experience one has of the real world&quot; with the
                         new art forms and principles that he called his &quot;modern
                              inheritance.&quot;<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Its ener- getic, muscular
                         compositions, which critic Lewis Mumford described as &quot;moving
                         rhythmically through space and time,&quot; conveyed Benton&apos;s
                         belief that social &quot;action&quot; defined American history,
                         past and present.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> Yet much of Benton&apos;s dynamic depiction of American action cen-
                         tered on human conflict, struggle, and racial discord. All of the panels in
                         the mural&apos;s first chapter focused on antagonism between European
                         explorers and indigenous Americans, and the panels in the second chap- ter
                         similarly centered on strife and destruction. Benton&apos;s social epic
                         of American history, in other words, was an unceasing pattern of racial
                         vio- lence and human anguish; his focus on action showed conflict as the
                         central metaphor in the American national narrative.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> Perhaps it was despair that this was the national imaginary that led Benton
                         to abandon <hi rend="i">The American Historical Epic</hi> in the late
                         1920s. In subsequent murals Benton focused on scenes that gibed with his
                         politi- cal convictions and, in particular, his faith in a liberal
                         democracy shaped by the industry--and independence--of hardworking men. He
                         did not entirely ignore episodes of racial terrorism, religious
                         intolerance, and human conflict in his subsequent murals, however. In his <placeName>

                                   >Missouri</region>
                         </placeName> mural, for example, he included scenes of slaves being beaten
                         and the expulsion of the Mormons. [plate 13] And in the most controversial
                         panel of the <placeName>

                         rally, accompanied by a burning cross and an American flag.
                         Benton&apos;s reasons for including this scene stem from the specifics
                         of the commission, and from his unwavering attention to the dynamics of
                         social agency. </p>

                         (presidents and politicians) in chapters such as &quot;Liberty and

                         on &quot;histo- ry from below&quot; rather than &quot;history
                         from above,&quot; and on issues of social dynamics and agency. While he
                         included a few key historical players-- Abraham Lincoln, for example, and
                         Civil War-era Governor Oliver P. Morton--most of the 270-odd figures in the
                         mural were modeled on modern-day Hoosiers that he sketched during his
                         forays around the state.</p>
                    <p>Most of them were also men: while feminist Frances Wright was featured in a

                         Women were &quot;touchy&quot; subjects, he once remarked, and his
                         1937 autobi- ography is dotted with descriptions of &quot;girls in whom
                         I was much inter- ested but with whom I could never seem to get along for

                         Benton&apos;s hypermasculinity was colored, in part, by his politician

                         in, rather than alienated from, the American Scene. Benton saw himself as
                         an agent of American history: the visual scribe of <placeName>

                         the &quot;social and economic reorganization&quot; of the early
                         1930s New Deal. He insisted that modern American art act as a force for
                         his- torical change: these public murals were not intended as documents or
                         illustrations, but as templates and guides for his imagined national
                         future. Benton believed in a modern American art oriented toward social
                         synthesis and reform rather than social hierarchy and civic disjunction,
                         and his views were widely shared in the era of the Great Depression. As
                         Social Realist artist Louis Guglielmi remarked in the mid-1930s:
                         &quot;I feel that it is necessary to create a significant art and not
                         merely some super- deluxe framed wallpaper to decorate the homes of the
                         wealthy. The time has come when painters are returning to the life of the
                              people.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>
                    <p>Still, while American Scene moderns like Benton saw themselves as agents in
                         American history, their sense of that history--and their par- ticipation in
                         it--was often anxious and antagonistic. As Benton painted it, American
                         history was bumpy and flawed--feelings that are conveyed in the loud,
                         oppositional compositions and strident colors of his public murals, and in
                         the historically despicable subjects that he often includ- ed. As much as
                         Benton&apos;s Hoosier history is populated by hard-working and
                         industrious men, and oriented toward a progressive narrative that ends on a
                         note of upbeat, pro-New Deal sympathies, this is not &quot;American
                         history lite.&quot; This is &quot;American history
                         brutal&quot;: an unrelent- ing saga of social action and populist
                         agency that, however factual, pic- tures the national narrative on
                         frenzied, tumultuous, and tortured terms. Consider how the hundreds of
                         figures that Benton painted rarely smile or laugh, and never seem to relax.
                         How can they? All of them are mus- cle-bound titans--the figure of Lincoln,
                         for example, stands over nine feet tall--who are completely focused on, and
                         even obsessed with, the making, doing, and performing of <placeName>

                    <p>Benton viewed history as something more than a march through time of key
                         events and players. He understood American history in terms of felt
                         experience and affective conditions. History was emotional; <list

                    <p>Public murals are often the source of conflict and controversy on college
                         campuses. At the University of Notre Dame, Luigi Gregori&apos;s
                         Columbus Murals have prompted protest in recent years, including demands by
                         some Native American students that they be removed. The murals, painted
                         between 1882-1884 and located in Notre Dame&apos;s Main Building,

                         the Plains Indian costuming that Gregori selected for the Indian captives)
                         and insulting stereotypes.</p>
                    <p> The mural was conceived at a moment of Christopher Columbus mania: in 1882,
                         the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic fraternal organi- zation, was founded
                         and a decade later, the 400th anniversary of Columbus&apos;s discovery

                         Columbian Exposition. Painted, too, to combat decades of anti-Catholic

                         </placeName> , Notre Dame&apos;s mural was intended to unite the campus
                         around a historical fig- ure engaged in God&apos;s work. In 1997, a
                         university committee was appointed to develop a nuanced historical
                         interpretation and distribute a free full-color brochure of the murals,
                         which states: &quot;The University of Notre Dame recognizes that the
                         Columbus murals reflect 19th-century white European views of race, gender
                         and ethnicity which may be offen- sive to some individuals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dartmouth&apos;s Hovey Murals, on the other hand, were covered up and
                         hidden away in the early 1980s after objections were raised to their
                         mythologizing of that college&apos;s history and their soft-core
                         pornographic depiction of Native American women. Painted in the late 1930s
                         by Walter Beach Humphrey (a 1914 Dartmouth graduate), the murals illus-
                         trated Dartmouth&apos;s drinking song, a ditty written by Richard
                         Hovey. Originally located in Hovey Grill, a rathskeller of sorts in Thayer
                         Hall, the murals tell the story of Dartmouth College&apos;s founder,
                         Eleazar Wheelock, venturing into the New England wilderness with some
                         &quot;five <pb n="139" id="VAA4025-105-2-029"/> hundred
                         gallons&quot; of rum, which he &quot;served&quot; to the Native
                         American men he encountered from the school&apos;s legendary silver
                         punch bowl. Everyone gets drunk and has a fine time, including the
                         half-naked females standing around--one of whom is depicted reading an
                         upside- down book.</p>
                    <p>If once considered amusing, by the 1970s the Hovey Murals were the subject of
                         intense debate at Dartmouth, serving as a generational dividing line
                         between alumni who objected to the college&apos;s move toward
                         co-education (Dartmouth first admitted female students in 1972) and
                         students incensed by their demeaning depiction of Native Americans. The
                         drinking song itself implied that area Indians traded their land to
                         Wheelock for alcohol; it also discounted the college&apos;s original
                         charter to educate the &quot;youth of the Indian tribes in this
                         land.&quot; By the 1980s, the murals were placed in storage--although
                         in 1993, Native American stu- dents asked that they be made public again.
                         As Colleen Larimore, former director of Dartmouth&apos;s Native
                         American Program remarked, &quot;While we still consider the murals to
                         be degrading and offensive, we cannot deny how Native Americans were viewed
                         in the past at Dartmouth and in this country. Rather than fleeing from this
                         past, we must face it and learn from it.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         legacy of con- flict, violence, and racial struggle, and of our obligations

                         Bellamy&apos;s <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> (1888), imagined a
                         post-capitalistic future through the eyes of a time- traveler who could
                         compare the past and the present. Late nineteenth- century Americans
                         reveled in historical pageants, from the Civil War reunions that began
                         almost as soon as the war ended, to the reenact- ments of Western history
                         in Buffalo Bill&apos;s Wild West, to the civic com- memorations that
                         had become a national craze by the early twentieth century.</p>
                    <p>World&apos;s fairs were particularly significant occasions for looking
                         backward in order to look forward. After the enormous success of the 1851

                         third-person narrative, on the passing of symbolic power in human affairs
                         from the Virgin--who had inspired medieval builders--to the machines that
                         excited his contemporaries: &quot;As he grew accustomed to the great
                         gallery of machines, he began to feel the forty-foot dynamos as a moral
                         force, much as the early Christians felt the Cross . . . Among the thousand
                         symbols of ultimate energy the dynamo was not so human as some, but it was

                         founding of their city in 1833, they imagined a backward look to the past
                         that would be tied to forward-thinking economic promotion. Accordingly, the
                         planners sought private funding for the fair&apos;s financial support,
                         choosing to issue notes and memberships and to charge exhibitor and
                         concessionaire fees rather than requesting local, state, or national
                         government assistance. This decision probably saved them after the stock
                         market crash of 1929. Major <placeName>

                    <p> But, as the extent of the Great Depression became apparent and the opening
                         date for the fair drew closer, organizers reevaluated their plan for a
                         historically minded celebration. What could motivate Depression- stricken
                         Americans to spend their dwindling resources on travel and entertainment?
                         And what narrative of historical progress could reassure a public all too
                         worried that the present moment represented danger and declension? The fair
                         was conceived as a backward look, but perhaps a look forward would be more
                         encouraging to a Depression-era audience. Accordingly, the Centennial
                         Exposition acquired a new name: A Century of Progress. Its central focus,
                         organizers decided, would be upon human progress through technology.
                         &quot;Science Finds--Industry Applies--Man Conforms&quot; became
                         its motto.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Viewers would come to the fair to imag- ine
                         a brighter tomorrow--literally brighter, since the planners also made the
                         decision to drench the fair with bright, saturated colors. [plate 1]
                         Nothing could be more different from the White City of 1893 than the sleek,
                         futuristic buildings in their brilliant colors. Like the architectural
                         fantasies of Coney Island, the fair would invite viewers to enter a dream- like world.
                         But unlike an amusement park, the world&apos;s fair would sug- gest
                         that the world of tomorrow lay within the grasp of the visitors.

                         reigned at the General Motors building where you could see an actual
                         automobile being manufactured. The electricity building not only suggested
                         a futuristic world, but it was illuminated by colored lights day and night.
                         The fair looked forward with determination.</p>
                    <p>The fair&apos;s planners knew that the Depression meant that they had an

                         lacking private commissions for &quot;real&quot; structures, were
                         eager to showcase new ideas that might lead to the adoption of their
                         designs by private and corporate patrons. Their buildings could use
                         inexpensive building materials and hire cheap laborers eager for work of
                         any kind. Furthermore, building codes were less than stringent at the
                         fair&apos;s site on newly reclaimed land, so its buildings could become
                         a laboratory for innovative building design. The House of Tomorrow,
                         designed by George Frederick Keck, drawing concepts from Le Corbusier and

                         of Frazier and Raferty, combined stylish design with new man-made
                         materials.</p>
                    <p>The Century of Progress Exposition thus used its backward glance in order to
                         look forward. The opening ceremonies illustrated this partic- ularly well.
                         Fair organizers had seized upon a logo for the fair that looked back into
                         deep time and forward toward scientific wonders. Astronomers had calculated
                         that the star Arcturus, 200 trillion miles away, took forty years to send
                         its light to earth--exactly the length of time since the previous
                         world&apos;s fair in <placeName>

                         </placeName> in 1893. Accordingly, a Rube Goldberg-like device was
                         constructed to capture light from the star, feed it into photo-electric
                         cells, convert it to energy, and send it to <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago"

                         </placeName> , where, it was said, the light from the star touched off the
                         elec- trical system that powered up the fair&apos;s lighting on opening
                         night. Modern scientists find the calculations inaccurate, but nonetheless
                         Arcturus became the fair&apos;s logo and the perfect symbol of its
                         futuristic uses of the past.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>

                         form for the contemplation of the past. During the 1920s and 1930s, mural
                         painting had been embraced as a medium for comprehensive social commentary
                         and critique; at the same time, murals were being commissioned by major
                         industrialists such as Edsel Ford and Nelson Rockefeller. Mexican painter

                         right to the world of airplanes, oil refiner- ies, and building boom at the
                         upper center and left. The paintings were based on sketches he had made on
                         travels throughout the country, and on musings about American history in
                         which he had been engaged for over a decade.</p>
                    <p>Since the end of World War I, Benton, like many American artists and writers,
                         had been thinking about the meaning of history in the shap- ing of the
                         American present. In 1918, critic Van Wyck Brooks had coined the phrase the
                         &quot;usable past,&quot; to designate a search for a history that
                         would be vigorous and critical and would speak directly to the issues of
                         the present.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Benton was engaged in a parallel quest;
                         in 1919 he began <hi rend="i">The American Historical Epic</hi>, a series
                         of paintings intended &quot;to present a peoples&apos; history in
                         contrast to the conventional histories. . . . I wanted to show that the
                         peoples&apos; behaviors, their <hi rend="i">action</hi> on the opening
                         land, was the primary reality of American life.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >9</hi> [plates 11, 12] Although he never found the patronage that
                         would have allowed him to realize the project in full, the pieces he
                         completed during the 1920s forecast his vig- orously critical look at
                         American history.</p>

                         Benton&apos;s illustrations did reflect a critical historical
                         perspective, includ- ing vignettes of social injustice (Indian removal, the

                         of working men (for example, lumberjacks and factory workers). The
                         endpapers of the book imagine American history as a sort of procession,

                         lines and dark smoke of the industrial revolution provide an image of both
                         power and impend- ing disaster. [plates 14, 15] From start to finish, and

                         American utopian thinking, an awareness of radical economic critique made
                         more salient by the crisis of the Great Depression, and a desire to create
                         a dramatic and dynamic people&apos;s history. Appropriately for the
                         Century of Progress, he created a walk through history to provoke thoughts
                         about the past and also about the future. Spectators entered the room
                         beneath the paired images of aboriginal inhabitants of the state:
                         prehistoric &quot;Mound Builders&quot; who were represented as
                         skilled artisans, and &quot;The Indians&quot; whose hunter-gatherer
                         culture offered arriving Europeans a model for environmentally harmonious
                         living. Walking for- ward, the spectator could see the two sides of the
                         room simultaneously, following the story of industrial development on one
                         wall and cultural development on the other. The panels were crowded with
                         figures and vignettes designed to attract the spectator&apos;s
                         attention: an enormous fig- ure of Abraham Lincoln with an axe, a scene
                         from the Underground Railroad, covered wagons, steamboats, railroads,
                         soldiers marching opti- mistically to the Civil War in Industrial panel 6
                         [plate 3] and returning home again, tattered and wounded, in Cultural panel
                         6. In harmony with the theme of progress, hopeful images brought the murals
                         to a con- clusion, with the founding of the university in Cultural panel 9
                         and the establishment of powerful industrial landscapes in Industrial
                         panels 9 and 10. [plate 4] At the same time, Benton&apos;s critical
                         vision of American life did not omit ominous images such as a gathering of
                         the Ku Klux Klan in Cultural panel 10 [plate 9] and incipient labor
                         violence in Industrial panel 9. At the exit, paired images were again
                         brought togeth- er: &quot; <placeName>

                         into a dream-like recapitulation of history, and as the images flowed by,
                         the very figures on the walls seemed to be looking sometimes forward and
                         sometimes backward.</p>
                    <p>To take one example of the pairing of forward- and backward-look- ing images,

                         Cultural panel 7, &quot;Woman&apos;s Place,&quot; almost faced
                         each other across the hall. [plate 7] Both panels feature a mule-drawn
                         conveyance, and in both cases, the drivers follow a path that leads them
                         deeper into the scene. Under the red-white-and-blue-striped sky that binds
                         the two sides of the mural together, the farmer in Industrial panel 8
                         pauses his mowing machine on a grassy rise, looking down on a prosperous
                         farm <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-105-2-038"/> scene below. The natural
                         landscape, which had been the setting for ear- lier panels such as
                         &quot;The Pioneers&quot; and &quot;Home Industry,&quot; has
                         been trans- formed into a scene of cultivation, with cows, chickens, pigs,
                         farm equipment, and fields of grain. But the farmer is looking backward,
                         against the flow of the mural&apos;s march toward industrialization; by
                         1933 the farm population was shrinking throughout the country, and the
                         golden grain tsunami that sweeps from the fields to the farmer&apos;s
                         wagon may be as fanciful as the farm paradise imagined in the Norwegian
                         folk- song &quot;Oleana,&quot; published in English in Depression

                         under the same red-white-and-blue cloudscape. [plate 7] They pass the scene
                         of a woman&apos;s club meeting that brings together black and white
                         women in front of the portrait of Frances Wright, advocate of
                         women&apos;s rights. Driving through the natural landscape, where a
                         bower of trees containing a swimming hole offers an idyllic playground for
                         mischievous boys, the couple&apos;s mule-drawn car- riage heads down a
                         winding road that takes them to the new world of the city, with its heady
                         mix of entertainment and the arts in the next seg- ment, Cultural panel 8.
                         Standing in the middle of the room, the specta- tor could look from one
                         side of the mural to the other to experience the simultaneous pull of past
                         and future. In one panel, the traditional farmer looks back wistfully to an
                         agrarian world of remembered prosperity while on the other side, the young
                         couple drives forward through a transforming natural environment into the
                         future.</p>

                         the romance of science would bring a better tomorrow. Benton concluded his
                         march through history with a more considered suggestion: <placeName>

                    <p>In the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi>, Benton treated American historical subject
                         matter in provocative ways. He initially tried to determine
                         &quot;meanings and values that were American&quot; by ignoring the
                         conventional patriotic, celebratory, and heroic rhetoric of both historical
                         narrative and mural painting. Benton instead focused on the
                         nation&apos;s violent past with respect to black and Native Americans,
                         and created exaggerated, elongated, even stereo- typed or caricatured
                         figures of Indians, white settlers, and black slaves, <list

                    <p>Like many other cultural producers such as Van Wyck Brooks, whose seminal
                         essay &quot;On Creating a Usable Past&quot; had appeared in 1918,
                         Benton turned to American history in order to re-imagine the

                         rather than look to the past as a model, he sought to make American history
                         conceptually and visually relevant to his own moment. Benton&apos;s
                         preoccupation with racial figures and American history after World War I
                         unavoidably connects the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi> to the related citizenship
                         debates of the late teens and early 1920s. The marginalized bodies and
                         histories suggest a contested notion of an American body, both in a
                         political and visual sense, and underscore the identity questions,

                    <p>As Benton suggested in &quot;A Dream Fulfilled,&quot; a consideration
                         of his <hi rend="i">Epic</hi>--which represented an unprecedented, even
                         radical, approach to public art--is an important precursor to any
                         discussion of his later murals. I believe that Benton&apos;s failure to
                         engage viewers with the impli- cations of the racial inequities he depicted
                         compelled him to change his approach to race in his art. In the discussion
                         that follows, I explore the visual strategies for racial representation
                         that Benton developed in his 1930s public murals in his effort to connect
                         more cooperatively with American audiences--implying, in the Toni Morrison
                         sense, a white- majority public. These strategies built upon, but
                         necessarily departed from, the critical approaches he had invented for the

                              has studied the ways in which &quot;racial divisions show their

                              reviews published about them. In several key instances, the published
                              reviews reveal the author&apos;s ten- dency to conflate, deflect,
                              dismiss, talk around, even render incoherent the racial presence they

                         revise his critical notion of a distinctly American historical epic in

                         last. [plates 11, 12] Explicitly paired in a parenthetical arrangement of
                         the figures, each scene also showed native dwellings: Navajo hogans and a
                         quintessential pioneer&apos;s log cabin. The visual pairing functions
                         not necessarily as an example of progress or eco- nomic determinism, but
                         rather as a leveling. It sets up a parallel notion of the indigenous
                         structure and settlement--one Indian, one white--and the versions of
                         American history told from the &quot;pathfinder&apos;s&quot; or
                         Native American&apos;s perspective. Alluding to the recent legally
                         equal status of Indians as of 1924, the final chapter suggested that these
                         two indigenous narratives were unequivocal and inseparable, but
                         competing.</p>
                    <p>As the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi> unflinchingly shows, Benton saw Native
                         Americans as central to American history, even as they were being written
                         off in an influential history textbook authored by historian Charles Beard
                         with William C. Bagley: <hi rend="i">The History of the American
                              People</hi>. First published in 1918, Beard and Bagley&apos;s
                         mass-distributed textbook was seen as one that &quot;would put
                         democracy into the study of history&quot; and in which
                         &quot;colonial <placeName>

                         </placeName> is pictured as a melting pot of the races.&quot;<hi
                              rend="sup">19</hi> However, in the pref- ace to the third edition in
                         1928, Beard and Bagley wrote that &quot;the space given to the North
                         American Indians has been materially reduced. They are interesting and
                         picturesque, but they made no impress upon the civ- ilization of the <placeName>

                         </placeName>. In a history designed to explain the present rather than to
                         gratify curiosity and entertain, Indian habits of life and Indian wars must
                         have a very minor position.&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi> But
                         Benton&apos;s contempo- raneous &quot;The Lost Hunting
                         Ground&quot; shows the monumental Indian, equal in scale to his white
                         counterpart in &quot;The Pathfinder.&quot; Native Americans
                         received what would be the last word in Benton&apos;s revisionist
                         American history, but influential historians, not to mention school chil-
                         dren nationwide, now saw American Indians as irrelevant to the present.
                         Increasingly mindful of creating art that would resonate with the broad-
                         est possible audience, Benton must have internalized such dismissive
                         attitudes, acknowledging that his visual &quot;epic,&quot;
                         prominently featuring American Indians, might make &quot;no
                         impress.&quot; Benton abandoned the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi> that same

                              </placeName> Today</hi>, Benton pictured American Indians not as a
                         monumental, inevitable presence but as a literally tiny minority in
                         contemporary society, conveying the tension between their new citizenship
                         and popular stereotypes and romantic images. These factors encouraged
                         Benton to leave Indians virtually out of his vision of modern <placeName>
                              <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                         </placeName> and to underscore those very stereotypes and fanciful visions
                         in his composition. In &quot;Changing West,&quot; a cowboy and a
                         large movie camera stand to the right of the sole Indian. To his left are a
                         blond woman--possibly a Hollywood starlet--and a figure in a toque, a
                         direc- tor or cameraman. These details suggest that the Indian we see is
                         actual- ly an actor, a movie character on the set; here the Indian has gone
                         metaphorically from being an &quot;Actor,&quot; a player in
                         American society, to merely an &quot;actor.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >21</hi> Benton has transferred the Indian&apos;s agency from real
                         history to a Western movie script, in which the Indian is a projection--
                         like the film to be--of the American imagination.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, African Americans represented to Benton a significant presence
                         and force in contemporary American society. Although only two major black
                         figures appear, in &quot;Deep South&quot; and &quot;City
                         Building,&quot; they stand at both ends of the mural panels and anchor
                         the entire cycle. Effectively back to back, they are dressed identically,
                         and their arms are raised in similar gestures. These rural and urban black
                         figures represent the foundations of capitalist <placeName>

                         </placeName> from Benton&apos;s perspective: agricul- tural
                         productivity and modern industrialization, both of them depend- ent on
                         black labor.</p>
                    <p>The cotton picker&apos;s and the driller&apos;s arms encircle their
                         faces. Benton&apos;s framing device is a subtle visual metaphor
                         emphasizing each black head, symbolizing therein a kind of psychological
                         boundary, and encapsulating in that frame certain realities of black
                         American life. In &quot;City Building&quot; the link is to
                         construction work: the jackhammer and the driller&apos;s chiseled face
                         are enclosed within the dynamically com- pressed space of his powerful,
                         muscular arms--features Benton has greatly exaggerated and heightened; in
                         &quot;Deep South,&quot; the link is to the region&apos;s
                         dominant agricultural system, then referred to as King Cotton. <list

                         set against a white background within the rigid square created by his
                         upraised arms. The white highlights in the face function as literal and
                         metaphorical reflections of white--they ref- erence minstrelsy, suggest how
                         white and black relations framed and structured life in the Deep South, and
                         literally show against the black skin the white reflection from the pile of
                         cotton emptied from the large sack. The unfilled bag and the vacant stare
                         may suggest the emptiness and seeming inescapability of sharecropping but
                         also that this era was finally drawing to a close: the man disgorges a bag
                         of cotton, deliberate- ly turning it upside down, perhaps, amazingly, for
                         the last time. Alvin Johnson of the New School, who published an essay on
                         these murals in the early 1930s, interpreted this figure as &quot;the
                         triumphant Negro.&quot;<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>

                              </placeName> Today</hi>, Benton worked to embed the racial realities
                         he considered intrinsic to contemporary <placeName>
                              <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                         </placeName>. He moved away from the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi>&apos;s
                         violent allegories implicating whites, such as the newly arrived slaves
                         being brutally whipped in &quot;The Slaves,&quot; a panel in
                         chapter two of the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi>. Benton instead began to use race
                         in a manner more palatable to white audiences, as he had in &quot;Over
                         the Mountains,&quot; from chapter three of the <hi rend="i">Epic</hi>.
                         In this panel, the artist had shown laborers, or slaves, as more powerfully
                         modeled than the white pioneers. Their chiseled, extraordinary musculature
                         represented a stereotypical physique desired by white culture, one
                         traditionally missing from the white bodies. Similarly, the black figures
                         in <hi rend="i"><placeName>
                                   <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>

                         compositionally more significant than most white figures. The black body
                         could not be avoided. Benton forced viewers to acknowledge African
                         Americans, if only visually. But he did so by depicting blacks, with their
                         rippling muscles, in expected and relatively accepted roles-- as
                         construction workers or cotton pickers.</p>
                    <p>For his commission to decorate the Whitney Museum&apos;s reading room,
                         Benton used the regional framework to consider American popu- lar pastimes
                         across the country, what he would call the <hi rend="i">Arts of Life in <placeName>

                         that &quot;The Arts of Life are the popular arts and are generally

                         stereotype and caricature. He described his &quot;Indian
                         Arts,&quot; for example, as an &quot;instance of romantic
                         indulgence ... one does not have to be a boy scout to understand and
                         forgive this--through romance we Americans provide compensation for what we
                         actually have done to the Indian.&quot;<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                    <p>In the &quot;Arts of the South,&quot; however, Benton privileged the
                         section described as &quot;Negro Singing,&quot; because the black
                         man leading the song dominates the composition. He is the largest figure,
                         at the center, and his heft and position convey the importance of Negro
                         song or spirituals to American culture--as well as their independence: it
                         is a tradition that can turn its back on &quot;white singing,&quot;
                         as Benton depicted.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Yet the dual tree trunks root the
                         white and black expressions of faith and music liter- ally in the same

                    <p>Consider also that what at first glance appears to be a deeply trou- bling
                         parallel at the lower edge of the mural--the black mother and child at
                         lower left next to the trash pile at lower right--may not be. The two
                         sections are the edges of a broken circle, divided by the patch of dark
                         green matter at the center. These two halves move in opposite directions.
                         Follow the mother-and-child foundation clockwise towards the blacks
                         gathered in song. On the other side, follow the trash pile counterclockwise
                         around to what Benton called &quot;Holy Rollers,&quot; the
                         &quot;get next to God&quot; worshippers and singers. Benton very
                         well may have sought to link the presumed racism and hysterical
                         righteousness of evangelical southern whites to &quot;white
                         trash,&quot; a phrase invented in the nineteenth century, while
                         elevating what he saw as the fortitude of the often-besieged black family
                         and their experience in the South.</p>
                    <p>However, modern American artist Stuart Davis railed against Benton&apos;s
                         depictions in the magazine <hi rend="i">Art Front</hi> in 1935, calling his

                         failed to appreciate the complexity of Benton&apos;s methods and the
                         fact that the muralist may have been ridiculing not blacks, but whites. In
                         addition to the &quot;trash&quot; foundation of the Holy Rollers,
                         Benton further undercut the perceived piety and role of religion in
                         southern life: just above the trio of black men playing a typical--to
                         Benton--game of &quot;Craps&quot; (a scene and title that offended
                         many, especially juxtaposed with the church), is a stooped white woman
                         heading to an outhouse adjacent to the house of worship. Unremarked upon by
                         critics is the fact that, while her driver waits and snoozes, she is surely
                         going to &quot;crap.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Early in his career, between 1919 and 1928, Benton sought to hold whites
                         accountable for the nation&apos;s racial divisions and democratic
                         crises through a critical history of the United States, his <hi rend="i"

                         developed to represent race were regional, chronological, popular,
                         stereotypical, or caricatured. But these methods and the mural&apos;s
                         racial subject matter have often elicited such emotional responses that
                         Benton&apos;s approaches to race continue to be dis- missed, avoided,
                         or misunderstood. After 1928, Benton largely aban- doned efforts to
                         critique racial inequities viscerally in favor of picturing black and
                         Native Americans in non-threatening ways for a majority- white audience. He
                         came to accept, but tried to mitigate, a persistent national racial divide
                         through visual representation. During a segregated era utterly disinclined
                         to do so, Benton did represent black and Native <list type="footnotes">

                         or his appropriation of popular art in the form of stereotyping,
                         caricature, fiction, or folklore through the 1930s compromised or furthered

                         critics raised issues that have flared up in public art controversies ever
                         since: the artist&apos;s relationship to his or her audience; the
                         appropriateness of a given work as a civic symbol representing local
                         traditions and aspi- rations; the unfamiliarity of many members of the
                         public with avant- garde modes of representation; insensitivity to racial
                         histories that hurt and shame; and the age-old tension between our desire
                         to represent our- selves as we are and our tendency to idealize ourselves
                         as we wish to be. To his credit, Benton went out of his way to answer
                         critics in print and public meetings--something that most of his successors
                         in the mod- ernist public art movement of the late twentieth century failed
                         to do. It is not clear how successful those efforts at persuasion were in

                         state guidebook. When members of the Federal Writers Project protest- ed

                         him on my shit- house wall. Why don&apos;t you write about our

                         left-leaning modernists. The repeated characterization of his politics as
                         &quot;fascist&quot; or something close to it reflected
                         intellectuals&apos; growing hostility toward the populism that Benton
                         had inherited from his father. No doubt Benton&apos;s ugly rants
                         against the influence of homosexuals and Jews in the art world made matters
                         worse, but in retrospect it appears that the political attacks on Benton
                         were intimately linked to progressives&apos; repudiation of the pop-
                         ulist rhetoric upholding the ideal of an egalitarian republic of small pro-
                         ducers against exploitation by monopolistic &quot;parasites.&quot;
                         Such language had mobilized mass movements of workers and farmers in the
                         1880s and 1890s, but by the 1930s most intellectuals on the left were
                         likely to stress its parallels to the &quot;petty bourgeois&quot;
                         politics of resentment that had produced Nazism and Fascism in Europe.
                         Likewise, Benton&apos;s effort to incorporate images and narrative
                         devices derived from popular cul- ture--cinema above all--infuriated those
                         modernists who likened capi- talist &quot;kitsch&quot; to the
                         official art of totalitarian regimes. Doss notes that Benton&apos;s
                         endorsement of &quot;the movie Art as a sort of communal Art,&quot;
                         placed him squarely at odds with the left-modernist position coalescing in
                         the pages of the <hi rend="i">Partisan Review</hi>.11 What Benton saw as
                         &quot;communal Art,&quot; the <hi rend="i">Partisan Review</hi>
                         critics now derided as &quot;mass culture.&quot; Benton nonetheless
                         remained defiant to the end. Writing in his memoir, he con- trasted the
                         &quot;privatism of modernism, its grounding in an exaggerated
                         individualism,&quot; to his own aspiration &quot;to set up a

                    <p>Drawing on Doss&apos;s arguments, I would like to suggest an addition- al
                         source for the charges leveled against Benton&apos;s work. What often
                         united the attacks on Benton&apos;s murals was a widespread uncertainty
                         about whether their representation of past and present realities was nos-
                         talgic or critical and, more broadly, about how exactly his historical
                         cycles made the past available for the social challenges of his day. In
                         keeping with much of the aesthetic ideology of the New Deal period, Benton
                         conceived of public art as a dramatic narrative that offered a
                         &quot;usable past&quot; for the present and future.
                         Benton&apos;s thinking was especial- ly close to Mumford&apos;s
                         cultural and social criticism, which traced the dis- integration of earlier
                         historical moments of &quot;synthesis&quot;--whether in <list

                              rend="sup">13</hi> Mumford had started his career in the 1920s as an
                         heir to John Ruskin and William Morris, condemning the factory system and
                         the industrial division of labor for separating art from everyday life and
                         thereby consigning most people to bureaucra- tized modes of work and play.
                         By the 1930s, Mumford&apos;s work took a dif- ferent turn as he scoured
                         the present for signs of a nascent &quot;organic&quot; community.
                         In <hi rend="i">Technics and Civilization</hi> and other writings from that
                         decade, he argued that social science, regional planning, and new devel-
                         opments in art, architecture, and industrial design promoted a resurgent
                         holism that was taking material form &quot;within technology
                              itself.&quot;<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Simultaneously calling upon
                         historical memory and social hope, Mumford left himself open to many of the
                         same accusations Benton faced--that his work was nostalgic and sentimental
                         on the one hand, or utterly utopian and idealist on the other. Did Mumford
                         and Benton urge a return to a folkish &quot;Golden Day&quot; or
                         naively idealize an industrial-capi- talist system as capable of its own
                         transcendence? Either way, the place of politics and popular mobilization
                         as instruments of social change remained murky at best.</p>

                    <p>The ambiguity of the position that Mumford shared with Benton stemmed from
                         their shared conception of history as a dramatic narra- tive--a conception
                         that was, if anything, more important to Benton&apos;s work than it was
                         to Mumford&apos;s. &quot;History was not a scholarly study for
                         me,&quot; Benton wrote of his early career, &quot;but a drama. I
                         saw it not as a suc- cession of events but a continuous flow of action
                         having its climax in my own immediate experience.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >15</hi> The idea of public art as drama, as &quot;a con- tinuous
                         flow of action,&quot; was central to the aesthetic position that
                         Mumford, John Dewey, and many others articulated in the 1930s.
                         Dewey&apos;s 1934 <hi rend="i">Art as Experience</hi> sought to recover
                         &quot;the continuity of esthetic experience with normal processes of
                         living&quot; by emphasizing artistic process over individual art
                         objects, which in turn led Dewey to trace the origins of expressive culture
                         in primitive ritual and perform- ance.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Dewey wrote:
                         &quot;Art is the extension of the power of rites and cer- emonies to
                         unite men, through a shared celebration, to all incidents and scenes of
                              life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Murals appealed to artists and
                         critics in Dewey&apos;s orbit as a visual rite dramatizing movement
                         through history. Federal Arts Project director Holger Cahill spoke
                         repeatedly of an incipient American &quot;ren- aissance&quot; and
                         recommended murals as a &quot;heritage to the future . . . cre- ated in
                         our own time.&quot;<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Muralist Mitchell Soporin

                    <p>Benton marched at the head of that big parade for much of the 1930s. Yet his

                         from that of many of his contemporaries. The dramas Benton enacted in his

                         during his life and after. Long- standing complaints about melodrama as a
                         genre appear again and again in the critical commentary on
                         Benton&apos;s murals. Benton&apos;s detractors repeatedly condemned
                         his work&apos;s emotional excess and sentimentality, its heightened
                         theatricality and staginess, its cartoonish portraits of stock heroes and
                         villains painted in garish colors, and its use of simplis- tic moral

                         In a secular, revolutionary age melodramatic narratives filled an
                         ideological void by writing an accessible &quot;drama of the moral
                         life&quot; into popular culture.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> &quot;While
                         its social implications may be variously revo- lutionary or
                         conservative,&quot; Brooks writes, melodrama &quot;is in all cases
                         rad- ically democratic, striving to make its representations clear and
                         legible to everyone. We may legitimately claim that melodrama becomes the
                         principal mode for uncovering, demonstrating, and making operative the
                         essential moral universe in a post-sacred era.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>As a way of telling a moral story about the world, melodrama rep- resents an
                         alternative to both realism and modernism, even as it draws on both
                         traditions. Film theorists Christine Gledhill and Linda Williams have been
                         especially perceptive in exploring the relationship between melodramatic
                         storytelling and realist conventions. Gledhill argues that melodrama
                         &quot;[takes] its stand in the material world of everyday reality and
                         lived experience, and acknowledging the limitations of the conven- tions of
                         language and representation, it proceeds to force into aesthetic presence
                         identity, value and plenitude of meaning.&quot;<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                         Melodrama, in this argument, makes use of realist conventions but ratchets
                         up their emo- tional register, stopping short of the psychological
                         intensity and com- plex subjectivity of German Expressionism and other
                         modernist movements. While modernism tears apart familiar language and
                         repre- sentation, the melodramatic imagination creates a seemingly
                         realistic narrative that is deliberately overwrought, indebted more to
                         pantomime than to dialogue, and given to formulaic endings. It is worth
                         remember- ing in this regard that melodrama first emerged in plays that
                         were staged to orchestral music, often without spoken dialogue, which made

                         theatrical and cinematic melodrama. Indian hunters and mound builders, the
                         frontier couple at their plow, Civil War governor Oliver P. Morton sending
                         Hoosier soldiers to war, young Abe Lincoln reading a posted notice, brawny
                         proletarians, club women, and college professors: all are scene-stealing
                         protagonists who propel history for- ward in a series of dramatically
                         staged vignettes. [plates 2, 3, 6, 8] One can almost hear the player piano,

                    <p>It is the uneasy place of melodrama within modern aesthetics-- neither
                         realist nor modernist, though indebted to both--that explains the ferocity
                         of criticism Benton received from audiences devoted to these more familiar
                         artistic traditions. Doss makes a powerful defense of Benton as a modernist
                         whose work aspired to &quot;cultural synthesis,&quot; not the
                         dissonance and fragmentation normally associated with the modern
                              movement.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> It seems to me, however, that the
                         modernist elements in Benton&apos;s work--most in evidence in his New
                         School murals of 1930- 31--were largely subordinated to a melodramatic
                         narrative form. Recognizing melodrama as an unacknowledged competitor to
                         realism and modernism makes it easier to understand Benton&apos;s
                         awkward place in the critical debates of the 1930s and in later scholarship
                         on twentieth- century American art.</p>
                    <p>Melodrama no doubt appealed to Benton&apos;s populist inclinations as a
                         &quot;radically-democratic&quot; mode of representation well suited
                         to public art. But it also served a compensatory function in his work,
                         simultane- ously recalling and effacing the populist tradition he knew from
                         his childhood. Despite his best efforts to bring populism into the
                         twentieth century, Benton&apos;s use of melodramatic techniques from
                         theater and film reveals the waning power of that tradition in a modern,
                         industrial-capi- talist society. As the social conditions that gave
                         populism its political purchase dissolved, melodrama offered a moral
                         pantomime of historical progress that foreclosed future insurgency. The <placeName>

                         Benton modernized the populist tradition by inserting it into a melodra-
                         matic structure that robbed it of its radicalism. Or to put it another way,
                         melodrama is where Benton&apos;s populism went to die.</p>
                    <p>Melodramatic narrative shares with populist social criticism a rhet- oric of
                         moral recuperation that is itself indebted to biblical prophecy. It
                         discloses a rupture in the moral universe that can only be healed by a
                         recovery of values associated with a more virtuous past. It does so, how-
                         ever, without demanding the asceticism of a prophetic worldview or the mass
                         political mobilization of populist agitation. Rather, melodrama involves
                         what Linda Williams calls &quot;the retrieval of... absolute inno-
                         cence and good&quot; through a formulaic narrative that reaffirms
                         familiar moral conventions by uncovering the hero&apos;s latent moral
                         value and the sheer villainy of his adversaries.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                         &quot;Melodrama,&quot; Williams writes, &quot;offers the hope
                         that it may not be too late, that there may still be an archaic sort of
                         virtue, and that virtue and truth can be achieved in private individu- als
                         and individual heroic acts rather than . . . in revolution and
                              change.&quot;<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Northrop Frye likewise
                         described a central theme in melodra- ma as &quot;the triumph of moral
                         virtue over villainy, and the consequent ide- alizing of the moral views
                         assumed to be held by the audience.&quot;<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                         Melodrama holds out the promise that, despite our fallen condition, we can

                    <p>In the melodramatic imagination that Benton shared with D.W. Griffith and
                         much subsequent Hollywood cinema, the producer radical- ism of the late
                         nineteenth century gave way to a stark juxtaposition of the virtuous and
                         the venal. The enemies of the people became the scheming Thaddeus Stevens
                         figure in <hi rend="i">The Birth of a Nation</hi> (1915) or the
                         misanthropic Mr. Potter of <hi rend="i">It&apos;s a Wonderful Life</hi>
                         (1946), cardboard villains whose defeat is preordained in their first
                         appearance as pompous hyp- ocrites. The serpent is not in the garden for
                         long, such melodramas assure us, and neither is the Wicked Witch of the
                         West. Performance takes the place of politics; dramas of moral reassurance
                         substitute for a more profound repentance.</p>
                    <p>By eliminating any overt reference to politics as an instrument for
                         democratic renewal, Benton&apos;s 1930s murals threatened to collapse
                         the future back into the past, which in turn fed accusations that he was a
                         nostalgic reactionary. It was not only the modernist left that sought to
                         consign Benton to the dustbin of history. The 1941 WPA guide to <placeName>

                         </placeName> did the same. State administrator Matthew Murray was hardly a
                         man of the left: he deliberately sanitized the guide&apos;s content,
                         erasing controversy and conflict from its account of the state&apos;s
                         history and actu- al condition. It is revealing, then, that the WPA guide
                         framed Benton in terms of an idyllic vision of the state&apos;s past,

                         populism into a modern visual language. As a moral vernacular familiar to
                         ordi- nary Americans, melodrama was an ideal idiom for Benton. It told an

                         and to Benton&apos;s ability to weave view- ers&apos; experiences
                         into a historical narrative that they themselves, as visi- tors to the
                         Century of Progress International Exposition, helped to enact. But
                         Benton&apos;s recourse to melodrama also registered the dimin- ished
                         sense of political possibility that characterized much of American history
                         during his day and our own. Benton&apos;s increasing marginalization
                         over the course of his life, and in much of the historical scholarship
                         written since, stands in stark contrast to the longevity of melodrama as a
                         popular genre. The robust populism that Benton knew in his youth is now a
                         distant memory, yet the melodrama of democracy survives in every
                         performance of our nation&apos;s history that demands little of us as
                         cit- izens. Benton the impresario is no longer with us, but the show goes
                         on.</p>

                         transformed Indiana University in his service as President (1937-62) and
                         University Chancellor (1962-2000). Under his leadership, the universi- ty
                         grew from a provincial hub into a cosmopolitan center of learning with an
                         international reputation. Shrewd, charming, and energetic, Wells possessed
                         an immense social network and ample sound judgment to find and create
                         opportunities to improve the fortunes of IU. People were his passion, and
                         he cultivated contacts with all members of the university community as well
                         as with many groups beyond the campus. Although he strengthened the
                         university&apos;s focus on research and advanced training, he made an
                         extraordinary effort to cultivate the arts as well. Wells&apos;s
                         unwavering commitment to academic freedom was put to the test by his
                         protection of Alfred Kinsey&apos;s controversial research on sex, and
                         he set into motion the expansion of international academic pro- grams of

                    <p>Wells understood that learning took place whenever and wherever consciousness
                         existed, and he was devoted to building a creative and nurturing
                         environment for the entire IU family. His vision reflected his belief that,
                         in addition to the intangibilities of morale and spirit, the campus
                         landscape--&quot;our precious islands of green and serenity&quot;--
                         played an important role &quot;in their ability to inspire students to
                         dream long dreams of future usefulness and achievement.&quot;<hi

                         learning.</p>
                    <p>But that vision did not spring into action fully formed when Wells became the
                         eleventh president of IU beginning in 1937. Rather it devel- oped over
                         time, pieced together from his family background and life experiences,
                         combined with on-the-job training. A 1924 IU alumnus, Wells had joined the
                         faculty as an instructor in economics in 1930, was promoted to assistant
                         professor in 1933, and then was named Dean of the School of Business
                         Administration in 1935, at the age of 33. Two years later, he became Acting
                         President. </p>

                         near-forgotten status in 1938, why on earth did President Wells want them
                         for the university? By exploring how and why Wells was sensitized to art in

                         campus as a dynamic peda- gogical agent.</p>
                    <p>The very physicality of the campus provides a &quot;cultural
                         glue&quot; to attract and fix the loyalties of its academic community
                         and a social set- ting where university norms, rituals, and customs are
                         enacted. Through generations, Wells knew, the campus had been
                         &quot;culturally instructive, introducing the individual to the rich
                         set of information, values, princi- ples, and experiences which art,
                         landscape architecture, and architec- ture are capable of
                              embodying.&quot;<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The roots of his vision can
                         be traced to the remarkably deep and fertile appreciation of the cultural
                         landscape of Indiana University that he had begun to cultivate as an
                         undergraduate.</p>

                              Wells was struck by the physical beauty of IU&apos;s wooded
                              landscape, dotted with graceful monoliths of native stone, and eagerly
                              partook of the culture of its academic community. The gregarious young
                              man joined Sigma Nu fraternity, finding the brothers he had never had
                              growing up as an only child.</p>
                         <p>Receiving mostly B&apos;s and C&apos;s in his coursework, Wells
                              pursued a business degree in IU&apos;s new School of Commerce and
                              Finance. Very active in extracurricular affairs, he distinguished
                              himself in college (as he had in high school) by serving as treasurer
                              or business manager of nearly all the groups he joined, ranging from
                              his high school yearbook staff to the IU chapter of the YMCA. His
                              engagement with the arts had begun even earlier. Starting as a
                              nine-year-old, he played horn--first alto and then baritone--in a
                              succession of local brass bands, and was a mem- ber of the IU Band
                              during college. Never achieving virtuosity in his play- ing, Wells
                              nonetheless stuck with it for the group solidarity and civic pride it
                              engendered in him.</p>

                              association with IU in the 1890s, when he received com- missions to
                              paint portraits of several professors. In 1907 he got to know Bryan
                              during the course of several weeks when the then president sat for his
                              portrait in a temporary campus studio. Steele&apos;s fame
                              increased, and in the spring of 1916, an exhibit of his paintings
                              appeared in the Student Building in conjunction with the centennial of <placeName>

                              university had bestowed only two times in the preceding decade, first
                              to James Whitcomb Riley (1907) and then to David Starr Jordan
                              (1909).</p>
                         <p>When Steele came to campus in 1922, a large studio was prepared for him
                              on the top floor of the Library (now Franklin Hall). There were no
                              stipulations about his activities save that he would be in residence
                              six months of the year. &quot;I believe we need beauty as much as
                              we need truth,&quot; Bryan contended, adding that &quot;the
                              University needs artists as much as it needs scholars.&quot; The
                              president&apos;s idea was that Steele&apos;s very presence
                              would help to advance art appreciation on campus, thus con- tributing
                              to the moral uplift of the student body. For his part, Steele ren-
                              dered his mission in simple terms: &quot;to see the Beautiful in
                              nature and in life. &quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                         <p>The artist was modest and unpretentious about his work, and was
                              unperturbed if visitors dropped in when the studio was open Thursday,

                                        it has meant to be faithful to seeing things steadily and
                                        seeing them whole. His art is his life, and he, as you meet
                                        him and talk to him is the best commentary upon his
                                        pictures. He puts into his pictures not only what he sees,
                                        but what he believes in. . . . The artist&apos;s view of

                              </quote> In the spring of 1923, the Union Board bought six of
                              Steele&apos;s paintings, to be hung in the Student Building. That
                              acquisition served as the nucle- us of the impressive art collection
                              now in the Indiana Memorial Union building. That fall, Wells was
                              elected and served as treasurer of the Union Board. No doubt he was
                              aware of these purchases.</p>
                         <p>Wells received his BS in Commerce at the 1924 IU Commencement, held in
                              the Men&apos;s Gymnasium. The utilitarian space was spruced up and
                              decorated with a special art display. Pride of place went to a large
                              oil painting representing &quot;Alma Mater&quot; and the fight
                              against ignorance. It was the work of Edwin Howland Blashfield, an IU
                              alumnus, who was well known both as a muralist and for his
                              allegorical, figurative style. (Among his other commissions was the
                              interior dome of the Library of Congress in the nation&apos;s
                              capitol.) Presiding over his twen- ty-second commencement ceremony,
                              President Bryan titled his remarks, &quot;Alma Mater and the Dark
                              Ages.&quot; Despite the glories of the Gothic cathedral built
                              during the Middle Ages, he said, the Dark Ages are &quot;eter-
                              nal,&quot; located in the hearts and minds of all of us. Bryan
                              went on to describe the painting: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        monster is barbarism, the spirit which scorns and tramples
                                        under foot what is fine and loves what is base. The monster
                                        is the never-dying spirit of the Dark Ages. A flock of
                                        angels strive in comic distress to save the books. A youth
                                        with a sword stands ready, we hope, to fight for the good
                                        cause at the command of Alma Mater. When I saw this youth
                                        with the sword, I thought of our boys who chose to spend
                                        their money for the pictures of Theodore Steele.<hi

                         <p>February 8, 1938, was a fateful day in IU history. Wells, in his eighth
                              month as acting president, had won the confidence of most of the
                              faculty and some members of the Board of Trustees based on his compe-
                              tent performance on the job. He juggled a punishing travel schedule to
                              replace depleted faculty ranks while also working with the trustees to

                              Bryan&apos;s permanent replacement. The vote was split four to
                              four. Voting in favor were the trustees appointed by McNutt during his
                              term as governor. Of the opposition, three trustees had been elected
                              by the alumni. The fourth, J. Dwight Peterson, was a gubernatorial

                              talked with University Comptroller Ward Biddle about finding a place
                              for the paintings in the still-growing Indiana Memorial Union. Biddle,
                              a decade older than Wells, was the young president&apos;s closest
                              con- fidant and key ally among the administrative staff. Biddle, who
                              had graduated from IU in 1916, was also a Sigma Nu brother, and had
                              served as chapter advisor when Wells served as fraternity president
                              during his senior year. Biddle had mentored Wells since their first
                              meeting in 1923, and the two men shared a deep dedication to the
                              welfare of their alma mater.</p>

                              dimensions of the murals. Under some pretext, Thompson visited Ross

                              obtained the information. &quot;It will take a room 75X35 without

                              search for an appropriate space on campus proved futile. The new
                              Business and Economics building (now Woodburn Hall) might hold a few
                              mural panels, but accommodating the whole sequence would increase

                         <p>By now, the trustees had learned of Wells&apos;s determination to
                              obtain the paintings. In early August, Wells heard that Benton
                              &quot;would be delighted to see the murals go up at the
                              university,&quot; in a message relayed to him by Fine Arts
                              Professor Harry Engel, a friend of the artist. Jokingly, Benton added,
                              &quot;Whatever is decided upon for the murals is O.K. with me and

                              art and culture. He made bold moves to acquire cultural heritage,
                              reframing and incorporating it into the liberal arts con- text, and
