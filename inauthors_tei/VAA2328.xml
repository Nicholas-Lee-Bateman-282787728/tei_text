                    inadvisable to treat the Subject exhaustively in a mere Pocket Guide. The Purpose of this Volume
                    shall have been accomplished if Students are aroused to a keener Interest in the sprightly Topic and
                    feel encouraged to undertake Original Research, verifying by Experiment the Conclusions here-with
                    set down. It has been suggested to the Author that there is no piercing demand for a Work of this
                    character, inasmuch as several millions of Investigators are already devoting the greater portion of
                    their Time to a sincere consideration of the Girl Proposition, and the number of Experts is
                    increasing hourly. In reply it may be urged that a Treatise of this Description cannot possibly
                    discourage their Efforts and it may help a lot.</p>

                    time on it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The best he could ask for was to send her a Box of long-stemmed Roses and then go and let
                    a Train run over him and maybe she would condescend to attend the Funeral. That, or else he could
                    save her life in a Runaway and die with his Head in her Lap. All he wanted was a Romantic Finish
                    that would leave a sad, sweet Memory behind. He wanted a <pb id="VAA2328-019" n="9" TEIform="pb"/>

                    soulful Attorney wanted to throttle him, for he could not believe that a real Diana would trifle
                    with a blue Cat-Fish.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">However, he accepted the Opportunity to hold Converse with the Star of his Soul. Buzzer
                    led him around the long Veranda and at last he stood in that radiant Presence.</p>

                    the Theatre as often as she could muster the Price, and there she would sit in a pensive Attitude
                    and gaze yearningly at the pale Leading Man with the Black Ringlets. After returning Home she would
                    mope around in her blue Kimona and say that she didn&apos;t care for any Dinner. Then Mother
                    would give her some Camomile Tea and a hot Foot-Bath and tell her that she had caught Cold. When it
                    came to Diagnosis, Mother was a Shine.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While she was still subject to these recurring Attacks of Actoritis, another Malady laid
                    hold on her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One day when Father came home he was met by Aggie&apos;s Mother, who was pale and
                    worried.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Something terrible has happened,&quot; she said. &quot;Aggie has Art on
                    the Brain.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It was too true. She had attended a <pb id="VAA2328-028" n="[18]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    Red with pasteboard Armor on the Walls. There she had met an Artist. Any one could tell that he was
                    the real Latin Quarter Article, for he wore the corn-silk Tassels and never combed his Hair, and
                    smoked a Pipe even when he had Callers. He was made up in Velveteen and a Fauntleroy Collar and his
                    Cravat would have done for a Sash. Aggie was pining for Bohemia. So she decided that she would marry
                    the Genius who never had been Shaved, and they could live together in the Paint-Shop and cook all
                    their Meals over an Oil Stove. She began to comb her Hair down over her Ears and moved her
                    Waist-Line up until it was stopped by he Arms, and she wore long clinging Raiment and tried to be
                    exactly like the Slim Sisters that show up in a Burne-Jones Panel. All this made Father very
                    Exhausted. Father was in the Pig-iron Business and he didn&apos;t think that Art was such a
                    Much. He said that a Man with silky Jo-Jos who painted Dying Sunsets that no one wanted to buy, was
                    not his pick for a Son-in-Law. He <pb id="VAA2328-030" n="20" TEIform="pb"/> wanted Aggie to select
                    a Practical Mana Brewer, if possible.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">There is no telling what would have happened, if a new Disease had not attacked Aggie.
                    For one Day, as Father entered the Drawing-Room he heard a strange Thumping and Pounding overhead,
                    which caused the whole Building to Vibrate.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Somebody is tearing out the Second Story,&quot; he said, in Alarm.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">They went up and looked through the Key-Hole. Aggie had on a scanty Suit of Blue Flannel
                    and she was trying to beat the Soul out of a Punching-Bag.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Is there anything we can do?&quot; asked her distracted Pop.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing,&quot; was the Reply. &quot;We must let Nature take its Course.
                    She will get over it in about Three Weeks. In the meantime we must watch her carefully or she may
                    elope with some Weight-Lifter.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2328-031" n="21" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Truly enough, the Spasm of Muscular Development lasted only 21 Days, after which she took
                    a good Rest and slowly regained her Health. Her Parents felt hopeful. The Violent Exercise seemed to
                    have worked all the Art and Actoritis out of her system.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Just as Father and Mother were beginning to feel easy in their Minds an awful Thing came
                    off. Aggie wandered out one Afternoon and happened to stumble on a Club Meeting at which an
                    Authoress with Gold Spectacles did a Balancing Act on a high Pedestal. Aggie came home with the
                    Literary Bacillus biting her at every Step, She decided to write an Historical Novel and she thought
                    she had better hurry and get at it before she was too Old. So she began to wear her Clothes loose
                    and had Pencils stuck in her Back Hair and Ink-Stains on her Fingers. She succeeded in getting
                    acquainted with some of the Literati. Now and then she would bring them up to the House and Feed
                    them. Father couldn&apos;t see them at all. Aggie said it was a great Privilege to meet People
                    who do Things. Father <pb id="VAA2328-032" n="[22]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    Pig-Iron was not very Bookish.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Just about the time that Aggie was convalescing from the severe Case of Literature, she
                    was seized with Social Reform. She discovered that she had a Mission. She was going out among the
                    Working Classes to show them how to be Intellectual. Mother suggested that she remain at Home and
                    Show Father how to be Intellectual. For nearly 10 Days she was out uplifting the Lower Classes. Then
                    one day she bounced into the House and said: &quot;Mommer, I am going in for
                    Photography.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mother groaned, but she was not greatly surprised. She was getting used to the Fada and
                    Foibles.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Aggie began to blow up the House with Flash-Lights and she converted the Clothes-Press
                    into a Dark-Room. The Premises had a Chemical Odor. The Pictures would have been all right if the
                    Light had been better, or if they had been given Time Exposure, or the Camera hadn&apos;t
                    waggled, or Something. As it was, they were full of Fog and Moth-Balls.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">One afternoon Aggie was swiftly transformed from a Kodaker into a Menticulturist. She
                    brought home a Book so Deep that Mother couldn&apos;t make Mead or Tail of it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Next Day a Young Man walked into the Office and said to Aggie&apos;s Father,

                <p TEIform="p">During many a long Afternoon when he should have been busy with the Books, Philo leaned
                    back, combing his Mustaches with a Steel Pen and looking at the Wall. He could see himself in a Cozy
                    Corner under a Red Light. Beside him sat a Prize Beaut of the kind that makes a Star Feature for the
                    Sunday Paper. She was holding him by the Hand and whispering, &quot;You for Me, and nothing else
                    doing.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Almost every Nightfall he would change to a White Vest and start out to see if he
                    couldn&apos;t make the Lithograph come true.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Philo always had his Plan of Campaign ribbed up. He knew what he was going to say when
                    she came breezing into the Front Room. Then when she had said so-and-so as a playful Come-Back he
                    would say something <pb id="VAA2328-038" n="28" TEIform="pb"/> Keen, apparently right off the Reel,
                    and that would lead up to the Scene in the Cozy Corner.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Philo was always Letter Perfect at Rehearsals, but when it came to the Night Show he was
                    a Scamp.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Trouble was that the Little Lady never came back with the Right Cue. After about two
                    Moves she would hand him a Liner which he would Muff. Then for the next five Minutes he would be
                    trying to rub the Varnish off the Chair, using himself for that Purpose.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Or perchance when he showed up with his Lassoo hidden under his Coat and his Soul steeled
                    to Determination, he would find two or three other Beaux on the Premises, all organized to block him
                    off. Some twenty Minutes later, Philo would be up stage reading a Magazine.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After being Frosted from Head to Foot, our Young Friend decided that one who would induce
                    a Timid Girl to move over and be Chummy, must not go after her but compel her to follow the Trail.
                    Philo read in a Book costing $1.18 at a Department Store that the blas <pb id="VAA2328-039" n="[29]"

                    Indifference, simply got them all worked up.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Game plays out as follows: Cynical Ike with the dark, piercing Eyes and the lines of
                    a Great Sorrow marked on his Handsome Face tells Dora that all Women are alike. This Talk goes best
                    with a Turkish Cigarette. Dora tells him that he is Off. She says that there &apos; are Women in
                    the World capable of Steadfast Love. Ike springs a pensive Sigh and says Ah, if he could believe it.
                    Thereupon it is up to her to prove it or lose the Argument, and that&apos;s the Answer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So Philo went around telling every one who would listen to him that Women are fickle
                    ever. When he called he sat as far down in the Chair as he could get and said cruel Things about the
                    World of Fashion. He wanted to get away from all the vain Pretendings of Artificial Society. He
                    would never Marry.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He worked this along the entire Chain of Boarding Houses and no one teased him to change

                    swell Lookers are supposed to get out and chase the Woman-Hater, but up in the 5th Ward, where Philo
                    resided, the Recipe was no good.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly he switched. The second Book that fell into his Hands pictured the Young
                    Fellow who simply keeps at the Girl and snoops around and plays House Dog until her Woman&apos;s
                    Heart is touched by his Slavish Devotion. Philo began to camp out at the Home of a Brunette. At the
                    end of six days she shivered at the Sight of him. After he had been given the Headache Answer three
                    times in one Week he pulled down his Entry Money and coppered the whole Scheme.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Once he attempted the Impetuous Line of Business. It always works out on the Stage. The

                <p TEIform="p">One Moonlit Evening it was that $12-a-week Philo with a Vocabulary of 82 Words started
                    out to win the Fair One with just one passionate Whirlwind that would carry her off her Feet.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He moved alongside, got a Split Infinitive crossed with a defective Adverb and died on

                    a short cut across the Lawn and escaped into the Alley back of the Engine House. Fortunately she had
                    other Callers that Evening and became so Interested that she forgot to speak to Father.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Philo began to weaken on the Systems. Yet he knew that there was some certain Way of
                    going at it, for he could see what was being pulled off all around him. Every Night when he was out
                    scanning the Hammocks and Front Porches in order to spot his Destiny, he saw Whole Bunches of them
                    snuggled together in the Twilight. He wondered how they managed to Last.</p>

                    discussed Ways and Means of keeping him at Home. A Girl who had been on the Bargain Counter since
                    the Year of the Big Wind, and no Takers, arose and wanted to know why, if Man was such a Bunch of

                    Department. He was for Petty and had no Shame in the Matter. He would send a A. D. T. boy at 6,
                    saying that he would be up at 8 and then he would phone her at 7 to find out if she had received the
                    Note.</p>

                    Goo-goo, double strength. It was an Omnibus Love that reached out its red-hot Tentacles and twined
                    around all Objects, animate and inanimate, that were associated with little Honey-Bun.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He would have deemed it a Holy Privilege <pb id="VAA2328-056" n="46" TEIform="pb"/> to go

                <p TEIform="p">It was the kind of transfiguring, old-fashioned, romantic-novel Love that made him think
                    well of her Kin-Folks. He knew that any one who was related to the Queen of the Human Race was
                    certainly Right. So he tried to stand Ace with the Old People and a brother named Walter and a
                    tall-browed Sister who was Intellectual.</p>

                    stubbed his Toe often enough to know from sad Experience the true Value of two small Pairs when five

                    after which it was time to bat up a few Flies and then, in the Gloaming, start in for four or five

                    for twenty years. On Sunday Afternoon he was due to meet Brother Walt at the Country Club and play
                    him for a Ball a Hole. After a couple of Sundays, Walt had enough Has-kells to last him a Life-Time.</p>

                    Dorothy Vernon was better than Billy Baxter. While he would be doing Foot-Work and side-stepping the
                    Questions that were calculated to show him up as a howling Ignoramus, the Real Thing would be
                    sitting back waiting in vain for an Opening.</p>

                    long Sermons right in Fly-Time, and conned into reading 47 Books that did not appeal to him. He
                    seemed to be making grand Headway with all members of the Outfit except the One that he wanted to
                    snare out into a Dim Corner and hold in a Strong Embrace forever and ever.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After a while he began to weaken on the Scheme of playing up to a whole Cast of
                    Characters. He wondered if it would not be just as easy to love a lone Orphan.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She was Wise. She saw herself losing a Good Thing. It was a shame to back-cap her own
                    Tribe, just when they were pulling for her, but she had to do it. One Night she fought off the
                    others and lured him into a Boat and there in the Moonlight she told how she had lived in the same
                    House with them for 19 Years and how they were all right but they wouldn&apos;t do.</p>

                    struck a foolish Side-Motion and ran into the Fence.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he was among the Fellows he opened up like a Morning-Glory. He told Stories and said
                    Sarcastic Things about Married People he knew and made up Verses. The Young Men would repeat these
                    Slick Observations to the Girls and tell them how witty and entertaining old Splivey was. So the
                    next time Homer showed up, the vivacious little Kittens would form a Semi-Circle in front of him and
                    say, &quot;Oh, Mr. Splivens, do tell us a Story or else make one of your killing
                    Jokes.&quot; Then Homer would flush up and try to swallow his Palate. He would flatten out like
                    a dying Welsh Rabbit and make a few choking Sounds, but there would be nothing doing in the Story
                    Line.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After a Painful Pause the Girls would quit him cold. During the remainder of the Evening,
                    Homer would sit back in a dark Corner of the Gentlemen&apos;s Dressing Room, thinking up the
                    Reply he might have made but did not.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the meantime, the Girls would be giving <pb id="VAA2328-066" n="56" TEIform="pb"/> him
                    the Giggle and saying he was the wooziest ever. If they met him later in the Evening, each one
                    handed him some Cutting Remark about having a Nice Time. If they had been Men he could have Come
                    Back in grand style, but when any little blue-eyed Elsie ran up and jabbed a Spear into his
                    quivering Bosom, he simply groaned and turned his Face to the Wall.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">What made it so Bitter for Homer was, that in his Heart of Hearts he wanted to be a
                    Butterfly. Frequently he would say, &quot;Some Boys can Fly and why can&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At many an Evening Party he would conceal himself behind the Bass Viol and watch the
                    frivolous Capers of the Charley Freshes and wonder how they did it. He would listen to the merry
                    Babble and wish that he could butt in and Talk all Evening without having anything to Say. Sometimes
                    he would overhear the Conversation that was causing all the Girls to double up and have Duck Fits.
                    Then the Cold Sweat would gather in large Beads on his Forehead. The Talk was a Cross between the
                        <pb id="VAA2328-067" n="57" TEIform="pb"/> innocent Prattle of Childhood and the maniacal
                    Maunderings of the Incurable Ward at the Foolish Works.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh!&quot; thought Homer. &quot;If only I could mislay my Mind some
                    evening and get out and deal that kind of pink Persiflage, I would be as Popular as any of these
                    Willing Performers.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Homer fell in Love at long range with a Girl named Lucy Livingstone. Lucy was a Prize
                    Pansy who never passed in Algebra, but she was a Talker from Conversationville. Homer never told his
                    Love, but let Concealment, like a Green Worm, feed on his essential Organs. He would compose a
                    Honeyed Speech with which to greet his would-be Dul-ciana, but when he met her at the Corner of
                    Fifth and Main he would lift his Hat with the wrong Hand and gurgle a few Words of stereotyped
                    Piffle and back into a Lamp-Post.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Oh, but he was a naughty Lover! When it came time for him to go into Action, his
                    Ammunition was always wet. And even when he Fired, he never got to Range. He would <pb
                        id="VAA2328-068" n="58" TEIform="pb"/> Loop a few Loops and dodge into a Cigar Store.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">What made him so sore was that some Handsome Harry with Vaseline on his Hair and not more
                    than two Ounces of Cerebellum could saunter up to the Heart&apos;s Idol and tap her on the Back
                    and call her &quot;Luce.&quot; And what was ten times worse, she seemed to Like it. He saw
                    himself done up forty ways from the Jack by many a He-Pelican who could not command $8 a week in the
                    Open Market.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he met her, he addressed her as Miss Livingstone. The other Fellow called her
                    &quot;Sis&quot; and linked Arms with her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Whenever a Rival blocked him off, Homer stood around on one Foot for a while, waiting for
                    an Opening, and then he did a soft-shoe Sneak and swore that he would Forget her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He told himself that he was a Chump for continuing to Worship one who could be pawed over
                    and man-handled by anything that wore a Derby Hat.</p>

                    He yearned to monopolize the Affection which seemed to be On Tap for any one who cared to step up
                    and turn the Spigot.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He told himself that Faint Heart never won out Fair Lady. From all he could gather, the
                    Society Tit-Bit preferred the Gaily Boy to the one who sat on the other side of the Room and talked
                    about the New Books.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mr. Splivens decided to turn over a New Leaf. He saw that his only chance was to jump in
                    and make a Bold Play. His telepathic Tactics had not made the slightest Impression on Lucy. The
                    Silent System was no good.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;The next time I get a chance to Lead, I will give her a Glad
                    Surprise,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I will convince the Little Lady that I am not made
                    of Wood. I can be just as Loving as the next one if my Nerve holds out.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So he went to a Dance and there was Lucy, looking very Cute and Coquettish and hemmed in

                    Courage. Accordingly he slipped out and stowed away five Santiago Sours, so-called because they
                    leave you wrecked on the Beach. He came back a trifle Squiffy. He was all Lit Up. Homer was ready to
                    be as Friendly and Familiar as any Girl could possibly wish. He laid Hands on the surprised Lucy and
                    led her to the dim Conservatory.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;This is where my Stock takes a Leap of 20 Points,&quot; he said to himself,

                <p TEIform="p">He fixed a Burning Gaze on her and carelessly wrapped an Arm about her supple Waist.</p>

                    letting her know anything about it. He was dead willing to Hook Up and the sooner the better, but he
                    was afraid to undertake a Proposal for fear he would Fumble. Every time he came up to the Main

                <p TEIform="p">He knew what he ought to do, all right enough, because he had read the Books on the

                    something that is waiting to be de-livered. Every Clothing Salesman in the House thinks that he
                    could crouch on a Rug and sing the same Song. But when he finds himself in a Private House and it is
                    up to him to advance the Ball or get off the Field, he falls down and steps on himself.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">It happened thuswise. He was a Daylight Performer and loved to parade his Attractions. If
                    he had a Duchess on his Staff he would lead her along the main-travelled Streets and show her off.
                    But he held her by the Arm just the same for fear that some one would run out of an Alley and grab

                    No. 1. He wanted the Friend to see for him-self that the Girl thought the World of Papa. It was Fine
                    Business for the Friend to sit over on the Far Side of the Room and watch them hold Hands, now and
                    then stealing a little Old <pb id="VAA2328-080" n="70" TEIform="pb"/> Hug. The Friend must have
                    enjoyed every Minute of it.</p>

                    say, &quot;Oh, I suppose this little Party fairly hates me.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But one Evening when he went out Hand-Holding and carried his own Gallery with him he ran
                    into Bunches of Trouble. The Friend belonged to the Buttinsky Family and refused to stay on the Far
                    Side of the Room. He was a clever two-handed Boy and had practiced a few Holds of his Own. He pulled
                    his chair over and made it a Threesome. In about 8 Minutes he had the Regular Fellow stymied and
                    Hazel was leaning against him so as to make his Conversation a Short Carry.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Before he left that Evening he had himself all dated up for a Return Engagement. It
                    looked as though the other Young Gentleman had the Casters under him.</p>

                    was the Girl.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Original Gentleman Friend was a Wisenstein. As soon as he saw himself losing out, he
                    began to lay deep and shifty Plans to head off the new Entry. A two-by-four chinless Intellect would
                    have tried to put the Rival into the Nine-Hole by opening up on him and telling where he spent some
                    of his Evenings, but Wisenstein had read on a sign somewhere that every Knock is a Boost. He knew
                    that no Fellow ever landed a real Princess by talking Scandal about the other Candidates.
                    Accordingly, he played a deep System. He became Press Agent for his Friend. He touted Mr. Buttinsky
                    as the real Essence of Allygazam. He painted him in four bright Colors and put his Picture in every
                    Window.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he got the Girl aside he would tell her that dear old Buttinsky was one of the most
                    charming Chaps in the World and claimed to have a lot of Women spreading their Nets for him. He said
                    that Buttinsky was a great <pb id="VAA2328-083" n="73" TEIform="pb"/> Singer, having been known up
                    in the Country where he came from as the Village Thrush. He advised her to have Buttinsky tell a
                    number of his Stories, because as an After-Dinner Wit he had Chauncey M. Depew churned to a Froth
                    and was commonly known as the Life of the Party. Then he asked her if she had seen Buttinsky cut
                    loose in a Ball-Room. He said that all the Girls who saw Buttinsky move across the gleaming Floor in
                    the Two-Step began to look Glassy out of the Eyes and sank back in a Stupor. If she ever
                    i&apos;ound time she ought to talk Books with Buttinsky because he knew them from A to Izzard
                    and could get rid of Literary Talk in a Style calculated to charm a Bird out of a Tree. And as for
                    dear old Art, he was supposed to be the Man who had written it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Buttinsky did not know that he was being Lithographed as a Phenom. When the Princess
                    urged him to trot out his Accomplishments he thought she was so Sticky on him that everything he did

                    chucked in a few Minors. They were these naughty Witch-Hazel Fellows, and after he had turned a few
                    of the Tonsorials loose in the Parlor, he had the Princess straightened out as stiff as a Board and
                    biting at the Doilies. When she led him around to the Subject of the late Novels he got all balled
                    up, for he thought that Gertrude Atherton wrote &quot;Mary MacLane.&quot; And one Night when
                    she teased him out on the Dancing Floor and he missed Step and tried to walk up one side of her, she
                    began to have a dim and twinkling Suspish that this Boy Wonder was a Two-Spot.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Buttinsky helped Matters a lot by trying to undermine Mr. Wisenstein, who had been saying
                    all the Nice Things about him. Every time he got the Princess backed on a Sofa he did a Hammer Solo.
                    For instance, he advised her to have no Dealings with a Man who drank. He said that Wisenstein was a
                    Nice Fellow, But. Then for about 30 Minutes the absent Wisenstein would get his.</p>

                    Accomplishments went, she started in to be Indignant because he roasted one who always spoke so
                    Lovely of him.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As for Wisenstein, when she came right out and asked him about his Habits, he owned up
                    and leaned on her Shoulder and said his only Hope was to get a Good Woman to Reform him. Which,
                    probably, was a very foolish Move.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then when she remembered how Magnanimous he had been, always speaking well of a Certain
                    Person who had tried to sew Buttons on him, she perceived that Wisenstein was one of
                    Nature&apos;s Noblemen. He contradicted her at first, but finally let her have her own Way. And
                    Mr. Buttinsky did not seem to be One-Two-Seventcen.</p>

                    from falling Asleep. She had told him all the Scandal she could think of and Wished a Ring on his
                    Finger and played Philopene, and at last she had to call in that Stop-Gap of revered Memory, the
                    Family Album.</p>

                    married the Music-Teacher et cetera, finally coming to the Likeness of a slender and attractive
                    Damsel in an out-of-date Costume.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;It is a Picture of Mommer before she was married,&quot; said Eclaire.
                    &quot;Everyone says I am the perfect Image of her.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Young Man got busy with his Thinks. He had seen Mommer. She was a good, moral Woman,

                <p TEIform="p">FASTIDIOUS Fannie was the name of a Girl who had her Pencil out and marked down an Error
                    the Minute it was made. She knew the Rules and Regulations by Heart. She slept with the Hand-Book of
                    Etiquette under her Pillow and worked the Eagle Eye whenever she was in Company. Fan was so
                    Grammatical that she made nearly every one tired, and she was so Touchy that those who took long
                    Chances and started in to Chat with her, had to weigh every Word.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At least a dozen Young Men came fooling around at different Times, attracted by her cold
                    Beauty and the fact that she was the Only Child of a National Bank. Fan put the Blue Tag on them one
                    by one. The first was six hours late in making his Party Call, and when he came around he found the
                    Gate nailed up. The second wore his Dinner Jacket and a Black Tie one Evening when he should have
                    worn his long Henry Miller, so Fan wrote to <pb id="VAA2328-092" n="82" TEIform="pb"/> him that ho
                    was 90 per cent Pinky Doodle and belonged in a Lumber Camp. Another was careless enough to strike a
                    Match and light his Student&apos;s Lamp one evening when he was seeing her Home. She screamed
                    and called for a Cab, for she held that no True Gentleman would Smoke a Cigarette while walking with
                    a Lady. A fourth Aspirant wrote to her on the wrong kind of Paper and put the Date at the Top
                    instead of the Bottom and the Answer that he longed for never came. A fifth got the wrong Clutch on
                    her, while they were Waltzing, and after that she couldn&apos;t see him, not even with a Spy
                    Glass.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Thus she threw them into the Scrap Heap as fast as they bobbed up. One parted his Hair on
                    the wrong side and another kept his Hands in his Pockets and another walked oil the off side of her,
                    when they went up Street.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At last she had checked up the whole Push and not one would Do. And they were so Scared
                    of her that when they came near her Corner they did a little Foot-Work to the other side of the
                    Street.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">ONCE upon a Time there was a Gum-Chewer named Tessie who ironed up her White Dress and
                    bought seven yards of Ribbon and went on a Picnic given by the Ladies&apos; Auxiliary of the
                    Horse-Shoers&apos; Union.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Tess was more than nine and could take care of herself at any point along the line. She
                    was full of the Old Harry but very Popular.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She had a changeable Figure and a Complexion that showed up best at a Dance.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Although somewhat shy on Happy Clothes she managed to leave a small Ripple behind her
                    whenever she plowed along Main Street, showing her Buckles. Uusually she wore her Sailor pulled down
                    to her Eye-Brows and cast frightened Glances to right and left, as if to say, &quot;Gee! I
                    wonder if some Fresh Guy is going to speak to me?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But some of them didn&apos;t.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2328-096" n="86" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Therese was her Official Name and she used it on her Cards, each of which had a Colored
                    Picture of Flowers in the Corner. Mother got the name in a Story-Paper.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Bertha Clay Habit seemed to run in the Family. Tessic loved to work her way into a
                    Tea-Gown and then get a couple of Pillows under her and eat Fudges and read how Basil Armytage rode
                    up to the Manor House and found Loraine waiting for him beside the old Yew Tree.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Tessie didn&apos;t know the diff between a Manor House and a Chop House but it
                    sounded swell and she had a secret longing to meet a sure-enough Basil who wore what is sometimes
                    known as a Dress Suit and had Brilliantine on his Mustaches.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While waiting for Basil to pop out at some Corner and catch step with her, Tess was doing
                    the best she could.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">And that was why she used up a lot of Starch getting ready for the Picnic given by the
                    Ladies&apos; Auxiliary of the Horse-Shoers&apos; Union.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">When she walked up the Gang-Plank her Shoes were hurting her a little but she had on all
                    of her Rings and thought fairly well of herself.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Tessie did not fetch any Lunch-Basket with her because she had a horrible Suspicion that
                    some Gentleman would get to talking to her and then make her go and eat a few Lines. She had been
                    out a couple of times before and it had been her Luck not to come back Hungry. Tessie had a sort of
                    a Hunch that History would repeat itself.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So Tessie planted a Camp Stool right in the Main Promenade where those who wished to go
                    Forward or Aft would be compelled to walk over her. After which she gazed pensively at the broad
                    expanse of Drink and waited for something to happen.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now among those on Board was a Pale-Face I with more or less Neck who was prominently
                    connected with the Bundle Department of a first-class Clothing Store. His name was Chauncey and he
                    loved the Society of Ladies. At the same time he knew his Place.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Chauncey spotted Therese and saw that she was alone and sighing for Company but he did
                    not care to be too Brash at the first Crack for fear that she would give a Yelp and jump Overboard.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly he nerved himself and approached her, Hat in Hand, and began to beg her
                    Pardon.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He said he knew it was hardly Proper to brace a Young Lady without the Formality of an
                    Introduction but he hoped she would overlook his Boldness. He made it so Strong that Tessie had to
                    play the Banker&apos;s Daughter in order to hold up her end. She said it did seem very strange
                    to be sitting right there talking to a Party she had never Met and if her People ever suspected that
                    she done anything of that Kind, they would be Awful Sore.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Chauncey pulled out his Cuffs and began to deal Polite Conversation of the kind that is
                    supposed to calm the Fears of a Trembling Young Thing. He told her his Real Name and showed his Link
                    Buttons and begged her not to regard him as a Mere Flirt.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2328-101" n="91" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&apos;At the end of a half hour she was chewing the End of her Fan and answering
                    &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No.&quot; It looked to Tessie as if she would have to put
                    up with him all Day so she began to work the Flag.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As for Chaunce, he perceived that he had been too Fresh, so he switched to the Weather
                    and began to burn low and threaten to go out.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Just when Tess figured herself a sure Loser, some one hit her in the Back and called her
                    Sis. It was a loud Hick who had been watching her on the Dock.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I like your Nerve!&quot; exclaimed Tessie, giving him the Eye.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Now you behave or I&apos;ll give you a mean old Slap right on the
                    Elbow,&quot; said the Hick, saying which he seated himself between Chauncey and Therese.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Gladys, dost think you could learn to love me?&quot; he asked, taking her
                    by the Lace Mitt.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It is needless to say that Chauncey was very Indignant. He felt it his Duty to protect
                    the poor Girl but somehow he found himself <pb id="VAA2328-102" n="[92]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    care so much for the way her Hair was put up and she was toasting him for Keeps and threatening to
                    hand him One if he didn&apos;t let go of her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Finally she got so mad that she asked him to come to the back part of the Boat so that
                    she could tell him just what she thought of him.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">That was where Chauncey found himself alone with the Waterscape. Tessie never came back
                    for she had found her Meal-Ticket.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">ADROVE of Homeless Bachelors was herded every Night in a sad European Hotel. One of them
                    was a Lady-Killer, who didn&apos;t deny it. He had left a Trail of Broken Hearts from Penobscot,
                    Me., to Puget Sound. He had the Style of Beauty made familiar by the Wood-Cuts in the Weekly Story
                    Paper. He was the Police Gazette&apos;s Idea of a Gent. Also he was an identical Ringer for the
                    polished Villain of the Ten-Twent-and-Thirt Repertoire Troupe. He had a long, silky
                    Gambler&apos;s Mustache and he wore embroidered Suspenders. He was Elegant in Every Detail.
                    Trust him for that.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">His name should have been Chilton Travers or Lionel Lyndhurst, but his Parents could <pb
                        id="VAA2328-105" n="95" TEIform="pb"/> not foretell that he would grow up to be Manicured once a
                    Week, so they called him Bill.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He wore Satin Fronts and Velvet Collars and put Cologne on his Eye-Brows. Bill had
                    massive Jewels on each hand and a Watch-Charm the size of a Padlock. When he had combed his Hair so
                    that it stood up in front, a la the Polite Brakeman, and whitened himself with Talcum Powder, and
                    splashed himself with Musk and eaten a few Caehous to perfume the Breath, he was more than Satisfied
                    with himself. He wore sharp-toed Patent Leathers, with Green Tops, at all Hours of the Day and
                    Night. Bill read the <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">Smart Set</hi> every Month and told how much his
                    Clothes cost, and before he had conversed with a Stranger very long he would bring up the Subject of
                    Silk Underwear. One of the yearning Ambitions of his Life was to own a Seal-Skin Overcoat.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Bill was on the Road there was never a Waitress with a Waspy Waist and high-heeled
                    Shoes that did not tremble violently when she handed him his Tenderloin of Beef <pb id="VAA2328-106"

                    Chance to see the real Kafoozalum, although she often reads about him in The Duchess.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At the Hotel which he illuminated with his Presence, Bill was wont to gather a few
                    Friends about him and tell of all the Happy Homes he had wrecked. He let it be under stood that when
                    he held up one Finger and whistled, they came running from all Direc tions.</p>

                    off an Engagement with a Guy from Boston, and all on his Account. He was a Devil among the Women,
                    and he admitted it. As soon as a Lady had counted up his Rings and Lockets and got a good whiff of
                    the Musk, she was ready to play the White Slave. Sometimes, when the Pipe was drawing very freely,
                    he would tell all about being invited out to spend the Evening with a certain Queen whose Father
                    owned one of the principal Banks in Omaha. To prove that all he said was True, he would show a Pink
                    Envelope with Sealing Wax on the back of it. Those who had obtained a Flash of these Missives
                    noticed that they were addressed in Blue Ink, with a little Curly Tail to each Capital Letter, thus
                    proving that they must have been written by Heiresses.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One Peculiar Fact in connection with the Killings made by this Commercial Don Juan was
                    that all the Victims of his Fatal Beauty lived at least 200 miles away. Here in the Town which was
                    Headquarters for him, he <pb id="VAA2328-109" n="99" TEIform="pb"/> seemed comparatively Harmless.
                    He could put on his fawn-colored Prince Albert with a Red Carnation and a jaundice-colored Cravat,
                    and carry his gold-headed Cane all up and down the main Thoroughfares and then come back to the
                    European Hotel without having any of the Elite tagging after him. In fact, if he hadn&apos;
                    Confessed so often, no one would have suspected that Rainbow Bill, the human Mardi Gras, had ever
                    cut any Melons outside of the Switchmen&apos;s Ball.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At this same Hotel there lived two or three Young Fellows who did not use Cocoa Cream or
                    Scented Soap, and not one of them had ever made Cruel Sport of the trusting Affections of a Railway
                    President&apos;s only Child. They thought they were good and lucky if they could sally out after
                    Nightfall and while away a careless Hour with a few nice Stenographers and Music Teachers. All they
                    expected was a little &apos;Coon Stuff on the Piano and then some Dutch Lunch.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It happened that they told the Girls about Rainbow Bill who lived down at the Hotel and
                        <pb id="VAA2328-110" n="100" TEIform="pb"/> was receiving come-back-to-me Letters every Minute
                    or two from the Leaders of Kansas City&apos;s 400 and the Prize Beauties of Lexington, Ky., to
                    say nothing of the Hot-Looker whose Old Man had just built a $250,000 Hut outside of Philadelphia.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Girls said they should like to meet one who had got in right with so many of the
                    First Families, but they were afraid that he wouldn&apos;t pause to dally with them, seeing that
                    they were on Salary. Perhaps one accustomed to show off in a spacious Drawing-Room would find his
                    Style more or less cramped when thrown into the 6x9 Parlor of a $22 Flat. However, the Boys said
                    they would try to inveigle Rainbow Bill. Only, they gave Fair Warning that he claimed to be a
                    Sorcerer and that after he looked a Soubrette in the Eye and made a couple of Passes, she was His,
                    and took Orders from no one else. The Girls said they were ready to take a Chance. Besides, they had
                    been Vaccinated.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Boy with the Wardrobe of many Colors did not show any Eagerness when told that he <pb
                        id="VAA2328-111" n="101" TEIform="pb"/> was wanted up at the Flat. He began to back water and
                    fake up Excuses. They had to tell him that the Girls had seen him on the Street and were dying for
                    an Introduction. At last he fixed himself up until he smelled like a box of Cashmere Bouquet, and
                    they took him in Tow.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He began to lose out from the Minute that he came up the front Steps. His Reputation had
                    preceded him and it was the kind that would sink a Ship. The nifty tailor-made Damsel of Nineteen
                    Hundred and Something doesn&apos;t ask any better Sport than to walk up and down on the
                    tonsorial Wretch who fancies that he is Irresistible. As soon as a Man Bills himself as a
                    Girl-Tamer, the whole Sorority wants to get out and stab him to death with Hat-Pins. For some
                    Reason, the latest variety of New Woman resents the Sug gestion that she is a Soft Mark for the curb

                    kidded him to a Frazzle. They passed the Sarcastic Shots at the Rate of one per Second with no
                    Return, although frequently he had told that he was a great Hand for Repartee. They hurled the
                    Javelins into him until he curled like a Rubber Band. The fascinating Wiles that had played such
                    Havoc among the Society Belles at other Points somehow refused to come to the Surface. All he could
                    do was shift his Legs and look Sheepish. In the whole course of the Evening he found his Voice 8
                    times, but he didn&apos;t say anything that would have induced a Girl to leave her comfortable
                    Home. After the first half hour they wouldn&apos;t have known he was there at all, if he
                    hadn&apos;t got in the Way occasionally.</p>

                    one. He wore Hand-me-Downs that looked as if they had been made by a Swell Tailor. He kept his
                    Trousers on Hangers and took such good care of his Wardrobe that a Suit would last him from 3 to 5
                    Years. He shaved himself and blacked his own Shoes and borrowed a Paper to read.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So that although his Salary didn&apos;t make him round-shouldered taking it Home, he
                    was enabled to soak a couple of Frog Skins each Month and was contemplating Matrimony.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Edward estimated that two of them could get along comfortably on his Pay without cracking
                    the Nest Egg. In Fact, he had it all figured out. The House Rent would be so much and the Groceries
                    would stand him something, and then he allowed $200 a year for Clothing. He knew that he could worry
                        <pb id="VAA2328-115" n="105" TEIform="pb"/> along on half of that Amount and he had heard that
                    Dresses were cheaper than Suits of Clothes.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One Evening, just about the time when he was waiting for a Chance to nab the Girl, he was
                    at the House with other Callers, among them several Women.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">They were asking the Real Thing about some Finery she had just purchased. She said she
                    knew it must be an awful Bore to Men, but she supposed she would have to show it. So she went
                    upstairs and came back with enough Merchandise to fill one of Wanamak-er&apos;s Windows.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Women Callers went into Convulsions and the Men looked at it solemnly and said

                    went on Young Hyson Jags and then groped after the Whatness of something. If she could land in with
                    a dreamy Bunch and sit in a Front Room with all the Curtains pulled down and the Candles shaded,
                    while a Lady who never had ruined her Shape read a Puzzle Paper that got past every one <pb
                        id="VAA2328-119" n="109" TEIform="pb"/> who heard it, then the Wife of the Plain Man thought she
                    was having the Time of her Life.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She loved to flirt with the Unknowable and occasionally take a Fall out of the Occult.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But she had no Time for anything she could Understand. She preferred to sail through the
                    Ethereal Regions of the Bamboo Dreams, hanging by one Toe and having a Rush of Blood to the Head.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As suggested at the Beginning of the Fable, the Poor Woman did not know what hurt her but
                    she proceeded on the Theory that the Higher Intellectual Life consisted of Equal Parts of Vertigo
                    and Guess-Work.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">All this meant Fine Business for the Boy who in a Careless Moment had promised to Love,
                    Honor and Obey. She sprang a new Series of Curves on him every Week or two. Sometimes he suspected
                    that she had gone aft to the Wheel-House but he didn&apos;t like to say so on account of the

                    with an unusual kind of Hair come up to their Number and eat about $2 worth of Chow.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She and the Genius would sit at opposite ends of the Table and ping-pong a line of in

                <p TEIform="p">Azalea did not put in all of her time with the Musickers. One day she came home and said

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;How do you know he is a Genius?&quot; asked the Plain Husband, who was

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;That will be sweet Billiards,&quot; said the Plain Husband. &quot;When
                    I come home at Night all tuckered, there is nothing cheers me more than to listen to an incipient

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;But this one is a Remarkable Character,&quot; said Azalea. &quot;He is

                    who are trying to be kind to him. His favorite Specialty is making Cracks about those who Entertain
                    him. I have no doubt that be will go away and say the most Sarcastic Things about us, but then you
                    must expect that from a Genius.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;ll bet that he won&apos;t say any worse things about us than I
                    say about him,&quot; said the Plain Husband. &quot;What time does the Genius
                    arrive?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You never can tell,&quot; was the Reply. &quot;He is so Great that he
                    scorns to keep his Appointments, but if he cones at all, it will be some-where between five and

                <p TEIform="p">The Genius arrived at 9.30 and said all he wanted for Dinner was four Bowls of Soup and
                    an Orange. Azalea thought he was charmingly Eccentric. It would be wrong to tell what the Plain
                    Husband thought.</p>

                    Every week or so the Plain Husband would arrive at the House to find everything upset in Honor of
                    some longitudinal Empress in the World of Thought who glared at him through Steel Specs and wore her
                    Wens in the most unexpected Places. Any time that the Plain Husband bumped against a Proposition of
                    this kind, he folded up like a Pocket Camera. When it came time to Carve he would be so Nervous that
                    every Slice looked as if it had been put through a Fluting Machine.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This went on for Years. He used to tell on the Outside, when he was in his Cups, that he
                    was conducting a first-class Boarding House for Freaks. Azalea put it differently. She said that she
                    had entertained more Whales than any other Woman along the Street.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But the Dorsal Vertebrae of the long-suffering Camel may be weighted to the Point of
                    Fracture and there came a Day when the Plain Husband riz up. He invited a few Friends to Dinner and
                    then notified Azalea. She <pb id="VAA2328-126" n="116" TEIform="pb"/> scanned the List and then
                    threw a couple of Throes.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nobody ever heard of these Folks,&quot; she said.</p>

                    the Plain Husband. &quot;I long for the sight of those who Comb it in the Ordinary Way and talk
                    about something besides Themselves. I have got good and tired of looking at Genius through Smoked

                    Evening, had a little System of his own. He believed that the correct Method was to tell each New
                    One all about how the Others were crazy to Land him. This would show that he was a Popular Young
                    Fellow and would make the New One a little more eager to cut the others out.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The System worked so well that he used it all the time. He kept his Pockets full of
                    Letters and Photographs to prove that he was No. 1 with at least a Dozen of them, and in order to
                    make it very Strong he had a few Presents of Jewelry that he would show, under his Coat, when he

                    Record as a Girl-Subduer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She conic down and he got Busy. He showed her a Ring that had been given to him one Night

                    told how several Weddings had been postponed in the Hope that lie, the Idol of the Ladies and the

                    in a while he would secretly pine for something that scaled under 35. His Heart had been on Short

                    &quot;When you take the first Flash you don&apos;t care so much for her. But after you get

                    the Window, so that gave him no chance to Jump. Friend shoved him back into a Window Seat and asked
                    him to put a Cushion behind her. Then she started in to twist the Buttons off his Coat and tell him
                    how much she had heard about him. She said he had an Interesting Face. He had a Notion to come back

                    I may be wrong, so I will go.&quot;</p>

                    know what Women suffered. She said they were Oh, so Indifferent and soon Forgot. The Mark hoped that
                    it might be so. He had a very yellow Evening but the one who had taken him along had a Thor, so it

                <p TEIform="p">GILBERT was engaged to marry Refined Alice, Daughter of the Com mission Merchant.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He was on the List of Eligibles that every Mother in Town had in her Writing Desk. The
                    Parents on both sides of the Fence had given their Consent. All Preliminaries had been arranged.
                    There was not a Cloud in the Sky. It was a tame everyday, colorless kind of Courtship and that is
                    why it did not suit Alice.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She wanted to be Engaged to some one who would send a Secret Message by the Faithful
                    Servant and then climb a Rope-Ladder and try to Kiss her through a Screen Window. Her Idea of
                    meeting a Lover was to slip out on a Dark Night and find him at the Trysting-Place, muffled in a
                    Cloak. There was no particular Excitement in being under Contract to one who came in the Front Way.
                    So she <pb id="VAA2328-141" n="131" TEIform="pb"/> wearied of the Alliance and Gilbert began to have
                    Visions of himself on a Siding and get ting the Red Light.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He knew that she wanted a Love Affair with a few streaks of Melodrama in it and rather
                    than pass up a Good Thing he fixed it for her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He got her Father into a Poker Party and bluffed him out of his Money and then joshed
                    him. Alice&apos;s Father went home and said that he had been mistaken in the Young Man and
                    perhaps she had better call the Deal off. Then a lot of Gilbert&apos;s Friends went around to
                    see her and they began to Rap. They told her that Gilbert was an all-night Bat and a Sport and that
                    he had a Past.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;They are trying to Separate us,&quot; said Alice, with her Hand on her
                    Heart. &quot;But Courage, Sweetheart! I will be True.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Gilbert wrote and said he dared not come to the House, for fear her Father would take a
                    Shot at him, but if she loved him, to put a Lamp in the Window and he would be outside in the Rain,
                    waiting to learn his Fate. It was a happy Night for Alice.</p>

                    him drink Sassafras Tea each Night.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Eugene pined away for a couple of Days and then transferred his Pollywog Affections to an
                    Old Maid who stood at the General Delivery Window at the Post-Office. He wrote for Seed Catalogues
                    and Terms to Agents so as to have an Excuse to speak to Angel. She up and married the Station Agent.
                    Eugene had to go out and forget his Sorrow in Base-Ball and Pull-Away.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In due Time he went to a Fresh-Water College and here he began to yearn for another Kind.
                    It happened that he went out Botanizing with a slender Co-Ed who wore Nose-Glasses <pb
                        id="VAA2328-147" n="137" TEIform="pb"/> and had an Intellect that made a Noise like a Dynamo.
                    Frequently they did their Algebra together and he wrote Notes to her in Latin telling her that she
                    was All Right.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Along about this time his Idea of Paradise come down to Earth was to own a snug little
                    Library and sit in it every Evening reading aloud to a tall-browed Helpmeet. He wrote several Essays
                    on Women and sprung them on the Pythagorean Literary Society. He said that every Maverick who was
                    cow-trailing around over the Sand-Lots of this dreary Life had an Affinity concealed somewhere in
                    the Brush and the Game was to hunt her up and then stick to her like Spalding&apos;s Glue. He
                    allowed that the real Girline Charms did not depend upon Frizzes and Make-Up. Eugene was strong for
                    the Beauty of Soul which would wear for Years and look just as well on one Side as on the Other.</p>

                    He decided to cut out the Private Reading Circle until he could see his Way clear to get enough to
                    pay for the Li cense.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Having settled in the City he gave a busy Imitation of a Bright Young Fellow who is
                    trying to side-step the Potter&apos;s Field. At the Boarding House where he coaled there was a
                    Head Waitress who carried a Remarkable Shape for one who had to be on her Feet all day. She never
                    had been beyond the 3rd Grade in the Grammar School but when they had Chicken she always slipped
                    Gene the Second Joint and she had his Paper propped up for him when he came to Breakfast. He gave
                    her several long Rides on the Cars and there might have been something doing if Eugene had not had
                    his Salary whooped. He moved into a first-class, pruneless Family Hotel and got into the Habit of
                    carrying Money in his Clothes. In the meantime the Co-Ed was off in Minnesota somewhere, teaching
                    School.</p>

                    Eugene, who was now 80 and had mislaid his Diploma, found that he no longer had an un controllable
                    Desire to buckle up with those who wore Specs and could tear the lining out of Synthetic Philosophy.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he ambled around after Dinner he had his Port Eye out for a larksome Looloo who
                    would pin Flowers on him and tease him to take her to a Lively Show. He began to buy Jack Roses for
                    all who were under 22. He framed his Dresser with Carbon Photos of Mazies and Lilians and Madges.
                    One of the upper Drawers smelled like the front part of a Drug Store and was filled with Square
                    Envelopes addressed in the scraggly, dislocated Writing that looks like a Profile Drawing of the
                    Sierra Nevadas.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Eugene was now too Busy to think of Matrimony. He had eight or nine on his Books at one
                    time and the main Joy of his Life was to burn up his Income in such a way that it would give a
                    fleeting Hour of Happiness to a dimpled Bud weighing anywhere from 85 to 115 Pounds.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2328-151" n="141" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">The Library which he had planned in the Cloisters of Learning consisted of a Date-Book
                    and a Volume telling how to cook Things in a Chafing-Dish.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">By and by it came about that Eugene had a thin Spot on top of his Head. The little Snips
                    who hopped out of the Nursery into Sassiety every Fall started in to call him Papa and Nunky. He
                    began to count the Years and decided that he was due to take the High Jump.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But he did not choose any Lady who taught in the Sunday School. Neither did he swing on
                    any Old Maid at the General Delivery. His Heart did not hone and hanker for any Female Emerson or
                    any stately and superior Head Waitress. Even the Society Queen who had been worked out for a couple
                    of Seasons did not appeal to Eugene. He put his Tag on a blonde Canary 17 Years of Age who spelled
                    Sure with an H and had from 7 to 9 Thoughts every 24 Hours. But she was very Easy to Look at. And

                    Manner. The Druggist was willing to give a Guarantee that the Bristles were Real. This Toilet Set
                    reposed in a puckered Nest of Yellow Satin. The Box was of Blue Plush with a neat Clasp and on the
                    Lid was the Following, in Silver Letters: &quot;Merry X-Mas.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every Girl in Town came into the Drug Store and leaned on the Show-Case and gazed
                    longingly at the Work of Art. It was evident that the local Beau who loosened up for $6.50 would win
                    in a Canter. But there was general Doubt as to whether any one would be so Reckless as to fork over
                    $6.50, just for Foolishness. All who went into the Drug <pb id="VAA2328-159" n="[149]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    Plush, the Yellow Satin and the gleaming Celluloid, conceded that the Outfit was Purty, but they
                    allowed it was too Fine for Actual Use. It was supposed that the Box alone would come to $3. Some
                    said the Letters on the Lid were genuine Silver. Others contended that they were merely Plated.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In every Household the Toilet Set was a fruitful Topic. The general Verdict appeared to
                    be that, in all probability, the Druggist would either have to knock off something on the Price or
                    else be Stuck. There had been one or two Offers of $5 for the <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">Pice de
                        Rsistance,</hi> but the Druggist claimed that he had paid more than that for it, Wholesale.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Three Days before Christmas there appeared on the Yellow Satin a Card marked
                    &quot;Sold.&quot; The News spread like Wild-Fire that some one had blown himself to the
                    Limit. There was but one Question agitating the whole Village for the next two Days. &quot;Who
                    will get the Toilet Set for Christmas?&quot; Speculation ran rife and every Girl who kept <pb
                        id="VAA2328-161" n="151" TEIform="pb"/> Company was hoping against Hope, even though her cold
                    Judgment told her that, in all likelihood, her Fellow had not seen $6.50 in six long Months.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Druggist had been pledged to Secrecy and it became evident that the Populace would
                    have to wait until Christmas to have its Curiosity appeased. So it waited with a lot of Impatience.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Village Wag, whose name was Amos, had been one of Several who looked at the Toilet
                    Set and counted their Money and passed out. He loved a Girl named Luella, but he had a Frugal Mind.
                    It seemed to him that it would be more Sensible to save his Money and make a First Payment on a
                    Home. Besides, the Poultry Business had been a little Slack and he couldn&apos;t see himself
                    giving up $6.50 for a dosh-burned Gimcrack that was no Account except to look at. So he gave up 60
                    Cents for an Autograph Album and let it go at that. He would have gone ahead and bought something
                    for a Dollar, only Amos thought he had a Cinch. His only Rival for <pb id="VAA2328-162" n="152"
                        TEIform="pb"/> the Hand of Luella was Tallmadge N. Crockett, proprietor of the Livery and Feed
                    Stable. Amos was so much more Comic and Conversational than Tallmadge and had such a Taking Way that
                    he wasn&apos;t for a Minute afraid of being Cut Out by Tallmadge.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Being the recognized Village Wag, Amos was called upon to impersonate Santa Claus at the
                    Christmas Tree Entertainment. Amos was a born Romp, and the Congregation was sure of many a Hearty
                    Laugh when he came in as Santy and began to cut Didoes.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Amos borrowed a Buffalo Robe, a Strand of Bells and a Fur Cap. He rigged up a Set of
                    Cotton Whiskers and prepared to be even Funnier than usual.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">On Christmas Eve the Church put them in the Aisles, so great was the Interest in the
                    Tree. The Superintendent of the Sunday School, looking unusually pale and scrubbed-up and smelling
                    of Bay Rum, stood up in front of the Tree and made an Address that was Facetious, from his Point of
                    View. The Choir sang one of its hardest Anthems and after two <pb id="VAA2328-163" n="[153]"

                    in as Santa Claus and did some of his best Comedy Acting. He galloped up and down the Aisles and
                    scared several Children in Arms into Convulsions. Then he went up to the Tree to assist the droll
                    Superintendent in distributing Presents. As a Team they were expected to spring a great many timely
                    Quips, right on the Spur of the Moment.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While standing by the Tree, waiting for the Infant Class to conclude a Carol, Amos saw on
                    a Table the magnificent Toilet Set, with the $6.50 Mark still on it. He drew nearer to read the
                    attached Card and almost fainted with Horror when he saw the Name of Luella in the well-known
                    Hand-Writing of Tallmadge N. Crockett. The Shock was so great that everything Swam before his Gaze,
                    the same as in a Natatorium. He could not see anything except his own Finish. When Luella came to
                    compare the superb Toilet Set and the 60-cent Autograph Album, he knew that he would not be
                    One-Two-Seven. He was inspired to a Desperate Action. He happened to remember that <pb
                        id="VAA2328-165" n="155" TEIform="pb"/> Celluloid contains Gun Cotton and Camphor and other high
                    Explosives. The Infant Class stood between him and the Congregation. Stealthily he plucked a lighted
                    Candle from the Tree and dropped it on the Toilet Set. Then he leaped over the Rail. There was a
                    terrific Report, a flash of Fire, an odor of Camphor and the Air was full of Infant Class. A Panic
                    ensued. Throwing off his Disguise of White Cotton Whiskers, Amos gathered Luella in his Arms and
                    carried her to a Place of Safety. She called him &quot;Preserver&quot; and refused to let go
                    of him. When Quiet was restored, there was nothing left of the Toilet Set except the Clasp and the
                    letters spelling &quot;Merry X-Mas.&quot;</p>

                    he had been dealing in Gum-Drops. He had worked along on the Theory that my Lady Isabelle hankered
                    for nothing but sugar-coated Compliments. All the other Young Fellows followed the same Method. If
                    their Conversation had been set to Music, they could have done it as a Chorus.</p>

                    their Defects. Instead of praising the Costume of a Lady Friend, he would tell her, on the Q. T.,
                    that some other Color was more becoming. He would deliberately pick a Quarrel so as to have a warm
                    little Tiff and a Reconciliation. They began to be afraid of him and they paid more Attention to

                <p TEIform="p">LUTIE was an Only Child. When Lutie was eighteen her Mother said they ought to do

                    Nerve. Others allowed that it ought to be Pulled.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But what Mamma meant was that Lutie ought to have it cultivated by a Professor. She

                <p TEIform="p">She bought a red leather Cylinder marked &quot;Music,&quot; so that people would
                    not take it to be Lunch. Every morning about 9 o&apos;clock she would wave the Housework to one
                    side and tear for a Trolley. Her Lessons cost the Family about twenty cents a Minute. She took them
                    in a large Building full of Vocal Studios. People who didn&apos;t know used to stop in front of
                    the Place and listen, and think it was a Surgical Institute.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">There were enough Soprani in this one Plant to keep Maurice Grau stocked up for a Hundred
                    Years. Every One thought she was the Particular One who would sooner or later send Melba back to
                    Australia and drive Sembrich into the Continuous. Lutie was just about as Nifty as the Next One.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When she was at Home she would suck Lemons and complain about Draughts and tell why she
                    didn&apos;t like the Other Girls&apos; Voices. She began to act like a Prima Don <pb
                        id="VAA2328-175" n="165" TEIform="pb"/> na, and her Mother was encouraged a Lot. Lutie certainly
                    had the Artistic Temperament bigger than a Church Debt.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now before Lutie started in to do Things to her Voice she occasionally Held Hands with a
                    Young Man in the Insurance Business, named Oliver. This Young Man thought that Lutie was all the
                    Merchandise, and she regarded him as Permanent Car-Fare.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But when Lutie began to hang out at the Studios she took up with the Musical Set that
                    couldn&apos;t talk about anything but Technique and Shading and the Motif and the Vibrato. She
                    began to fill up the Parlor with her new Friends, and the first thing Oliver knew he was in the Side
                    Pocket and out of the Game.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In his own Line this Oliver was as neat and easy-running as a Red Buggy, but when you
                    started him on the topic of Music he was about as light and speedy as a Steam Roller. Ordinarily he
                    knew how to behave himself in a Flat, and with a good Feeder to work back at him he could talk about
                    Shows and Foot <pb id="VAA2328-176" n="166" TEIform="pb"/> Ball Games and Things to Eat, but when
                    any one tried to draw him out on the Classics, he was unable to Qualify. In short, he was a Crab.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Lutie and her Musical Acquaintances told about Shopan and Batoven he would sit back
                    so quiet that often he got numb below the Hips. He was afraid to move his Feet for fear some one
                    would notice he was still in the Parlor and ask him how he liked Fugue No. 11, by Bock. He had never
                    heard of any of these People, because they did not carry Tontine Policies with his Company.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Oliver saw that he would have to scratch the Musical Set or else begin to Read Up, so he
                    changed his Route. He cancelled all Time with Lutie, and made other Bookings.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Lutie then selected for her Steady a Young Man with Hair who played the &apos;Cello.
                    He was so wrapped up in his Art that he acted Dopey most of the time, and often forgot to send out
                    the Laundry so as to get it back the same Week. Furthermore he didn&apos;t fly <pb
                        id="VAA2328-177" n="167" TEIform="pb"/> to the Suds any too often. He never saw more than $3 at
                    one time; but when he snuggled up alongside of a &apos;Cello and began to tease the long, sad
                    Notes out of it, you could tell that he had a Soul for Music. Lutie thought he was Great, but what
                    Lutie&apos;s Father thought of him could never get past the Censor. Lutie&apos;s Father
                    regarded the whole Musical Set as a Fuzzy Bunch. He began to think that in making any Outlay for
                    Lutie&apos;s Vocal Training he had bought a Gold Brick. When he first consented to her taking
                    Lessons his Belief had been that after she had practiced for about one Term she would be able to sit
                    up to the Instrument along in the Dusk before the Lamps were lit, and sing &quot;When the Corn
                    is Waving, Annie Dear,&quot; &quot;One Sweetly Solemn Thought,&quot; or else
                    &quot;Juanita.&quot; These were the Songs linked in his Memory with some Purple Evenings of
                    the Happy Long Ago. He knew they were Chestnuts, and had been called in, but they suited him, and he
                    thought that inasmuch as he had put up the Wherewith for <pb id="VAA2328-178" n="168" TEIform="pb"/>
                    Lutie&apos;s Lessons he ought to have some kind of a Small Run for his Money.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Would Lutie sing such Trash? Not she. She was looking for Difficult Arias from the
                    Italian, and she found many a one that was Difficult to sing, and probably a little more Difficult
                    to Listen To.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Voice began to be Erratic, also. When Father wanted to sit by the Student&apos;s
                    Lamp and read his <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">Scribner&apos;s,</hi> she would decide to hammer the
                    Piano and do the whole Repertoire.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But when Mother had Callers and wanted Lutie to Show Off, then she would hang back and
                    have to be Coaxed. If she didn&apos;t have a Sore Throat, then the Piano was out of Tune, or
                    else she had left all of her Good Music at the Studio, or maybe she just couldn&apos;t Sing
                    without some one to Accompany her. But after they had Pleaded hard enough, and everybody was
                    Embarrassed and sorry they had come, she would approach the Piano timidly and sort of Trifle with it
                    for awhile, and say they would have to make <pb id="VAA2328-179" n="169" TEIform="pb"/> Allowances,
                    and then she would Cut Loose and worry the whole Block. The Company would sit there, every one
                    showing the Parlor Face and pretending to be entranced, and after she got through they would Come To
                    and tell how Good she was.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She made on many of these Parlor Triumphs that there was no Holding her. She had herself
                    Billed as a Nightingale. Often she went to Soires and Club Entertainments, volunteering her
                    Services, and nowhere did she meet a Well-Wisher who took her aside and told her she was a Shinein
                    fact, the Champion Pest.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">No, Lutie never got out of her Dream until she made a bold Sashay with a Concert Company.
                    It was her Professional Debut.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Father fixed it. The Idea of any one paying Real Money to hear Lutie sing struck him as
                    being almost Good enough to Print. But she wouldn&apos;t be Happy until she got it, and so she
                    got It right where the Newport Lady wears the Rope of Pearls.</p>

                    Make Good. Next Morning they said that Lutie had Blow-Holes in her Voice; that she hit the Key only
                    once during the Evening, and then fell off backward; that she was a Ham, and her Dress
                    didn&apos;t fit her, and she lacked Stage Presence. They expressed Surprise that she should be
                    attempting to Sing when any bright Girl could learn to pound a Type-Writer in Four Weeks. They
                    wanted to know who was responsible for her Appearance, and said it was a Shame to String these Jay
                    Amateurs. Lutie read the Criticisms, and went into Nervous Collapse. Her Mother was all Wrought Up,
                    and said somebody ought to go and kill the Editors. Father bore up grimly.</p>

                    and brought their Mandolins along. They would double over and tickle the Instruments nearly to Death
                    and then she would say that she loved Music.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One was named Fred and the other was Eustace.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Mothers of the Neighborhood often remarked, &quot;What Perfect Manners Fred and

                    the Mothers than they were with the Younger Set, although no one could say a Word against either of
                    them. Only it was rumored in Keen Society that they didn&apos;t Belong. The Fact that they went

                    of their Acquaintance.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Debutante&apos;s name was Myrtle. Her Parents were very Watchful, and did not
                    encourage her to receive Callers, except such as were known to be Exemplary Young Men. Fred and
                    Eustace were a few of those who escaped the Black List. Myrtle always appeared to be glad to see
                    them, and they regarded her as a Terrible Swell Girl.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Fred&apos;s Cousin came from St. Paul on a Visit; and one Day, in the Street, he saw
                    Myrtle, and noticed that Fred tipped his Hat, and gave her a Stage Smile.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh, Queen of Sheba!&quot; exclaimed the Cousin from St. Paul, whose name
                    was Gus, as he stood stock still and watched her Shepherd&apos;s Plaid disappear around a
                    Corner. &quot;She&apos;s a Bird. Do you know her well?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I know her Quite Well,&quot; replied Fred, coldly. &quot;She is a
                    Charming Girl.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;She is all of that. You&apos;re a great Describer. And now what Night are
                    you going to take me around to Call on her?&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2328-186" n="176" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Fred very naturally Hemmed and Hawed. It must be remembered that Myrtle was a member of
                    an Excellent Family, and had been schooled in the Proprieties, and it was not to be supposed that
                    she would crave the Society of slangy old Gus, who had an Abounding Nerve, and furthermore was as
                    Fresh as the Mountain Air.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He was the Kind of Fellow who would see a Girl twice, and then, upon meeting her the
                    Third Time, he would go up and straighten her Cravat for her, and call her by her First Name.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Put him into a Strange Companyen route to a Picnicand by the time the Baskets were
                    unpacked he would have a Blonde all to himself, and she would have traded her Fan for his College
                    Pin.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If a Fair-Looker on the Street happened to glance at him Hard he would run up and seize
                    her by the Hand, and convince her that they had Met. And he always Got Away with it, too.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In a Department Store, while waiting for <pb id="VAA2328-187" n="177" TEIform="pb"/> the
                    Cash Boy to come back with the Change, he would find out the Girl&apos;s Name, her Favorite
                    Flower, and where a Letter would reach her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Upon entering a Parlor Car at St. Paul, he would select a Chair next to the Most
                    Promising One in Sight, and ask her if she cared to have the Shade lowered.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Before the Train cleared the Yards he would have the Porter bringing a Foot Stool for the
                    Lady.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At Hastings he would be asking her if she wanted Something to Read.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At Red Wing he would be telling her that she resembled Maxine Elliott, and showing her
                    his Watch, left to him by his Grandfather, a Prominent Virginian.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At La Crosse he would be reading the Menu Card to her, and telling her how different it
                        <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">is</hi> when you have Some One to join you in a Bite.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At Milwaukee he would go out and buy a Bouquet for her, and when they rode into Chicago
                    they would be looking out of the <pb id="VAA2328-188" n="178" TEIform="pb"/> same Window, and he
                    would be arranging for her Baggage with the Transfer Man. After that they would be Old Friends.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now Fred and Eustace had been at School with Gus, and they had seen his Work, and they
                    were not disposed to Introduce him into One of the most Exclusive Homes in the City.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">They had known Myrtle for many Years; but they did not dare to Address her by her First
                    Name, and they were Positive that if Gus attempted any of his usual Tactics with her she would be
                    Offended; and, naturally enough, they would be Blamed for bringing him to the House.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But Gus insisted. He said he had seen Myrtle, and she Suited him from the Ground up, and
                    he proposed to have Friendly Doings with her. At last they told him they would take him if he
                    promised to Behave. Fred warned him that Myrtle would frown down any Attempt to be Familiar on Short
                    Acquaintance, and Eustace said that as long as he had known Myrtle he had never Presumed to be Free
                    and Forward with her. He had <pb id="VAA2328-189" n="179" TEIform="pb"/> simply played the Mandolin.
                    That was as Far Along as he had ever got.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Gus told them not to Worry about him. All he asked was a Start. He said he was a Willing
                    Performer, but as yet he had never been Disqualified for Crowding. Fred and Eustace took this to
                    mean that he would not Overplay his Attentions, so they escorted him to the House.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As soon as he had been Presented, Gus showed her where to sit on the Sofa, then he placed
                    himself about Six Inches away and began to Buzz, looking her straight in the Eye. He said that when
                    he first saw her he mistook her for Miss Prentice, who was said to be the Most Beautiful Girl in St.
                    Paul, only, when he came closer, he saw that it couldn&apos;t be Miss Prentice, because Miss
                    Prentice didn&apos;t have such Lovely Hair. Then he asked her the Month of her Birth and told
                    her Fortune, thereby coming nearer to Holding her Hand within Eight Minutes than Eustace had come in
                    a Lifetime.</p>

                    Music for him.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">They unlimbcred their Mandolins and began to play a Sousa March. He asked Myrtle if she
                    had seen the New Moon. She replied that she had not, so they went Outside.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Fred and Eustace finished the First Piece, Gus appeared at the open Window, and
                    asked them to play &quot;The Good Old Slimmer Time,&quot; which had always been one of his
                    Favorites.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So they played that, and when they had Concluded there came a Voice from the Outer
                    Darkness, and it was the Voice of Myrtle. She said: &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what to Play;
                    play the Intermezzo.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Fred and Eustace exchanged Glances. They began to Perceive that they had been backed into
                    a Siding. With a few Potted Palms in front of them, and two Cards from the Union, they would have
                    been just the same as a Hired Orchestra.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But they played the Intermezzo and felt <pb id="VAA2328-192" n="182" TEIform="pb"/>
                    Peevish. Then they went to the Window and looked out. Gas and Myrtle were sitting in the Hammock,
                    which had quite a Pitch towards the Center. Gus had braced himself by Holding to the Back of the
                    Hammock. He did not have his Arm around Myrtle, but he had it Extended in a Line parallel with her
                    Back. What he had done wouldn&apos;t Justify a Girl in saying, &quot;Sir!&quot; but it
                    started a Real Scandal with Fred and Eustace. They saw that the only Way to Get Even with her was to
                    go Home without saying &quot;Good Night.&quot; So they slipped out of the Side Door,
                    shivering with Indignation.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After that, for several Weeks, Gus kept Myrtle so Busy that she had no Time to think of
                    considering other Candidates. He sent Books to her Mother, and allowed the Old Gentleman to take
                    Chips away from him at Poker.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">They were Married in the Autumn, and Father-in-Law took Gus into the Firm, saying that he
                    had needed a good Pusher for a Long Time.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">One night, at a Lawn Fete given by the Ladies of the Methodist Congregation, he met
                    Daughter. She noticed that his Trousers did not bag at the Knees; also that he wore a superb Ring.
                    They strolled under the Maples, and he talked what is technically known as Hot Air. He made an
                    Impression considerably deeper than Himself. She promised to Correspond.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">On the occasion of his next Visit to the Way Station, he let her wear his Ring, and made
                    a Wish, while she took him riding in the Phaeton. He began to carry her Photograph <pb

                    House. Sometimes he would fold over one of her Letters so they could see how it started out. He said
                    the Old Man had Nothing But, and he proposed to make it a case of Marry. Truly, it seemed that he
                    was the principal Cake in the Pantry, and little did he suspect that he could be Frosted.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But Daughter, after much Pleading, induced Father to send her to a Finishing School in
                    the East. (A Finishing School is a Place at which Young Ladies are taught how to give the Quick
                    Finish to all Persons who won&apos;t do.)</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At School, the Daughter tied up with a Chum, who seldom overlooked a Wednesday Matinee,
                    and she learned more in Three Weeks than her Childhood Home could have shown her in three Centuries.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now she began to see the other Kind; the Kind that wears a Cutaway, with a White Flower,
                    in the Morning, a Frock, with Violets in the Afternoon, and a jimmy little Tuxedo at Night.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">For the first time she began to listen to Harness that had Chains to it, and she rode in
                    Vehicles that permitted her to glance in at the Second Stories.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She stopped wearing Hats, and began to choose Confections. She selected them Languidly,
                    three at a time.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then the Bill to the Way Station, and Father down with Heart Failure.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She kept Mr. Sothern&apos;s Picture on her Dresser, with two Red Candles burning in
                    front of it, and every time she thought of Gabby Will, the Cracker jack Salesman, she reached for
                    the Peau Espagne and sprayed herself.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One Day when the Tobacco Salesman came up Main Street with his Grips, on his way to visit
                    the Trade, he met the Drill Clerk, who told him that She was Home on a Visit. So he hurried through
                    with his Work, got a Shave, changed ends on his Cuffs, pared his Nails, bought a <pb

                <p TEIform="p">Daughter was on the Lawn seated under a Canopy that had set Father back thirty-two
                    Dollars. There was a Hired Hand sprinkling the Grass with a Hose, and as Will, the Conversational
                    Drummer, came up the Long Walk, Daughter called to the Hired Hand, and said: &quot;Johnson,
                    there is Strange Man coming up the Walk; change the Direction of the Stream somewhat, else you may
                    Dampen him.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Drummer approached her, feeling of his Necktie, and wondered if She would up and Kiss
                    him, right in broad daylight She didn&apos;t. Daughter allowed a rose-colored Booklet, by Guy de
                    Maupassant, to sink among the Folds of her French Gown, and then she Looked at him and said:
                    &quot;All Goods must be delivered at the Rear.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Don&apos;t you Know me?&quot; he asked.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Rully, it seems to me I have seen you,</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Somewhere,&quot; she replied, &quot;but I cahn&apos;t place <pb
                        id="VAA2328-201" n="191" TEIform="pb"/> you. Are you the Man who tunes the Piano?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Don&apos;t you remember the night I met you at the Lawn Fte?&quot; he
                    asked; and then, Chump that he was, and all Rattled, he told her his Name, instead of giving her the
                    scorching Come-Back that he composed Next Day, when it was Too Late.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I meet so many People traveling about,&quot; she said; &quot;I
                    cahn&apos;t remember all of them, you know. I dare say you called to see Pupah; he will be here
                    Presently.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then she gave him &quot;Some one&apos;s else,&quot;
                    &quot;Neyether,&quot; &quot;Savoir-Faire,&quot; and a few other Crisp Ones, hot from
                    the Finishing School, after which she asked him how the Dear Villagers were coming on. He reminded
                    her that he did not live in the Town. She said: &quot;Only Fahncy!&quot; and he said he
                    guessed he&apos;d have to be Going, as he had promised a Man to meet him at Jordan&apos;s
                    Store before the Bank closed.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As he moved toward the St. Nicholas Hotel he kept his hand on his Solar Plexus. <pb
