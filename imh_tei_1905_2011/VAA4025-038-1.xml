                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> in a pensive mood as it looked back over the Civil War years which had so
                    recently closed. "We wonder at what we have endured, we wonder at what we have
                    achieved," it reflected. "We know as never before why we are blinded as to the
                    future. Could we have… anticipated the great price we would have to pay for the
                    maintenance of our integrity, we would have shrunk in dismay from the contest, or entered upon it
                    with hearts unutterably heavy."</p>
            <p>In sharp contrast was the gay holiday spirit which permeated Indiana in the spring of 1861 as the
                    state bustled about the business of mobilizing for war. Amid the early martial enthusiasm there were
                    few who anticipated the long and sanguinary struggle ahead. The eager volunteers who filled the
                    three months' regiments—and the politicians who sanctified their
                    cause—envisioned a war of short duration, a pleasant summer campaign, followed by the
                    swift collapse of the Confederacy. With that accomplished, they expected a quick return to peace, to
                    "the Union as it was," and to the suspended but still unsettled political issues.
                    The war was being prosecuted only to preserve the Union, "with all the dignity, equality,
                    and rights of the several States unimpaired" ran the Crittenden resolution which was
                    endorsed, in July, 1861, by every Indiana congressman.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Thus, having little
                    cognition of the social dynamics implicit in the war itself, the Hoosiers were hardly prepared for
                    the profound changes that were soon to overtake Indiana and the nation.</p>
            <p>As the months wore on, however, and the prospect of <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-038-1-006"/> peace and reunion appeared ever more remote, the citizens of
                    Indiana ultimately perceived that the old order was changing—that "the Union as
                    it was" would be no more. Denied a clear perspective by the distraction of clashing armies
                    and angry politicians, few men grasped the full meaning of those momentous changes. It became
                    increasingly clear that "hence-forth the Americans will be a different people,"<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and that the country was entering upon "a new stage of
                        being."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Thus, while the war experience was being woven into the
                    fabric of state and national heritage, its impact was transforming every aspect of Hoosier society.</p>
            <p>The local beneficiaries of change welcomed these revolutionary appurtenances of military strife and
                    pronounced them good. The war too they blessed as a "refining ordeal" which would
                    develop "the virtues of the American people." Denying that it would have any ill
                    effects upon popular institutions, they insisted that the nation would "from the crucible
                    of war and the sacrifice of blood, present a more perfect civilization… than the world
                    has ever seen."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This happy picture of a regenerate people with souls cleansed by a bath of blood, however, was at
                    best a distortion of the Indiana scene during those four long years of war. Instead the state
                    presented a variegated mosaic of heroic, self-sacrificing patriotism and unblushing avarice, of warm
                    idealism and calloused cynicism.</p>
            <p>Noble indeed was the general devotion to the soldiers' welfare portrayed by the untiring
                    zeal of state sanitary workers, the sanitary fairs, the women's auxiliary societies, the
                    church organizations of every denomination, and the independent activity of young and old alike.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Commendable too were the efforts stimulated by Governor Oliver P. Morton in
                    behalf of the destitute families of the volunteers.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> For that purpose
                    soldiers' aid societies were formed, thousands of loaves of bread were distributed from the
                    state bakery, theaters presented benefit performances, and farmers frequently <list type="footnotes">

                    a social consciousness and cooperative spirit which in that individualistic age prior to the war had
                    been all but dormant.</p>
            <p>In contrast there was, unfortunately, in this war-time society a grim and morbid <hi rend="i">motif</hi> which predominated throughout the conflict. It was revealed in the suffering and
                    privation of broken families deprived of their means of support, and in the many tragic letters to
                    the governor appealing for material aid.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> It appeared again in the terrible
                    anxiety about the safety of loved ones after every battle, in the growing lists of native sons who
                    were killed in action or died of disease, and in the desperate efforts of relatives to visit the
                    sick and wounded in military hospitals.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> At home the original horror at the

                    </placeName> depot was gradually deadened as people became hardened and habituated to such
                    incidences of war.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the appeal to arms appeared to be at least as conducive to the development of vice as it
                    was of virtue. In Indiana's bustling capital city the business of war preparations brought
                    in its wake a decided slackening of moral standards. Gambling and heavy drinking were common;
                    painted women plied their trade unmolested except for the occasional invasion of their premises by
                    mobs of drunken soldiers who turned them into shambles. Crime grew apace. Newspapers were filled
                    with accounts of street brawls, of the depredations of bands of lawless men, of murders and
                        thefts.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behind the lines, in Indiana as elsewhere, people witnessed the unhappy spectacle of men growing rich
                    from their ccuntry's misfortunes, too often without scrupling about the means by which they
                    amassed their wealth. When state bonds were sold to raise money for military purposes complaints

                    with their government by demanding excessive discounts.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The unsavory practices
                    of men connected with the early business of the state commissary and quartermaster departments

                    huge profits by swindling state and national governments in filling the much coveted war orders.
                    Governor Morton's complaints about guns that could be shaken to pieces and about Austrian
                    rifles that became worthless after a week's use sketched a shameful picture of the rankest
                    knavery. To have sent men to the field with such weapons, he once protested, would have been
                    "little better than murder."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Small wonder then that some
                    defined the conflict as a "contractor's war" and cried out against the
                    patriots who had "enriched themselves out of the… very miseries of the

                    month. Governor Morton described the situation succinctly in an appeal to Congress in November,

            <p>These destitute families made an unhappy contrast with the men who prospered and lived accordingly.
                    Indeed, for some the war was a period of lavish living, elaborate entertainments and material
                    abundance. The dissatisfied called it an era of "criminal extravagance… without
                    a parallel" and asserted that the (Lresources of the nation are being wasted in riotous

                    that vast economic changes were sweeping across Indiana and the nation. The ancient struggle between
                    the dogmas of Democracy and Whiggery had not abated, but the former's concepts of political
                    economy, so long predominant, were forced to yield before the onslaughts of triumphant
                    Republicanism. Ruefully the Hoosier Jacksonians watched the bulwarks of their system crumble away as
                    the hated principles of their foes emerged to rule the country.</p>
            <p>In southern Indiana the devotees of the old order—the boat builders, the merchants and
                    farmers whose prosperity had long hinged upon the river trade—complained bitterly against
                    the obstruction of their river outlet, and occasionally they defiantly engaged in contraband trade
                    with the South. They refused to abandon their abiding suspicion of railroad transpbrtation and

                    "Yankee," and noted that the Eastern and Southern markets could not be compared
                    "with the arithmetic of five years ago."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Manifestly, in the

            <p>Additional evidence of economic change appeared in the transformation of banking institutions during
                    the war period. Secession had been a severe blow to Indiana's free banks which had invested
                    heavily in Southern state bonds.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The state bank too had difficulties when the

                    local banking and the issuance of large quantities of "greenbacks" grated upon the
                    sensibilities of Jacksonian Democrats who were apprehensive about further departures from their
                    cherished economic principles. They protested against the growth of a "political money
                    power" whose financial policies were allegedly based upon "a foundation of
                    sand," and predicted the imminence of economic ruin and the collapse of government

            <p>The dismay of Indiana Democrats reached its climax early in 1863 with the establishment of a new
                    system of national banking. To them it epitomized the abandonment of Democratic economic doctrines
                    and the resurrection. of the most detested of all Whig heresies. Other Hoosiers, however, including
                    some wealthy Democrats, welcomed the new banking system. Beginning with the First National Bank of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, directed by William H. English, a network of these institutions quickly covered the
                    state. By 1862 Indiana possessed thirty-one national banks which had all but won the field from the
                    state institutions. Indeed, most branches of the state bank ultimately obtained national bank
                        charters.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Nothing more clearly exemplified the role of "war
                    necessity" as an instrument of social revolution than did these changes in the American
                    banking system.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the foes of economic change nursed a bitter resentment against the revival of the
                    protective tariff. The Morrill tariff of 1861—"a model of political
                    thieving"—received censorious treatment in countless Democratic resolutions, and Western
                    Republicans who accepted this and subsequent tariff increases were branded as apostates to their
                        section.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Thomas A. Hendricks and Daniel W. Voorhees repeatedly scourged
                    the Eastern manufacturers who exploited the West with the protective tariff and sought to make its

                    dislocations, the war still brought an unprecedented degree of prosperity to Indiana. Widening
                    markets meant high prices for the products of her farms, and agriculture flourished and expanded as
                    never before. The recruiting of armies left a shortage of man power which improved the bargaining

            <p>That Indiana was undergoing an economic transformation was thus apparent enough even to

                    perceived by the friends of the old order. Jefferson's Democracy might still idealize rural
                    virtues and envision Indiana's future in terms of prosperous farms and peaceful villages;
                    but the dreams of others were woven with ribbons of steel, colored by the smoke of factories and
                    filled with humming machines. Enterprising Hoosiers were not slow to catch the dynamic spirit of
                    industrial capitalism, nor to transform the fabric of dreams into the tough web of fact. Sturdy
                    farmers were feeling the mettle of their industrial rivals as Indiana marched with the nation toward
                    a new economic era.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>With the conflict assuming the proportions of a protracted and gigantic struggle accompanied by
                    significant modifications of American institutions, the original concept of a war based upon the
                    Crittenden resolution appeared somewhat puerile. Hence, to counter their critics, the local
                    protagonists of war and national change proceeded to formulate a greater moral justification for
                    their cause. Gradually their propaganda organizations unfolded and described before Hoosier citizens
                    a series of issues and objectives which placed the war upon a high level of moral grandeur.

            <p>President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation afforded the local war propagandists an
                    opportunity to raise one grand moral issue. Despite their early conservatism upon the slavery
                    question, by the summer of 1863 Indiana Republicans and their party press had passed from the
                    argument of "military necessity" to. a justification of the act on the principles
                    of human liberty. They discovered in the slave system the basic cause of the war and began to speak
                    in terms of an irrepressible conflict between slavery and freedom.</p>

                    Lincoln's proclamation "made the present contest… a struggle in behalf
                    of human liberty and against slavery." Moreover, it contended, "between the
                    hostile principles of Freedom and Slavery… there can of necessity be no permanent
                        peace."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>Yet, despite the contemporary justification of the conflict in terms of great moral issues, the Civil

                    experienced by a nation at war, and the effectiveness of Union propaganda transformed many people
                    into blind and intransigent fanatics. The war itself unleashed the forces which too often overcame
                    the powers of rational thought. Behind the lines men ceased to think and only hated, for the virus

            <p>Overcome by the miasma of war, Republican speakers and newspapers unfolded, after each battle, a
                    familiar and repetitious pattern of atrocity stories. They began with the first battle of Bull Run
                    where the "rebel barbarians" were alleged to have robbed the Union dead, fired
                    upon hospitals "with their freight of groaning wounded," and
                    "pierced… with their bayonets" the wounded on the field. The loyal
                    press described the execution of this diabolical work as so systematic as to leave no doubt that it
                    was done by the orders of rebel commanders whose purpose was extermination.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                    After numerous rehearsals of such accounts, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> concluded that no people in history "ever exhibited that fiendish
                    malignity, that savage cruelty, and that utter want of honor and respect for the laws and customs of
                    war, that have characterized the people of the South…."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                    Southerners "are only about semi-civilized," raged the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>,
                    "and do not therefore understand that war is not necessarily barbarous."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The effects of such outpourings upon an agitated people were shown in the numerous printed letters of
                    angry patriots who found release for their malevolence in demands for punitive measures of
                    retaliation, perhaps "a little more shooting, and not quite so much capturing."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> When, early in 1862, Confederate prisoners were brought to Camp Morton,
                    complaints were heard that the rebels were being treated too well.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Such bitter
                    feelings were deepened by Union officers who returned from Confederate prisons to lecture upon their
                    inhuman treatment during their confinement in the South."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> These were
                    the sinews which strengthened the will to fight.</p>

            <p>War psychosis was not only manifested in the Hoosiers' attitude toward the South, but also
                    in a morbid suspicion of those at home whose opinions did not coincide with their own. Men whose
                    political ends were served by inoculating the community with tales of domestic treason often
                    succumbed ultimately to the infection of their own puissant drug. Loyal citizens lived in panicky
                    fear of their own neighbors, and lumped all dissenters in the single category of traitors.
                    Intellectual tolerance was not the order of the day.</p>
            <p>With the assurance that peace could come only "through the red gates of war,"<hi rend="sup">54</hi> the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> informed its readers that unless a man gave
                    unqualified support to the war and was "openly, heartily, and intensely loyal, he is
                    suspected of secession proclivities…."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Upon that premise
                    Union party advocates repeatedly indicted the Democracy with disloyalty. The evidence advanced by
                    excited partisans was that Democrats divided northern councils and thus prevented the suppression of
                    the rebellion, that they supposedly made no contribution to the sanitary commission, that they cried
                    out for free speech only to enable them to spread their treason, that all Knights of the Golden
                    Circle were Democrats, that all rebels were Democrats—indeed, that it was a Democratic
                        rebellion.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    Democratic societies to illustrate "that the State is, as Governor Morton strikingly
                    expressed it, ‘perfectly cavernous’ with disloyal organizations."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The Republican press printed every rumor and wild report sent in by frenzied
                    patriots of conspiracies being hatched among their neighbors, of secret aid to the rebels, and of
                    the shameful persecution of Union men. The authors of these letters expressed horror at men who
                    boldly wore copperhead emblems, and who were so depraved as to "glory in being
                    butternuts." There were numerous demands that all such traitors be arrested and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Additional alarming letters poured in upon the governor from every quarter of the state. They
                    described the activities of Democrats who cursed Union men and cheered for "Jeff"
                    Davis, and reported the drills and meetings of treasonable societies in adjoining townships and
                    counties. Some professed to possess large stores of information with which they hoped to aid the
                    governor in the exposure of the Knights of the Golden Circle. It was characteristic of these
                    letters, filled as they were with rumors in the absence of facts, to reflect numerous local feuds
                    and the agitation and illiteracy of their authors rather than the treason they pretended to
                        expose."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The general war hysteria was equally well portrayed in
                    the correspondence of Republican secret societies whose members appeared to regard themselves as the

            </p>
            <p>Public leaders were at least as great alarmists as were their constituents. In the summer of 1862
                    Governor Morton wrote a panicky letter to Secretary of War Stanton which described a secret
                    treasonable society in Indiana with 10,000 members organized to "circulate and foster
                    newspapers of extremely doubtful loyalty." The <placeName>

            <p>Similarly, military officials in Indiana often succumbed to the general excitement and conducted
                    themselves as though they resided in the heart of the Confederacy. Conrad Baker, assistant provost
                    marshal general for Indiana, reported to his chief that the "disloyal element under the
                    name ‘Democracy’" was having great success in its efforts to arm and
                    drill its friends.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> General Carrington, who also received a full quota of
                    communications regarding domestic treason,<hi rend="sup">65</hi> reported to the president and
                    secretary of war, early in 1863, that the local Knights of the Golden Circle were organized
                    "to break up the army." He sent them an elaborate description of that
                    society's secrets and objectives which embodied most of the current newspaper reports. It
                    was his belief that the local Knights had a membership of 92,000, and that Vallandigharn could have
                    raised 20,000 armed traitors in the state without trouble.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this welter of rumors concerning domestic disloyalty there emerged nothing more substantial than
                    isolated instances of local disorder, and these—the Republican press
                    notwithstanding—were the fruits of the general hysteria, of lawless bands associated with
                    neither party, of refractory soldiers and personal feuds, rather than of any widespread treasonable
                        conspiracy.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Whatever significance was attached to the Dodd conspiracy of
                    1864 by Union party politicians, the fact still remained that no insurrection ever materialized and
                    that the subsequent "treason trials" failed to reveal the evidence of an overt
                        act.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Secret Democratic societies there were, but they were equally popular

                    only in terms of war psychosis and of political strategy. It was hardly the manifestation of a
                    people purified by war.</p>
            <p>In all these unfortunate incidences of a war-time society Indiana fared no better than other states.
                    The hardening of men by their close association with suffering and death, the lowering of moral
                    standards, the intensity of partisanship in a period of swift social change, and the evidences of
                    war psychosis were as grim as the war itself. If any elements of "a more perfect
                    civilization" were mixed in the "crucible of war," they were bought at a
                    staggering price.</p>

                    </placeName>, which became the permanent capital of the Hoosier state in 1825, was one of the best
                    planned cities of the American Middle Western wilderness. This was due. to the location of the
                    capital in the unsettled part of the state, to the grant of four sections of land by the federal
                    government, to the plans evolved by the men employed to lay out and survey the site, and to the
                    accomplishment of these ends in advance of the actual rise of the city. The origin and location of
                    the federal land grant and the revenues arising therefrom during the first decade of statehood made
                    possible the expenditures necessary to the achievement of this early instance of state planning. The

            <p>There were various factors which contributed to the selection of this particular spot. It was

                    at a less distance than thirty miles southward; the public land of the surrounding area had not yet
                    been opened to sale; and it was hoped that this place could subsequently be made a point on the
                    National Road. Perhaps the committee was also influenced by a belief that <geogName>White

                        <p>One of the most ludicrous acts, however, of the sojourners at Corydon, was their naming of
                            the new seat of state government. Such a name, kind readers, you would never find by
                            searching from Dan to Beersheba; nor in all the libraries, museums, and patent-offices in
                            the world. It is like nothing in heaven nor on earth. It is not a name for man, woman, or
                            child; for empire, city, mountain or morass; for bird, beast, fish, nor creeping thing; and
                            nothing mortal or immortal could have thought of it, except the wise men of the East who
                            were congregated at Corydon. It is composed of the following letters:—</p>
                        <p rend="center">I-N-D-I-A-N-A-P-O-L-I-S!</p>
                        <p>Pronounce it as you please, gentle readers—you can do it as you
                            wish—there is no danger of violating any system or rule, either in accent,
                            cadence, or emphasis—suit your own convenience, and be thankful you are enabled
                            to do it, by this rare scholastic genius of the age. For this title your future capital will
                            be greatly indebted, either to some learned <hi rend="i">Hebraist</hi>, some venerable <hi rend="i">Grecian</hi>, some sage and sentimental <hi rend="i">Brahmin</hi>, or some

            <p>The statute which named the capital also appointed Christopher Harrison, first lieutenant governor of
                    the state, and two others a committee to lay out the donation having "specially in view the

                            during that session of the General Assembly that provoked such acrimonious debate and such
                            merriment as naming the new capital. A strong effort was made to name the new town Tecumseh.
                            Some of the old Indian fighters, as Marston Clark of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                            </placeName>, urged that name. The name ‘<placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                            </placeName>’ is said to have been suggested by Jeremiah Sullivan of <placeName>

                            </placeName>, and accepted as a compromise." Neither Esarey nor Dunn make any
                            citations to supporting references. The name Tecumseh does not appear to have been voted cn
                            by either housq of the Assembly; see <hi rend="i">Journal of the House</hi>,

                            1820–1821. The writer has gone through the files of several early Indiana
                            newspapers, but has not found any paper which discussed the name Tecumseh. The Tecumseh
                            tradition, however, may have a factual basis.</item>

                    Territory, wrote Henry Dearborn, Secretary of War, that "the British have. been unremitting
                    in their exertions to preserve their influence over the Indians resident within our

                    weaken the little influence he had over them, and stated that his informants reported that the

            <p>When the Indians complained to Harrison early in 1802 about the treatment they were receiving from
                    the Americans, saying that the Americans used them for their own selfish aggrandizement, Harrison
                    could explain the complaints in no other manner than that such ideas had been suggested to the
                    Indians by Britishers. He believed the Indian jeremiads to be above the capacity of the Indians, and
                    said "they must have been put into his mouth [the Indian's] by the said
                        M'Kee,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> or by some of the British merchants." The Indians

                    the British had been the instigators of this report, and that, they had "even attempted to
                    make the Indians believe that the <placeName>

                    execution of war dances was proof enough of an offensive alliance between the Indians and the
                    British. By public resolution they unanimously resolved "That any attack from the Indians

            <p>The gathering of Indians at Greenville aroused great apprehension among the settlers of the Indiana
                    Territory. William Wells, Indian agent, informed Harrison that the Prophet kept a communication with
                    the British at Malden. Moreover, he was telling the Indians that the Great Spirit was going to
                    destroy every white man in America, and as a result the Indians were preparing for war. "It
                    is my opinion," he stated, "that the British are at the bottom of all this
                    Business and depend on it that if we have war with them that many of the Indian tribes will take an
                    active part against us…."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Harrison believed the cause of the "stir and commotion" was the attempt of the

                    " but he felt the real spirit behind the movement was British influence. The confederacy

            <p>One month later the dispatches of the governor took on a new note. He believed that the British might

                    they gave as one of the reasons for desiring a declaration of war the fact that the British were

            <p>When Westerners accused the English of plotting with the Indians and urging them to war against the
                    Americans and to resist further land sales, they thought they had a genuine grievance. By studying
                    the correspondence and papers of British officials we can gain some insight into the nature of the
                    official British Indian policy. It is well to remember, however, that official British Indian policy
                    is one thing, whereas unofficial Indian policy might bear no relation to it. The home government
                    might pursue one policy while the many British traders who circulated among the tribes, and who
                    wielded no mean influence over them, might, to protect their economic interests, be conducting
                    programs antipodal with those of the British government. The official policy shall be described
                    here; the Indian relations of British traders will be dealt with in the future.</p>

                    </placeName> pursued an extremely passive policy toward the Indians of the Northwest. They, of
                    course, continued the practice of giving them a few annual presents, for to do otherwise would have
                    meant the loss or curtailment of their trade among the various tribes. But the expenditures of the
                    department had been cut, for, "Retaining their attachment to the King's Interests
                    has not of late years been thought an object worthy of consideration…."<hi rend="sup">63</hi> If the British were actively urging the Indians to war on the Americans, such
                    persuasions must have been indeed secretive, for the Canadian archives contain no evidence of such

                    purpose of this renewed interest in them is revealed in a letter written by Sir James H. Craig, the

                    Indians in event of an Anglo-American war, for he knew "If a war takes place, they will not
                    be idle. If we do not employ them, there cannot exist a moment's doubt that they will be
                    employed against us…. " He feared that unless the Indians were brought over to
                    the British side, the chain of friendship would be broken and "All our valuable commerce
                    now carried on in the Indian country would be lost and it would be years before our traders could
                    venture to the parts necessary to resume it." He urged that much caution be used in
                    conversations with the Indians and even suggested that negotiations should wait until war became

                    to the Indians, the British Indian agents were to lose no time in sending messages to the different
                    Indian nations and putting the question of aid to them point-blank. But if the Indians were to be
                    used, "They should never be suffered to act alone if it can be avoided, but always with
                    some of our people…. " Craig had heard something of the Prophet and suggested to

            <p>The same sentiment Craig expressed to Castlereagh. He explained that the Indians were valueless as
                    friends, but dangerous as enemies. He, therefore, thought it politic to attempt to secure them to
                    the interests of Great Britain. For some time the Indian department had been under the jurisdiction
                    of the civil authorities. Craig suggested that better results could be obtained if it could be again
                    placed under military command.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Castlereagh was quick to agree with Craig upon his proposed Indian policy: "Under an

                    conciliate the Indian Tribes upon the following Principle; that if in a contest they are not
                    employed to act with us, they will be engaged to act against us…." Furthermore,
                    he let it be known that if the <placeName>

            <p>As a guarantee that the Indians would ally with them in case of a future war, the British took steps
                    to cement the alliance. Members of the Indian department felt that the task of winning over the
                    Indians after such a long period of neglect was a difficult one. Steps were taken for the conduction
                    of a pressure campaign on the Indians. Everything that would aid in such a campaign was used by the

                    of 1870 aroused considerable interest and helped to initiate the making of several supplementary
                    corresponding maps. The first four maps which accompany the present article show conspicuously the
                    source by states of Indiana's American born, non-Hoosier population in 1850, 1880, 1910,
                    and 1930. These maps apply to the population of the state as a whole, not to that of specific
                    counties.</p>
            <p>Figure 1 shows that according to the census of 1850,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Indiana contained many

                    Indiana's population. About one-fourth of the state's population was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. One-half of the state's population was born in Indiana and the remainder in
                    many other states or in foreign countries. Each of the other Eastern states contributed to
                    Indiana's 1850 population.</p>
            <p>Figure 2 shows that at the 1880 census, <placeName>

                    </placeName> stood higher among the states than in 1850, with 186,000 natives living in Indiana. But
                    Indiana's population had approximately doubled since 1850, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s contribution had declined from one-eighth to one-ninth, approximately. The

                    </placeName> in 1880 were approximately as great absolutely as in 1850, which meant that they also
                    constituted about half as large a share of the state's population. The emigration from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> declined considerably. On the other hand, natives of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were more numerous in Indiana in 1880 than were the natives of <placeName>

            <p>These maps illustrate four great principles or laws of population spread: 1) Nearby areas, unless
                    they have few people, tend to supply relatively many migrants. For example, most of the people
                    migrating into Indiana were born in an adjacent or nearby state, except that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> supplied few to Indiana until their own population became considerable. 2) Migration
                    tends to take place along parallels of latitude rather than north-south. In the earlier years, the
                    movement was predominantly westward; in recent, years, the eastward component is significant. The
                    migration of many tens of thousands of families from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> into Indiana is partly an illustration of the westward movement <list type="footnotes">

                    Indiana, into which most Kentuckians migrated, is west of the northern half of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. (An appreciable movement from the South before the Civil War into Indiana reflected,
                    in part, a special political condition, a movement from slave states into a free state.) 3) Migrants
                    make up a decreasinp percentage decade by decade of the total population. In early years, nearly
                    everyone in Indiana was born elsewhere; in recent years, such people comprise only a relatively
                    small percentage of the state's population. 4) A fourth generalization supported by these
                    maps is that a large share of the population of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is relatively mobile. Instead of spending their lives within a few miles of their
                    birthplace. as is true for most of the world's people, many natives of Indiana live in each
                    of the other states, and each of the other states have sent numerous representatives to Indiana.</p>
            <p>Thus, by way of summary: In the early decades, many non-Hoosiers migrated to Indiana. At the 1850
                    census, for example, about one-half of the state's population had been born in other states
                    or in foreign countries. Soon, however, many natives of Indiana migrated to other states. By 1880,
                    this number almost equalled the number of natives of other states living in Indiana. By 1900, about
                    650,000 Hoosiers were living in other states, and at the 1930 census, about 930,000. Although
                    corresponding data for the 1940 census are not yet available, it is quite probable that more than a
                    million Hoosiers were living in other states, or more than a third as many as were living in
                    Indiana. The number of natives of other states living in Indiana increased much more slowly. In 1850
                    there were about 390,000, in 1900 nearly 500,000, in 1940, perhaps, about 650,000. Thus while in
                    1850 only one-half of the people of Indiana were born in Indiana, eighty years later about
                    three-fourths were born in this state. and many more Hoosiers lived in other states than the natives
                    of other states who lived in Indiana (264,000 in 1910, 281,000 in 1920, and 227,000 in 1930). The
                    largest sources of migrants to Indiana have been <placeName>

                    Dreservation of a free Government, and spreading the opportinities, and advantages of education
                    through the various parts of the Country, being highly conducive to this end, it shall be the duty

                    seminaries of learning shall be sold by authority of this state, prior to the year eighteen hundred
                    and twenty; and the monies which may be raised out of the sale of any such lands, or otherwise
                    obtained for the purposes aforesaid, shall be and remain a fund for the exclusive purpose of
                    promoting the interest of Literature, and the sciences, and for the support of seminaries and public
                    schools. The General Assembly shall from, time to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to
                    encourage intellectual, Scientifical, and agricultural improvement, by allowing rewards and
                    immunities for the promotion and improvement of arts, sciences, commerce, manufactures, and natural
                    history; and to countenance and encourage the principles of humanity, honesty, industry, and
                    morality.</p>
            <p>Sect. 2. It shall be the duty of the General assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to
                    provide, by law, for a general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from township
                    schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.</p>
            <p>Sect. 3. And for the promotion of such salutary end, the money which shall be paid, as an equivalent,
                    by persons exempt from militia duty except, in times of war, shall be exclusively, and in equal
                    proportion, applied to the support of County seminaries; also all fines assessed for any breach of
                    the penal laws, shall be applied to said seminaries, in thc Counties wherein they shall be
                    assessed….</p>
            <p>Sect. 5. The General Assembly, at the time they lay off a new County, shall cause, at least, ten per
                    cent to be reserved out of the proceeds of the sale of town lots, in the seat of Justice of such
                    county, for the use of a public library for such County, and at the same session, they shall
                    incorporate a library company, under such rules and regulations as will best secure its permanence,

                    </placeName> in March, 1861, he was accompanied by a young man by the name of Ellsworth who had been
                    residing in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName> force of fire-fighters, into a company which later took the name of
                    "Zouaves." After they had marched to the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> they became celebrated for their splendid ability and fighting qualities. Ellsworth
                    became their Colonel, although at that time only about 23 or 24 years of age.</p>
            <p>One day there was observed flying from a hotel, in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the opposite side of the Potomac, a new flag, the "Stars and

                    young officer, Ellsworth, proceeded to cross the river, and, ascending bhe stairway, pulled down the
                    flag. As he came down he was shot and killed by the hotel proprietor. This murderous outrage so
                    fired the Northern mind that the boys from cities, towns, and farms flocked to the banner of the
                    North, and armies were rapidly assembled.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A little later that memorable and
                    inspiring song, "John Brown's Body Lies Molding in the Tomb," which was
                    being sung throughout the land, was frequently changed to "Colonel Ellsworth's
                    Body Lies Molding in the Tomb."</p>
            <p>During the conflict, many other songs, such as "Dixie's Land," were
                    composed and sung by almost everybody who had a voice, from the youngest to the oldest. Though of
                    Southern origin, "Dixie's Land" was sung by both the North and South, and
                    was played on fife and drum throughout the whole years of the war. Other songs were composed and
                    sung later on, such as "Marching Through <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

            <p>One song in particular was sung just after the battle of Laurel Hill and Cheat River. This fight was
                    one in which the three-month soldiers from Indiana took a prominent part. General Bob Garnett was in
                    command of part of the forces on the Confederate side.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> During the fighting he
                    got up on a log lying on the opposite side of a stream of water that separated the two armies, and
                    to show his defiance of the Northern soldiery, made a speech in which, like Goliath of old, he
                    defied the enemy. The result was the same, for he was shot. As the Northern soldiers were victorious
                    here someone composed a song, a portion of the words being as follows: "Ha, ha, ha, first
                    families of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    make a splendid runner." Another song, similarly inspired, contained these words:
                    "Bob Garnett of the Confederate States of America has got his courage sticking, and bravely
                    swore the day before, he'd give Uncle Sam a licking."</p>

                    Lincoln to the presidency, there arose in the South a belligerent, sentiment against him and the
                    incoming administration, based on the assumption that there would be interference with slavery.
                    President Lincoln, to allay this bitterness on behalf of his Southern brethren, in his Inaugural
                    Address in March, 1861, declared that he had no intention of interfering with that institution. But
                    this was not enough, for the agitation went on gaining force, being fanned by hot-headed orators,
                    until the fury went beyond all bounds, and one state after another followed the example of the state
                    of <placeName>

            <p>The most stunning shock to the whole country came on April 12, 1861, when the news was heralded from
                    one end of the country to the other that General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, who became famous
                    afterwards as a fighting rebel, had bombarded Fort Sumter and had shot down "Old
                    Glory." Sumter fell and the flag went down on the 14th day of April, after being bravely
                    defended by Major Robert Anderson and his eighty soldiers.</p>
            <p>The reaction of the people upon receipt of this distressing news was most awe-inspiring. Our father

                    quit work as if the day of doom was at hand. Men gathered in groups with troubled faces. They were
                    much distressed as they tearfully met on the streets or came together at the yard fences. Civil war
                    now became inevitable, and the sound of the fife and drum was heard all over the land, North and
                    South. The President had been counseling forbearance and bidding for a peaceful solution, but to no
                    avail. Many favored allowing the South to go, saying it would solve the slavery question. Indeed,
                    some of the public press advocated the same. But as defiance of federal power grew more intense in
                    the South, this submissive attitude of the people changed. War was declared and the North and South
                    were at arms—the conflict was on. Lincoln called for 75,000 men, which number was soon in
                    camp and on the road south. Governor Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, in short order, tendered
                    Indiana's quota to the President. The men were called for three months, as the
                    Administration thought it would be all over in that time. Some of these men who were released in
                    July, came home, but others did not.</p>
            <p>People from all parts of the country-side gathered in schoolhouses or in the open air for the purpose
                    of hearing orators and recruiting officers who called for volunteers to serve for three years, or to
                    the end of the war. At all such meetings the ever present fife and drum, playing "Yankee
                    Doodle" and (‘The Girl I Left Behind Me’ inspired the younp and old
                    alike with military spirit. At one of these gatherings held on the commons near the creek that ran
                    through our farm, I saw as many as thirty or more boys fall in line within a space of a few mintes.
                    Saloons were open in those days and many of these boys had imbibed a little too freely and were a
                    part of Uncle Sam's army while under this excitement, but they made good soldiers for they
                    were not drunkards. This was Company B, 39th Indiana Infantry. My oldest brother, John L. Earnett,
                    was one of this company whose life was offered as a sacrifice for his country.</p>
            <p>Among the men who were prominent in raising an army was a native Irishman by the name of Reeves. In
                    his fiery speeches calling for volunteers, he closed by saying, "We know the danger but
                    before I will let these foul traitors triumph, they shall pass over my dead body, and that flag
                    [pointing to the Stars and Stripes] shall be my ‘winding <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-038-1-068"/> sheet.’" He became a Captain and came through the
                    War. but some of the boys under his command now sleep at Chickamauga and on other battle-fields.</p>
            <p>The time of departure was at hand. There were present a great number of people, including all classes
                    of citizens, old men and women, young boys and girls, and those who were going to the front. The
                    train rolled in, men went aboard. Mothers, fathers, and sisters were bidding their loved ones
                    farewell with tear stained faces. Among the crowd were weeping children whose fathers had joined the
                    army, for many men of families were among those leaving little ones at home. The steam was turned
                    on, and with the signal of the whistle, the train grew less distinct, as we gazed down the tracks,
                    until it finally was out of sight. Returning to their homes, friends took up the thread of life
                        again.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The long freight trains from northern Indiana and from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> came down the old Peru railroad track bound for the South. In and on top of these
                    old-fashioned cars were hundreds of men, who, as they passed through town, stood cheering. Onward
                    they went, many never to return, and the "tumult and the shouting ceased" as the
                    train disappeared.</p>
            <p>As the war progressed, filling the ranks of volunteers became more difficult and when a township
                    failed to furnish its quota the government resorted to the draft until the required number was
                    secured. The ages included were eighteen to forty-five. No attention was given, as in the World War,
                    as to whether these men were single or were married. On the date of the drawing, the whole community
                    was wrought up until the result was known and the unlucky ones were notified of the selections. It
                    was not considered any special honor to be drafted.</p>
            <p>Men were allowed to hire substitutes, and many did so, in some instances they paid as high as one
                    thousand or twelve hundred dollars for others to go in their places. The usual price, however, ran
                    from two hundred to five or six hundred dollars. Many of these substitutes made very poor soldiers.
                    There were conscientious men, however, who refused to hire substitutes, for it would have been an
                    unpleasant remembrance <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi> The writer has in his possession a replica of one of these war

                    disease or in battle.</p>
            <p>In some counties the county commissioners offered bounties of different amounts for substitutes to
                    fill the ranks. These offers were accepted in good faith by many soldiers who served their term, but
                    the temptation enlisted many adventurers and professionals, who got their money from the county,
                    entered the army, and then deserted to go to some other county and repeat the performance. This gave
                    rise to the term "Bounty Jumpers." It was very difficult to do anything with these
                    men, for if they finally landed in the service and were making good, the government, needing their
                    services, could not afford to hunt up the matter in order to punish the crime. The practice of
                    allowing substitutes gave the man of means an advantage over the poor man, but the offering of
                    bounties worked the other way, for it taxed the man of wealth for the benefit of his poor neighbors.</p>
            <p>Some men, who had volunteered while this offer was in effect but without knowing of the offer, were
                    held to be entitled to the bounty. Probably twenty years after the close of the war, the firm of
                    which I was a member brought suit against <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> for the bounty and recovered. to the best of my recollections, —200 in each
                    case. The Supreme Court, however, finally decided that the limitation had run against such claims.</p>
            <p>There was another temptation the government allowed, which was to pay men for securing volunteers.
                    This led some unscrupulous men to report certain names to the military authorities, which greatly
                    embarrassed these persons. I have personally known of men, by reason of this deception, who left
                    their homes and slept on beds of straw in the dense forests that then existed in the neighborhoods.
                    There may not have been any real danger, but they believed that there was and kept watch for
                    officers for days at a time.</p>
            <p>Deserters from the army became numerous during, and after, the year 1862, and the fastnesses of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> County became a rendezvous for these escaped soldiers. Mrs. Bar nett, who was then a
                    small girl, told me that she saw some of these men passing her home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> township, tied in some manner to their captors or the horses on which they rode. One
                    night, immediately after the Battle of Perryville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, we heard a knock at the door of our home, and <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-038-1-070"/> on
                    opening, there stood three men in uniform who asked to stay all night. My father invited them in.
                    They said they were making their way to their homes but did not care if they could only have the
                    privilege of sleeping on the floor as they had for some time not been in the habit of using beds. Of
                    course, there was nothing to do but tell them they might stay, which they did, sleeping on the floor
                    immediately in front of a warm fire in the open fireplace.</p>
            <p>The next morning after my mother had given them their breakfast and they were ready to go, they asked
                    one of my older brothers whether he would like to exchange some of his clothing for one of their
                    army coats. He was glad to do this for the army coat was much better than the one he gave the
                    soldier. These men departed and we saw no more of them. but they left the impression with us that
                    they had only been in the army a few days before the Battle of Perryville and in that battle they
                    had been badly defeated. We surmised that they were deserters from the army. The army coal was not
                    of very much use to my brother for the reason that the government had forbidden civilians to wear
                    army clothes, and upon being apprised of this fact, my brother took his new found coat, dug a hole
                    in the straw stack, put the coat, in the hole, and stopped it up.</p>
            <p>One thing we all then realized was that war existed just across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River, and men were liable to go into battle at any time after crossing it. Although
                    the regular army of the Confederacy was farther away, guerrilla bands were everywhere in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, only awaiting opportunity to attack and destroy.</p>
            <p>Coming home from school one evening with others, we observed a new-made grave in the cemetery on my
                    father's farm. We stood around it in silence. It was the tomb of Arthur Turner, a neighbor
                    boy, who went away in high spirits. Soon afterward we saw a second, and this was the grave of
                    another boy from an adjoining farm, George Deakyne. This was the first fruit of war, and we began to
                    understand what war meant.</p>
            <p>The prcpaganda of hate soon developed in both North and South, for no war can be carried on
                    successfully without it, and all kinds of stories were put afloat to foster the war spirit. It was
                    not long until the people of the North regarded the rebels of the South as hideous beings, wholly
                    devoid of <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-038-1-071"/> any human sympathy and glorying in the misery of
                    others. We children used to say that we should like to meet a rebel to see what one looked like. We
                    thought they were a race of men entirely different from ourselves. Boys with guns would point at an
                    imaginary foe and pretend that they were killing Jeff Davis or other rebels.</p>
            <p>The Northern Methodists were bitterly opposed to human slavery. They were unlike the Friends or
                    Qualrers, who were equally opposed to slavery, but would not fight. About the time the war broke
                    out, the children of our family were going to school to a very prominent Methodist teacher, who.
                    very soon after his school closed, volunteered and went through the war.</p>
            <p>Besides the real soldiers who went to the front, there were many junior organizations of boys from
                    the ages of teri to twelve who played soldier. They elected officers, armed themselves with some
                    semblance of ornamentation, and drilled after the example of the army officers. Major John H. Tadton
                    told me he was captain of a company organized in th:. neighborhood of Greenwood. This company was
                    armed with cornstalks. I, too, played the captain of a company, some of whom had wooden swords and
                    other equipment of a similar character, while the captain possessed a cap of military imitation. My
                    brother, D. C. Barnett, who has been practicing law in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> for many years, was one of the boy soldiers.</p>
            <p>A boy about sixteen years of age of very poor family and of scant education disappeared on a frosty
                    morning in the fall of 1861. Just at daylight as I came out of our home this boy came through a
                    dense wood along the creek bottom, all alone, wearing an army cap and a blue army overcoat, with a
                    gun over his shoulder. He came up the creek and passe? over the bridge going toward the railroad,
                    where I suppose he boarded a train for the South.</p>
            <p>A soldier had left his family living in an abandoned schoolhouse in our little town of Cicero. The
                    boys heard he was home and hastened to see the first returned soldier. The door of his little humble
                    home was open, and there he sat at dinner with his family, uniform of blue still on, while many
                    neighbors gathered around the building. He was an object of adoration for all the town, and a hero
                    in the eyes of every boy.</p>
            <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-038-1-072"/>
            <p>Large drafts upon the charity of the county were necessary. Families of small, helpless children were
                    left when their fathers enlisted, but the home folk were very kind in seeing that they did not
                    suffer. There were also several refugee families that came north from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    large families and without any means of support. They were, however, upright and law-abiding
                    citizens, many of whose descendants became permanent residents of the state. They had left the South
                    to escape persecution because of their sympathy with the North. So far as is known, all these people
                    and their descendants have voted the Republican ticket, which fact is not surprising when we
                    remember that the slave-owning population of the South belonged to the other party.</p>
            <p>In July, 1863, the guerrilla, John Morgan, with his band of followers crossed over the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River into Indiana, coming as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, frightening the people, forcing the women to cook their meals, exchanging their worn
                    out horses for good ones, and creating consternation generally throughout the whole southern part of
                    the state. The report was current for a day or so that this band of "free-booters"
                    had come as far north as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but they soon left the state, crossing over into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> where Morgan was captured and imprisoned at <placeName>

            <p>In January, 1863, my father, Ambrose D. Barnett, passed through the lines to secure a furlough for my
                    brother, John L. Barnett, who was badly sick in a hospital at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The rules of the War Department were so strict at that time that it was almost
                    impossible to secure a release of a sick soldier, until they found that he could not recover, and so
                    my father came home alone. In a few days, brother arrived one morning, and died the next. At that
                    time, my father told us that throughout the whole state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, through which he. passed, it was no uncommon thing to see chimneys standing where
                    guerrillas had burned the homes of Union sympathizers.</p>
            <p>One does not have to draw strongly upon his imagination to realize the distress the destruction of
                    human life brought to the citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>. It was a land of mourning, for in almost every neighborhood there were mothers who,
                    like "Rachel of old were weeping for their children <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-038-1-073"/> and
                    would not be comforted because they were not." When the news of the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> flashed over the wires, the word came that 18,000 men had been killed in this one
                    engagement. As a great number of the boys from our immediate neighborhood was known to be engaged in
                    the battle, the shock to the community was one never to be forgotten. The high tension of feeling,
                    the suppressed excitement and the awful suspense were oppressive, and it was days before the parents
                    and relatives of the boys in the fight knew the fate of these boys so engaged.</p>
            <p>Many rumors were afloat concerning seditious schemes for the furtherance of the cause of secession,
                    some unfounded, but others seemingly with proof of their existence. One of these was to the effect
                    that certain sympathizers with the South had formed a conspiracy to seize the arsenals at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, capture or kill the Governor and other state officers, liberate the ten thousand rebel
                    prisoners then being held at Camp Morton at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and capture the city. thereby turning Indiana over to the South. Governor Morton, who
                    made a name as a terror to all whq opposed the war, is said to have suppressed the threatened
                    scheme.</p>
            <p>Indiana was chosen as a fertile field in which the Confederates could launch their schemes, for it is
                    just across the river from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and most of the residents were of the South. Half of the state had been reared there
                    and had relatives there, and it. was taken for granted a more friendly feeling for the cause of the
                    South would be met in this state. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was populated more from the Eastern states.</p>
            <p>Growing out of the hatred engendered by the War and for some years after its close, certain persons,
                    friends and foes of each section, still were intent on keeping alive war's animosities.
                    Among such was one Brick Pomeroy, who published a paper at LaCross, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, which held a very vicious attitude toward President Lincoln. When it was reported that
                    the body of J. Wilkes Booth, the assassin of the president had been taken out to sea and consigned
                    to the waves, he wrote the following lines depicting the virtues of Booth, according to my memory:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">Yes, give him a sepulchre wide as the sweep,</p>
                        <p rend="center">Of the tidal waves measureless motion</p>
                        <p rend="center">Yes, put him to sleep in the arms of the deep</p>
                        <p rend="center">For his heart was as grand as the ocean—</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-038-1-074"/>
            <p>And here is another from the pen of a writer whose sentiments differed from those of
                    Pomeroy's: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">Oh, may that cursed Jeff Davis float</p>

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>We have noticed of late many excuses being made by some prominent parties for the men of the South
                    who took up arms against the Union, ranging from General Beauregard, who, unprovoked, fired upon
                    Fort Sumter, to General Robert E. Lee. Some of these excuses are based on the fact that these men
                    belonged to the South, that they were born and reared in the South, and that it was the natural
                    thing to do. This excuse might have more weight if the North had been the assaulting party and if
                    the South had acted only in selfdefense, but let us ask who fired the first shot, and the answer
                    is—General Beauregard, when he shot down the country's flag at Sumter. Who
                    ravished the arsenals of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and had the first army in the field? The answer is the South.</p>
            <p>This being the starting point, did it justify Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Generals Johnston,
                    Beauregard, and Stonewall Jackson, in stultifying themselves, after enjoying the protection and
                    benefit arising to them as citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, by taking up arms against it? It is said they were honest, but mistaken. Did any of
                    them ever say they were wrong? That they were able and had many virtues does not excuse them for
                    their effort to destroy the country that had given them birth and protected them in their rights as
                    citizens. Was Jefferson Davis justified in encouraging the destruction of the Union, after being
                    educated at the expense of this government and after taking the oath to support and defend the flag?
                    Can we justify General Lee, who, after acquiring a military education at West Point, slaughtered
                    thousands of Northern boys who were defending Old Glory, and who led his hosts on to conflict,
                    shooting down that same emblem of our country at every opportunity?</p>
            <p>During the period of the war, certain articles, which the people of the North were accustomed to
                    have, became <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-038-1-075"/> very scarce, and when they could be obtained were
                    very expensive. While the South had tobacco, sugar, and cotton, the North had wheat, corn, and a
                    larger supply of livestock. Cotton goods became very dear in the North and because of our inability
                    to get coffee, many families resorted to baked potatoes, or parched wheat for coffee, and instead of
                    cotton goods we raised flax for material for summer wear. Instead of sugar we made maple molasses
                    and maple sugar, and about this time sorghum was introduced from <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. I believe my father paid —1.25 for one pound of this seed.</p>
            <p>The North had sheep, and almost all clothing worn by men, women, and children was manufactured from
                    wool. The men sheared the sheep, the women picked out the burs, spanish needles, and other trash,
                    washed the wool, spun the yarn, wove the flannels, and cut out and made the garments for both sexes.
                    Some of the boys of this present day would not fancy wearing a home-made, coarse flannel shirt,
                    jeans-pants and coats for every day and also Sunday wear; and the girls would not feel at home in a
                    heavy, plain flannel dress, no frills or ornamentations, heavy cowhide shoes made by the
                    neighborhood shoemaker and kept soft by tallow grease. But the above is what the people of that day
                    had, and they were happy.</p>
            <p>In the years during the conflict, the people were content with the simple life. In addition to the
                    home-made food and clothing, the means of travel were generally walking, riding horseback, or riding
                    in two horse wagons, for very few had buggies or carriages. If the distance was only onc or two
                    miles, one would most frequently walk. On Sundays the young people generally rode. It was not
                    uncommon to see several couples in procession on the way to church, and afterwards in groups at the
                    home of some neighbor. The girls used side saddles and wore long riding skirts which reached below
                    their feet. The girls were not afraid of horses, but pulled up the reins with the same assurance as
                    their companions. It was a beautiful sight to see these cavalcades sweeping down the highway. The
                    older people went in the two horse wagons. On Saturday evening it was a common practice for the
                    whole family to gear up the horses and away to the home of some friend or relative to stay over
                    night without giving any previous notice.</p>
            <p>I do not remember any bank failures during the four and <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-038-1-076"/> one-half
                    years of the war. In fact, there were not many banks until the National banks were authorized near
                    the close of hostilities. Men kept their money at home. If necessary, money could generally be
                    borrowed from some farmer in the neighborhood, for there was usually some one in the community who
                    kept money to loan.</p>
            <p>I remember my father keeping in our home, during the late years of the war, about three thousand
                    dollars. IIc. did not lose one cent, although he had this money for many months. All the community
                    seems to have known it, and yet no robber broke into the home. There were no bars on the windows or
                    locks on the doors. One dark night, after my father received this money from the sale of some land,
                    would-be burglars came with a dark lantern that was visible in our yard. Intent on robbery, they
                    were scared off by the snapping of a small five-shooter that refused to go off. This frightened all
                    the children, who dreaded to see the next night come. But the burglars did not return. There was one
                    robbery about 1864, as I remember. Joseph Combs, an elderly gentleman who lived west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Union township. was beaten and robbed of a considerable sum of money.</p>
            <p>The private soldier of the Union army had a pretty blue uniform, made of wool, a blue cap with a
                    black bill, and broad, rather heavy leather shoes. He was also given a canteen to carry water, and a
                    knapsack for his blankets.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> But the Southern soldier wore what was called
                    "butternut," which was a dingy, unattractive uniform. So when a Republican wanted
                    to tantalize a Democrat he would do so by calling him a "butternut" and this
                    aggravated the latter so that in turn he would call the Republican an
                    "abolitionist" or "black Republican." Now and then some Democrat
                    boys or perhaps girls, in defiance, would wear a real butternut on the lapel of their coat or other
                    garment. Amidst all these provocations a most bitter feeling and party hatred arose, culminating at
                    times in free fisticuffs.</p>
            <p>In the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> [now known as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>], there were two ardent Republican boys about the ages of fifteen or sixteen who took
                    great delight in annoying Democrats <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi> The army uniform was in evidence long after the close of the war,
                            the blue overcoat being used extensively by returned soldiers or other persons who had
                            secured them in some way from individual soldiers or dealers in such articles. The army
                            shawl also survived many years after the close of the rebellion.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-038-1-077"/> of the village or persons of that political faith who passed
                    through. One of these was William McNaughton, a son of a Methodist preacher. He later operated a dry
                    goods store in this city. The other was Tee Belk. I can now see these two young fellows on the
                    sidewalks of the little town, Billie McNaughton with his army shawl over his shoulders, disputing
                    and exchanging epithets with members of the opposite party, and Tee Belk ready for a fight.</p>
            <p>The political rallies of those days were something fierce. It was generally understood that at all
                    these gatherings there would be present a gang of bullies from the other party, that free fights
                    would be in order, and that there would be no interference by the police officers an such occasions.
                    On the day of such gatherings, drunken men on the streets of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> would stand on the corners and sidewalks and engage in loud vindicative and profane
                    harangues, and abuse the other party and its officers. This was carried on for hours at a time, with
                    no interference. Saloons were open and liquor flowed freely. In these days if a man expected an
                    office he had to be a "wet," for if a temperance man bobbed up, he was sure of
                    defeat, and one who would not pay for the drinks was declared unfit for office.</p>
            <p>Like the "Silver and Gold Democrats" in the time of William J. Bryan, the
                    Democratic Party of the North was divided as early as 1862 or 1863 into what was called the
                    "Regulars" and the "War Democrats." The former contended that
                    President Lincoln was carrying on the war and making sacrifices of white men in order to free the
                    colored men. This may not have been all the story, for, when the presidential election of 1864 came
                    on, "Old Man Politics" reared his ugly head, and, as he always does, blinded the
                    better judgment of men and made them his servants. As General George B. McClellan was the Democratic
                    candidate for president against Lincoln, there may have been much resentment at least on his part,
                    and the part of his friends because he was removed from his high command by President Lincoln after
                    the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was necessary, also, to make some kind of an issue before a fight. History has
                    recorded the story of this grievous mistake of both the leader and his followers, which kept the
                    losing party out of power for twenty years. Many of those who opposed further bloodshed were honest
                    patriotic persons, many had sons in the army, and <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-038-1-078"/> many had lost
                    members of their families, but time has demonstrated that they were wrong.</p>
            <p>A great majority of the soldiers who returned from the war voted with the Republican Party, because
                    they were opposed to slavery and because the Regular Democrats opposed the continuation of the war.
                    The army seemed to be favorable to Lincoln and the soldier vote contributed largely to his
                    re-election. The charge was made that this vote was unduly cast in some manner, but the fact remains
                    that the soldiers who came home voted the Republican ticket.</p>
            <p>There were numerous charges of irregularities in elections committed by Republicans during these
                    tempestuous days. It was charged that in one election in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> township the Republican majority was in excess of the total votes of the township. The
                    count of the ballots was not made until the day after election, the box having been kept by a member
                    of the party in a bank in this city over-night. It is said that the individual in later years only
                    smiled when the matter was suggested to him.</p>
            <p>After the death of President Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, a resident of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, who had been elected vice-president, succeeded to the presidency. Many doubts were
                    entertained as to what kind of an executive he would make, as it was feared by many that he might be
                    in sympathy with the South. Especially was this true of the Republican Party which had elected him.</p>
            <p>It was not long after his incumbency into office that a difference arose between Congress and the new
                    president, which grew more apparent and widespread until it developed into a violent antagonism.
                    This antagonism, instead of abating, increased until impeachment proceedings were instituted to
                    depose him from his high position. The charges preferred were high crime and misdemeanors and it was
                    claimed he had been guilty of such, more specific matters being set forth as required by law.</p>
            <p>After the trial, which lasted considerable time, during which there was great excitement throughout
                    the country, the Democratic press and politicians were generally favorable to the
                    President's acquittal, although having opposed his election. On the contrary, the press and
                    politicians of the Republican party were generally desirous of his conviction, <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-038-1-079"/> When the vote came he was acquitted. The ballots showed one vote short
                    of the two-thirds necessary to convict.</p>
            <p>In those strenuous days the boys were not slow in taking an active interest in politics and as our
                    family was Democratic, we were also very anxious to see the prosecution fail. The vote was taken, as
                    my memory serves me, on May 16, 1868, in the afternoon, and being so interested in the result, the
                    writer and two brothers were looking for an omen and were considerably discouraged during the whole
                    morning and until noon on account of the clouds shutting out the sunshine. About two
                    o'clock in the afternoon, the sun suddenly peeped from behind the mists and we took it for
                    a sign that the President would triumph, which he did. But his administration had been so badly
                    crippled by his conduct and the trial that he quit without accomplishing any great good.</p>
            <p>In order to vindicate his policy he made a speaking tour through the country which was called his
                    "swing around the circle." In doing so he passed through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he made a short address from the car platform. The Reverend Willett Tyler, a
                    strong Democrat, a preacher of the Old School Baptist Church, and a former recorder of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>, stood upon a pile of rails near the railroad track and addressed the President in the
                    following language: "Andrew Johnson, President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, stand by the Constitution and the laws, and the Democracy of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> will stand by you." The President felt vindicated by the assurance that the
                    members of the party, that had tried to defeat him, were for him in at least one county.</p>
            <p>It was almost pathetic to witness the craze the young people manifested about this time for
                    education. A person who had a diploma from college was then looked upon as it wonder. At that time,
                    I had never seen a college graduate that I knew to be one, except our teacher, Reverend John C.
                    Miller, and A. V. Pendleton, both of whom were living in our neighborhood. I learned afterward that
                    Judge D. D. Banta and Doctor W. T. Stott were college graduates. There may have been others, but
                    these were the only ones known to me.</p>
            <p>The first high school in Indiana, it is said, was instituted, owned, and conducted by the Reverend
                    John C. Miller, in what was formerly the old Christian Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It first opened its door, as I remember, in the autumn of 1867, <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-038-1-080"/> a little more than two years after the war closed. Miller was a
                    graduate of the state university of Indiana. He was an experienced and wonderful teacher, as well as
                    a great preacher. This school at once sprang into prominence and young men and young women flocked
                    to its doors from different parts of Indiana. A few came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. The curriculum consisted of all the common branches, Latin, Greek, higher mathematics,
                    grammar, and bookkeeping.</p>
            <p>Sometimes every evening, but always once a week in the schools of that day, all the classes dropped
                    their books and sang "The State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, Augusta on the Kennebec River," and the rest of the states and all of the
                    other countries. In this way, even the least of the scholars learned all these capitals and the
                    rivers on which they were located, within a few weeks without any study. After the war closed, some
                    "higher-ups" laughed geography-singing out of the schools. It has been asserted
                    today that only a few of the high school and college graduates can tell the capitals of onefourth of
                    the states and the foreign countries. As to lessons on good breeding and good wholesome literature,
                    "Old McGuffy" will never be excelled.</p>

            <p>A portrait of John Gibson (May 23, 1740—April 10, 1822) has long been a desideratum.
                    Gibson was the first, last, and only Secretary of Indiana Territory, 1800–1816. He
                    arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> months before the Governor, William Henry Harrison, and from July 4, 1800 to January,
                    1801, he was acting governor; it was he who put in operation the government of the newly created
                    territory. He was also acting governor from the time Harrison left the Territory for his military
                    command in June, 1812, until the arrival of Thomas Posey in April, 1813 (See p. 819,
                    "Roster of Territorial Officers," etc., printed as Appendix III in <hi rend="i">Laws of Indiana Territory 1809–1816</hi>, edited by Louis B. Ewbank and Dorothy
                    Riker, published by the Indiana Historical Bureau, 1934).</p>
            <p>Aside from his position in Indiana, General John Gibson's career was both significant and
                    picturesque. After an education better than that of most boys of his time, he took part in the
                    expedition of General Forbes which captured Fort Duquesne and changed the fort and settlement into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Staying there as a trader, he was captured by the Indians and saved from death by
                    being adopted. His Indian wife was a sister of Chief Logan, whose famous speech in 1774 he
                    preserved. Gibson participated in Lord Dunmore's War and raised a regiment which he led
                    during part of the war of the American Revolution in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s army. After the war he engaged in Indian trading at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was a member of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Constitutional Convention, for several years was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas
                    of Allegheny County, and was a general in the state militia. The last years of his life were spent
                    at Braddock's Field, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the home of his daughter, Mrs. George Wallace.</p>
            <p>An old oil portrait, described on the reverse of the picture as a portrait of General John Gibson and
                    presented to his daughter, Mrs. George Wallace, was brought to light last spring in correspondence
                    with Mrs. M. Carey, 1079 Third Avenue, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City. Tradition was said to have ascribed the portrait to Charles Willson Peale, but no
                    evidence of <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-038-1-082"/> this has been found. The portrait was bought by Eli
                    Lilly, president of the Indiana Historical Society and by him has recently been placed in the
                    William Henry Harrison house at <placeName>

            <p>A study of the portraits of the governors of Indiana, with some account of the men who painted them,
                    is listed for publication by the society this year. Wilbur D. Peat, director of the John Herron Art
                    Museum, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is the author. Mr. Peat has been engaged for several years in photographing early
                    portraits of Indiana citizens throughout the state and in learning everything that is to be found
                    about the portraits and their painters. He has made a special study of the portraits of the
                    governors in the State Capitol. The publication is to contain reproductions of the portraits; it is
                    a contribution to the history of art as well as to Indiana biography.</p>
            <p>Since the printing in the December number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> (pp.
                    382–83) of the suggesticjn that steps be taken in all the counties of the state toward
                    the ultimate production of adequate and dependable histories of the counties, it is reported that a
                    history of one county by a high school history teacher, in progress for several years, is nearing
                    completion. Inquiries from four counties indicate interest in the project. There seems to be ground
                    for hope that other counties, either through their historical societies, or through individual
                    enterprise, will soon begin the collection of data and the production of chapters for future county
                    histories. There are few, if any, counties of the state in which there are not resident some college
                    graduates who have had training in the study and writing of history in their college courses. In
                    most counties there are selfeducated persons who are deeply interested in the history of their
                    communities and who have made more or less study of some phase of their history. It might be
                    possible in this generation, by concerted movement, to produce a complete series of county histories
                    which would, at least, give a great impetus to scholarly study and teaching of local history.</p>
            <p>Thus far, our historical output, while fairly extensive, has been fragmentary and of an exceedingly
                    variable quality. No one could claim that it has given us a clear understanding of our past or of
                    the development of our institutions and our people. Is it not time to undertake a more ambitious
                    effort <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-038-1-083"/> to develop historical studies in a more scientific and
                    systematic way? It must be admitted that there are not, at present, many channels for the
                    publication of all worth-while writings upon local history, but such an effort might well open
                    channels, not only for the production of a better quality of historical writings but for the
                    publication of products which deserve being put into printed form and wider circulation.</p>
            <p>At this time of year the Indiana Historical Society appeals to college teachers of history to enlist
                    the interest of those who are majoring in this subject in the continuation of their historical
                    reading and study in association with the members of historical societies. Before long they will
                    receive an information-application folder from the Indiana Historical Society for nomination for
                    membership in the society of those seniors who might reasonably be expected to appreciate the work
                    in the society. This year many of the men who graduate will be taken into the armed forces of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and can hardly be expected to establish themselves in a community. It is all the more
                    desirable. however, that a continuation of their intellectual pursuits should be held before them,
                    as well as before others who go at once into civilian life.</p>

                    special terms for purchase of a large piece of Congressional land in a milder region in the West.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Because the final vote on their petition was a tie, it was up to the speaker
                    to give the decision. He was opposed to the measure, so the Rappites remained in <placeName>

                    depending on the good will of politicians.</p>
            <p>In the first months of the year 1814 George Rapp and several companions went exploring for a new site
                    on which to build another city. They found what they wanted on the banks of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> community, the new difficulties and hardships which they experienced in turning the
                    wilderness into a wellplanned town, made them feel sad even in their beautiful surroundingi. Quite a
                    few of the advance group suffered severely from fever, and a number of these died. The fact that
                    their Father Rapp had to return to <placeName>

            <p>When Lincoln evaded Senator Wade's demand for the removal of Grant with a story,
                    "Bluff Ben" could not contain himself. "It is with you, sir, all story,
                    story! You are the father of every military blunder that has been made during the war. This
                    government is on the road to hell, sir, by reason of your obstinacy…. " (N. W.
                    Stephenson, comp., <hi rend="i">An Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln</hi>, p. 416). It was
                    Lincoln's obstinate moderation, of course, that saved the Border States and the Union, but
                    at the cost of alienating radicals in his own party who were grimly resolved to make a revolution of
                    the Civil War and to destroy slavery and the Old South. Their divergent policies gave rise to a
                    bitter conflict between President and Congress which foreshadowed reconstruction. Rhodes, Randall
                    and other students have investigated this crucial contest for power. But Professor Harry Williams of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University has written the most extensive and interesting account of the radicals
                    during the war; for their main political agency, the Committee on the Conduct of the War, it is
                    probably definitive.</p>
            <p>Under the leadership of Wade and Chandler this congressional committee became "the spearhead
                    of the radical drive against the administration [p. 641]." In secret hearings, often
                    without a quorum, they sat as political commissars of the Northern armies. Ignorant of military
                    strategy but animated by their principles of attack, confiscation and emancipation, they promoted
                    and degraded generals, and hounded McClellan with "almost paranoiac" zeal (p.
                    185). Lincoln's search for commanders like Grant and Sherman who could win the war,
                    whatever their party or their views of the Negro, was constantly hampered by the radicals; they were
                    much more concerned with how the war was waged and for what partisan ends. Their
                    favorites—McDowell. Frémont, Pope, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Burnside—were incompetent in the field but correct in politics. Mr.
                    Williams demonstrates at great length that "the entire conduct of the war was shot through
                    with politics [p. 87]." Southern historians who have attributed the collapse of the
                    Confederacy to internal <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-038-1-089"/> quarrels might profitably reconsider how
                    divided and inefficient the North was, but without losing the war.</p>
            <p>Professor Williams adds nothing new to what Rhodes and Channing have told us of radical intrigues to
                    purge the Cabinet of Seward, Smith, Bates and Blair, to defeat Lincoln's renomination, to
                    force his hand in emanicipation, and to deprive him of the initiative in reconstruction. But these
                    negotiations loom larger in this book as part of the movement to replace presidential with
                    parliamentary government. Since the radicals could not capture their own party an.! remained a
                    minority in Congress until 1866, they were driven to measures which had the twofold purpose of
                    destroying presidential independence and forestalling a resurgence of Southern opposition. It is
                    evident from Mr. Williams' study that the roots of reconstruction were dug deep in the war
                    years, and it is a misnomer to think of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Early in 1862 Thaddeus
                    Stevens declared that Congress, not the President, should be dictator, and the radicals imagined
                    themselves dictators of Congress.</p>
            <p>If this excellent study is to be criticized at all, it is for not showing us how the radicals gained
                    power with the public or how they used it in Congress. Although Mr. Williams calls Wade and Chandler
                    the "Jacobin bosses" and frequently writes of their "radical
                    machine," not once does he examine the operation of this machine on the floor of Congress,
                    in caucus, and at the polls. He recognizes as fully as Beard or Beale that the economic and social
                    policies of the radicals made them Jacobins (pp. 7–9), but he confines his study to their
                    dealings with Lincoln, Stanton and the generals; their connection with tariff, taxation, railway,
                    land and currency legislation he fails to explore. This might well be the subject of a companion
                    volume. The only minor criticism worth making is that the author over-simplifies the radical
                    position on Negro suffrage; not until after the War did even Thaddeus Stevens come to accept it (p.
                    319; cf. <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe</hi>, p. 536, January 31, 1866). Finally it should be
                    observed that historians continue to treat the radicals without sympathy, and Mr. Williams is no
                    exception. However short-sighted their goals, however unscrupulous their tactics, the radicals
                    deserve to be studied in a larger persrective. Then we may hope to understand why they possessed the
                    dynamic power to make the War a struggle for their ideas of liberty.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> are the principal points visited, somewhat after the manner of John Bach McMaster in
                    his <hi rend="i">History of the People of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>. The point of the chapter is the development of urban life in an agricultural
                    state which was passing from the frontier stage. This is followed by a survey of the various
                    elements of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s population beginning with the Indians, the last of whom were removed from
                    the state during this period. The presence of a few thousand Negroes kept the state from being a
                    white man's country and also preserved considerable hostilty to the black race. The
                    migration of settlers from the older sections of the nation is also described in detail. The
                    agricultural activities and the beginning of industrial developments are pictured. The contents of
                    the fourth chapter are indicated by the title, "Modes of Transportation—Old and
                    New." Because the subject involves the change from rivers, roads, and canals to railroads
                    the chapter is more of a historical treatment than the previous chapters.</p>
            <p>Nearly one hundred pages are devoted to the social history of the period, in which
                    "Recreation and Sociability," "Religion and Education," and
                    "Literature, Science, and the Arts" are treated. The political developments of the
                    years oi the Jacksonian movement and the rise of the Whig Party require a longer description in
                    which the Panic of 1837 is subordinated to the political story. The anti-slavery movement forms
                    something of an interlude before the political narrative is resumed in connection with the
                    presidential campaign of 1840. The volume closes with a discussion of banking and sectional problems
                    as they affected the politics of the state.</p>
            <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-038-1-091"/>
            <p>It is obvious from this brief review of the contents of the volume that the author considers the
                    economic, political, and social aspects of his subject. Although this is to his credit, it is
                    permissible to raise a question that is not confined to this particular volume. How much historical
                    development or change is necessary to entitle a descriptive treatment to be called history?
                    Conversely, does the lack of change within the period assigned to an author cause a narrative to
                    become something else than history? Let it be said at the beginning that the historical character of
                    this volume as a whole is not questioned, although portions of the work justify raising the
                    question. The problem seems to be inherent in the social approach to history, particularly when the
                    period to be treated is a short one. It also seems to be increased as a result of the small amount
                    of interpretation which the author offers his reader. Too often the narrative is merely a citation
                    of so much of this and so much of that, so many hogs or cattle, so many foreign born or so many
                    natives of Southern states or of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Certain chapters like the one on transportation and those on political developments
                    are exceptions. Others like the surveys of the cities, the population elements, agriculture,
                    industrial beginnings, and parts of the treatment of social events raise the question whether a
                    longer period of time ought not to have been assigned to the author. Perhaps there was more change
                    than readily meets the eye, which a more interpretative account might have pointed out.</p>
            <p>A few minor points may be mentioned such as the lack of related details on the maps, especially those
                    illustrating the transportation network (p. 99, and 116). The rivers of the state should have been
                    added. Since Middleton is involved in the discussion (p. 98) it might have been indicated also. More
                    attention should have been paid to the process of clearing the land and to the making of potash.
                    Sheepraising and ship-building seem to have been passed over too quickly.</p>
            <p>In fairness to the author and to those who share with him the honor of producing this work, it must
                    be said that it is a highly creditable volume. It is a thorough study of the period by an
                    experienced investigator and writer. It is scholarly and unbiased.</p>

                    </placeName> upon the development of the Methodist Episcopal Church was attempted by the author of
                    this volume. To a considerable extent the study was localized in southeastern Indiana, but the
                    generalized treatment and the extensive references to, and description of the English backgrcund
                    often crowded the Indiana locale out of the picture. The author combined the methods of the
                    historian, the sociologist, the psychologist, and the student of comparative religions. The study is
                    not, however, a history of Methodism on the frontier or in southeastern Indiana.</p>
            <p>The problem of the study is described in the opening chapter as the determination of the manner in
                    which the "divergences of environment modified the subsequent development of Methodism in
                    America," the divergences being those found on the frontier in southeastern Indiana. A
                    description of this area is given in the second chapter. It is built around the life and experiences
                    of the Reverend Allen Wiley, who was a Methodist circuit rider. In the third chapter the creed and
                    organization which enabled this church to become the most numerous in this area are declared to have
                    been imported from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> with only slight modification. Their significance is revealed by contrasting them with
                    corresponding features of other churches. The secular developments in southeastern Indiana are more
                    extensively described in the fourth chapter, entitled "Methodism Comes of Age,"
                    than are the religious changes. The career of Robert R. Roberts, "the Frontier
                    Bishop," is utilized to indicate the more democratic character of the episcopal office on
                    the frontier in contrast to its position in an older society (chapter five). "The Structure
                    of Methodism," chapter six, pictures the differences in Methodist organization in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as contrasted with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. One very important difference was the development of a strong central authority in the
                    episcopal office in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, which the author believes was largely due to the needs of the frontier. The price for
                    this development in a democratic country was continued controversy and schism of discontented
                    elements (chapter seven). Doctrinal and social differences in the <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-038-1-093"/> districts that were outgrowing the frontier stage continued to flourish and to draw off the more
                    discontented, but thc desire for efficiency maintained the system unchanged and prevented any very
                    serious divisions. Methodism adapted itself to the passing of the frontier and the development of a
                    middle class urban society (chapter eight). The disappearance in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> of the highly emotional evangelism with its attendant bodily effects and its
                    development in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into the chief recruiting method of the Methodist Church is attributed in the last two
                    chapters to the frontier., where an isolated rural people whose emot;onalism was not, restricted by
                    a highly respected church with a developed liturgy and ceremonialism or by the necessity of
                    reporting for work six or seven days a week.</p>
            <p>The work has certain deficiencies which are minor in character and which do not particularly lessen
                    its value, although it is unfortunate that they were not eliminated before publication. The language
                    used in describing geographical features of southeastern Indiana and neighboring parts of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> are confusing to the reader. "Up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>" is used (p. 10) where "down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>" would be more correct. "While the Great Miami flows toward the east
                    into what is now the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the Whitewater takes n course almost due north…. " is certainly an
                    erroneous statement (p. 10). The former flows south and west but not east, while the latter flows
                    south and not north. The confluence of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with the Whitewater and Great Miami rivers is referred to (p. 32), but certainly the
                    author knows that the Whitewater flows into the Great Miami and not the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The description of a circuit (p. 47) is confusing for, after stating that it followed
                    the Whitewater. River, the author has the preacher in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in between appointments along the Whitewater. Obviously he would not have doubled and
                    redoubled his steps in this roundabout manner. "By 1818," according to the author, "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> [Indiana] boasted two local papers, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Republican</hi> and the
                        <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>…. [p. 71]." The <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>
                    was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> not <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the <hi rend="i">Western Eagle</hi> was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a time and when it moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> its place was taken by the <hi rend="i">Indiana Republican</hi>. Consequently <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> would hardly have boasted of these two papers. In describing pioneer conditions (p. 29)
                    it is <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-038-1-094"/> stated that "It was not until 1809 that Governor
                    Harrison… succeeded in freeing from Indian claims most of thc territory south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>," but a glance at Esarey's <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi>, I,
                    272, which work is cited in that very paragraph, would have revealed the inaccuracy of that
                    statement. Other errors in respect to land follow, as (p. 59) the statement that Congress in 1822
                    cut the price from —2.00 to —1.25 an acre. The act was passed in 1820. Such
                    statements as the following do not increase the reader's confidence in the
                    author's freedom from extremes: "The slavery issue between North and South was but
                    an index of the divergent economic interests between the two areas [p. 140]"; and "Hence
                    the political ideals of Jefferson… in the last analysis involved a species of political
                    anarchy… [p. 151]."</p>
            <p>The above points are connected with the background in which the religious developments were cast, but
                    it is also possible to find some deficiencies in the major field. Peter Cartwright is a favorite
                    illustration with this author as with many others, but it is doubtful that Cartwright, "by
                    moving with the frontier, was able to some extent to recapture the spirit of former days."
                    It seems quite likely that he witnessed in his later days the same transformation in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> that Wiley, with whom he was contrasted, witnessed in southeastern Indiana. The
                    statement was qualified but even so the comparison is hardly accurate. Jesse Walker of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> would have served the purpose much better. It is doubtful that Cartwright's
                        <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi> should be referred to (p. 172) as a "lusty damnatory
                    one." In like manner one might question the inference that he was "a dash of
                    genius allied to a touch of madness [p. 14]…. " Generally, however, the author
                    shows good understanding of Cartwright and treats him fairly. A more serious error is that the vast
                    amount of background material is less well understood and often seems to crowd the major story from
                    the reader's attention. Even though there may be some modern overemphasis on the unworthy
                    aspects of the campmeeting the work is a keen analysis of religious developments.</p>
            <p>This volume will be of interest to students of religion, of Indiana history, and of the frontier
                    period of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It will also have a bearing on the controversy ovei. the "Turner
                    thesis," for it represents a study of actual developments rather than the too familiar
                    arguments of various <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-038-1-095"/> historians which are based upon what they
                    think rather than upon a study of developments.</p>

            <p>This attractive paper-bound pamphlet from the pen of the Director of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Memorial Commission will appeal to everyone interested in the Rappite period of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. Others who may read it will become interested in the unique annals of the
                    Rappite community on the banks of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The story is more than a description of the Labyrinth as it includes a brief study of
                    its creators, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Society. In addition, interesting material is presented dealing with five other
                    historic labyrinths, with a general statement relative to various church labyrinths and the Etruscan
                    labyrinths. There are also sections dealing with the labyrinth in literature, art, games and
                    pageantry.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Labyrinth, which was permitted to pass out of existence in the years following the
                    return of the Rappites to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, has been recently restored. The design of the restoration is as nearly as possible the
                    same as that of the original. The new site is a plot of ground adjacent to the space occupied by the
                    original. The plants marking the winding and intricate paths of the restored Labyrinth consist
                    mainly of Amoor River Privet. The old hedgerows were formed of "wild river privet together
                    with flowering trees and shrubs and some thorn trees." Trees have not been used in the
                    Restoration. 'The building placed in the center of the Labyrinth by the Rappites was
                    constructed of wood. The new building which will be known as the <hi rend="i">Temple</hi> is
                    constructed of stone.</p>
            <p>In his description of the original Labyrinth, the author quotes from several persons who observed it
                    while still preserved. The description by Robert Dale Owen which was included in his autobiography,
                        <hi rend="i">Threading My Way</hi>, seems the most reliable of all. Owen refers to the Labyrinth
                    as a playground, but he believed that it had a significance in relation to the lives that Rapp
                    wished the members of his community <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-038-1-096"/> to follow. "Thus
                    George Rapp had sought to shadovforth to his followers," says Owen, "the
                    difficulties of attaining a state of peace and social harmony." This much was symbolized by
                    the maze of paths by which the shrine could be reached by a successful seeker. Owen adds this keen
                    interpretation: "The perplexing approach, the rough exterior of the shrine, and the
                    elegance displayed within were to serve as types of toil and suffering, succeeded by happy
                    repose." Mr. Lockridge accepts this view as stated by Robert Dale Owen and found in other
                    writings, and presents it in his own way, saying that, "it may be assumed that the
                    Labyrinth sumbolized their [I the Rappites'] belief in the early comings of the millenium.
                    It also typified their conception of the winding ways of life by which a state of true social
                    harmony was to be attained ultimately. It seems, furthermore, to have been regarded by them and by
                    those who visited them, as a pleasure ground. Thus, it integrated truly the harmony of those devout
                    people."</p>
            <p>The brochure is well written and represents much careful work. There are some slips such as
                    "divigation" for "divination" (p. 22), and the failure to
                    indicate an omission from a quotation (p. 77). Readers will certainly appreciate the many fine
                    things included in the pamphlet, perhaps the finest piece of writing that Mr. Lockridge has ever
                    done. The reviewer has enjoyed the study and recommends it to others.</p>

            <p>I should like to begin my talk by quoting, with your permission, a rather insulting poem about our
                    interests and our profession. It is by John Kendrick Bangs, the American humorist, and it goes like
                    this: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Whate'er my forebears may have been,</p>
                        <p>Ape, insect, bird, flesh, fowl, or fin,</p>
                        <p>I am myself; and rain or shine</p>

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps no line of monkey ancestry ever made a monkey out of Mr. Bangs, but I can tell you from my
                    own experience that ancestry, and particularly the search for it, has made monkeys out of a good
                    many people. Many a man has set out to trace his family history only to end up three or four years
                    later in a state of greater confusion than when he started. And many a woman has been driven to
                    distraction by the intricate inter-twinings of the branches of the family tree.</p>
            <p>My purpose in presenting this paper is to help some of you in the search for your ancestors by
                    pointing out to you a number of short cuts and a number of proven methods that some of you may not
                    now practice. I realize, of course, that many of you have had considerable experience in research,
                    and that a number of the things I am going to say have been heard by you and read by you time and
                    time again. Moreover, there are in existence a number of books dealing with my subject which cover
                    the ground much more thoroughly than I can in the space of an hour. One of them in particular,
                    Gilbert Doane's <hi rend="i">Searching for Your Ancestors</hi>,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> is an
                    admirable handbook for the genealogist, and I shall refer to it again and again. In the course of my

                    <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-038-1-098"/> the Genealogical Department of the Newberry Library, and through
                    association with some of the competent professional and amateur genealogists who regularly work
                    there, I have come upon some stray bits of information and some tricks of technique that may be new
                    to even the most experienced of you. Those of my audience who are old hands at genealogical research
                    will have to bear patiently with me during certain portions of my paper, for the bulk of it is
                    directed to the inexperienced amateur and to the comparative newcomer in the field.</p>
            <p>I do not know what started you on your interest in genealogy, but it was probably one of the half
                    dozen or so aims that prompt most people to look up their ancestors. These are, briefly: (1) To
                    satisfy a natural curiosity about the past and about the people who lived in the old days. (2) To
                    determine relationship to some historical person or to some member of the nobility. (3) To establish
                    claim to membership in the D.A.R., S.A.R., or some other patriotic society. (4) Or, finally, the aim
                    may be simply the fun connected with research—the pure joy of the search and interest in
                    the unusual things that are turned up.</p>
            <p>Most people pursue one or more of these aims with a grim seriousness that frequently threatens to
                    obscure their satisfaction when they finally do accomplish their end. Once in a while, however, I
                    come across a genealogist who thoroughly enjoys his hobby, even when the joke is on him. One of our
                    readers at Newberry, for example, became a member of the Mayflower Society through an ancestor who,
                    it turned out, was the first man hanged for murder in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The reader was not dismayed, and maintained his family pride even when he learned that
                    the murderer's son, Francis, was sent to jail for drinking (that is, smoking) tobacco on
                    the highway. At this point, however, the members of the family discarded their evil ways and from
                    then on became honorable citizens. A son of Francis moved to another part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and founded the first church in that town. The amusing thing about the matter, the
                    reader informed me, is that many persons who could become members of the Mayflower Society through
                    this same ancestor have dropped everything upon discovering the hanging.</p>
            <p>But whatever your aim, and whatever the pleasure you take in following it, the procedure in general
                    is the same. I <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-038-1-099"/> am going to discuss, first, the equipment
                    necessary for genealogical research; then I shall talk about where to start, followed by an outline
                    of library research and general suggestions on research procedure. Throughout these remarks I shall
                    make frequent reference to various types of tools and their use. Some of the things I shall say are
                    very simple and obvious. I shall mention them, however, because I know from my experience at
                    Newberry that even people who have been working for years on their family history have not developed
                    standard systems of research and have not provided themselves with practical tools for their work.</p>
            <p>In starting out on genealogical research you must be aware of one important fact. It is this: that
                    before you finish with your search you are going to be the possessor of a huge heap of notes and
                    manuscripts and pictures and photostats and maps and strange little pencilled scraps of paper that
                    came from goodness knows where. It is vitally important, therefore, to start out with a definite
                    plan for arranging and filing this material as you gather it. This aspect of research seems to have
                    suffered great neglect at the hands of genealogists, although genealogical work requires just as
                    much care and intelligence as any other research subject. It is also important to remember that in
                    this kind of research you will find a great many apparently unrelated facts and items. An item here
                    and an item there may seem to have no connection, and yet a third item may link the three together.
                    Such a happy combination obviously would be impossible if, through bad organization, the first two
                    were not accessible when the third was found. Keep everything pertinent, therefore, and keep it in
                    findable form.</p>
            <p>Provide yourself with a loose-leaf notebook. One eight-and-a-half by eleven inches in size is
                    preferable because this size not only is convenient tG carry, but all your correspondence,
                    typewritten papers, photostats and other valuable notes and papers can be inserted and rearranged
                    with a minimum of trouble. Many genealogists also carry a smaller pocket size for jotting down notes
                    and information when traveling. I should like to say a word about that common combination, pencil
                    and paper. Pencil is all right for temporary notes, but eventually smudging will result in loss of
                    legibility or even in complete obliteration. Pen and ink make the ideal
                    combination—wherever, <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-038-1-100"/> of course, the library or
                    institution will permit their use.</p>
            <p>There are various patented devices for holding notes, or for preserving family records, which are
                    obtainable at book stores that specialize in genealogical publications. There are square charts, or
                    radial and fan-shaped charts, arranged so that the skeleton or even the entire compilation may be
                    seeii at a glance. The old-fashioned natural tree with its trunk, branches and twigs has in recent
                    years passed completely off the scene. The <hi rend="i">New <placeName>

               <hi rend="sup">3</hi> system of denoting relationship by figures,
                    paragraphing, and difference in type styles and sizes is the standard system used in printing
                    material.</p>
            <p>And now as to where to start your search.</p>
            <p>The place to start digging is right in your own back yard. Every family has records of some sort and
                    every home has a collection of such memoranda. They may he relics, old clippings, albums, old
                    letters, diaries, official documents of one sort or another, journals, and even samplers. And last
                    but not least, of course, is that most widely used storehouse of documents and data—the
                    old family Bible. Many a letter or paper too valuable to be trusted to the doubtful security of a
                    bank vault has been slipped between the leaves of the old family Bible. And more often than not, the
                    Bible has proved to be a safe resting place. If you are fortunate, and if your ancestors were given
                    to filing letters and clippings and other information in the Bible, you may find a good deal of
                    useful information in the family copy. The chances are even better that you will find written
                    therein the births and deaths of at least one or two generations.</p>
            <p>In telling you how to use this information I can do no better than quote from <hi rend="i">Searching
                        for Your Ancestors</hi>. Mr. Doane says: "One of the first things to do when examining
                    a Bible is to determine when the book was printed. If the title page has the date 1817 on it, or the
                    preface or translator's note is signed 1817, you know at once that any records dated before
                    that year were entered from memory (or, perhaps, copied from some older Bible). In this event those
                    records should be carefully verified, if possible, from other sources—gravestones, town
                    or church records."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> I should <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-038-1-101"/> also like to make this suggestion: because essential
                    genealogical information is often contained in family Bibles it is important to insure against their
                    loss and destruction. This can be done by photostating the title page and all pertinent genealogical
                    data and giving copies to several close relatives. Incidentally, and while I am on this subject, it
                    is always prudent and frequently helpful to mark all family portraits and pictures in such a way
                    that future generations will be able to identify them.</p>
            <p>After the family documents have been examined, thc next step is to ransack the minds of the various
                    members of the family. Many elderly people have a very clear memory of things that they heard or saw
                    when they were younger, and such information can be of great value. It should be remembered,
                    however—and this point cannot be overemphasized—that all such information must
                    be checked and verified in every possible way before it is accepted as factual. It is better to
                    regard the statements of relatives and old settlers as valuable hints and clues toward further
                    research rather than as reliable history.</p>
            <p>When you have gathered all the information that the family Bible and the family memory have to offer;
                    when you have equipped yourself with all the names aid dates and places that you possibly can get;
                    then, and not until then, are you ready to go to the library to begin your research in books.</p>
            <p>But before I talk about search in books, I should like to make five suggestions of a general nature:
                    (1) In tracing your ancestors always proceed from the present to the past. It is the easiest way
                    because more is known about present and recent generations than about the earlier ones; and it is
                    the best way because it minimizes the danger of getting off on a branch line. (2) Make a note of
                    every book you search in—<hi rend="i">especially</hi> if you find nothing in it. You may
                    spend a day or even two days in going through book after book without finding a single reference to
                    your family, and you may feel that you have wasted completely those two days. But your activity was
                    not wasted. Such activity may be called "negative research." That is, you did not
                    find what you were looking for, but you do know that what you are looking for is not in the fifty or
                    sixty books you consulted in those two days. If you have listed their titles (preferably <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-038-1-102"/> on small cards alphabetically arranged by author), you will have a
                    "works consulted" file which will tell you instantly what works you have already
                    examined. It is a system that will save much duplication of effort. (3) In reading old records and
                    documents it is important to remember that with the passage of time the meanings of words change.
                    For example, in early records the term "cousin" did not necessarily imply blood
                    relationship, and "brother" could mean a brother-in-Christ or a brother-in-law as
                    well as the closer tie. "Son-in-law" occasionally meant step-son, and there are
                    other similar traps for the unwary. (4) Every name is important, no matter where you find it. The
                    ordinary man whose chief aim in life was to be an honorable citizen and a prompt taxpayer may be a
                    very elusive person. His record may be found anywhere. He may be mentioned in a local history or he
                    may be mentioned in a medical or business directory or some other special compilation that has no
                    direct connection with family history or the science of genealogy. There is no rule limiting the
                    bibliography of genealogy. A name may be found anywhere—and you must look for it there!
                    (5) Finally, do not be discouraged if you fail to compile your genealogy in a few hours. Sometimes a
                    few hours' work will show great results, but frequently days, weeks or months will pass
                    with very little accomplished.</p>
            <p>With these hints and suggestions in mind you are ready to begin work in a library.</p>
            <p>It is advisable, on your first visit to a library that you have not used before, to go to the person
                    in charge of the genealogical department and ask him or her to acquaint you with any special indexes
                    they may have compiled, and with the general routine in that particular library. Most libraries have
                    developed catalogues or guides to certain of their collections; they are designed to save time and
                    effort for the reader, and intelligent use will result in just that saving. At Newberry, for
                    example, most genealogists begin their search in the celebrated analytical index. It is a guide to
                    the family names in the books to be found in the Library, and it contains over a million entries,
                    alphabetically arranged by name and then by state and county under each name.</p>
            <p>You are now ready to explore the vast domain of published works. If you are fortunate, you will find
                    that an already-published genealogy includes your branch of the family. <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-038-1-103"/> You probably will not be fortunate, so your next step will be to
                    examine periodicals which include genealogies and notes on family history. The best available guide
                    to this source is Jacobus' <hi rend="i">Index to Genealogical Periodicals</hi>.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This tool indexes such periodicals as the <hi rend="i">New <placeName>

                    this field. They contain, in addition tn genealogies, such items as transcripts and abstracts of
                    local records, probate records, church records, and cemetery records. There also are numerous
                    periodicals covering other sections of the country, such as the <hi rend="i">William and Mary
                        Quayterly</hi>

                    </placeName>. There are other important indexes. such as <hi rend="i">Durrie and Munsell</hi>,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> but I shall not discuss them here. Instead, I shall refer you once again to
                    Mr. Doane's book where, in Appendix A, you will find a comprehensive list of indexes.</p>
            <p>When you have exhausted the periodicals as a source of material, the next thing to do is to locate a
                    history of the town or county in which you know your ancestor lived. In general histories there are
                    only very brief mentions of individuals—enough, however, to establish the genealogical
                    identity. In local histories material will range from brief mentions of individuals to short
                    accounts of their families. It is not uncommon to find two or three generations in an article. Such
                    sketches are intended to show the connection of the individual or the family with the community.</p>
            <p>There are a few bibliographies of local history, but nothing, to my knowledge, that is comprehensive
                    or up-to-date. <placeName>

                    <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-038-1-104"/> another word of warning is in order. For various reasons many
                    towns have changed their names at one time or another, and many state and county lines have been
                    shifted. Frequently two or three new counties have been formed out of one large county, with a
                    subsequent adjustment of lines all around. Stetson<hi rend="sup">10</hi> gives an interesting
                    account which will serve as an example of the type of difficulty created for the genealogist by such
                    boundary changes.</p>
            <p>"John Joles was supposed to have been born, to have lived and to have died in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>. It was found by the record that he died in Bristol, <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>, an adjoining town. This record greatly disturbed some of his descendants who appealed
                    for help to establish the facts in the case. It was found that the old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>-Bristol line passed directly through the Joles house which stood not ovelhalf a mile
                    south from the center of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> village, and that the family bedroom where John slept was on the Bristol side of the
                    line. The town line was later moved south one mile, leaving the entire house a mile on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> side. At the time John died, however, if he died in his bed, he was in Bristol. But if
                    he ate in the old-fashioned kitchen, a custom prevailing in the early days, he ate in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>. Therefore he doubtless was born and died in Bristol, but lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> all his life, and actually was born, always lived in, and died in the same house and
                    adjoining rooms."</p>
            <p>Nor are such changes a problem of the past. Just a year or so ago I came across this item in one of

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers. It was date-lined Havana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, and read: "J. W. Whatley of Havana has lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>

                    moving." When, therefore, the searcher works through the history and records of a county
                    without finding mention of his ancestor, he will do well to check on the history of the boundary
                    lines. He may find his materials in the seat of the next county a few miles away.</p>

            <p>Other records found in genealogical libraries and in public libraries having genealogical sections
                    include copies of official records such as birth, marriage and death certificates. As you progress

                    the proper locality, and the same treatment will be accorded death and marriage records. If the
                    vital records of the town were not kept at an early date, or if they were destroyed, the next source
                    would be any available church records. These frequently contain the records of baptisms, marriages
                    and deaths. Sometimes they contain a little additional information which would not be found with the
                    official record of the event as given by the town clerk. For example, you may find the names of

            <p>All of this, of course, is an illustration of what I have said before: There is no limit to the
                    bibliography of gelealogy. Every book which contains the desired name should be used for compiling a
                    history of that family. The choice of books depends largely on the activities of the members of the
                    family. A minister might be found in such works as the <hi rend="i">Annals of the American
                        Pulpit</hi>,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> and a soldier, in the army records or the pension records.
                    Then, too, there are innumerable resources for discovering proofs of identity, or relationship
                    lineal or collateral, and no one book can tell you how to work. Rather than attempt to give you a
                    lengthy bibliography of genealogy, I will call your attention once more to Mr. Doane and his list of
                    bibliographies that serve as a guide to the most-used books in each field.</p>
            <p>There is, of course, much work to be done outside of libraries. This consists largely of writing to
                    others for information and help, and very frequently such correspondence is the only way to get
                    absolutely necessary information. Again I feel that I should apologize for elaborating on such a
                    simple point, but I have seen so many rudely-written letters, and so many justifiably sharp replies,
                    that a word of suggestion may be helpful. Always introduce yourself at the beginning of your letter.
                    Then state your problem briefly and clearly and follow that statement with a series of direct
                    questions. If possible, arrange these questions in some logical order so that the person questioned
                    will be able to see something of the point of your inquiry. In other words, make your letter
                    interesting, and keep in mind that not all people are interested in genealogy, and that genealogical
                    problems, particularly those of a stranger, do not seem important to them. You will, of course,
                    enclose return postage, or a stamped, self-addressed envelope. When writing to town or county clerks
                    for vital records, probate records, land records, or tax lists, offer to pay any fee they may charge
                    and enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope for reply.</p>

            <p>At this point Doane again comes to the rescue of ancestor hunters. For your convenience he has listed
                    the states which have collected in a state office the vital records from the several towns and
                    counties. A more complete list, and the one from which Mr. Doane compiled his, was printed in an
                    article in the <hi rend="i">New <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName> Register</hi>.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Harold Clarke Durrell, the author of the
                    article, gives very full information about the activities of the offices in all forty-eight states,
                    so his paper should also be consulted on such problems.</p>
            <p>There is one more extra-library activity to be mentioned. When all other records have failed to
                    produce information. you will have to start digging in cemeteries-figuratively, not literally. The
                    dates and inscriptions on tombstones arc your records here, and they frequently are very valuable
                    ones. It should be remembered that in most old settlements it was as much a custom to have private
                    burial plots on the farms as to have church or town graveyards. In many cases these private burial
                    places antedate the public ones. Hence a thorough search must be made of all such possible places.
                    If you fail in one place, search the cemeteries in neighboring communities. Tombstones, of course,
                    are not always helpful. Imagine the feelings of the earnest seeker after information who came across
                    this inscription: "I was somebody. Who, is no business of yours." And some of them
                    are obviously unreliable, as, for example, the one that reads: "Here lies Johr: Mound, Who
                    was lost at sea and never found."</p>
            <p>I am sure that by this time you are thoroughly bored with the tools of genealogical research, and
                    probably will not want to hear another title for a week. I should like to mention just one more type
                    of tool, and then I shall have finished. That tool is the newspaper index, and, I am happy to say,
                    we are getting more and more of them. Those already in existence are Palmer's <hi rend="i">Index to the [<placeName>

                    will be published. These newspaper indexes are to be found only in the larger libraries, but there
                    is always a chance that they will contain a reference to an obituary notice or some other item
                    relating to your ancestor, and they may well be consulted whenever you happen to be working in an
                    institution which has them.</p>
            <p>So much for the tools of the trade. Before concluding, I should like to say a few more words on
                    technique. Remember that nothing can be done toward establishing the earlier families until the more
                    recent ones have been found. The local sources are nearly always productive and will supply many
                    clues. If your ancestor lived in one place and theu moved to another, the proper procedure would be
                    to search the records in the latter place from birth records to warrants for land. This may
                    establish the activities of the family over a certain period, may determine the duration of
                    residence at that place, and may also give suggestions as to former residence. In earlier days the
                    record of the first purchase of land by a person made mention of his former residence. Because of
                    this fact it is occasionally possible to trace the wanderings of a family for quite a few years.</p>
            <p>The place of maps in genealogical research should be mentioned. Old maps are far more helpful than
                    modern maps, since they show the geographical condition as it actually was at the time your family
                    lived in the territory. Use state, county, and town maps, and topographical and rural delivery maps.
                    If they are too large they can be folded and inserted in your loose-leaf book. No serious search
                    should be attempted unless a good map is available.</p>
            <p>An analysis of the 1790 census, called <hi rend="i">A century of population growth from the first
                        census of the <placeName>

                    of the various counties and the changes which have taken place in them from time to time. This
                    volume also includes a list of names taken from the 1790 schedules showing what spellings were used
                    for each name in the different schedules.</p>
            <p>And here is what I think is one of the most helpful of all devices. When you have exhausted all other
                    means and <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-038-1-109"/> methods of research, and you do not know where to turn next,
                    make what is known as a "circular search." Get a map of the pertinent territory
                    and, using the earliest known residence of your ancestor as the center, draw, with a compass, a
                    circle at a radius of about five miles. Then search all the sources in all the towns included in
                    this area. If this fails to produce information, extend the radius another five miles and again go
                    through the records of <hi rend="i">every</hi> town. This may be continued indefinitely, and it very
                    seldom fails.</p>
            <p>Finally, may I urge one more point? May I make a plea for accuracy? You <hi rend="i">must</hi> verify
                    every note, every reference, every scrap of information you get. The fact that a date is in a book,
                    and that the book is in a famous library, does not mean that the date is a reliable one. I cannot
                    emphasize this point too strongly, for on it hinges the reputation of your research and of all
                    genealogical research. Remember the last words of the dying scholar as his pupils gathered at his
                    bedside: "Check your references!"</p>
