            The October, 1880 election for state officers was important to the Democratic party in Indiana, and
                    the November, 1880 presidential election in the Hoosier State was doubly important to the national
                    fortunes of the party. Yet the Democracy lost both of these political contests by narrow margins of
                    less than 8,000 votes in a total count of approximately 470,000.1 This occurred
                    despite the fact that in early September of 1880 the state had appeared to key observers as safely
                        Democratic.2 Why did these defeats materialize? Literate and vocal
                    participants, as well as historians, have offered a myriad of explanations about the elements,
                    issues, and mistakes which contributed to this debacle. Stress usually has been placed on national
                    factors: e.g., the supposed political ineptitude of the Democratic presidential candidate, General
                    Winfield Scott Hancock; the unfortunate appearance of the phrase "a tariff for revenue
                    only" in the party platform; the general disorganization and anarchy within the party
                    following the loss of the disputed election of 1876; and the

                    energy, money, and imported voters which were supposedly poured into Indiana in the closing weeks of
                    the campaign by the Republican national committee under the direction of its secretary, Stephen W.
                        Dorsey.4
            
            During the campaign, after the October election, and in the months following the November defeat,
                    many voices in Indiana and neighboring states suggested that the failure had been due largely to the
                    faulty operations of the Democratic State Central Committee of Indiana. This committee had operated
                    under the chairmanship of William H. English, who was also the vice-presidential running mate of
                    General Hancock on the national ticket.5 The papers of English, which are
                    available for scrutiny, provide a remarkably full picture of the policies, problems, techniques, and
                    financial activities of the state central committee in that highly significant election year. These
                    manuscripts and records make possible a somewhat detailed study of the committee's
                    operations. Such an analysis throws considerable light on the actual causes of defeat and offers a
                    variety of interesting detail about the tools and tactics as well as the strategy and scope of a
                    state political campaign some fourscore years ago.
            The electoral arithmetic of the presidential contest in 1880 was remarkably similar to that of
                        1876.6 The magic figure for victory was still 185 electoral votes since no

                     states or census reapportionment had altered the total. By 1880
                    there was little danger that any of the southern or border states could be stolen again from the
                    Democrats as had probably happened in 
                  Louisiana,
                            Florida
               , and 
                        South Carolina
                     in 1876. This provided the party with a basic initial advantage of 138 electoral votes
                    practically before the contest began. The addition of 
                        New York
                     (35) and Indiana (15) would make a total of 188 votes and victory. Tilden and Hendricks
                    had carried these key northern states in 1876; therefore, they might be presumed to be Democratic in
                    1880. It is true that the picture had changed somewhat in 
                        New York
                    , but it was thought that some truce could be worked out between the John Kelly and
                    Samuel J. Tilden forces to enable the Democrats to achieve the necessary unity. Since 
                        Connecticut
                     (6) was no longer considered as probably Democratic even strongly Democratic 
                        New Jersey
                     (9), when added to the anticipated votes from 
                        New York
                     (35), would not be sufficient. Thus, the fifteen votes of Indiana were crucial.7 While a scattering of Democratic electors might be forthcoming from 
                        Nevada
                    , 
                        Oregon
                    , and 
                        California
                     in the Far West, these developments could not be relied upon. Democratic managers
                    agreed that 
                        New York
                     and Indiana must be secured in 1880,8 but victory in the Hoosier
                    State was especially important because of its October election of state officers. Republican victory
                    in this contest would undoubtedly affect the psychology of the presidential campaign and breed
                    discouragement in Democratic quarters.
            Usually voter support in Indiana throughout the last half of the nineteenth century was almost
                    equally divided between the two major parties. This perhaps reflected the remarkably even cultural,
                    economic, and regional balance within the State. For a decade and a half before 1875 Oliver P.
                    Morton was the driving and domineering spirit and force of the Republicans. In the same period
                    Thomas A. Hendricks was the strongest leader of the Democrats. Following the Civil War Indiana
                    became a bloody political battleground with parties

                     alternating in power within the state as the result of a series
                    of very narrow victories at the polls.9 Hendricks was a formidable presidential
                    candidate in the Democratic national conventions of 1868 and 1876. In the latter year he was
                    nominated for the vice-presidency as the western representative of the 
                        New York
                    -midwestern alliance of the Bourbon Democrats of the North. Some easterners were not
                    happy with this development, since by that date many of them had come to regard Hendricks as
                    something of a renegade Bourbon because of his dalliance with inflation.
            But the star of Hendricks faded somewhat from the political horizon in the years
                    1877–1880. He made plain his resentment of Tilden's studied failure to consult
                    him during the campaign and electoral count of 1876–1877 by announcing that he would
                    never again run on the old ticket of 1876.10 He felt the pressure of the
                    Greenbackers in the Midwest and partially succumbed to their doctrines.11 He
                    made tentative rapprochements with the Kelly forces who were fighting Tilden in 
                        New York
                     and generally tried to solidify and expand his presidential support among all western
                        Democrats.12 Back home in Indiana, however, some new faces were appearing in
                    party gatherings, councils, and state offices.13 Some of these, such as George
                    W. Julian and Isaac P. Gray, were old Whigs or Democrats who had joined Morton in the Republican
                    party in the Civil War era and had remained until the completion of its historic mission of
                    antislavery had been replaced by Grantism and reactionary Bloody-Shirtism. Others, such as Governor
                    "Blue-Jeans" Williams, of 
                        Vincennes
                    , and State Treasurer William Fleming, of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , had worked with Hendricks for years but were now carrying party and governmental
                    responsibilities in their own right.
            In the Indiana elections of 1878 the Democrats won a resounding victory after a campaign in which the

                     may have been weakened to some extent by Morton's
                    death in the fall of 1877.14 Both the Democratic party and the incumbents of
                    elected and patronage state positions hoped to continue their good fortune. But Hendricks'
                    preoccupation with his presidential ambitions bid fair to confuse the Democratic state machine and
                    to decrease the party's prospects in both 1880 elections. Although it must be remembered
                    that the gyrations of national party conventions usually are unpredictable, careful scrutiny of a
                    considerable volume of evidence on the 1880 nominations in 
                        Cincinnati
                     strongly suggests that Hendricks did not have a real chance of being nominated for
                    either president or vice-president. He had to share the title of "leader of the
                    West" with others such as the 
                        Ohio
                     politicians, Allen G. Thurman, Henry B. Payne, and George H. Pendleton; he had thrown
                    away his chance for the second spot by his vigorous anti-Tildenism of the previous three years; and
                    he was persona non grata to the great party fund contributors of the East because
                    of his flirtation with the inflationists.15
            
            Yet Hendricks' past services and the tradition of his heroic leadership during the
                    Reconstruction years enabled him to send to the 1880 convention an Indiana delegation pledged to
                    support him for the presidential nomination. This meant that Indiana, a state needed by the
                    Democrats that year, would have no representative on the national ticket unless another Hoosier
                    could be found. Some of the delegates turned first to Senator Joseph E. McDonald, who sought
                    permission to allow his name to be presented for second place from Hendricks, his life-long
                    political colleague.16 Since this permission was not forthcoming, the convention
                    turned to ex-Congressman William H. English, who was nominated by acclamation.17
            
            Vice-presidential nominee English was comparatively unknown to many Democrats in 1880. He had served
                    for several terms in the national House of Representatives in the 1850's with a somewhat
                    routine record of cooperation with the southern slavery interests then dominating the party and

                     the national government.18 With the
                    outbreak of hostilities in 1861, he returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to establish a highly successful business in real estate mortgages and banking. He
                    cooperated in general with the Lincoln and Morton administrations and deserved the characterization
                    of being a genuine War Democrat. In 1863 he founded the First National Bank of 
                        Indianapolis
                     under the new law of that year. Having developed this bank into one of the premier
                    financial institutions of the Midwest, he resigned its presidency on July 25, 1877.19 For the next two years or more he consolidated and reorganized his business investments and
                    enjoyed his status of quasi-retirement. English evidently kept an eagle eye on the political picture
                    in Indiana and the nation and very shrewdly evaluated the drift of public opinion in both areas. He
                    sensed the eastern Bourbon Democrats' dissatisfaction with Hendricks and realized that that
                    gentleman was rapidly isolating himself from the national power picture and also losing some of his
                    grip on the party in Indiana.20
            
            As early as November, 1879 English had set the ball rolling for the vice-presidential nomination by
                    means of interviews and the dispatch of thousands of reprints of these interviews to friendly
                    editors around the country.21 By February, 1880 he was negotiating for the
                    chairmanship of the state central committee. In February and March he consulted with William H.
                    Barnum and Samuel J. Tilden about this proposition;22 later he established
                    contact with Henry L. Watterson for a

                     In May, 1880 he was ready to throw overboard both Tilden and
                    Watterson and allow his name to be associated with General Hancock.24 When the
                    Democratic state convention met on June 9, Hendricks was its president and the delegation to the
                    national convention was pledged to him, but William H. English emerged as the chairman of the state
                    central committee and thus was in charge of that year's canvass. National Chairman Barnum
                    and Senator Joseph E. McDonald promptly sent letters of congratulation to English.25 Two weeks later the other major phase of his program became a reality with his nomination
                    as 
                        Hancock
                    's running mate.
            The state central committee was composed (in addition to the chairman) of a representative from each
                    of the state's thirteen congressional districts.26 Because they had
                    local roots, its members undoubtedly reflected the current social, political, and economic confusion
                    of a predominantly agrarian region beginning to feel the impact of industrialization. The chairman,
                    however, was a voice from the political past. He had been little more than a bystander in the
                    political arena since 1860. His ideas as to the requirements, activities, and tactics to insure
                    victory at the polls were traditional. Since he alone had excellent relations with the national
                    committee and eastern Bourbon interests, and since it was hoped that he would spend freely of his
                    own considerable fortune to insure his election as vice-president,27 he was
                    generally allowed to run the campaign as he saw fit. A perusal of his papers and of the lists of the
                    state central committee's expenditures shows that he believed the political techniques of
                    the 1840's would provide the tried and true formula for

                            ; Eighth District, Joshua Jump, Vermilion County; Ninth District, A. B. Pitzer, 
                                Tipton County
                            ; Tenth District, A.B. Crampton,

                                Allen County
                            ; Thirteenth District, H. H. Francis, LaPorte County.

                     success. This meant a campaign with plenty of speeches,
                    newspaper propaganda, parades—all stressing the classic Jeffersonian principles and
                    cliches of economy, honesty, and "constitutional liberty." The tariff, currency,
                    and labor problems were to be ignored. If all the Democrats were gotten to the polls on election day
                    and Republican attempts to introduce out-of-state imports as voters were checkmated, then victory
                    for the Democrats, English assumed, would result.
            In Indiana such an operational procedure was inadequate for the Democratic party in 1880. Hoosier
                    farmers had suffered declining prices for their crops for too many years to be able to forget
                    economic grievances.28 The Hendricks element in the party organization was not
                    happy at seeing their hero and themselves relegated to the ranks while prewar supporters of James
                    Buchanan and Stephen A. Douglas, as well as some ex-Republicans, took over the operation of the
                    party machine.29 Also, burgeoning labor organizations did not relish being
                        ignored.30 Finally, the state ticket, selected by the convention on June 9,
                    1880, left something to be desired. Colonel Isaac P. Gray, of 
                        Randolph County
                    , was nominated for the office of lieutenant-governor although many knew that he was a
                    stronger campaigner than ex-Congressman Franklin Landers, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , who was the candidate for governor. Gray's prominence as a Republican member
                    of the state senate in 1869 evidently left deeper scars and more doubts in the minds of the
                    delegates than did Landers' Greenback aberrations.31 Although such well
                    known figures as William Fleming, of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , and John G. Shanklin, of 
                        Evansville
                    , were running for re-election to state offices, this ticket had no great name such as
                    Hendricks to lead the way. It did not even have a "Blue-Jeans" Williams, a Michael
                    Kerr (then deceased), or a William S. Holman to stir the spirits of the faithful.
            By the early summer of 1880 the Democratic central committee had established very modest headquarters
                    in four rooms at the Bates House in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Periodically three other rooms were rented as needed and paid for at the per

                     diem rate of $3 for each extra room occupied.32 Chairman English set up his office here with George F. Parker as secretary
                    and clerk at a salary of $18 per week.33 Parker had been sent from 
                        New York
                     by National Chairman William H. Barnum, who regarded him as an experienced and valuable
                    political operator. This arrangement had been discussed as early as February 19, 1880 by
                    correspondence between Barnum and English. At the same time Barnum had advised English to select and
                    train a first-class man as vice-chairman who could take over during the absences of English.34 Upon the selection of the Hoosier as the vice-presidential nominee, Barnum
                    promptly wrote English and invited him to 
                        New York
                     for meetings with National Committeeman William L. Scott, of 
                        Erie
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and others before the 
                        Hancock
                     notification ceremonies in mid-July. In the same letter Barnum congratulated both
                    himself and English for their foresightedness in arranging for the operation of the state central
                    committee during the chairman's absence.35
            
            The records of the central committee do not reveal much about the relationship of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     headquarters to the various county chairmen, but a limited portion of the story can be
                    reconstructed through odds and ends of documentary evidence. Despite the faint trace of a suggestion
                    that in theory an assessment was levied on each county for the central committee's
                    operations, most entries make it plain that dollars, printed materials, and speakers flowed in the
                    reverse direction. Vouchers for small amounts ($50 to $200) to county chairmen
                    for campaign expenses, such as C.O.D. express charges on literature shipped by the central committee

                    be filled out with the names of all Democratic farmers for comparable follow-up action. There is
                    also evidence that the 
                        United States
                     pensioners of all types in each county were recipients of special attention by both the
                    state and county leaders.38 In spite of these considerable services and supplies
                    from the central committee, at least one chairman had the temerity to ask Chairman English for a
                    small fund for party expenses, since the man could raise no money in very small and very Republican 
                        Ohio County
                    , near 
                        Cincinnati
                    .39
            
            The methods employed by the central committee for raising and spending party funds in 1880 in Indiana
                    were casual and in line with tradition. According to available evidence, no sums were asked or
                    expected of the common man. Instead, holders and aspirants for state office as well as devoted and
                    wealthy party adherents were expected to foot the bill.40 Assessments of up to
                    $2,000 were levied against each major candidate on the state ticket. Contributions were
                    channeled to the treasurer of the committee by whatever means were convenient and available.
                    Collections began on August 4 and continued until October 30, 1880. Some collections of
                    contributions when handed in were credited to the efforts of particular nominees and earmarked for
                    their campaigns. T. W. Woolen, the committee treasurer, kept a little black book in which thirty-one
                    entries, varying from $100 to $10,250 for a total of $38,432.30,
                    were recorded. Of this amount, $28,636 was turned in by Chairman English and there is
                    considerable evidence that $15,000 of this figure came from the vice-presidential
                    nominee's own pocket. In addition, it is possible that he was out of pocket for a variety
                    of incidental expenses. Because of his spot on the national ticket, he probably also made a
                    significant cash contribution to the expenses of the national committee although evidence to that
                    effect is not available. In passing, it is interesting to note that Thomas A. Hendricks was not
                    listed in the records of the central committee as a contributor. It is possible, of course, that
                    Hendricks supplied some funds to contributions listed here and there by lump sum.

            The total amounts raised and expended by the Democratic central committee of Indiana in the 1880
                    campaigns probably did not exceed $50,000.41 This figure is
                    remarkably low even after allowance is made for the price level and the value of the dollar at that
                    time. Modern state committees could do little more than set themselves up in business with such
                    limited funds. Obviously, not many two-dollar bills for voters could be provided for in such a
                    budget. Although bribery funds would probably not be listed in the records, the difficulty the
                    central committee had in raising even the limited total indicated above suggests that
                    cash-for-voters was not a widespread practice among Indiana Democrats in 1880.
            No evidence was found in either the committee's records or in English's
                    correspondence with Barnum and 
                        Hancock
                     of any cash being sent from the national committee to the Indiana committee. 
                        New York
                     sent many bundles of free literature to the state, but the express charges on these
                    usually were paid from the state party's treasury. Much help was given to English and his
                    cohorts by the 
                        New York
                     headquarters in providing literally dozens of out-of-state speakers for Indiana. The
                    expenses and occasional fees of these speakers were nearly always borne by 
                        New York
                     or by a national committeeman from some state other than Indiana.42
            
            This situation reflected the classic Jeffersonian concept of the federal union of the states as one
                    in which each state was the master of its own political fate. Despite the continuous barrage of
                    pleas from English to Barnun and 
                        Hancock
                     for help and the crucial importance of Indiana to the Democrats nationally in 1880,
                    only guidance, speakers, and literature apparently were forthcoming from 
                        New York
                    . This illustrates the quite limited and primitive stage of development of what is now
                    one of the strongest of party political institutions. Today national committees and chairmen
                    mobilize and distribute great financial resources with acumen in key 
                  
                     41 This estimate is based upon an analysis of the evidence found in
                            the Records of the Democratic State Central Committee [of Indiana]. Since these records
                            probably are not complete, further research, accounting, and statistical study might produce
                            a more accurate picture.
                  
                     42 For example, National Committeeman P. H. Kelly, of
                                    
                        St. Paul, Minnesota
                     , paid the expenses of Ignatius Donnelly,
                            Charles E. Severance, and Erasmus C. Flandrau, who spoke in Indiana in September, 1880. This
                            was revealed in a letter from Winfield S. Hancock to English, August 26, 1880.
               
                     states. This was not the practice in 1880, despite the
                    ground-breaking labors of Abram S. Hewitt in that direction while managing the Tilden campaign of
                        1876.43 On the other hand, there is more than a suspicion that the
                    Republican party's national command was not harassed by any such limited concept and that,
                    since the days of Lincoln, it had faced the necessities of national party finance and operations in
                    all of their ramifications.
            While modern political operators at the state level might be amazed at the limited finances and
                    sources of funds available to the Democratic central committee of Indiana in 1880, certified public
                    accountants of the mid-twentieth century would undoubtedly be horrified at the informal and
                    indifferent methods employed in making and recording party expenditures in 1880. A practice
                    seemingly existed whereby those against whom assessments were levied could partially or wholly work
                    out their financial responsibility by paying a variety of small bills presented to them by party
                    workers operating under their direction. Subsequently these paymasters gave the party treasurer
                    vouchers, complete with receipts signed by the party workers or other persons presenting the bills.
                    The most spectacular example of this procedure is found in the extensive records (vouchers numbered
                    1 to 82) which William Fleming presented to the Democratic State Central Committee in 1880.44 This gentleman, then serving as treasurer of state, had those who received
                    payment from him sign official State of Indiana receipts. This is a shock to the
                    researcher examining the records, since at first glance it appears that Fleming was using state
                    funds to pay off party debts. More probably, however, most of these bills were presented to him
                    while he was at his desk in the capitol; thus, he merely reached for the receipt blanks which were
                    closest at hand and in generous supply. After all, a receipt was still a receipt regardless of the
                    printed heading. The openness and extensiveness with which he followed this procedure make it
                    difficult to attribute to it any corrupt implication. One shudders to think of the deluge of charges
                    of corruption which would overwhelm a state treasurer today if an opposition newspaper uncovered
                    such a practice.

            State Treasurer Fleming succeeded in paying so many miscellaneous bills that his account shows the
                    central committee owed him $2,770.74 even after deducting his $2,000
                    assessment. Fleming's vouchers covered charges for: benches and chairs freighted to the
                    Wigwam for rallys; postal paper-wrappers and postage; Glee Club transportation; shirts, belts, and
                    campaign suits; fife and drum corps; county chairmen's campaign expenses; telegrams; the
                    varied services of the publisher of the Deutsch Amerikaner; and finally the cost
                    of a special train to transport Franz Sigel around the state on a speaking tour. The scope and
                    variety of these expenditures suggests that, although T. W. Woolen was treasurer of the central
                    committee, Fleming was the premier paymaster and bursar for many of the routine expenses.
            The bulk of expenditures which accounting purists might classify as administrative was handled
                    through the office of Chairman English. In addition to the office rent (approximately
                    $1,400 for four months), the salary for secretary and assistant ($360), and
                    poll books ($467.90), four bills for general office supplies and printed circulars
                    totaling $442.30 were recorded.45 Considerable attention to the
                    problems of uniforms and badges for party workers on parade was given by both the national and state
                    committees. In August, 1880 Barnum dispatched two detailed letters to English describing the items
                    of clothing which his subcommittee had recommended to be worn by Democrats on parade in all regions;
                    he also suggested the proper process of selection and the prices to be paid for these articles. This
                    decision was based on a desire to benefit from the price reductions possible with large orders
                    (85¢ was to be the total cost per outfit) and also to make the uniforms "uniform
                        everywhere."46 This 
                        New York
                     attempt to guarantee the homogeneous appearance of all Democrats evidently did not
                    succeed in Indiana; one Charles Lincoln sold 110 uniforms (including torches) to William Fleming for
                    $220 on September 2, and Ryan the Hatter of 
                        Indianapolis
                     on September 9, 1880 presented a bill to Chairman English for 2,000 campaign suits at a
                    cost of $1,400.47

            Telegraph and express charges were other significant administrative expenses of the central
                    committee. Fortunately for Chairman English his cousins James 0. and Norvil Green were prominent
                    executive officers in the International Ocean and Western Union Telegraph companies. These obliging
                    relatives, upon hearing of his nomination for vice-president, promptly sent him
                    "franks" enabling him to send messages over the lines of these organizations free
                    of charge for six months.48 This bonanza undoubtedly reduced the total of all
                    telegraph bills, but the records of the committee include a thirteen-page itemized list of telegraph
                    messages covering the two months from September 4 to November 4, 1880 for a total of
                    $439.03. The records of express charges are incomplete, but apparently three different
                    companies shared in the bundle business of the central committee. Adams Express Company was employed
                    most frequently for local shipments in the vicinity of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , with charges varying from 50¢ to $5 per shipment. The services
                    of the American Express Company were engaged for the distribution of packages to more distant points
                    throughout the state at costs running from $5 to $12 each, while the 
                        United States
                     Express Company received all of the out-of-state business and presented statements for
                    services costing from $10 to $18 for each delivery.49 A
                    substantial bill of $1,967 for the staging of a "Grand State Rally" in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on October 5 and 7 and an undertaker's $6 charge for
                    "Carriage Hire"50 can serve to complete this sampling of
                    administrative expenses for activity in and about the capital city.
            Although the over-all assumption of Chairman English was that there were more Democratic than
                    Republican voters in Indiana in 1880, he was well aware of the necessity of reassuring the faithful
                    by the printed and spoken word. The former is clearly demonstrated by the variety, volume, and
                    incessant use of newspaper facilities to carry the message of the Democracy to the people. Extensive
                    paid political advertisements and announcements appeared in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel from July 27 on at a basic rate of 7¢ a line. In the first
                    month 1,163 of such lines were printed, while from August 28 to October 4 (the eve of the state
                    election)

                    arrangements with Louis Schade of the Washington Sentinel to send 500 copies of
                    his sheet to Indiana leaders for a period of four months at $1 a copy.54 The Gutenberg Company of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , publisher of three different German language weeklies which appeared on Sunday,
                    Thursday, and Saturday, was given a contract for the weekly distribution of 1,000 copies of each
                    publication for a total of $50 per week.55 This same company and six
                    other German language papers around the state held contracts for the printing and circulation to

                    slips" each week. This service cost over $300 per week.56
            
            One contract with a newspaper editor which might have surprised the older and more conservative
                    members of the party was that with Enos B. Read. He distributed for the party from 500 to 1,000
                    copies of his unusual Sunday weekly, The People, for a contracted price of
                    $50 per thousand.57 This scurrilous and spicy sheet was later
                    described by a local historian as designed to appeal to the "ought to be submerged tenth of
                    the people."58 Another somewhat unexpected development was the
                    cooperation of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel, which had for some time been the voice of the Hendricks wing of the
                    party. By late September this newspaper had performed a considerable number of services for

                    reprints of Hendricks' speeches, and copies of the paper; thus, it proceeded to bill the
                    central committee to the tune of $141.02.59
            
            The committee was, of course, bombarded with requests from editors and owners of various small
                    Democratic journals around the state for small gifts or loans to meet current indebtedness and do a
                    better job for the party during the remainder of the campaign.60 In addition,
                    the 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Times, which had a large circulation in northwestern Indiana, was the cause of
                    some concern to the central committee. Ex-Senator James R. Doolittle, of 
                        Wisconsin
                     (and 
                        Chicago
                    ), reported to English in confidence that Wilbur F. Storey, the editor, was
                        "moody and may do us harm." This was because of
                    Storey's belief that the southern wing of the Democratic party would overwhelm the northern
                    and western leaders if the party ever achieved national power. Doolittle, recalling that Storey had
                    changed his tune after being helped financially during the 1876 campaign by Tilden money, asked the
                    vice-presidential nominee to explore the possibility of a similar largess to Storey by English or
                    the national committee.61
            
            Since the debacle of the Literary Digest's presidential poll in 1936,
                    remarkable progress has been made by both commercial and academic analysts in evaluating the factors
                    which influence public preferences for consumer goods or candidates for office. In the realm of
                    political behavior, teams of scholarly interviewers have established a close correlation between
                    "interest or a sense of involvement" and political action. They have demonstrated
                    that the hard core of both parties is not influenced by the course of the campaign. They have also
                    made clear that many of those who at first are little interested in the issues, programs, and
                    promises usually become concerned in the last days of the contest with the outcome and proceed to
                    vote. Today political parties pour massive sums and energy into political speaking campaigns,
                    including both face-to-face speeches and radio and television

                     addresses, in order to activate the political predispositions
                    of the reluctant segments of the electorate.62
            
            But the only machinery for evaluating political behavior known to exist fourscore years ago was the
                    hierarchy of party workers. On the lowest levels, their reports of voter interest and reaction
                    served as a guide to political techniques. The size of crowds at parades and speeches was considered
                    an indication of the voters' intentions although such turnouts may have reflected only
                    curiosity. The basic problems of survival in the 1880's were uncomplicated and revolved
                    around questions of public policy much simpler than those confronting voters in the twentieth
                    century. In addition, it should be recalled that the Australian ballot had not yet been adopted and
                    that the "channels of communication" from party to people were sharply limited to
                    printed and spoken words.
            Regardless of how sophisticated moderns may evaluate the effectiveness of campaign speeches, a
                    hurried glance at the extensive data in the records of the Indiana Democratic central committee and
                    at the frantic correspondence between Chairman English and a multitude of prospective speakers
                    reveals that the leaders of the Indiana Democracy regarded the spoken word as the number-one weapon
                    in beating back the Republican challenge. The two months after the adjournment of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     convention in late June, 1880 were devoted to the mobilization and assignment of
                    numerous distinguished speakers for a concentrated campaign of near saturation beginning during the
                    last weeks in August. The theory seemed to be that if the party kept all Democrats busy listening to
                    its speakers, they would not have time or opportunity to listen to the opposition!
            In light of the uncertain campaign effectiveness of the members of the state ticket, such seasoned
                    and impressive Hoosier campaigners as Thomas A. Hendricks, George W. Julian (an independent
                    ex-Republican), and the two 
                        United States
                     senators from Indiana, Daniel W. Voorhees and Joseph

                    speakers from 
                  Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin
               ,
                    and 
                        Iowa
                     brought the gospel from the Democracy of other midwestern states.64
                    Carefully selected southern speakers, such as Cassius Clay, of 
                        Kentucky
                    , and Wilkinson Call, of 
                        Florida
                    , brought the good word from the Southland. Samuel J. Randall and Senator William A.
                    Wallace, leaders of rival segments of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     party, both performed.65 From the East came General Franz Sigel, of 
                        New York
                    , Alex Troup, of 
                        New Haven
                    , and that perennial turncoat and political genius, Benjamin F. Butler, of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , who in that year was wearing the Democratic regalia.66 Some of
                    these speakers paid their own way and did not ask fees; others were financed from the joint
                    resources of the national and state committees; and still others were paid by wealthy individuals
                    who were not Hoosiers.67 The highest fee for an individual speech apparently was
                    $150. Both Generals Butler and Sigel received such recompense, with the added
                    accomodation of a special train for each within Indiana.68 Most combined fees
                    and expenses that had to be paid by the state central committee ran between $50 and
                    $100 each.69
            
            Two of the speakers were regarded so highly by the national committee that they were signed for the
                    duration of the campaign (from mid-August until the November election) for rather fancy fees.70 Both of these men, ex-Senator James R. Doolittle, of 
                        Wisconsin
                    , and ex-Congressman George W. Julian, of Indiana, had been either Radical Republicans
                    or had cooperated somewhat with that breed during the war and the early days of Reconstruction. Thus
                    they were at

                     least distrusted by old guard Democrats, and Julian was surely
                    resented and possibly despised by this group. But their services in the 1876 campaign for Tilden and
                    their demonstrated capacity to influence independents made them appear indispensable. There must
                    have been considerable uproar, however, in the ranks of the Indiana central committee when it became
                    known that the national committee was paying Julian $1,500 plus most of his expenses for
                    two and one-half months of work.
            The considerable reliance of Chairman English on national headquarters for financial assistance and
                    guidance in putting together this "maximum effort" speaking campaign is attested
                    to by seven letters from General Hancock71 and ten letters from Chairman Barnum
                    in the English Papers.72 These letters were written largely in August and the
                    first two weeks of September, 1880. The majority of General Hancock's communications were
                    written in his own hand. Contrary to traditional political mythology, they reveal the keen mind of a
                    decisive and shrewd political operator. In nearly every one of these missives the general's
                    opening sentence attempted to reassure Chairman English that all responsible leaders in 
                        New York
                     were aware of Indiana's crucial importance for national Democratic victory and
                    were working full time to achieve that objective. English was probably asking for money in addition
                    to advice, literature, and speakers; but, on his requests for financial help, he received only
                    generalized assurance from 
                        Hancock
                     and nothing from Barnum.
            Early in August, 1880 English had asked the national committee to provide him with thirteen speakers
                    from thirteen different states to speak in the thirteen congressional districts of Indiana. 
                        Hancock
                     went along with this whimsical numbers game and on August 6 sent English a list of
                    fifteen men who might be approached for the assignment.73 Of the men proposed,
                    only one was from the South (Governor R. B. Hubbard of 
                        Texas
                    ), three were from the border states of 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Maryland
                    , and the remainder were from the North and the West. Of the latter, one was a prominent

                        Hancock
                     continued to offer intelligent suggestions about additional speakers and promised his
                    services in securing their cooperation if English so desired. The general reported favorable
                    developments everywhere, especially in 
                        Maine
                    , and congratulated English on "the vigor shown in your management of the
                    Indiana campaign…,"74
            
            Four of the letters addressed by Barnum to English during the planning period for the speaking
                    campaign dealt with the controversial contract with George W. Julian.75 That
                    gentleman's cash income since leaving Congress had been meagre, and his very limited
                    personal estate had declined through unfortunate loans and other financial difficulties. During the
                    war and early Reconstruction Julian had been a snarling, opinionated, dedicated supporter of
                    antislavery movements and leaders; but he could not support the Stalwart Republicanism of Grant,
                    Conkling, Cameron, and company. On August 26, 1876 in 
                        Indianapolis
                     he had made a powerful speech, "The Gospel of Reform," which gave the
                    Tilden campaign a tremendous lift in Indiana and throughout the country.76 Over
                    two million copies of this speech, printed by the national committee at the direction of Abram S.
                    Hewitt, had been distributed widely.77 Although Julian had been a leading
                    Liberal Republican in 1872 and a belated but enthusiastic supporter of Tilden in 1876, he had never
                    affiliated himself openly and fully with the Democracy. Instead, he was an independent reformer with
                    a conscience and a reputation for sincerity.
            Barnum explained, one might even say apologized, to English for signing up Julian. He confessed that
                    he "did not like his [Julian's] stile [sic] & way but
                    under all circumstances I have concluded we had better shut our eyes & swallow him
                        down…,"78 A week later Barnum expanded his explanation
                    by saying that 
                        … the arrangement was made with Julian … against our judgment, but
                            because Julian being an Indiana man we felt his inaction would

            Barnum's other letters to English on the speaking campaign dealt with the hiring of
                    Doolittle and his proposed itinerary. According to this plan Doolittle was to start speaking in
                    Indiana on August 14, go to 
                        Maine
                     for the last two weeks before the election in the Pine Tree State, and then return to
                    Indiana and the West.80 Barnum also canvassed the possibilities of more speakers
                    from the South, especially 
                        Kentucky
                    . Later, somewhat as an afterthought, he inquired of English as to whether the latter
                    would have any use for "gentlemen of color" as speakers and proceeded to send one
                    the next day with a letter of introduction.81
            
            Although the speaking campaign was their major effort, Chairman English and his central committee did
                    not neglect other possibilities for increasing the Democratic vote in 1880. The special attention
                    given to Irishmen, Germans, farmers, and pensioners has been mentioned previously. In addition,
                    communications from the treasurer of the 
                        Ohio
                     central committee indicate that English, in letters to the central committees of
                    neighboring states, had offered to pay train fare for any Indiana voters desiring to return home to
                        vote;82 and actually the 
                  Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis
                & 
                        Chicago
                     Railroad did bill English's committee for "138 people transported to
                    various towns to vote" at a cost of $442.85.83
            
            Very early in the campaign English was faced with the age-old question about the proper treatment of
                    special interest groups, which, although limited in numbers and not genuine segments of the party,
                    might be the balance of power in a close election. Organized labor, a new and somewhat controversial
                    element on the political scene, soon attempted to project itself into the Indiana campaign.
                    Immediately after the 
                        Cincinnati
                     convention Marshall C. Woods, the political director of the Wage-Mens Amalgamated
                    Union, reported that "his group of over thirty thousand, mostly miners
                    and railroad men, good Republicans and Democrats, although called

                    grinding the face of the Poor…."84 Evidently English did not
                    respond promptly to this offer which might have hurt him in the eyes of his conservative backers;
                    two days later Woods sent him another letter virtually demanding a decision as to whether or not
                    Wood's organization could expect approval and a small sum of about $50 for
                    printing, banners, and other expenses.85 The records do not indicate any payment
                    to this organization. Six weeks later, on August 16, a 
                        Kentucky
                     correspondent called the attention of English to a secret labor organization (probably
                    the Knights of Labor) with a strength of twenty thousand in 
                  Indianapolis, Terre Haute, Evansville, New
                    Albany
               , and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . He reported that he had asked National Committeeman W. L. Scott in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to see the officers of this organization of nine hundred thousand members and get their
                    help for the Democratic ticket nationally.86 Again, the records do not reveal
                    any positive action on this suggestion.
            Late in June, 1880 this same 
                        Kentucky
                     correspondent, who evidently had wide political connections with Greenback leaders,
                    tried to have English arrange for the renomination of Dr. Gilbert De La Matyr, a much loved
                    Democratic Greenbacker currently representing the 
                        Indianapolis
                     district in the Forty-sixth Congress. He visualized this as "the most
                    effective argument … in 
                        Maine
                     for the fusion ticket, the final withdrawal of Weaver, & a
                    consolidation in Penna., 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                    …. To blunder in a Supreme moment is worse than a crime & I trust you
                    will not do so in 
                        Indianapolis
                    ."87 Early in July a 
                        New York
                    
                    Times editorial commented on the embarrassment which this proposal must be causing
                    the conservative-minded, former bank president who was running the campaign in Indiana. The editor
                    of the Times noted that 
                        Mr. De La Matyr holds the casting vote in the Indiana delegation, on a vote by States, and in
                            the contingency of the Presidential election being thrown into the House, he would make an
                            awkward enemy. Thus though English may detest his principles and distrust the man, he is
                            compelled to consider him.88

                                New York
                            
                            Times, July 6, 1880.
               
                     Although the editorial concluded with the statement that
                    "Major Mitchell, the Democratic rival of De La Matyr has finally withdrawn, and the first
                    clause in this disreputable bargain has been carried out," the deal must have gone awry
                    since the beloved Greenback clergyman was not renominated by the Democrats. The brief sketch of his
                    career in the Biographical Directory of the American Congress,
                    1774–1949 disposes of the problem neatly by stating that Mr. De La Matyr
                    "was not a candidate for renomination in 1880."89
            
            Twentieth-century registration and voting legislation plus widespread use of voting machines may have
                    greatly reduced the threat of fraudulent voting. In 1880, however, neither of the major parties in
                    Indiana could relax its vigilance but was forced to watch the opposition continuously to ferret out
                    and, if possible, forestall schemes for ringers, repeat voting, fraudulent voting lists, and
                    manipulation during the counting of ballots. The closeness of the party totals in Indiana elections
                    was an open invitation to smart political operators to practice their tricks. Tilden had carried
                    Indiana in 1876 by about five thousand votes and the Democrats had won the state elections of 1878
                    by about fourteen thousand. Thus the importation of new voters, the rigging of election lists, and
                    the hiring of repeating voters, if practiced judiciously and strategically, might overcome this
                    narrow margin of Democratic strength—unless the Democrats either stopped such activities
                    by the opposition or adopted similar ones of their own.
            Very early in the campaign Indiana Democrats were put on their guard by a letter to Chairman English
                    from Judge W. B. Beach. This 
                        Rhode Island
                     Democrat reported on June 29, 1880 that a conference had been held that very day in
                    Senator Henry B. Anthony's private office in 
                        Providence
                    , where Republican plans were formed to stop the Democratic boom that was sweeping the
                    country. Following the intelligence furnished by his informer, Beach reported: 
                        It was agreed that unless they could carry Indiana in October they must suffer defeat in
                            November—. To carry Indiana they rely on money and importation. They will try to import negroes [sic] from 
                                Kentucky
                             We know this has been done to some extent heretofore—they intend to
                            win by it this time.90

                  90 W. B. Beach to English, June 29, 1880.
            
            
            Echoes of this threat were repeated by other correspondents. Chairman Barnum, for example, revealed
                    real concern in two letters to English during August; in one he encouraged close cooperation between 
                        Kentucky
                     and Indiana Democrats to "check this outrageous fraud, and if necessary to
                    organize some plan to keep even with them."91 In addition, Blanton
                    Duncan, of 
                        Kentucky
                    , sent English the details of a plan for extended surveillance by detectives of all 
                        Kentucky
                     Negroes who "get off boats, trains, etc. in Indiana." Every
                    Democratic train conductor and trainman was to be alerted to report each case by letter to the local
                    committees at 
                  Evansville, New Albany, Jeffersonville, Madison
               , and 
                        Cincinnati
                    . It was expected that this movement would not start until the last week in September,
                    since otherwise it would be too expensive for the Republicans, who were conducting county
                    fund-raising drives in 
                        Kentucky
                     for the campaign in Indiana.92
            
            Another threat from ringers, this time from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , was revealed on August 21 in a letter to English from Chairman Barnum93 and on August 24 in one from Lewis C. Cassidy, of 
                        Philadelphia
                    .94 The latter, through informants and detectives, had learned that
                    a delegation, unknown in size but composed of expert election officers and manipulators of
                    fraudulent votes, had left 
                        Philadelphia
                     for 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Two of these operators, named McGuiness and McDonough, had been identified and
                    personal descriptions, including pockmarks on their faces, supplied. Barnum was sufficiently
                    impressed with the threat to pay the expenses of the detective who had been tracking these men so
                    that he could follow and watch them in the Hoosier State. Finally, on August 24 Blanton Duncan, that
                    perennially suspicious gadfly, called Chairman English's attention to the national club
                    convention, scheduled for September 15, 1880 at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , which might be a cover for the introduction of two thousand new voters. These
                    delegates, coming from various parts of the country, could remain in Indiana just long enough to
                    vote in mid-October.95

            The state election of 1880 was the last one held in October in Indiana. In fact, until early that
                    year it was thought that recent legislation and constitutional amendments combining the state and
                    national elections in November had already eliminated separate state contests. A state supreme court
                    decision, however, temporarily reinstated the usual election date.96 This meant
                    both parties had to engage in strenuous electioneering somewhat earlier than they had planned.
                    Originally the Democrats had hoped to begin in mid-August with major speeches by the two
                    distinguished independents, Doolittle and Julian.97 Doolittle did give a fine
                    oration in Indiana on August 14 for which he received good newspaper coverage,98
                    but Chairman English refused to use any of the state committee's funds for Julian. So the
                    celebrated reformer merely refused to say a word on a public platform until arrangements were
                    completed for the national committee to pay his fee and some of his expenses. Thus, on the very hot
                    evening of August 24, Julian's opening blast was delivered at the Wigwam in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It was entitled "The Duty of the Independent Voters." Two days
                    before its delivery Julian confided to his journal that the speech was as good as his famous 1876
                    oration and that he felt some satisfaction since "the niggardliness of English is
                    splendidly rebuked, & he now begs me to say something nice about him which I told him I
                    could not do, as my speech is already in print (Associated Press) …."99
            
            Any dissident party worker who might have grumbled at the fancy fee for George Julian's
                    speeches in Indiana and elsewhere would surely have changed his tune if he had had an opportunity to
                    read the October 14, 1880 entry in Julian's journal. Here Julian described his continuous
                    speaking tour of nearly all the major population centers of the state. During that tour, which began
                    on September 1 at 
                        New Castle
                     and ended on October 11 at 
                        Wabash
                    , he delivered variations of his speech to twenty-two different audiences over a span of
                    forty-one days. He traveled by horse and buggy, train, and

                     boat at all hours of the day and night. Throughout most of the
                    period he was wracked with fever and the nervous sleeplessness which had bothered him for a decade.
                    But crowds of up to fifteen thousand (just acres of people) greeted him at several stops on his
                    trip. He came home without a single doubt as to the result on election day.
            While Julian and other speakers had been swarming over the state, contending with insects, dust,
                    heat, and ill-health, trouble—serious trouble—had developed at the central
                    committee's headquarters in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . On August 22 in his journal Julian recorded rumors that Chairman English's
                    treatment of him had "raised a row between English and his friends which damaged him
                    [English] greatly…."100 On the same day, Rebecca R.
                    Springer, the wife of a Democratic congressman from 
                        Illinois
                     and an old friend of English, reported the ugly rumors she was hearing about the
                    chairman's conduct of the Indiana canvass. She wrote: 
                        The great fear seems to be that you will not assist financially, to the extent required for
                            success. Some democrats from Indiana have been making the assertion that you would rather
                            lose the position than spend the $100,000 necessary for success and gentlemen who
                            do not know you personally are feeling greatly exercised over this matter.
                    Her concluding sentences warned English that his political career was at stake and begged
                    for a letter of reassurance on Indiana.101 Rumors that all was not well in
                    Indiana spread to 
                        Georgia
                     where on August 23 Alexander H. Stephens, an old prewar friend, wrote for information
                    about the Democratic prospects in Indiana.102
            
            The most expert, realistic, and complete analysis of the trouble was supplied to National Chairman W.
                    H. Barnum on August 19 by Edward Campbell, Jr., the chairman of the 
                        Iowa
                     state central committee. On his way to 
                        Pittsburgh
                     on business, 
                        Campbell
                     had spent three days in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and was alarmed and discouraged by what he saw there. He reported: 
                        The democratic masses I found in good shape and enthusiastic, but among the leaders there
                            prevail the most discouraging and disgraceful petty jealousies that I have ever seen among
                            politicians professing to 
                        
                                    100

                             be men—school-boys would be belittled by
                            such work. I wrote very briefly to Mr. Randall hoping to have him meet me here for fuller
                            explanation, but I since learn that he cannot come.
                        I therefore risk putting on paper to you a part of what I wanted to say to
                            him—viz— The managing politicians of the Indiana school are deadly
                            hostile to Mr. English—some of them may be willing to lose the State, but they
                            all complain that Mr. E. has been so long out of the field, that he cannot successful[ ]y
                            handle the campaign—, and there seems to be a general misunderstanding regarding
                            the financial work. They supposed Mr. E. would look after this; he depends on your
                            Committee, and nothing is doing in the real work which is absolutely
                            essential to success. The G. B. [Greenback?] element is mad and in the market. The Radicals
                            are prepared for them. Negroes are running in every hour, [sic] Our people
                            are listening to speeches and singing songs, and our leaders & candidates are
                            wrangling about old sins and present jealousies. Your hurried visit there without seeing
                            certain prominent men is severely censured—the blame largely being put on Mr. E.
                        I express no opinion as to where the blame lies for all this trouble—but I do know that unless something is soon done to set things right the State is
                                lost to us.
                  
                        I think if you or Mr. Randall or Mr. Scott would see Mr. English after knowing what I have
                            written, the matter might be adjusted; but the leading men there do not agree with me. They
                            all profess to think that a meeting of your Extv. Com. [Executive Committee] is the only
                            remedy. I wrote to Mr. Ham briefly—but the worst had not then been developed. The
                            State Committee meeting on the 17th confirmed all the doubts started by individual
                                complaints.103
                  
                    
            
            Barnum sent this devastating analysis to English by a perceptive and reliable observer. The national
                    chairman admitted he was really overwhelmed with work; yet if needed in Indiana he would come. He
                    also mentioned the interesting fact that "Mr. Dorsey, the Secretary of the Republican
                    National Committee leaves here tomorrow to make 
                        Chicago
                     his headquarters until after your election in October."104
                    Three days later he informed English that General Hancock wanted Barnum to 
                        visit 
                                Chicago
                             on a matter he considers important & of which I will report you on my
                            return in your place…. I shall call on you the first of next week for
                            consultation about your state & I guess I will see all the grumblers so they will
                            not feel neglected. I must confer with you about this home stretch in your State.105

                     Barnum added further disparaging remarks about
                    "newspaper men clamoring for help" and about 
                        Franklin
                     Landers, the gubernatorial Democratic candidate, with whom he had had some experience
                    in 1876. This suggests that, although somewhat concerned, he thought the dissatisfaction was normal
                    and could be smoothed over with a visit and some kind words. A close examination of the evidence,
                    however, makes it plain that the leadership team of the Democracy was in uneasy harness. This did
                    not augur well for the political fortunes of a party soon to be challenged by the new techniques,
                    issues, and campaign tricks of a Republican party organization startled by its defeat in the 
                        Maine
                     state elections in early September, 1880.
            The Republican campaign for the Garfield-Arthur ticket in 1880 was slow in starting.108 The scars resulting from the defeat of the Stalwarts in their bid for a third term for
                    Grant, and the surprise nomination of the Half-Breed Garfield, who had seemingly deserted his 
                        Ohio
                     colleague John Sherman, had not been patched up by the nomination of Chester A. Arthur
                    for vice-president. The Conkling wing did practically nothing to help the ticket during the first
                    two months after the 
                        Chicago
                     convention in early June, 1880. Reluctantly on August 5 Garfield came to a meeting with
                    the New Yorkers at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. This conference, which Conkling did not attend although
                    his spokesmen did, produced the first "Treaty of Fifth Avenue," some eighty years
                    before the celebrated Nixon-Rockefeller "Treaty of Fifth Avenue" in July, 1960.
                    Down to mid-September the Republican strategy was based largely on the old sure-fire formula of
                    "waving the bloody shirt," along with some dabbling in miscellaneous lesser
                    issues, such as 
                        Hancock
                    's responsibility for the hanging of Mrs. Surratt, the supposed Roman
                    Catholicism of Mrs. Hancock, the Chinese exclusion policy, and Democratic inexperience in national
                        administration.107
            
            Despite some improvement after the Fifth Avenue meeting early in August, the Republican campaign
                    never really 
                  
                     106 An excellent summary of the course and pace of the Republican
                            campaign is to be found in Clancy, Presidential Election of 1880, pp.
                            167–205. Much of the account of Republican activities from August to November,
                            1880 is based on these pages.

                     got off the ground until the shock of the 
                        Maine
                     defeat in September, when a Democratic-Greenback fusion ticket registered astounding
                    victories. Immediately after this disaster the Republican organization sprang to life. The bloody
                    shirt was replaced by a crash program on the Democratic tariff plank.108
                    Speeches, editorials, posters, broadsides, and flyers of every description flooded such key areas as
                            
                  New England, New
                    York
               , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , and Indiana. Conkling and Grant set out for 
                        Ohio
                     and Levi P. Morton for Indiana. Grant proceeded to take back his previous nice words
                    about 
                        Hancock
                     and attempted to deny that the Democratic nominee was a man of action who could lead in
                    his own right.109 Money flowed from the pockets of businessmen, many of whom now
                    appeared on the platforms with the Republican speakers. The Democrats simply were unprepared for
                    combat in this new battle arena. They did not have enough leaders and speakers who were well versed
                    in the intricacies of the tariff. They were handicapped by the fact that many in their own ranks
                    were sympathetic to the general idea of protection. They did not have readily at hand adequate
                    answers to the new Republican tactic with its barrage of half-truths and twisted statistics.110
            
            Whether Stephen W. Dorsey did or did not march his repeaters to the polls in Indiana in 1880 and pay
                    then off in two-dollar bills, available evidence makes it seem probable that Indiana would have been
                    lost to the Democrats anyway. The serious divisions in the party leadership, the skillful attention
                    showered on both labor groups and Greenbackers by the Republicans, and the Democrats' lack
                    of flexibility in meeting Republican charges that all manufacturing interests would be irreparably
                    harmed by Democratic tariff policy, all undermined the favorable position of the Democrats in
                    Indiana in 1880. Just to add to Chairman English's difficulties the Republicans
                    "procured a complete list of the mortgages held by him in

                        Franklin
                     Landers, who was ill equipped for the task, was trapped into joint discussions with
                    Albert G. Porter, the Republican candidate for governor. Porter proceeded to demolish
                    Landers' pretensions to wisdom and statesmanship.112
            
            The Democrats were defeated in the October state elections by pluralities varying from forty-seven
                    hundred to seven thousand for the various candidates on the state ticket. George W. Julian wrote in
                    his journal that he was "perfectly stunned & dumbfounded with disappointment.
                    Universal gloom among democrats succeeded universal joy & exultant
                    confidence…." He favored his journal with these morning-after theories about the
                    causes of the defeat by commenting that 
                        the blunders are the following: 1. the nomination of English. 2. the nomination of Landers.
                            3. the failure to nominate De La Matr [sic] for Congress in this district.
                            4. the Supreme Court decision in bringing on the election in October in this State were all
                            stupid blunders & it is not strange that the combined effect has defeated our
                                ticket.113
                  
                    
            
            The sense of impending doom continued during the remaining four weeks of the campaign. The loss in
                    Indiana (and 
                        Ohio
                    ) in mid-October made it more difficult to sustain Democratic enthusiasm. The
                    Republicans, having found a winning formula in Indiana, continued to beat the drum on the tariff
                    issue. In November, 
                        Hancock
                     was defeated by a substantial majority in the electoral college although the total of
                    his popular vote was only eight thousand less than that of Garfield. This figure was the approximate
                    margin of the Garfield victory in Indiana. Once again the Democrats were denied the White House,
                    apparently not because of their program and principles but because of their tactical rigidity and
                    inability to unite in the common cause. In no state was this more dramatically illustrated than in
                    Indiana, where the varied political segments were not fused into a common mold. As might be
                    expected, Chairman English was selected as the whipping-boy for the defeat in Indiana. Sixteen

                     Senator Daniel W. Voorhees found himself misquoted by a

                    Commercial reporter on the question of who was responsible for the loss of the
                    1880 October election. He felt called upon to dispatch a letter hurriedly to William H. English in
                    which he reassured the chairman that 
                  
                     
                        I have none but feelings of friendship for you, and I thought during the canvass, and
                                    have thought since that you have been shamefully slandered. Of course as to the
                                    details of your management of the canvass I knew nothing at the time and have not
                                    sought to know since. My financial operations with the Central Committee consisted
                                    in drawing on you for $50 on two different occasions for the expenses of
                                    special trains to get to my appointments. You promptly honored them, and beyond the
                                    use of money thus obtained I know nothing of the pecuniary features of the canvass.
                        I do not believe we lost the State either by your name on the ticket or through your
                                    management as Chairman of the State Central Committee.
                        
                                    With great respect, I am
                                    Very truly your friend.
                                    D. W. Voorhees.114
                           
                                
                     
                  
               
            
            It is difficult to agree with Senator Voorhees' blanket endorsement of William H.
                    English's contribution to the 1880 campaign in Indiana. Undoubtedly mistakes were made and
                    opportunities missed, but the detailed survey of the operation of English and his central committee
                    contained in this study suggests that a final answer about the reasons for the Democratic defeat in
                    Indiana is not to be found in the devil theory of history. English had been absent from the firing
                    line of political conflict for two decades. Like many other Democratic public figures such as Samuel
                    J. Tilden, who had reached political maturity in the prewar years, he absorbed the political,
                    social, and constitutional views of that era. These were a blend of Jeffersonianism, Jacksonianism,
                    Southernism, states' rights, regionalism, and decentralization. The Civil War not only
                    destroyed the federal union as a concept and made obsolete many earlier political and constitutional
                    traditions and values, but it also set in motion a myriad of "national" trends and
                    goals. New economic policies and questions, great population expansion and diversity, and
                    technological changes in the economic bases of society emerged when William H. English was on the
                    political side

                     lines. True, he had participated in some of these altered
                    patterns of American life through his service as a banker, but his political education had not kept
                    pace with the implications of these changes for electioneering. All this was known when he was
                    nominated for the national ticket and elected as chairman of the state central committee. Because of
                    his national eminence, extensive eastern contacts, and fat pocketbook he was considered the
                    appropriate man to run the canvass. The fact that he ran an old-fashioned campaign should not have
                    surprised anyone. Nor can he be criticized for not listening to the new voices in the party. He was,
                    after all, a Bourbon holding the fort in a region being subjected to dynamic upheaval. His political
                    arena was a dichotomy of conflicting needs and aspirations. As such, the Indiana Democracy was a
                    perfect illustration of the party's contradictory weaknesses on the national scene in
                1880.

            With increasing frequency these days back-page stories in Indiana newspapers indicate that rail
                    service is to be discontinued on sections of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , the 
                        New York
                     Central, and the Monon–or that a few of the remaining giant corporations are
                    negotiating to bring about the ultimate in railroad consolidation.1 Most
                    Hoosiers who grew up before World War II can recall when railroads were somehow different, if not
                    more important, than they are now. Some may already be looking back nostalgically to days when the
                    steam locomotive and sleek diesel were dramatic symbols of commercial progress, or when a train ride
                    was the standard means for making a trip to 
                  Chicago,
                            New York
               , or 
                        Denver
                    . A moment's reflection will prompt the realization that these are but signs of
                    a new chapter in the railroad history of the state, and that, if it is not the concluding chapter,
                    certainly it is one falling near the close of a long and fascinating story.
            The phases of Indiana's 130 years of railroad history can be capsuled into a few simple
                    statements. From the late 1820's until around 1850 there was much talking
                    but not much building. From 1850 to the early 1870's the basic network
                    was established, very much along the lines projected by the earliest promoters. During the latter
                    decades of the past century, consolidation of major lines took place, and many branch and feeder
                    lines were built to supplement the basic network. Since World War I consolidation has continued
                    while the network has retrenched due to competition from other forms of transportation. With minor
                    modifications, this summary might be applied to the history of railroads in most of the states
                    between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. But such generalizations

                     ignore the unique and multitudinous steps which Indiana and
                    other states have pursued in fitting themselves into the nation's railroad pattern.
            The present study is concerned primarily with railroad developments in the state of Indiana during
                    the period 1850–1855 when, after a somewhat lengthy prelude, the rail network of the
                    state finally began to take shape. In a sense this presentation is a "progress
                    report" on a more ambitious research project designed to encompass the story of
                    Indiana's railroads from their origins to their current operations. Because of the
                    abbreviated scope of this report, developments preceding and following the first half decade of the
                    1850's have been dealt with in a cursory manner only; and although a judicious effort has
                    been made to base conclusions on defensible data, this study must naturally suffer from a lack of
                    perspective because of incompleted research. It is hoped, nevertheless, that what is presented here
                    will serve as a sample of the kind of study that railroad history in the state and nation gives rise
                    to and, in fact, demands.
            The decade of the 1850's began with little actual railroad construction accomplished in
                    Indiana. The eighty-six-mile connection between 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    —the state's pioneer railroad—had been in operation
                    between its terminal towns since 1847, but even this pre-1850 success had not come easily.2 The dream of a railroad between these points went back to the agitation of the
                    early 1830's when the Indiana General Assembly granted charters to mushrooming
                    "rail road" companies all over the state—even before anybody was sure
                    just what a "rail road" was.3 The 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad has deservedly received much attention

                                Indianapolis

                            had been placed in operation before 1851 through the auspices of the 
                                Madison

                            were acts passed by the Indiana General Assembly. They are, therefore, contained in the
                            formal compilation of Indiana laws. Hereafter, this source will be referred to as Laws, General Laws, or Special Laws, depending on the
                            portion of the legislative record in which the particular charter is located.
               
                     from Indiana's historians for its initial
                        achievements;4 but the fact that it required fifteen years for Indiana to
                    build its first operable railroad is certainly indicative of the times.
            There may be, on the other hand, a tendency to dismiss too lightly the period of the 1830's
                    and 1840's as a background for later construction. A study of the projected routes outlined
                    in the hundred or more separate railroad charters issued from 1832 to 1850 reveals that these
                    fragmentary lines, prompted largely by local interests, did make some sense when plotted on a
                    composite map of the state. Of the more than four thousand miles of railroad authorized in these
                    early charters, most lines were designed to connect geographic points which, in the perspective of
                    125 years ago, should have been connected. In fact, some of the routes were of such intrinsic
                    importance that companies to construct railroads over them were authorized again and again after
                    earlier charters became obsolete.6 The route from the Falls of the
                        Ohio River to Lake Michigan, over which the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad company eventually completed its road, was one which figured in many separate
                    pre-1850 charters.6 Another route was that of the Buffalo and 
                        Mississippi
                     (later

                                Indianapolis
                             Railroad's achievements are duly mentioned in most general histories
                            of the state of Indiana and in several articles dealing with early transportation
                            developments in the state. For an example of the latter see George S. Cottman,

                     5 The mileage total is the writer's own estimate based on
                            study of the routes authorized in the charters. Although many of the points to be connected
                            by the proposed roads were at the time only villages, it would have been impossible to
                            predict with certainty in the 1830's and 1840's which of them might
                            eventually become key urban centers.

                            "rail-road" from 
                                New Albany

                            or "McAdamized Turnpike" was authorized between 
                                Jeffersonville

                            a charter was granted residents of 
                                Montgomery County
                             to build a railroad from 
                                Crawfordsville
                             to 
                                Lafayette
                            ; it was re-granted the following year, "revived" in 1848, and
                            amended in 1851 to include an extension south to 
                                Greencastle

                            515. Another significant charter amendment relating to this route was that granted to the 
                                New Albany
                             and 
                                Salem
                             company in 1848 which gave its officers the "right and power to extend
                            their work or road to any other point or points, than those indicated
               
                     the Northern Indiana) Railroad company; it meandered over the
                    northern tier of counties toward 
                        Chicago
                    , sending its projected tributaries in all directions to catch infant villages along the
                        way.7 Still other routes consistently regarded as important were those from 
                        Evansville
                     to 
                        Terre Haute

                        Richmond

                        Terre Haute
                    , from 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , from Peru to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , from 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and from the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls area to 
                        Indianapolis
                    .8 Once railroad building began in earnest in the early
                    1850's, these routes were among the first started.
            The general assembly was usually quite lenient in the time it allotted companies to complete their
                    roads, but legislative authority alone was not enough to get them built.9 In
                    many instances in which a company was little more than a flare-up of "rail fever,"
                    the project normally died soon. Apparently this was the fate of such unbuilt roads as the Levenworth
                        [sic] and 
                        Bloomington
                     (1834), the 
                        Charlestown
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     (1835), the Perrysville and 
                        Danville
                     (1836), and perhaps 40 per cent of all those chartered in the 1830's and
                        1840's.10 It is impossible to determine how many other companies
                        
                  by the location heretofore made by authority of the state…." Ibid. (1847–1848), 456–457. As noted by Professor
                            Logan Esarey, there is some question as to the exact charter authority under which the 
                                New Albany
                             and 
                                Salem

                     panies were stillborn before they even reached the charter
                    stage, but it is likely that at one time or another through the thirties and forties almost every
                    settlement in the state at least dreamed of an all-important rail connection.
            Stripped of certain emotional overtones which accompanied the formation of the early railroad
                    projects, the problem the planners and promoters tried to solve with their schemes was an economic
                    one. Paraphrased in a single word, it was markets. They wanted means to dispose of
                    their surplus commodities and facilities to obtain products their own economy was not advanced
                    enough to provide. In simplest terms, this meant they must somehow attach their locality to a point
                    or points where the advantageous exchange could take place. When the railroad fever first hit the
                    Hoosier State, waterways were the accepted mode of transporting bulky materials over long distances.
                    The initial purpose of the railroad was to supplement the waterway system.11
                    Since the state's population was weighted toward the Ohio River,12 towns along its banks had a strong priority as terminals for the earliest
                    chartered roads. Of the hundred or so authorized before 1850, twenty-five were to have points on the 
                        Ohio
                     as one of their terminals. Almost this many more were to touch the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal, while others were to tie in the northern portion of the state with the
                    natural waterway supplied by the Great Lakes. A few of the more ambitious routes, most notably the
                    one to be followed by the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad, attempted to link all three of these east-west waterways.13
            
            If it had not been for the establishment of the state's capital near the geographic center
                    of the state, this plan of using railroads chiefly as a means of linking waterways probably would
                    have prevailed somewhat longer. The location of the capital town itself came to be an important
                    factor in railroad planning. To plan a railroad of any significant

                     length and not somehow have it reach the promising capital
                    became almost infeasible. Though by 1850 
                        Indianapolis
                     was little more than the political center of the state—noticeably behind
                            
                  Madison, New
                        Albany
               , and other communities in industrial advancement—this
                    town was ideally situated for the kind of transportation revolution now beginning.14 It served as a magnet to draw to a central point what otherwise might have been dangling
                    lines. The foresight, promotion, and sheer good luck which combined to create 
                        Indianapolis
                     into the rail hub of the state make up one of the intriguing stories in
                    Indiana's history.
            By the close of the 1840's Indiana was recognized as a valuable hinterland for any
                    established marketing center which could arrange to tap it. The larger Ohio
                    River towns, and some of the not-so-large ones, early visualized themselves in this
                    highly profitable role. Promoters in 
                  Evansville,
                            New Albany, Jeffersonville
               , and 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     consciously or unconsciously worked toward this end. 
                        Madison
                    , having the first success in getting a railroad into the interior, actually came
                    closest of the river towns to being a regional distribution center.15
                    Ultimately, however, it was larger, out-of-state cities which exerted the real gravitational pull: 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        Louisville
                     to the southeast; 
                        Cleveland
                     and 
                        Toledo
                     to the northeast; and the phenomenal 
                        Chicago
                     to the northwest. There may have been an awareness on the part of Indiana's
                    early railroad promoters that anything they might accomplish would eventually fall as gain to
                    commercial interests in distant cities, but there is little to indicate that by the early
                    1850's they were seriously disturbed about it.
            Although there was no sharp break between rail developments of the late 1840's and those of
                    the beginning 1850's, the new decade did promise certain advantages over the previous
                    period. The state had gotten over most of the financial shock resulting from the internal
                    improvements fiaso of the late thirties, and relatively prosperous times

                            been adequately explored, but as early as 1907 one writer pointed out the competition among
                            the Ohio River communities for supremacy. See Cottman, Indiana Magazine of History, III (December, 1907), 155.
               
                     were back again. Along with a large increase in the
                    state's population there had undoubtedly been a commensurate increase in property values
                    and investment capital.16 Also, managerial and technical talent had no doubt
                    evolved as a result of the trial-and-error experiences of the recent past. Still another important
                    stimulant was the example of the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad. Its success proved that railroads could be built and operated in Indiana;
                    here was the encouragement needed to goad planners of other roads into action.
            At the beginning of the 1850's many earlier charters were still legally in effect, but no
                    more than ten of the companies authorized to construct railroads showed serious inclinations to
                    start building.17 These companies were surveying their routes and attempting to
                    accumulate sufficient funds to begin construction. At least two of the railroads were at the
                    track-laying state; before the year 1850 closed, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Bellefontaine Railroad company laid down twenty-eight miles of track between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Pendleton, and the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     completed its track thirty-five miles to 
                        Salem
                    .18
            
            The year 1851 brought further proof that the building era of Indiana's railroads had
                    arrived. The vigorous 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad company almost completed trackage over its seventy-three-mile route within
                    this single year; the Northern Indiana Railroad company opened a twenty-five-mile stretch from the 
                        Michigan
                     state line, near 
                  
                     16 Indiana's population in 1840 was 685,866; in 1850,
                            988,416— an increase of over 40 per cent. See U.S., Census Office, Seventh Census of the

                     17 Among the many charters legally in effect were those providing
                            railroads between Pendleton and 
                        Indianapolis, Rockville

                                Madison

                        South Bend

                        Salem
                     to the village of Orleans.19 Two other companies began laying
                    track; the Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     had the twenty-one-mile section from

                     to 
                        Noblesville

                    , completed twenty-seven miles of track to Vienna, in Scott County, before the
                    year's end.20
            
            The following three years (1852, 1853, 1854) showed the same kind of tangible results. Early in 1852
                    the Northern Indiana company joined with the 
                        Michigan
                     Southern Railroad company to open a route curving through the northwestern corner of
                    the state into 
                        Chicago
                    . During 1852 the 
                        Lafayette
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     company, blessed with ideal terrain, built its entire seventy-three-mile line, and by
                    the close of the year the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     company had finished its road to 
                        Columbus
                     and added an eleven-mile section to Edinburg. Meanwhile, the twenty-five-mile
                    Martinsville and 
                        Franklin
                     Railroad was opened for business in November.21
            
            In January 1853 the 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Bellefontaine company celebrated the opening of its track to Union (now 
                        Union City
                    ) on the Indiana-
                        Ohio
                     state line and joined with finished roads in the neighboring state to give Indiana its
                    first rail link to major cities on the eastern seaboard. The Indiana Central Railroad company opened
                    its line from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Richmond
                     in the fall of 1853; and a few weeks later, after more than two decades of false
                    starts, the Lawrenceburgh and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad company finally got its road completed between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and

                            period. Established as a weekly, it also appeared as a bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and daily. At

                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis

                     company, another feeder line was completed in December in southern Indiana; this was

                     Railroad, longest of all the pioneer roads, moved forward methodically and completed
                    its 288-mile route across the state from 
                        New Albany
                     to 
                        Michigan City
                     by the middle of 1854, thus realizing the dreams of early promoters to tie by rail the
                        Ohio River and Lake Michigan. During 1854 two other
                    companies managed to open service between key terminal points; the Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     did this in the spring, and the 
                        Evansville

                        Illinois

            Also during the same three-year period other important lines were either in the advanced planning or
                    early construction stage. These were: the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi

                     (actually a segment of the 
                        Baltimore
                     to 
                        St. Louis
                     trunk system); the

                        Chicago
                    , which was to join the rail complex in western 
                        Ohio
                     to roads converging on 
                        Chicago
                    ; and the Lake Erie, 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        St. Louis
                     (known later as the "
                        Wabash
                    "), destined to run from 
                        Fort Wayne
                     along the 
                        Wabash
                     Valley into 
                        Illinois
                    .24 These roads, all designed to span the state from east to west,
                    would eventually comprise a significant part of Indiana's rail network, but their
                    completion did not occur until some months after the period directly considered in this report.

            A tightened money market caused a temporary slackening of the building pace immediately after 1854,
                    but not before Indiana had taken fifth place among the states of the Union in completed railroad
                    mileage. The table below shows Indiana's relative position as of January, 1855:
            
               
                  25 This table is based on the writer's survey of the railroads
                        completed by January, 1855. Data was obtained from issues of the Indiana
                        Journal, 1850–1855. In some cases the mileage of individual roads is an
                        estimate.

            No systematic study has yet been made of the eighteen completed roads' financial statements,
                    but fragmentary evidence indicates that the average cost per mile was well over
                        $15,000.27 This includes the costs of right of way, surveying,
                    preparing the roadbed, rolling stock, and station facilities. Therefore, a conservative estimate of
                    the investment in Indiana's completed roads by 1855 is more than
                    $21,000,000—roughly twice the estimated cost of the whole projected internal
                    improvements system of the 1830's and 1840's.28 Some
                    companies, such as the 
                        Lafayette
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    , had little difficulty in preparing a roadbed and thereby cut initial engineering costs
                    to a minimum. Other roads, confronted with rough terrain and numerous streams

                     to bridge, were obliged to spend considerably more. Obtaining
                    sufficient capital to finish a road once construction began was a sore problem with several of the
                    roads. Others arranged adequate financing of the entire line before beginning construction.
            No really standard procedure was followed in raising the necessary funds to construct these railroads
                    of the early 1850's, but certain common features did prevail. Usually the charter specified
                    the amount for which the road could be capitalized; depending on its length this might vary from
                    $150,000 to more than $1,000,000.29 Since the charters
                    governing the roads constructed in the 1850–1855 period had been issued some years
                    before, when practical information on costs was unavailable, the capitalizations specified in these
                    charters obviously were little more than guesses. On the other hand, increases in capitalization
                    were apparently obtained with ease.30 From evidence thus far studied, it appears
                    that the capital to be raised by selling stock in a new company was intended to cover about 50 per
                    cent of the railroad's total cost. The other half was to be procured from the sale of
                    bonds, frequently with an interest rate as high as 10 per cent.31
            
            A "typical" case of the procedure followed in planning and building one of the
                    early Indiana railroads might be depicted as follows.32 A number of persons in a
                    region of the state decided that they should have a railroad. A mass meeting was then held in a
                    courthouse where articles of association were drawn up, the more affluent or vocal members of the
                    area were designated officers of the company, and an application for a charter was forwarded to the
                    state government. The charter, running anywhere from a few summary statements to several dozen
                    paragraphs, included information 
                  
                     29 Authorized capitalization for the Martinsville and

                             $200,000, for the Peru and 
                                Indianapolis

                    capitalization, gauge of track, permissible arrangements with other railroad companies, and
                    directors of the newly formed corporation.
            Once the charter was approved, solicitation began for the sale of stock. This was one of the crucial
                    phases in the destiny of the new company, for if officials failed to sell enough initial stock to
                    build up momentum for their enterprise, the venture halted right there. A strong appeal was made to
                    residents at all points along the proposed line to purchase or to make pledges for stock. In
                    exchange for stock certificates the buyer might give cash, real estate, equipment of various sorts,
                    or his promise to contribute so many days labor. When enough stock was thus distributed to indicate
                    to officials that the project was likely to succeed, the president and his agents began their
                    campaign to sell bonds to larger investors, usually at an attractive discount, and a man was
                    selected to supervise the engineering. Hereafter the president spent much of his time in eastern
                    commercial capitals peddling bonds and seeking bargains on rails and other needed equipment. This
                    was another crucial point in the affairs of the project. If times were good and the president could
                    make a convincing case for his railroad, money from the sale of bonds poured in and the road was
                    brought to completion with a minimum of delay; if times were bad and money tight, the project slowed
                    up or was indefinitely postponed.
            The eighty-four-mile Bellefontaine line (
                        Indianapolis
                     to Union) may serve as an example of railroad financing in the 1850's.33 The road's 1848 charter authorized a capitalization of
                    $1,000,000 with a stipulation that this amount might be increased at the pleasure of the
                    company. The line was completed early in 1853 at a reported cost of about $1,300,000. A
                    little over half of this initial indebtedness was in the form of stock; the remainder was divided
                    between 7 per cent foreign bonds and 10 per cent domestic bonds. During its first six months of
                    operation (July-December, 1853), the Bellefontaine had gross earnings of $118,000. Almost
                    $40,000 of this amount went for running expenses, $27,000 for paying interest
                    on bonds, and $31,000 for paying 4 per cent dividends 
                  
                     33

                     on stock; a little less than $20,000 was designated
                    as "surplus." Since the Bellefontaine's connections were excellent,
                    earnings could be expected to increase dramatically within the next few years. In the case of other
                    roads not so favorably located, the margin of surplus profits left little for maintenance,
                    improvements, and removal of bonded indebtedness.
            Income for the completed or partially completed roads consisted of receipts from the transport of
                    passengers, freight, mail, and baggage.34 To encourage further investment in
                    their enterprises, officials of some companies regularly publicized their income figures. When
                    viewed cautiously, such data does give some insight into the roads' financial condition
                    during their first months of operation. Company reports show that when completed between terminal
                    points the Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     immediately grossed about $12,000 per month, the Bellefontaine over
                    $19,000, and the Lawrence-burgh and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     about $20,000.35 Gross receipts normally increased
                    during the first full year of operation; the Lawrenceburgh company, for example, in March of 1855
                    reported monthly receipts of $33,275—25 per cent greater than those reported
                    by the well-established 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     road a few months earlier. The Northern Indiana company, which had a valuable
                    connection with 
                        Chicago
                    , reported gross monthly receipts of $116,000 at the close of its first
                        year.36 Most companies declared liberal dividends to stockholders based on
                    the so-called "surplus" accrued during the first months' service.
                    Dividends of 4 to 6 per cent were usually granted in the form of bonds or additional stock in the
                        corporation.37
            
            There was fluctuation in passenger fares as competition began to develop among some of the lines but
                    fares averaged about 2½ to 3½¢ per mile.38 From
                    the beginning of operations, passenger traffic on most roads was as heavy as could be accomodated
                    with the available equipment. While the Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     ran trains only the twenty-one-mile distance between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Noblesville
                     it transported almost

                     fifteen hundred passengers a month.39 When
                    in full operation between their terminal points most of the companies ran an
                    "express" and an "accomodation," i.e., local, train each way
                    daily. By 1854 the 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     road was carrying as many as five passenger cars on its trains, and the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     line was transporting about three hundred passengers in six cars on some of its trips
                    to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In the spring of 1855 the Northern Indiana road was reported to have run a record
                    train of thirty-eight cars and twenty-two thousand passengers.40 The 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad, in spite of the growing competition of other roads, carried twenty-eight
                    thousand more passengers in 1852 than it had during the previous year.41
            
            As connections were provided at 
                        Indianapolis
                     with other lines, most of the roads ran an early morning train to reach the capital
                    before noon and another one to return the traveler to his point of origin by suppertime.42 Frequent delays, many of them resulting from minor accidents, sometimes
                    prevented trains from arriving on schedule, but most managed to follow their timetables fairly
                    consistently. The failure to do so became increasingly serious as opportunity for diverse
                    connections developed at 
                        Indianapolis
                     and other junction points.
            By 1855 the combined rail and water accomodations were becoming so plentiful that a prospective
                    traveler might be faced with the decision of just which route to follow. From 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                     he could take the Bellefontaine northwest to Union and there get a connection to the
                    southeast; he could take the Lawrenceburgh and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     road to the town of 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     and transfer to an upriver steamer; or he could choose the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     road and make his steamboat connection at the town of 
                        Madison
                    .43 For a trip to 
                        Louisville
                     he had the choice of the direct 
                        Jeffersonville
                     road or the combined rail-water route using the 
                        Madison
                     and

                             Railroad between Edinburg and 
                                Indianapolis

                        Cleveland
                     or other eastern cities he would probably prefer the Bellefontaine, but he could also
                    take the Indiana Central, via 
                        Richmond
                    , to make connections in 
                        Dayton
                    . To 
                        Chicago
                     his best choice was a route over the 
                        Lafayette
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                    , and the 
                        Michigan
                     Central roads; but he could catch a Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     train to the 
                        Wabash
                     Canal and travel to 
                        Lafayette
                     for a rail connection. To the west his rail accomodations were limited to the 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but from 
                        Terre Haute
                     the Ohio River could be reached over the 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     Railroad or by Wabash River steamer. Most of the alternatives were
                    duly advertised, and even the more remote ones possibly had appeal to the leisurely, contemplative
                        traveler.45 Actually this diversity of routes had more practical meaning to
                    shippers of freight, especially when the longer routes were made attractive by competitive rates.
            Approximately half of the gross receipts of most early Indiana railroads came from the transport of
                        freight.46 Freight rates were so flexible during this period that no
                    accurate estimate on charges as they applied to various commodities can yet be given, but
                    considerable data exists about the types and quantities of freight carried on several of the roads.
                    During the months when a road was running only to the nearest town to which track had been laid
                    down, the usual pattern was a flow of farm commodities from the smaller terminal to the larger and a
                    simultaneous flow of finished goods from the larger to the smaller. For example, during a three
                    months' period when the Peru road was operating only between 
                        Noblesville
                     and 
                  Indianapolis, Noblesville
                shipped southward to 
                        Indianapolis
                     1,000 barrels of flour, 218 barrels of eggs, and over 21,000 pounds of bacon; in turn 
                        Indianapolis
                     shipped northward 25 plows, 126 barrels of salt, 36 kegs of powder, and 20,000 feet of
                        lumber.47 This pattern was soon altered if the rural terminal became a
                    junction point for one or more other roads. It then served as a trans-shipment center where all
                    kinds of goods from a wider 
                  
                     45 For typical items publicizing various rail routes see ibid., May 5, 17, 18, October 28, November 9, December 12, 1853, February 1, 1854.

                            exceptions: for example, the Bellefontaine company reported for the latter six months of
                            1853 $38,790.90 in passenger receipts and $73,398.85 in freight. See
                                ibid., January 27, 1854.

                     region were accumulated for shipment to more distant
                        markets.48
            
            Although corn and wheat were among the most important items of freight transported by the Indiana
                    railroads to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and other eastern cities, hogs were probably the most important single commodity.49 During the weeks of late fall and early winter carload after carload of
                    "porkers" was gathered from outlying areas and sent to the slaughtering centers.
                    In the early 1850's the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     road probably carried the bulk of this traffic, transporting as many as thirty or forty
                    loads in a single day, but the 
                        Lafayette
                    , the Bellefontaine, and the Lawrenceburgh lines also had their share.50 Some of the longest and most heavily loaded freight trains during these years were those
                    carrying rails and other building equipment for roads under construction.51
                    Again this was the type of business from which the 
                        Madison
                     road benefited greatly, since its southern terminus was a principal landing point for
                    heavy river shipments from both east and west. But in the long run the 
                        Madison
                     road paid dearly for helping to supply its future competitors.
            When Indiana actually got around to building railroads, many of the false notions associated with
                    roadbeds and track had become less current.52 But, nevertheless, some of the
                    track laid down on Indiana roads was the outmoded "flat-bar" rail, i.e., a wooden
                    base covered with bar iron. The 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad company used this type of rail from 
                        Madison
                     to Vernon until replaced by "compound" rail in 1853; the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     used flat-bar rail over the southern portion of its route and some of the early feeder
                    lines over their entire length.53 Because of the relative 
                  
                     48
                            
                                Greencastle
                            , at the junction of the 
                                Terre Haute
                             and 
                                Indianapolis
                             and the 
                                New Albany
                             and 
                                Salem
                             roads, was such a clearing point. In one instance, 15,000–20,000
                            barrels of pork accumulated there for eventual shipment to 
                                New York
                             via 
                                Lafayette
                             and

                     52 One of these was the belief that by using locally available
                            materials a railroad could be built for as little as $2,000 per mile. For
                            example, see ibid., February 2, 1831.

                            "compound" rail was possibly of solid wrought-iron construction. For a
                            description of some of the rails used during this period see Emory R. Johnson and Thurman W.

                     cheapness of this kind of rail, the Peru and 
                        Indianapolis
                     company tried it up to 
                        Noblesville
                     but was obliged to complete the remaining portion with the more serviceable
                        "T-rail."54
            
            The expense of the T-rail probably did as much as any single factor to slow down railroad building in
                    Indiana during this period. The Lawrenceburgh and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     company paid between $38 and $40 a ton for its T-rail, and by the
                    time the line was finished officials claimed that the value of the rail had almost doubled on the
                    world market.55 A mile of T-rail track cost around
                    $6,000—about one-third of the entire construction cost, including all the
                    other construction equipment, the right of way, rolling stock, and labor.56 Much
                    of the T-rail used on Indiana roads in the 1850's was manufactured in 
                        Wales
                     and shipped to the 
                        United States
                     via 
                        New York
                     or 
                        New Orleans
                    .57 The further shipment of this extremely heavy material to the
                    locality where it was to be laid down was costly and time consuming. Delays in receiving it were
                    often given as the cause for failure to abide by projected building schedules.58
            
            Although track gauge was an important factor in the railroad rivalry that developed in eastern areas,
                    it was relatively unimportant among the early Indiana roads.59 Most of the track
                    laid in Indiana adhered to what by the 1850's was considered standard gauge, i.e., 4 foot,
                    8½ inches. Exceptions to this were the 6-foot, or "Erie," gauge used by
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     company in its proposed 160-mile road across southern Indiana, and the 4-foot-10-inch,
                    or "
                        Ohio
                    ," gauge which was later (1854) adopted by the Bellefontaine line from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to Union.60 Since the Bellefontaine road was really an extension of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     rail network into the state of Indiana, officials of this company found it expedient

                        Ohio
                     standard.61 Only a segment of the 6-foot track of the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     had been completed in 1855, so this drastic gauge difference did not cause much trouble
                    until later. Early in 1854 the Lawrenceburgh and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     company worked out an arrangement with officials of the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     whereby a third rail was laid down between 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The Lawrenceburgh company trains were permitted to use this entry into the

                     by sharing one-fifth of their through-traffic receipts with the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     company.62
            
            Initial rolling stock for the railroads was procured by officials of the companies soon after
                    construction began. At least one locomotive and several flatcars and gravel cars were required to
                    carry building materials over the finished portion of the road to the building point. Additional
                    engines and cars were ordered when the road approached the operational stage.63
                    As the Lawrenceburgh company prepared to open its through line, officials reported rolling stock
                    valued at $134,053, including 7 engines, 79 gravel cars, 25 boxcars, 44
                    "platform" (flat) cars, and only 2 passenger cars. Eight more engines, 100
                    boxcars, and 5 new passenger cars had also been ordered.64 A few months before
                    the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     opened its 288-mile line, it owned 23 locomotives.65
            
            Most of the rolling stock used on the Indiana roads of the early 1850's was probably of the
                    standard types amply described by Seymour Dunbar and others.66 Locomotives were
                    chiefly of eastern manufacture, most of them having been built in 
                        Boston
                     or 
                        Philadelphia
                    .67 Once received they were given appropriate names, usually that of
                    a company official, a swift animal, or one of the localities along the route; for example, the
                    Indiana Central road had the Samuel Hannah

               68 Many of the passenger cars for the
                    early roads were manufactured in either 
                        Dayton
                     or 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               .69 They were invariably introduced
                    by the press as being "splendid" in appearance, but little additional information
                    was supplied. The capacity was about fifty. Since most trains usually carried only a few passenger
                    cars on a regular run, many travelers were obliged to take seats on other cars.70 Boxcars and platform cars, which made up the bulk of the rolling stock for most of the
                    roads, were crude and rather nondescript. They were sufficiently simple in design that on occasion
                    they could be constructed at the railroad's own shops.71
            
            By 1855 most completed roads had telegraph service extended along their routes, but it is not clear
                    from available reports just what this facility contributed to the operation of the railroads.72 Most companies also were granted contracts for carrying mail over the area of
                    their routes.73 Although mail was thus speeded to distant points, postal service
                    to smaller communities which had been regular stops on stage lines was sometimes slowed.74 Express service, operated principally by the Adams Company, became an
                    important adjunct of the railroads. Express cars were included in some of the larger trains, and the
                    company's agents were kept busy transferring more valuable freight at important
                        junctions.75
            
            Confining the account of railroad developments to a description of track laying and scheduled train
                    service would seriously distort the history of Indiana's early railroad building. The
                    classic iceberg example is certainly applicable here, for what is concealed below the surface may be
                    immeasurably more important than what is visible; for example,

                     the number of railroad proposals of the early 1850's
                    almost defies enumeration. Distinguishing between projects which were more and those which were less
                    serious in intent requires the utmost vigilance from the later investigator. Just about everybody
                    wanted to build railroads whether the building made sense or not. "There seems to be a kind
                    of Railroad mania abroad," remarked the editor of the Indiana Journal in
                    the spring of 1853. "In almost every newspaper within our own and adjoining States, we find
                    some new Road projected. The last one is from 
                        Covington
                     through Pinhook to 
                        Lafayette
                    ! There are at least a dozen talked of from the Atlantic to the Pacific."76
            
            As yet no attempt has been made in the present study to determine precisely how many separate
                    companies were chartered in the 1850's to build railroads in Indiana, but a day by day
                    survey of the Indiana Journal reveals scores of newly projected roads. A
                    conservative estimate of their proposed mileage would be over thirty-five hundred—more
                    than double the amount of track laid during the 1850–1855 period. The peak of railroad
                    optimism and agitation was reached in 1853; during this year alone at least twenty-five new roads,
                    with a total distance of over seventeen hundred miles, occasioned some degree of discussion or
                        action.77 If all the railroads created on paper had materialized, the cost
                    for the times would have been astronomical. The more seriousminded planners, faced with the
                    prospects of a tightening money market, began to realize this, and there was a sharp decline in new
                    proposals during the latter months of 1854 and on into 1855. "Railroad talk"
                    certainly continued, but it came to center upon a few favored projects, most notably the 
                        Evansville
                     Straight Line Railroad, promoted as Indiana's link in the vital transportation
                    chain binding the South to the Union.78
            
            A report of this limited scope is likely to raise far more questions than it
                    settles—questions which will require much systematic research and study before really
                    acceptable answers can be given. Who, for example, were the "promoters"

                     of these early railroads? What did they stand to gain
                    personally from their promotional efforts? What was the relation between railroad building and
                    politics? Did the state government through its legislation aid and abet worthless schemes, or did it
                    maintain an official neutrality which encouraged restraint? What influence did local legislators and
                    lobbyists have in procuring elastic charters and other favored treatment for their projects? To what
                    degree did the rail pattern as it was being established in the 1850's determine the
                    population distribution in the state? How much was the growing urban rivalry a cause and how much an
                    effect of the creation of Indiana's railroads? What role did the land speculator and his
                    "paper towns" play in these developments? Were the farmer and other small
                    investors actually victimized when their devaluated stock slipped from their hands? By what
                    intricate processes of higher finance was local control of these railroads eventually removed? Were
                    investors in eastern cities who accumulated Indiana railroad securities at a bargain price taking
                    undue advantage of western naivete? To what extent, if any, was railroad building in Indiana one
                    great bunko game?
            Answers to these and other basic questions will require not only mountains of factual material but
                    also a genuine insight into the economic and cultural conditions which governed this period of a
                    hundred years ago. That the project may be beyond the time and physical capabilities of an
                    individual scholar is already apparent. But, by the grace of Clio, the project will be continued,
                    and with a demonstration of that same perseverance which characterized some of the pioneer railroad
                    builders, Indiana's railroad story will eventually be told.

                        Indianapolis
                     was the first institution of higher learning among the Christian churches (Disciples of
                    Christ) to originate by action within the ecclesiastical structure of the denomination. Known as
                    North Western Christian University for many years, it came into existence through the concerted
                    effort of the Christian churches of Indiana. This religious body was fairly well established in the
                    state by 1847, when the idea of a college was conceived. If the only known printed statistics are
                    correct, there were some 300 churches with 19,914 members at the time. A church publication lists
                    130 preachers, but most of these were preaching laymen and not settled pastors.1
            
            The denomination began in Indiana through the merging of dissident factions of Regular, Freewill, and
                    German Baptist (Dunkard) congregations into the 
                        Campbell
                     movement, which had its beginnings in western 
                        Virginia
                     and northern 
                        Ohio
                    , and the Stone movement, which had its origin primarily with former Presbyterian
                    congregations in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Since Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone had similar objectives and a common
                    program and since representatives from both groups had made a declaration of formal union at
                            
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , in 1832, it was natural that these two
                    "frontier" religious bodies should join forces in Indiana. Stone's
                    followers were called Christians and their churches, Christian churches. Campbell's
                    followers were called Reformers and Disciples. The name "Disciples of Christ" was
                    preferred by 
                        Campbell
                     to designate his movement. In Indiana, churches originating from both groups took the
                    name, "Christian churches."
            There was little or no organized structure within the denomination at first, simply independent
                    congregations holding

                     similar theological views. Eventually some of these
                    congregations became associated in what they called "cooperations," two or three
                    churches sharing one minister or alternating the use of meetinghouses for the convenience of members
                    who found travel difficult and at times almost impossible.2

                    K. Harris acted as secretary. The meeting was of little importance except as the first meeting of
                    its kind among Indiana Christian church members. Minutes of the meeting were sent to Alexander
                    Campbell at 
                        Bethany
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , for publication in his periodical, the Millennial Harbinger (August,
                    1839). Included was a list of churches represented at the meeting and estimated membership
                    statistics. Several recommendations were passed at this meeting, but they were in no way considered
                    to be binding on the congregations. Similar meetings were subsequently held annually and became
                    known as state meetings, though occasionally they were called conventions. The Indiana Christian
                    Home Missionary Society was formed in 1849 with organizational machinery working within the
                    framework of a constitution. Because of the fear of ecclesiasticism on the part of many, the
                    missionary society was suspended in 1853. The society's supporters agreed to this action on
                    the basis that the state meetings would assume more responsibility and organize with a board of
                        officers.3
            
            A number of religious periodicals were published for the Christian church constituency in Indiana in
                    the early days of the movement. Nathaniel Field and Beverly James edited the Christian
                        Review at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     in the early 1830's. During 1840–1841, Field edited the Journal of Christianity at the same place. This was apparently superseded by the
                        Israelite in the early 1840's, with the same editor and published at
                    the same place. John O'Kane was responsible for the Christian Casket,
                    published at 
                        Connersville
                     in 1833, and Daniel Cox started the Primitive Christian at 
                        Vincennes
                     around 1845.

                        Mishawaka
                     by P. P. Russell in 1847. These journals were suspended after a few issues because of
                    lack of support.
            The Christian Record, the Western Reformer, and the Millennial Harbinger, religious periodicals under able editorship and covering longer
                    periods of time, are primary sources of early Indiana Christian church history and for this reason
                    are of value in discovering the early history of 
                        Butler
                     University. For the most part, minutes of interchurch and county
                    "co-operations," districts, and early state meetings are no longer in existence
                    and are known only through these periodicals.4
            
            James M. Mathes, sometimes assisted by Elijah Goodwin, published the Christian
                    Record. This monthly journal served in a quasi-official capacity as a means of exchanging views
                    on religious matters and reporting the activities of the brethren. It was published at 
                        Bloomington
                    , 1843–1851, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1851–1855, and moved to 
                        Bedford
                     in 1855. Benjamin Franklin published his Reformer at 
                        Centerville
                     in 1845 and changed the name to Western Reformer when he moved his
                    headquarters to 
                        Milton

                        Virginia
                    , beginning in 1830 and extending far beyond the period under consideration, has a
                    thorough coverage of Indiana Christian church news.5
            
            In the days before North Western Christian University was opened, Indiana had several academies which
                    were organized and maintained on the initiative of persons who were members of the Christian church.
                    These were privately owned and operated, but because the leadership centered around strong Christian
                    church personalities the brethren had a tendency to look upon them as their own. Among these schools
                    were 
                        Wayne County
                     Seminary at

                        are repeated within each new series, only month and year of issues are cited in this article.

            Though the denomination was very loosely structured in Indiana at the time (1839–1847),
                    Indiana was still ahead of other states in this respect. Numerically, the Christian church was
                    second only to the Methodist church and was represented by an unusually large number of religious
                    periodicals. In spite of this fact, there was no institution of higher learning on the college
                    level. Writing of this, Benjamin Franklin declared: 
                        The brotherhood as a whole or as a body, cannot, up to this day, say we have a
                                college. Nor can they as a brotherhood, in any state, say, we have a
                                college. As a body, they have never decided one question in relation to an
                            institution of that kind. Nor have the brethren in any state ever acted upon, or decided any
                            question respecting a college.7
                  
                    
            
            Certain citizens in Lawrence County appear to have been the first to propose that the denomination be
                    responsible for establishing a school of higher learning. According to available sources of
                    information, some time in the summer of 1847, Elijah Goodwin and James M. Mathes, then co-editors of
                    the Christian Record, held a preaching mission at 
                        Bedford
                    . At the conclusion of their engagement they were approached by 
                        Milton
                     Short and W. Malot (sometimes spelled Mallott or Mallat) of that community with a
                    proposal concerning establishing a college under the auspices of the Christian church denomination.
                    It seems that prior to this time Lawrence County citizens had raised $10,000 in
                    subscriptions to found a church college and preferred it to be under the patronage of the Christian
                    church. Goodwin and Mathes were impressed with the proposition, and after talking it over they
                    promised to publicize the matter in forthcoming issues of the Christian Record and
                    present it at the next state meeting to be held at 
                        Greensburg
                     in October, 1847.8
            
            The college question was the second major item of business considered at the 
                        Greensburg
                     state meeting. According to minutes published in the Christian
                    Record, the Lawrence County proposal was based on the condition that the school be located at 
                        Bedford
                    . Representatives from

                     8 Goodwin and Mathes did not follow through on publicizing this offer
                            in the Christian Record, but apparently they did present it at the 
                                Greensburg
                             meeting. The story of the meeting of Goodwin and Mathes with the two Lawrence
                            County men at 
                                Bedford
                             appears in James M. Mathes, Life of Elijah Goodwin: The Pioneer

                                St. Louis

                     made a similar proposal with the idea of locating the school at 
                        Farmington
                     but had taken no steps to give it financial support.9
            
            The convention, after thorough discussion, finally adopted the following resolution: 
                        
                     "Resolved— That the Chairman of this meeting appoint a
                            Committee of three, to report to this meeting the names of five brethren, to constitute a
                            Committee, whose duty it shall be to meet in the city of 
                                Indianapolis
                            , on the 2nd Monday in December next, for the purpose of receiving reports from
                            the brethren and friends in 
                                Rush and Lawrence counties
                            , and as many other counties as may be disposed to bid for the location; and to
                            determine the question of location; giving that point the preference which reports the
                            largest amount of funds for that object, other things being equal; such as health,
                            &c. The subscriptions in all cases, to be raised exclusively within the limits of
                            the county, asking for the locotion [sic]."10
                  
                    The chair then appointed James M. Mathes, George Campbell, and Benjamin Irwin, who in turn
                    selected a permanent committee. Committee members thus chosen were: Elijah Goodwin, of 
                        Bloomington
                    , Milton B. Hopkins, of 
                        Frankfort
                    , Thomas P. Connelly, of 
                        Connersville
                    , and Love H. Jameson and Ovid Butler, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .11
            
            The committee met at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on December 13, 1847, as requested; all members were present except Thomas P. Connelly.
                    Messrs. Malot and Short, of 
                        Bedford
                    , renewed the Lawrence County offer, but no report was received from 
                        Rush County
                    . The committee decided that not enough information had been given to Indiana Christian
                    church members concerning the college matter, that it should be brought to the attention of all
                    their brethren in the state and even to Christian church people in 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    . The meeting was then adjourned under the agreement to come together again the
                    following May.12
            
            A letter from David Staats Burnet, of Mount Healthy, 
                        Ohio
                    , to Benjamin Franklin of the Western Reformer, dated January 21,
                    1848, carried the information that there was a movement in 
                        Ohio
                     to establish "Newton College with University privileges" in
                            
                  Hamilton County, Ohio

                            verbal proposition made by George Campbell, of 
                                Rush County

                     published in the Western Reformer listed
                    seven reasons or "peculiar advantages" of this location. Burnet stated that he had
                    written Love H. Jameson, who in turn had conferred with Samuel K. Hoshour, Thomas P. Connelly, and
                    Ovid Butler, with the result that these men recommended union of the two enterprises.13 Burnet added that the 
                        Ohio
                     group had applied for a charter. A copy of the act to incorporate Newton College
                    followed Burnet's correspondence as printed in the Western Reformer.
               14
            
            In the meantime, Love H. Jameson wrote a lengthy letter to 
                        Franklin
                     dated March 15, 1848, in which he invited 
                        Franklin
                     to attend the next committee meeting in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on May 23. His letter showed an awareness of the 
                        Ohio
                     project, and it was apparent that he objected to the 
                        Ohio
                     plan of enlisting eastern Indiana brethren in support of an 
                        Ohio
                     college.15 In his comments in answer to this letter, 
                        Franklin
                     made it plain that he thought it would not be feasible for the brethren in either state
                    to relinquish college plans and that colleges in both states would be a desirable thing. He
                    recommended that Indiana Christians unite on their project and that as many as possible be present
                    at the next meeting in 
                        Indianapolis
                     when the committee would further consider the matter.16
            
            When the committee met for this meeting, there seemed to be several proposed sites to consider though
                    the 
                        Bedford
                     offer was the only one sustained by subscriptions. Goodwin presented the view that
                    inasmuch as "no county had made any effort worthy of comparison with the effort made at 
                        Bedford
                    " the committee should decide in favor of this location "on condition
                    that they [
                        Bedford
                    ] make good their former subscription." Others on the committee believed that a
                    college located at 
                        Bedford
                     could not possibly receive the support of the entire state. They reasoned that 
                        Bedford
                     was too far south of the center of the state to be accessible to students from the
                    north, too close to the state university, and that

                                Ohio
                             college proposal and the conflict between Christian brethren of 
                                Lawrence and Rush counties
                             points up the beginning of sectional rivalry for the location of the school, a
                            rivalry which plagued the Indiana state meeting for several months.

                     brethren in the north and east were objecting to this location.
                    It was finally decided to refer the whole matter to the next state meeting which would begin
                    "on Friday before the 1st Lord's day in October, 1848" at Little Flat
                    Rock church in 
                        Rush County
                    .17
            
            There were nine items of business on the agenda of the Little Flat Rock state meeting. Three of these
                    items were on the college question and were discussed with much feeling. They were: 
                        
                     3. That we hear the report of the committee appointed at the last State Meeting to
                                locate a college.
                     5. That we enquire: Is it expedient for the christian brethren of Indiana to proceed,
                                at this time, to found a College, or Literary Institution in this State?
                     6. If so, where shall it be located? and what method shall we adopt for raising the
                                requisite funds?18
                     
                  
                    
            
            In response to item three, Love H. Jameson read the entire report of the college committee as it had
                    been published in the Christian Record five months before.
               19 John O'Kane then offered a resolution that the report be received
                    and the committee honorably discharged. Stephen Younger of the church at 
                        Leatherwood
                    , Lawrence County, immediately raised an objection. It appears that having read the
                    committee report in the Christian Record prior to the state meeting, the Southern
                    District was ready with a prepared statement in response. The statement, in the form of a letter,
                    was read to the convention. It charged the special committee with sectional favoritism and acting in
                    bad faith. A resolution for the consideration of the convention was appended: "Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the committee should be severely
                    censured for refusing to locate after undertaking to do so; and we do hereby, before God, and the
                    world, wash our hands from all participation in, or approbation of their acts."20
            
            Thus the college proposal confronted its first big obstacle at this meeting. Fortunately, the report
                    of the special committee was supported by George Campbell, John Bowman

                            1848, pp. 376ff.
                  
                     20
                            Ibid., November, 1848, p. 130.
               
                     New, and others. They contended that the committee had not
                    acted in bad faith and that its members "had a right to pursue that course which they
                    thought best calculated to advance the interests of the Institution…."21
            
            Committee members who were present "disavowed all sectional feelings on the
                    subject," claiming they had pursued the course they did "for the sake of securing
                    a location which would meet the approbation and co-operation of the whole brotherhood throughout the
                    entire State."22 The censuring resolution from the Southern District
                    was tabled by a unanimous vote, and the original O'Kane resolution that the committee
                    report be received was accepted.
            When the fifth item of business was considered, four resolutions were proposed and accepted. The
                    first of these, offered by George Campbell, stated: "Resolved, That it is
                    the duty of the Christian brotherhood in Indiana to proceed to found and endow a College in this
                        State…."23 The other three resolutions, as offered by
                    John O'Kane, were designed to implement the 
                        Campbell
                     resolution. They proposed that a circular be sent to all Indiana Christian churches to
                    elicit views on the propriety of establishing a college in the state and to find out the preference
                    for its location, that competent brethren visit each church to lay the circular before the members
                    and ask careful consideration of its contents, and that the state meeting raise sufficient funds to
                    compensate those employed for this purpose.24 H. St. John Van Dake was selected
                    as general agent. In response to a call for volunteers to assist Van Dake in visiting the churches,
                    ten men accepted the responsibility.25
            
            Benjamin Franklin, editor of the Western Reformer, made a rough draft of the
                    proposed circular, and it was presented to a special committee for revisions and corrections. The
                    revised circular was officially approved by the state

                     meeting.26 The document was really a
                    circular letter, similar in form to circular letters traditionally sent out from early Baptist
                    association meetings. It explained the circumstances of the college proposal in detail and the
                    difficulties attending the work of the special committee on location and expressed a desire to learn
                    the views of all the brethren in the state on the matter. The circular asked two specific questions:
                    (1) Shall we build a college? (2) Where shall we build it? It further stated that H. St. John Van
                    Dake or other agents would visit within the year and hold a conference on the proposal and that each
                    church was invited to be represented by a letter and a delegate at the next state meeting in the
                    Christian meetinghouse (now Central Christian Church) at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , October 3–8, 1849. The circular was signed by Benjamin F. Reeve, president;
                    Benjamin Irwin, vice-president; Elijah Goodwin, secretary; and T. J. Melish, assistant secretary.27
            
            Van Dake declined the position of general agent, so Elijah Goodwin, his alternate, took the field at
                    once in a severe winter campaign. It was fortunate that Goodwin was willing to undertake the
                    canvass. Because of his association with the Christian Record, he was well known
                    throughout the state. In addition, he had held pastorates, organized new congregations, taken part
                    in several public religious debates, and held many evangelistic meetings, though he was then but
                    forty-one years old. The fact that he had worked out a plan for an Indiana Christian Evangelizing
                    Society and had written a constitution for it with the intention of promoting the project at the
                    next state meeting probably played no small part in his willingness to canvass the churches.
                    Regarding this work, Goodwin wrote, "I never stopped for rain, wind, snow, ice or
                    storm." He usually sent circulars in advance of his visits and then preached to the
                    congregation before taking the vote of the members. He claimed he advanced no personal opinion on
                    the college matter until after the vote was taken. A summary of voting results is as follows: 
                        … the result of this canvass among the churches was as follows: Nineteen churches,
                            with an aggregate membership of 1,156, gave no

                                    Christian Record, November, 1848, p. 132.
                        
                           27 Copies of this circular may be found in the Christian Record, January, 1849, p. 218, and in the Western
                                        Reformer, November, 1848, pp. 749–750. The complete minutes of
                                    the Little Flat Rock meeting were printed also in the Western
                                    Reformer, November, 1848, pp. 741–750.
                     
                             vote; three with an aggregate membership of 340, vote
                            no college; thirty-six, with an aggregate membership of 2,272, 
                                Indianapolis
                            ; fifteen, with an aggregate membership of 859, 
                                Bedford
                            ; five, with an aggregate membership of 714, scattering.
                        This gave a majority for 
                                Indianapolis
                             of 1,413, but the reports of local agents would swell that majority for 
                                Indianapolis
                             to over 2,000. The largest portion of these churches were south of the old
                            national road. Of course, none of the churches north of that road would have voted to locate
                            the college at 
                                Bedford
                            .28
                  
                    
            
            The basis of voting in the churches was one vote per member, members of these congregations being
                    primarily adults and a few persons under twelve years of age. On October 4, 1849, Goodwin made a
                    verbal report at the 
                        Indianapolis
                     state meeting. The minutes record that he had spent four and one-half months on the
                    field, had visited forty counties, and had found a majority of the brethren in favor of building a
                    college at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Six volunteer agents also gave reports which bore "about the same tenor as
                    the statements made by Bro. Goodwin except as to its [the college's] location in relation
                    to which there was some difference of opinion and wishes."29
            
            A committee was appointed to study the reports of Goodwin and the other agents for the purpose of
                    recommending a plan of action.30 After deliberation, the committee reported that
                    from the data before them they considered the brethren in Indiana at the time unprepared to found
                    and endow a university or college. Their report was supported by two committee resolutions, viz.:
                        
                        1st. Resolved that this Annual meeting recommend to the Brethren the founding of a North

                        2nd. Resolved, that this Annual meeting appoint a committee to correspond with the Brethren
                            and churches north of the 
                                Ohio

            Ovid Butler, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , objected to the "rivers and mountains" boundary clauses, preferring
                    to insert "North Western Territory" in their stead. In the session the following
                    morning, several other amendments were proposed and discussed with much feeling. As no agreement
                    could be reached, all resolutions and amendments were tabled until Saturday afternoon, October 6. At
                    this time, John M. Bramwell moved the adoption of the following: 
                        Resolved, That a North Western Christian University be founded at 
                                Indianapolis
                             as soon as a sufficient amount of funds can be raised to commence it, and that
                            a Committee of seven be appointed by this meeting to take the preliminary steps in reference
                            to the founding and endowment of such an institution.32
                  
                    
            
            John O'Kane offered a resolution to strike out the two original resolutions of the
                    committee, which apparently had been considered as a preamble to the Bramwell resolution, and to
                    adopt the Bramwell substitute. To forestall any future criticism and better to indicate state-wide
                    approval, Ovid Butler asked 
                        Marion County
                     brethren to abstain from voting. They agreed, and the balloting resulted in unanimous
                    adoption of the Bramwell resolution.33 This adoption marked the first real
                    breakthrough on the college matter. It meant the end of delay and argument over selection of a
                    location, the choice of a name for the institution, a clear decision to go ahead with the project,
                    authority from the state meeting for implementing this decision, and the emergence of Ovid Butler as
                    one of the primary leaders of the program.
            The following Monday, when Vice-President Butler was acting as chairman of the meeting, a nominating
                    committee was appointed to select the college committee contemplated in the Bramwell resolution. The
                    nominating committee acted at once, and their nominees received official approval.34 Ovid Butler, chairman of the new committee, was a prominent 
                        Indianapolis
                     attorney and Christian church layman. A man of acknowledged legal ability, financial
                    means, and of influence in the proper places, he was a desirable person to

                            nominating committee. They chose Ovid Butler (chairman), B. F. Reeve, J. B. New, Elijah
                            Goodwin, A. E. Drapier, L. H. Jameson, and John O'Kane for the college
                        committee.
               
                     put the will of the state meeting into action. Because of
                    failing health, he had retired from the active practice of law at the age of forty-six. M. C. Tiers
                    wrote in his Christian Portrait Gallery
               35 that when 
                        Butler
                     escaped death from serious illness in 1847, he was impressed with the conviction that
                    God had spared his life to give him an opportunity to engage in other work. It is possible that he
                    considered North Western Christian University to be his special new mission in life. As chairman of
                    the college committee, 
                        Butler
                     drafted what the brethren considered a liberal charter for the new institution. A
                    letter to J. M. Mathes a year later36 indicates that he was thinking in terms of
                    an institution much more extensive than a mere church college. Actually, he objected to locating a
                    Christian college at 
                        Bedford
                     on the basis that it would be limited as a college of the Indiana brethren rather than
                    being "a great North Western institution," as contemplated by the charter.
            The charter, as adopted by the state legislature on January 15, 1850, consisted of eighteen
                        sections.37 In describing this charter in a letter to J. M. Mathes, Ovid
                    Butler declared that it should aid the college committee in discharging the duties assigned to them.
                    The charter, he wrote, proposes the founding and endowing of a univeristy through the
                    instrumentality of a joint-stock company with a capital of not less than $75,000 nor more
                    than $500,000, divided in equal shares of $100 each. One-third of the capital
                    stock, he stated, would be expended on buildings, grounds, and equipment; the remainder would be
                    kept as a permanent fund for endowment. He explained that the subscriber could retain two-thirds of
                    his subscription as a loan and be entitled to interest on the whole subscription in the form of
                    tuition. The charter, he wrote, provided that subscribers would have control of the institution
                    through directors to be chosen by them triennially.38
            
            Section three of the charter is a clear indication of what the committee had in mind for the new
                    school:

                            Indianapolis
                        , in the State of Indiana, an institution of learning of the highest class for the
                        education of the youth of all parts of the 
                            United States
                        , and especially of the States of the Northwest; to establish in said institution
                        departments or colleges for the instructing of the students in every branch of liberal and
                        professional education; to educate and prepare suitable teachers for the common schools of the
                        country; to teach and inculcate the Christian faith and Christian morality as taught in the
                        sacred Scriptures, discarding as uninspired and without authority all writings, formulas,
                        creeds, and articles of faith subsequent thereto, and for the formation [promotion] of the
                        sciences and arts.39
               
                
            The charter named a board of commissioners40 who were to be responsible for the
                    raising of subscriptions for the capital stock of the university and the management of the
                    corporation until the election of a board of directors was made under the charter. After 750 shares
                    of stock had been subscribed, the commissioners were authorized to "appoint a time and
                    place for holding the first election of directors … [and] may also prescribe the manner
                    of holding and conducting said first election…." The twenty-one directors were
                    to be elected by the stockholders every third year to serve three-year terms; the directors were
                    authorized to choose a president of the board from among their own members, as well as a secretary,
                    treasurer, and other officers from either their members or the stockholders. Voting by the
                    stock-holders

                            (The word "promotion" appears in brackets in the Local
                            Laws). Emphasis on the Scriptures in the charter, coupled with strong aversion towards
                            creeds and confessions of faith was characteristic of the views of those in the Christian
                            church movement. Just as they believed such views were the only solid basis for the union of
                            all denominations, they also thought these principles would guarantee that the institution
                            would be non-sectarian and act as leaven to keep higher education in Indiana from assuming a
                            denominational character.
                  
                     40 Commissioners named in the charter were: F. D. Wheeler, John K.

                    stock held.41
            
            The new board of commissioners held an organizational meeting on March 5, 1850, in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Ovid Butler was elected president; J. B. New, vice-president; and John M. Bramwell,
                    secretary. An executive committee was appointed, consisting of the president, vice-president,
                    secretary, and two other commissioners, Elijah Goodman and Albert B. Cole. The executive committee
                    was given authority to select and employ agents to sell stock subscriptions. It chose Michael Combs
                    to work in 
                        Iowa
                     and Thomas P. Connelly to work in 
                        Ohio
                    . The remaining commissioners were charged with the responsibility of procuring
                    subscriptions for stock in Indiana communities. The hope was expressed that by the following May,
                    when the commissioners were to meet again in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , enough stock would have been purchased to authorize the election of a board of
                        directors.42
            
            The commissioners held their second meeting in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on May 29, 1850. They were called upon, one by one, to report their success in selling
                    stock subscriptions. It must have been an embarrassing period, for it appears that Ovid Butler was
                    the only commissioner who had sold any subscriptions. In spite of this, the group felt that the
                    future for the university was encouraging. Ovid Butler had been corresponding with Dr. E. Demming,
                    of the Indiana Medical College, about removal of that college to 
                        Indianapolis
                     under the patronage of North Western Christian University, and he shared these
                    communications with his brethren. According to the comments of Dr. Ryland T. Brown at this meeting,
                    the faculty at Indiana Medical College was favorable to moving the college to 
                        Indianapolis
                     or some other place.43
            
            In the meantime, on recommendation of the commissioners and with the approval of the Indiana
                    Christian Home Missionary Society, J. M. Mathes was encouraged to move his publishing headquarters
                    from 
                        Bloomington
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . This location was considered to be advantageous for the promotion of both the
                    university and missionary society projects via the columns of his journal. Mathes eventually
                    consented to this arrangement, although it meant giving up

            At the May, 1850 meeting of the commissioners or shortly thereafter, John O'Kane45 was appointed special agent to solicit stock subscriptions for the proposed
                    school. He was forty-eight years of age, a six-foot-one-inch Irishman, straight and slender, with a
                    reputation for wit, and popular with the Indiana brethren as a person and as a preacher. He had
                    tried his hand at many things, including the editing of a religious journal called the Christian Casket (
                        Connersville
                    , 1833), which survived for a year only. At the time of his appointment he was operating
                    a bookstore in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the south side of Washington Street between Meridian and 
                        Illinois
                    . He could not accept the new position, however, until he first sold his store. Ovid
                    Butler and J. M. Mathes were so anxious for him to take the field-work position that they formed a
                    partnership and bought him out for $1,500.46 He began his work on
                    January 16, 1851. J. M. Mathes wrote of O'Kane: 
                        As to brother O'Kane's fitness for his appointment, we need say nothing.
                            All who have heard him preach, and are acquainted with his literary attainments, and the
                            character of his talents, consider him abundantly qualified for a solicitor. He is the
                            ardent friend of the University, and is devoted heart and soul to its interests. He will
                            make a strong effort, and we hope a successful effort, in procuring subscriptions of stock
                            to the amount of $75,000. When this is done, the Board will be organized, the
                            site of ground purchased, and suitable buildings erected.47

                  45 O'Kane was the prime mover in organizing Central Christian
                        Church at 
                            Indianapolis
                         in 1833. Evans, Biographical Sketches of the Pioneer Preachers of
                            Indiana, 331–339, contains a good biography of John O'Kane.
                        O'Kane, now almost a legendary figure among Christian church preachers, has been
                        mentioned as having baptized Abraham Lincoln. The Shane Quarterly, IV (April,
                        1943), 61–71, published by the School of Religion, 
                            Butler
                         University, relates the account of G. W. Weimer, of 
                            Chicago
                        , of a conversation between O'Kane and Weimer. O'Kane is supposed
                        to have told Weimer that Lincoln and O'Kane took a buggy ride one night, and Lincoln
                        was baptized by O'Kane in a creek near 
                     Springfield, Illinois
                  .
                        Christian church historians, however, believe there is no adequate evidence to support this
                        contention.

            The new agent made a whirlwind start, selling some $4,000 worth of stock subscriptions the
                    first month. He wrote to Mathes, commenting: "My success thus far is beyond my most
                    sanguine expectation." In this same letter he claimed also to have done something for the
                    endowment of the chair of ancient languages in 
                        Bethany
                     College.48 After being on the field six months, O'Kane
                    accounted for the sale of stock amounting to $25,000. Since he had visited but one-tenth
                    of the Indiana Christian congregations and had already received one-third of the needed
                    $75,000 in subscriptions, the brethren began to feel confident that the remainder would
                    be raised within a year.49
            
            James M. Mathes, in an editorial in the Christian Record,
               50
                    wrote in an optimistic vein concerning the future of North Western Christian University. He
                    explained that because of sickness in the family, O'Kane had been confined to his home for
                    some three months, but with the aid of several brethren he had been able to get subscriptions
                    amounting to $43,000 by December, 1851. The editorial also pressed strongly for interest
                    in the school project. Mathes argued that education in Indiana was fast assuming a denominational
                    character. He mentioned 
                        Hanover
                     College, of the Old School Presbyterians, and 
                        Wabash
                     College, of the New School Presbyterians, as well as 
                        Franklin
                     College, which was supported by the Baptist denomination. Other denominational schools
                    cited in the same connection were Asbury University (Methodist) and St. Gabriel's and St.
                    Mary's colleges (Roman Catholic). The article also explained the situation at the state
                    university in 
                        Bloomington
                    , declaring that this school had ample endowment and a superior faculty yet there were
                    seldom over one hundred students in actual attendance at any one time. Mathes assumed from this data
                    that the trend of higher education in Indiana was primarily denominational in character and seemed a
                    little sorry for the plight of the state university.

                            Ibid., March, 1851, p. 280. There apparently was some sort of
                            understanding between the commissioners and Alexander Campbell, who was president of Bethany
                            College, for O'Kane to raise funds to endow a chair of ancient languages
                            simultaneously with the university project. Bethany College was a private institution at 
                                Bethany
                            , 
                                Virginia
                             (now 
                                West Virginia
                            ), supported primarily by Christian church members. The dual nature of
                            O'Kane's commission later became a source of contention between 
                                Campbell
                             and the commissioners.

                     He wrote that "the State University is left to take
                    care of itself as best it can."51
            
            Writing for the Christian Record from his Forest Home residence in 
                        Indianapolis
                     under the date of May 28, 1852, Ovid Butler announced that the establishment of North
                    Western Christian University was no longer problematical, that the goal of $75,000 in
                    stock subscriptions had nearly been reached, and that the commissioners were expected to meet in a
                    few days to examine the stock subscriptions and order an election of directors.52 Success apparently came sooner than expected, and it was necessary for Mathes to publish an
                    extra edition of the Christian Record to carry the story. The proceedings of the
                    commissioners, as reported in the extra, show that they met in the Christian Chapel (now Central
                    Christian Church) at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on June 22, 1852, under the chairmanship of Ovid Butler. The first order of business
                    after establishing the validity of the meeting was to hear John O'Kane read his official
                    report. He told of his eighteen months of labor on the field and of some three hundred discourses
                    made to the churches. As evidence of his work he submitted papers to show $75,200
                    subscribed in stock.53
            
            O'Kane's report was studied and accepted. Jeremiah Smith then made the motion to
                    implement the report with action. It was as follows: 
                        
                     Resolved, That the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars having been, to the
                            satisfaction of a majority of the Commissioners of the Northwestern Christian University,
                            subscribed as stock in said University, it is ordered by the Board that Wednesday, the 14th
                            day of July next, at two O'clock P. M., be appointed as the time, and the Christian
                            Chapel in 
                                Indianapolis
                            , as the place for holding the first election of Directors, as required by the
                            Charter, and that the President of this Board preside at said election, and that he call to
                            his assistance any two or four of the Commissioners or stockholders, to act as judges and
                            clerks of the election, and that notice thereof be given in the Christian Record and such
                            other ways as the President may deem proper and expedient.54
                  
                    The above resolution, one concerning John O'Kane's salary, another dealing
                    with the handling over of all papers pertaining to the project to the board of directors when
                    organized,

                            Ibid., 2.
               
                     and a final one concerning the closing of the work of the
                    commissioners were passed.55 The meeting marked another milestone in the
                    university project.
            The stockholders met on July 14, 1852, as directed in the resolution, and twenty-one directors were
                    elected for three-year terms.56 The new board of directors had its first
                    official meeting in the Christian Chapel in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on July 27. Ovid Butler was chosen president of the board, James Sulgrove treasurer,
                    and John M. Bramwell secretary. This was a four-day meeting in which the directors worked on rules
                    and bylaws, examined the financial potential of the proposed university, and appointed John
                    O'Kane as collecting agent to try to persuade stockholders of the necessity of immediate
                    one-third payment of their stock subscriptions.57
            
            The directors met again on August 31, 1852, at the Christian Chapel in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . They were concerned primarily with procedural problems, rules, and bylaws. In a couple
                    of days they got around to considering building sites. After checking several possible locations
                    they voted to purchase a twenty-acre tract from Ovid Butler. It was a wooded area just north of the
                    city limits of 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the vicinity of the present Thirteenth and College streets. The brethren thought
                    this location advantageous because the buildings, when erected, could be seen by passengers as they
                    passed through the city on two different railway lines. Some board members thought the site was too
                    far from the city, but the majority, being farmers, preferred a site in the open country. It was
                    thought by a few of the directors that in view of the fact that 
                        Indianapolis
                     was expanding, the university grounds might someday be within the corporation limits of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .58

            Ephraim S. Frazee offered a motion that the president authorize a premium of $50 for the
                    best plans and specifications for a building, that the premium be offered on a competitive basis,
                    and that it be open to all interested architects.59 Ovid Butler acted at once
                    and placed the following advertisement in several midwestern newspapers, including the Daily Journal and Daily State Sentinel, at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the second week in September, 1852:

                            appropriate for the use of the Institution until it shall be found practicable and necessary

            This advertisement launched William Tinsley on a long and successful career as a college architect.
                    He had been prominent in his profession in 
                        Ireland
                     and had recently come to America. In the winter of 1851 he opened an office in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . He had brought to this country ideas so unfamiliar to midwestern America that people
                    in need of building designs were reluctant to employ his services. He was desperate for an
                    opportunity to show what he could do when he read Ovid Butler's advertisement in a 
                        Cincinnati
                     newspaper. Alternate sets of plans were prepared immediately, one of which won the
                    coveted $100 prize. In addition, he was also commissioned to proceed with working
                    drawings and supervise the actual construction.61

                        grandfather of the American poet, Vachel Lindsay, who wrote about Frazee in his poem,
                        "The Proud Farmer."

            North Western Christian University's building was the first Tinsley designed in America, and
                    it marked this architect's Collegiate Gothic style. It was said to be very similar to the
                    Royal Freemason's School for Female Children at 
                        Wandsworth
                    , 
                        England
                     designed by Philip Hardwick, R.A., then currently under construction.62 Soon after designing North Western Christian University's building, Tinsley was
                    employed to make the drawings for Center Hall at 
                        Wabash
                     College, and he supervised the construction of this building simultaneously with that
                    of North Western Christian University. He was also responsible for planning a building for Oskaloosa
                    College (which later moved to Des Moines and became Drake University), the academic building at
                    Indiana University, Bascom Hall at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    , Ascension Hall at Kenyon College, and a building at 
                        Quincy
                     College, 
                  Quincy, Illinois
               . His long career also included the designing of many
                    public buildings, homes, and churches. Christ Church (Episcopal) on Monument Circle, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , still stands as a witness to this Victorian architect's ability.63
            
            The brethren could not wait for the erection of a building before actually starting the educational
                    program. The first Monday in May, 1853, they opened a preparatory school in classrooms which they
                    rented from St. Mary's Church (called St. Mary's Seminary by the Minutes of the
                    Board of Directors of N.W.C.U.) near the center of the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , north of the Circle. R. K. Krout, A.M., of 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , was employed as instructor.64 Professor Krout resigned after a few
                    weeks, and the school was temporarily suspended while the directors looked for a new teacher.65 By November, 1853, Lyman P. Streator had been secured for the position, and
                    forty boys were reported as being in attendance. James M. Mathes wrote concerning the school,
                    "Students will have an opportunity of taking a thorough course, preparatory to entering the
                    college proper when it opens, which we hope will be by next fall."66 By

                     four students had been enrolled. Closing exercises held in
                    Christian Chapel consisted of dialogues, declamations, and original compositions. The directors were
                    pleased to report that three of these students "put on Christ in the institution of
                    Christian baptism" and that they considered these three young men as the first fruits of
                    North Western Christian University. They were also pleased that the experiment was a success
                    financially for the school had sustained itself on tuitions. Then, just as the third quarter was
                    beginning, Principal Streator's wife died, and he felt compelled to return to 
                        Pennsylvania
                     with his children.67 The Minutes of the Board of Directors of
                    N.W.C.U. for May 25, 1854, show that the directors had confidence in him, since they had elected him
                    to the permanent faculty of the new school. After Streator left, the directors decided to suspend
                    the preparatory school until the university buildings were sufficiently advanced to receive the
                    classes.
            The resignation of Professor Streator and the closing of the preparatory school together with
                    difficulty in obtaining one-third payments from the stockholders to provide cash for paying the
                    various building contractors gave the directors problems in the early months of 1854. These problems
                    were of small concern, however, compared to those raised by an antagonistic article in the January,
                    1854 issue of the Millennial Harbinger. Alexander Campbell, co-editor of the Harbinger and president of Bethany College at 
                        Bethany
                    , 
                        Virginia
                     (now 
                        West Virginia
                    ), was the acknowledged and respected leader of the Christian churches. He was looked
                    upon as sort of a patriarch of the movement. This was a time when the North Western Christian
                    University project needed his tacit approval if not his blessing, and antagonism from him might well
                    prove disastrous.
            The meeting of the directors on May 24 was the first session of the board since 
                        Campbell
                    's article had appeared. Prior to this meeting, there had been correspondence
                    between Ovid Butler and John O'Kane which 
                        Butler
                     wished to share with his brethren. He first called attention to

                            Ibid., June, 1854, pp. 188–189. Streator, a Bethany College
                            man, subsequently became president of Mayslick Academy, Mayslick, 
                                Kentucky
                             and later evangelist for the 
                                Pennsylvania
                             Christian Missionary Society. The altercation between 
                                Campbell
                             and N.W.C.U., hereafter described, may have been a strong contributing factor
                            in his decision not to continue his post. For information on Streator, see the Christian Standard (

                        Campbell
                    's article, "Notes of a Tour to 
                        Illinois
                    ," in which O'Kane was charged with using the slavery issue to bolster
                    the cause of North Western Christian University and downgrade Bethany College.68
                    
                        Campbell
                     had written: 
                        I was, indeed, sorry to learn from several places in the State [
                                Illinois
                            ], that he [O'Kane] made a new issue, one heretofore unknown amongst us
                            as a Christian poeple. It was, in brief, that "Christians living on free soil, should not co-operate ["co-operate" had the
                            connotation of "fellowship" with the Christian church at that time] with
                            Christians living on slave soil, in any seminary of learning."
                            That in other words, political, rather than Christian
                            considerations, should rule and measure Christian co-operation in all seminaries of
                                learning.69
                  
                    
               
                        Campbell
                     also wrote that O'Kane was aware that the brethren in 
                        Illinois
                     and Indiana had proposed to endow a chair of ancient language at 
                        Bethany
                     College and that his actions had hazarded his reputation and that of the Indiana
                    brethren for fair and honorable dealing.70
            
            When 
                        Butler
                     corresponded with O'Kane to learn his view on the matter, O'Kane
                    denied 
                        Campbell
                    's charge that he had made his plea for patronage of North Western Christian
                    University on grounds of political Free-Soilism, but that "he urged the fact, that its
                    location was in a free State, and that students attending it would not be brought into contact with
                    the habits and manners that exist in populations where slavery exists."71
            
            The directors knew that they could not safely ignore 
                        Campbell
                    's allegation, so they drafted a document with preamble and resolutions which
                    they sent to the editors of the Millennial Harbinger, the Christian Record, and the
                        Christian Age with a request for publication "as an act of justice."72 In this document they repudiated the idea that Christians living on free soil
                    should not cooperate with Christians living on slave soil in any seminary of learning; that because
                    the university was pledged by its charter to the Bible and to no sectarian or political party, it
                    was not bound to receive or reject any doctrine or principle on a sectarian or political basis; that
                    they had confidence in the activities of John

                     O'Kane as agent of the school; that the university did
                    not claim "exclusive patronage" on any ground whatever; and that the board never
                    promised that John O'Kane, as its agent, would simultaneously urge the claims of Bethany
                    College. The document was signed by John T. Cox, secretary.73
            
            The misunderstanding apparently had its origin in Ovid Butler's home at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the evening of November 19, 1850. 
                        Campbell
                    , who had been on a tour through Indiana,74 was invited by 
                        Butler
                     to meet some friends at a social gathering in his honor. During the course of the
                    evening, 
                        Campbell
                     apparently pressed the claims and needs of Bethany College, an institution he had
                    established ten years before at 
                        Bethany
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , and a project very close to his heart. If 
                        Campbell
                    's recollections are correct,75 many of the friends at the
                    gathering that night were members of the board of commissioners of North Western Christian
                    University. After hearing 
                        Campbell
                    's plea for Bethany College, this "board" retired to another
                    room for some time to consider it. When the group returned, Ovid Butler told 
                        Campbell
                     they had resolved to endow a chair at 
                        Bethany
                     College and that John O'Kane would present the subject to the brethren at the
                    same time that he advocated North Western Christian University. As further evidence that such a
                    decision was made, 
                        Campbell
                     recalled that in many places in Indiana O'Kane actually did urge endowment of
                    the chair.
            A careful appraisal of the incident at 
                        Butler
                    's home would seem to indicate that 
                        Campbell
                    's memory, for the most part, was correct, but that some of his impressions
                    were colored by his own enthusiasm for Bethany College. There seems to be little doubt that
                    following this meeting, 
                        Campbell
                     believed that when John O'Kane went to the brethren to sell stock
                    subscriptions for North Western Christian University

                                Campbell
                             had speaking engagements at

                            Ibid., August, 1854, p. 467. This explanation by 
                                Campbell
                             was appended to the published document from the N.W.C.U. directors and was
                            intended as a reply to the statement: "That this [italics mine]
                            Board never promised that J. O'Kane ‘as an agent for the N.W.C.
                            University, would simultaneously urge the claims of Bethany College, that Indiana might
                            endow one of its Chairs,’ and Eld. Campbell is mistaken when he so affirms, the
                            Board never had the subject before it."
               
                     he also presented the cause of Bethany College.76 In O'Kane's frequent reports to the commissioners and in reports from
                    district and state meetings of Indiana Christian churches, as printed many times in the Christian Record, this seemed to be the case. The original commitment may have been made
                    unofficially by some of the commissioners who were present at the time, but, under the terms of the
                    charter, the board of commissioners had long since been discharged. The board of directors in 1854
                    was not the same board even though some of the same men made up its membership. It would seem,
                    however, that 
                        Campbell
                     deserved to be treated with more candor than is indicated in the ambiguous statement
                    that "this board never promised" to promote the Bethany College project along with
                    its own.
            As to the minutes of the board of directors, the single entry on May 24, 1854, with its preamble and
                    resolutions denying 
                        Campbell
                    's allegations, ended the matter. The document, published in the Christian Record, Christian Age, and Millennial Harbinger, was the
                    official "whitewash" of the affair. The unfortunate episide might have ended at
                    this point had not H. St. John Van Dake added fuel to the fire in a letter sent to the Christian Record.
               77
                    
                        Campbell
                     reproduced this letter in his Millennial Harbinger, prefaced by a few
                    caustic comments of his own.78 Van Dake's communication was couched in
                    strong language but shed little light on the real issue. Ovid Butler, believing his personal
                    reputation to be at stake, wrote an explanatory letter to Editor Mathes, which was also
                        published.79 The Millennial Harbinger
               80 also carried correspondence from Jeremiah Smith in which he defended the position taken by
                    the university and gave his version of the November 19, 1850 meeting at the Butler home. None of
                    those who corresponded concerning the dispute ever really backed down on the positions they had
                    taken. Campbell did admit, however, that he may have "miscalled the meeting" at
                    Butler's home, but he insisted "there was a called meeting

                                Campbell
                             had made this understanding clear in the Millennial
                            Harbinger, January, 1851, p. 52, and the Indiana brethren had never repudiated it
                            before this incident took place two years later.

               81
            
            To understand this unfortunate controversy it must be seen in its total context. It was not an
                    isolated local conflict but one incidental to a larger maneuver of social and political forces
                    within the denomination. The Bethany-
                        Indianapolis
                     episode was a vignette reflecting mounting tensions between North and South.
            The religious movement, of which 
                        Campbell
                     was at this time the undisputed leader, had grown far beyond his dreams and
                    expectations. It had become one of the large denominations in America, and there was reason to
                    believe its phenomenal growth would continue. Then the slavery issue, which eventually divided
                    nearly every major Protestant group, began to cast its shadows among 
                        Campbell
                    's followers. 
                        Campbell
                    , who considered the issue primarily political rather than religious and who wished to
                    keep the controversy out of the denomination, wrote very little concerning it prior to 1845. Under
                    pressure to clarify his position, he wrote a series of articles on slavery that year.82 He preferred to be known as antislavery in his opinions; yet being a biblical scholar,
                    he held to the master-servant relationship as he thought it was described in the New Testament. He
                    believed the system should be upheld as long as it was a law of the land. Being a pacifist also, he
                    objected to abolitionists and emancipators alike on the grounds that they advocated force to gain
                    their ends. Most of all, he was opposed to the sectionalism brought on by the slavery issue, which
                    threatened to divide his country and his religious followers. From 1845 on, there was open
                    alienation between 
                        Campbell
                     and his followers in northeastern 
                        Ohio
                    , a hotbed of abolitionism, followed by lack of support to Bethany College and the
                    subsequent founding of Hiram College at 
                        Hiram
                    , 
                        Ohio

            By 1850, 
                        Campbell
                     perceived that the cause of Christian unity and the restoration of primitive
                    Christianity—principles for which he had dedicated his life—the brotherhood

                     of Christian people, his college, and even his leadership was
                    in jeopardy because of what he considered a political situation. He knew the brethren on the Western
                    Reserve in 
                        Ohio
                     were getting out of hand but probably attributed it to the tradition of abolitionism in
                    their 
                        New England
                     background. For many years he had made regular tours through the South and Southwest
                    and no doubt felt strongly entrenched in these parts. Because of his advancing age he no longer
                    enjoyed extended tours among his constituents as before; yet a letter from Ovid Butler, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , jolted him into action again.84 He knew then that there was still
                    more work to be done. The letter informed Campbell of the incorporation of North Western Christian
                    University and innocently inferred that this school would have the patronage of some hundred
                    thousand Christian church members in Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Ohio
               , and 
                        Kentucky
                    . 
                        Butler
                     also inferred that Bethany College need not be concerned, because it had the support of
                    the South and trained leadership for southern constituents. 
                        Butler
                     probably had no intention of provoking 
                        Campbell
                    , but the letter had two distinct results; it motivated an immediate, caustic reply of
                        disapproval85 and compelled 
                        Campbell
                     to make his first tour among the Indiana brethren within five months. In his reply to 
                        Butler
                    's invitation to visit Indiana, which was one of several he had received
                    through the years, 
                        Campbell
                     gave as his excuse for never having visited the state that Indiana was celebrated for
                    fevers in the fall and its roads were impassable in the winter, the seasons during which he made his
                    tours. If he really believed this, his decision finally to make a tour of Indiana must have come
                    under strong inner compulsion.
            When Ovid Butler and his friends, some of whom were N.W.C.U. commissioners, entertained 
                        Campbell
                     at the 
                        Butler
                     home on the evening of November 19, 1850, they were aware of 
                        Campbell
                    's views concerning the validity of their project. His reply to 
                        Butler
                    's letter had made this plain enough. He probably made his position even
                    clearer when he gave an impassioned plea for Bethany College at this meeting. An off-the-record
                    policy decision was inevitable. In the best interest of North Western Christian University it was
                    deemed necessary for Indiana to support 
                        Campbell
                    's project, the endowment of a chair of ancient languages at 
                        Bethany
                     College. 
                  
                     84
                            Millennial Harbinger, June, 1850, pp. 330–331.
                  
                     85
                            Ibid., 331–335.
               
                     Any other decision would serve only to prove that 
                        Campbell
                    's charges against them in reply to the 
                        Butler
                     letter were justified. So 
                        Campbell
                     was informed that O'Kane, as agent of the university, would add
                    Bethany's project to his portfolio. It was a decision of appeasement, completely
                    unofficial, and without approval of the state meeting. There is no doubt that 
                        Campbell
                     considered it otherwise and took the offer at face value.
            The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 crystallized antislavery sentiment among Christian churches in the
                    North. 
                        Campbell
                     wrote in support of the act: 
                        Large and respectable meetings, ecclesiastic and political, have denounced it as
                            unconstitutional and immoral, and have been advising, or at least countenancing, resistance
                            and insubordination to its requirements. This, indeed, might have been more or less,
                            expected from those who are not well informed, either on the Constitution of the 
                                United States
                             or on that of Christ's Kingdom. But that any one well-instructed in
                            the Christian religion could recommend violence, or insubordination to a law, passed by a
                            Congress that merely represents and reflects the will of a sovereign people, is, to me,
                            rather an unexpected development.86
                  
                    
            
            With the passing of the act and the publicity attending it, the brethren in Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    , following the lead of 
                        Ohio
                    , became aroused. They were not sympathetic with slaveholders, did not agree with 
                        Campbell
                    's views on slavery, and held that the "laws of God" were
                    higher than the laws of Congress. Therefore, they could not support Bethany College, and John
                    O'Kane was quick to find out that the chair of ancient languages at 
                        Bethany
                     College had no chance of success in Indiana.87
            
            The controversy with Alexander Campbell crowded out other news connected with North Western Christian
                    University in 1854 so far as the Christian Record was concerned. Nevertheless, by
                    the end of that year, J. M. Mathes reported that the building was nearly completed and that sessions
                    of the preparatory school would commence at an early date.88 The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Daily Journal of April 2, 1855, carried a long account of the building enterprise.

                            Ibid., January, 1851, p. 27. Much attention has been given to this issue
                            because of what happened later between Bethany College and North Western Christian
                            University.

                     editor claimed: "It will be no slight gratification to
                    a public spirited citizen to be able to say that 
                        Indianapolis
                     has a college, which will compare favorably with any in the 
                        United States
                    ." The Journal described the new edifice as forming the
                    western wing of a structure which would be about 250 feet long and 100 feet deep, standing
                    immediately north of the old Bellefontaine Depot in the midst of a handsome grove of trees. The
                    completed wing, the writer stated, was about 100 feet by 103 in dimension, with towers, battlement
                    walls, projecting windows, heavy stone sills, caps and ornaments. The interior was described as
                    having black walnut staircases and massive balustrades. There were four recitation rooms and a room
                    for chapel services or meetings of literary societies. The writer concluded: "It is worth
                    the ride or walk of a mile and a half to look at it, and go through it."
            Although the building was completed on record time, there remained many financial problems which
                    disturbed the directors. Through the columns of the Christian Record, N.W.C.U.
                    stock subscribers were urged time and again to pay their subscriptions for stock they had purchased.
                    Ovid Butler wrote on March 1, 1855 that $6,000 was still due on contracts and that the
                    directors had instructed the treasurer to bring suit against subscribers when he deemed it
                        necessary.89 In this same issue, Mathes declared that the building was
                    finished but not out of debt.90 In a later issue he stated: "We could
                    open next week if the stockholders could pay up their dues, so the directors would have something to
                    pay the Faculty."91 In the fall of 1854, Elijah Goodwin was appointed
                    as agent for the university. He started his work early in 1855 and wrote of making a thorough
                    canvass of Indiana "from Lake Michigan to the mouth of the 
                        Wabash
                     river, and from Lawrenceburgh to 
                        Terre Haute
                    ."92 It was apparent to the directors by this time that
                    continuous financial support from the Indiana constituency was a necessity in the operation of an
                    educational institution.
            Alexander Campbell made his second visit to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in late December of 1854. Again, he was a guest in Ovid

                    an admirable specimen of architectural taste and grandeur 
                        equal to any thing I have seen in the North-West, and speak[s] in unmistakeable eloquence of
                            the honorable pride and secular ambition of its enterprising projector and his worthy
                            coadjutants. It is, and will long be, a proud monument of free soil jealousy, magnanimity,
                            and generosity. It did not begin in the flesh, to be perfected in the spirit; but in the
                            spirit to be perfected in the flesh.93
                  
                    Following these stinging remarks, 
                        Campbell
                     wrote of the conversation in the 
                        Butler
                     home concerning the misunderstanding of what had been said there at the 1850 meeting.
                    After mutual explanations, 
                        Campbell
                     apparently exonerated his 
                        Indianapolis
                     brethren, but with the reservation that he "could not fully reconcile [their
                    conduct] to Christian candor and straightforwardness on their part."94
                    Mathes reprinted the entire Harbinger article under the caption, "The
                    Misunderstanding Settled," concluding with his own observation, "Bethany College
                    and N.W.C. University, are not rival Institutions, but co-laborers in the great cause of Education,
                    and Moral and Religious Reformation."95
            
            The preparatory school was reopened in the university building on April 9, 1855, with Allen
                    Richardson Benton, A.M.96 in charge. 
                        Benton
                    , a graduate of Bethany College, had formerly been principal of Fairview Academy. The
                    school was advertised as being open to both sexes, "to give the female an equal chance to
                    obtain a thorough education." Prior to this, 
                        Benton
                     had been elected to the university faculty, and he served the preparatory school until
                    a principal could be found to replace L. P. Streator. Silas E. Shepherd and Joseph Ray had also been
                    elected to the faculty of the university, but they declined.97 On August 8,
                    1855, the directors elected B. L. Long

                             was professor of ancient languages at N.W.C.U., 1855–1861; president
                            of N.W.C.U., 1861–1868; president of Alliance College (Alliance, 
                                Ohio

                     and Robert Milligan to the faculty, but they also declined.98 The faculty roster was not completed until October 1, 1855. It was finally
                    made up of John Young, A.M., professor of natural sciences; A. R. Benton, A.M., professor of ancient
                    languages; James R. Challen, Jr., A.B., principal of the preparatory school; and L. H. Jameson,
                    Challen's assistant. It was decided to leave the presidency vacant for the present.99
            
            Twenty-one directors were elected for three-year terms on July 11, 1855, under the provision of the
                    charter. Many of them had served a prior three-year term.100
            
            Minutes of the meeting of the North Western Christian University directors for October 1, 1855, show
                    acceptance of the following resolution: "Resolved, that the Institution be opened on the
                    1st day of November next, the first session of which shall be nine months or to the 1st of August,
                    1856." Because of the shortness of time, and in lieu of a regular academic catalogue, the
                    directors issued a circular, dated November 1, 1855, in which an academic prospectus for
                    1855–1856 was given. According to the circular, the university was to be made up of six
                    schools or general divisions: (1) the English and Normal Schools, (2) the Mathematical School, (3)
                    the Classical School, (4) the School of Natural Science, (5) the School of Intellectual Science and
                    Rhetoric, and (6) the Law School. The moral and religious training of the students was to be
                    provided by daily lectures on such subjects as biblical criticism, natural theology, political
                    economy, and analogy of revealed religion. Degrees for men included bachelor of arts and bachelor of
                    science, and women who completed the male collegiate courses were to receive either

                    tuition was given as $30 per year for work on the college level and $20 per
                    year for courses in the preparatory school.101
            
            There was no formal dedication service for the new institution, but the school was officially opened
                    with what the

                    Daily Journal called commencement exercises.102 On this
                    occasion, James R. Challen, Jr. read the Scriptures, H. St. John Van Dake led in prayer, and
                    addresses were given by John O'Kane, Samuel K. Hoshour, A. R. Benton, and John Young.
                    Horace Mann, president of Antioch College in 
                        Ohio
                    , had been invited to speak, but he did not appear.
            Eight years had passed since the project was first proposed. There had been difficulties over the
                    location of the school and even a major conflict with the acknowledged leader of the Christian
                    church movement. Many of the problems which arose could have been handled better. The chief obstacle
                    that faced the brethren, however, seems to have been the raising of sufficient funds. Ovid
                    Butler's persistence and generosity, John O'Kane's perseverance in the
                    field, and the publicity given to the project by James M. Mathes and Elijah Goodwin in the Christian Record were major factors which brought the building project to
                    successful culmination.

            Aids and Suggestions Regarding the Teaching of Indiana History
            Donald F. Carmony
            Obtaining suitable books, pamphlets, maps, and other materials for use in the study and teaching of
                    Indiana history has long been a serious problem for students and teachers alike. Although the need
                    for such material remains substantial, improvement has been made in recent years in both the
                    quantity and quality of available items. Perhaps a concise statement about where and how materials
                    concerning Indiana history can be obtained will be especially useful to teachers and librarians.
                    This statement, however, principally concerns items suitable for use at the seventh- or eighth-grade
                    level. Both teachers and librarians should be able to obtain significant help, at modest cost, from
                    the following sources:
            
               (1) Both individual and library membership is available in the Indiana Historical Society for
                        $5 per calendar year. Annual membership results in the receipt of the monthly Indiana History Bulletin, at least one book about Indiana history, and four
                        quarterly issues of the Indiana Magazine of History. Correspondence concerning
                        membership should be addressed to the Indiana Historical Society, State Library and Historical
                        Building, 
                            Indianapolis
                         4, Indiana.

            Any listing of aids for and suggestions to teachers of Indiana history has important limitations.
                    Since such a list is always incomplete, considerable knowledge and understanding on the part of
                    individual teachers is essential to effective teaching of Indiana history. Capable and resourceful
                    teachers and librarians will manage to find a variety of additional books, pamphlets, maps, films,
                    and the like for use in teaching Indiana history as well as relevant material about the local area
                    in which students live.

               A History of Indiana Literature. By Arthur W. Shumaker. Indiana
                        Historical Collections, Volume XLII. ([
                        Indianapolis
                    ]: Indiana Historical Bureau, 1962. Pp. xi, 611. Frontispiece, index. $7.50.)
                    [Also available from the Indiana Historical Society in a paperbound edition for $3.50.]
            The purpose of this book, as stated in the Introduction, is to substantiate the assertion that
                    "the production of Indiana writers is one of the more significant contributions to American
                    literature made by any state or region." Admittedly, this is not an easy task, not through
                    any lack of Indiana literature, but rather because of the difficulties inherent in both judgment and
                    definition of regional literature. The author, Professor Arthur Shumaker, of DePauw University, has
                    accomplished this aim, certainly, as well as it is likely to be done, and the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau, which published the book, has a volume which may well serve as a guide and model for other
                    alert historical societies to follow. In considering some of the problems which arise from a study
                    of this nature, Professor Shumaker has made some important contributions, it seems to the reviewer,
                    in approach and methodology useful to those who may wish to make similar attempts at writing
                    regional literary history. While he may not have completely solved all problems, he has indicated
                    how such solutions may be approached.
            Indiana seems to have produced more than its share of writers in comparison to other midwestern
                    states. As early as 1827 it was recognized that the Hoosiers were "a scribbling and
                    forthputting people," and literary histories have often tentatively recognized the
                    existence, especially in the early decades of the twentieth century, of a "Hoosier
                    school" of authorship. In analyzing possible causes of this long record of activity,
                    Shumaker suggests, among other reasons, the diversity of Indiana's settlement, its lack of
                    formal educational facilities (leading to folklore and oral traditions of storytelling), its
                    propensity to frontier oratory, and its rural character. It seems certain that there was a
                    recognizable "Hoosier" personality fairly early in the state's history
                    available to writers and sufficiently developed for literary exploitation in a fashion perhaps not
                    true of other states in the traditional Northwest group.
            Next, the author addresses himself to the difficult question: What is an Indiana author? Is he anyone
                    merely born in the state, regardless of other facts about him? Is he anyone who has written about
                    the state, and if so, how much and how well? In nailing down his definition, admittedly a difficult
                    job at best, Professor Shumaker includes in his study those writers who spent most of their lives or
                    their most productive years in Indiana, regardless of their birthplace, and whose  works show conclusive evidence of influence of the Indiana environment.
                    At the same time he excludes those whose works, in quantity or quality, do not meet normal standards
                    of literary attainment. No one, certainly, could quarrel with these decisions and definitions, which
                    reflect historical honesty and common sense. Thus, from a possible total list of 1,563 writers,
                    Professor Shumaker chooses 142 who, from the beginnings of the state to 1939, may reasonably be
                    called Indiana writers.
            Though under this definition Indiana loses claim to authors of such stature as Theodore Dreiser,
                    David Graham Phillips, E. W. Howe, Joaquin Miller, and Jessamyn West, there are an impressive number
                    of authentic Hoosier writers remaining. Of these Professor Shumaker identifies as
                    "major," Edward Eggleston, Booth Tarkington, Meredith Nicholson, and William
                    Vaughn Moody, reserving George Ade, James Whitcomb Riley, and Kin Hubbard for a separate category of
                    major humorists. In the second flight he places Lew Wallace, Maurice Thompson, Charles Major, George
                    Barr McCutcheon, and Gene Stratton Porter. Few will argue with his choices, though among the minor
                    authors there are some fascinating figures whose lives and works deserve not to be neglected.
            But do these authors, Professor Shumaker asks, constitute a singular "Indiana
                    school" of writers, with enough in common in style, method, and theme to warrant the name?
                    They were not a school, he concludes, in any accepted sense, for they wrote for national rather than
                    regional audiences, quite independently of each other, displaying no identifiable set of beliefs
                    that could be called uniquely regional. Yet at the same time, in their use of Indiana materials and
                    attitudes, and through the common influence on them of the Indiana background, they did share in a
                    broader sense something of an Indiana flavor. A list of typical "Hoosier traits,"
                    similar to the one drawn up by Carl Van Doren (pp. 459–460), who wrestled with the
                    problem of the "Indiana point of view" in one of his studies of the novel, may
                    indicate the key to the answer. The characteristics listed as "Hoosier" are in
                    fact indistinguishable from any other traits usually associated with midwestern small-town and rural
                    nineteenth-century life. It may well be, then, that the indefinable "Indiana
                    quality" one finds in these authors is a sort of concentrated essence of the midwestern
                    personality and temperament as it appeared in small-town and rural life and that the great
                    contribution of the Indiana "school," if such exists, lies in observing and
                    exemplifying these things.
            There is, of course, much more in Professor Shumaker's study than can be discussed in a
                    brief review. The volume is a veritable compendium of information about Indiana literary and
                    cultural history, carefully researched and incisively written. In the field of regional history, it
                    seems to be a major achievement, one from which others interested in similar literary and historical
                    problems may learn much about arrangement and interpretation.

                        1497–1550. By Bernard G. Hoffman. (

                    $8.00.)
            As the subtitle indicates, this is a source book–more a factual compendium than an
                    interpretative synthesis. Ethnographic data are scant until the Cartier voyages, and thus much of
                    the book is taken up with study of the maps resulting from the exploration of the period.
                    Cartographic analysis is, of course, a necessary first step for the ethnohistorian. An interesting
                    and valuable feature of the book is the inclusion of a large number of maps (or portions of maps),
                    redrawn and compared, showing the cartographic evolution of the coastline and of place-nomenclature.
                    Hoffman relies heavily, as all who use the early maps of this area must, on the works of Biggar and
                    Ganong.
            The areal scope is not so broad as the subtitle indicates. The author quite naturally concentrates on
                    the region of the St. Lawrence River and Gulf because there is little material available for this
                    period about other parts of the Northeast.
            Dr. Hoffman, an anthropologist with the National Science Foundation, wrote his dissertation
                    (University of 
                        California
                    , 1955) on "The Historical Ethnography of the Micmac of the Sixteenth and
                    Seventeenth Centuries." The present book is a natural outgrowth of this earlier work, and
                    Hoffman mentions the possibility of a companion volume to cover the second half of the sixteenth
                    century. He is also known for his contributions to Ethnohistry, a scholarly
                    journal published at Indiana University.
            The author demonstrates his remarkable interpretative skill especially in the concluding chapters.
                    Perhaps he raises more questions than he answers, but this is as it should be. Many interesting
                    problems are touched upon lightly but not explored, such as the distribution of Eskimos, the
                    identity of the Beothuk, and the fate of the St. Lawrence Iroquois. Surely the last topic will
                    receive thorough treatment in the projected volume covering the period 1550–1600.
            The bibliography and index, so important in a work of this sort, are very full and useful. One can
                    think of a few studies, mostly recent ones, which might have been included in the bibliography but
                    none which is absolutely essential. There are surprisingly few typographical errors for such a
                    detailed work. The reasonable price does not reflect the problems of printing a book so imbued with
                    scholarship.

               The Colonial Image: The Origins of American Culture. Edited by John C. Miller.

                    : George Braziller, 1962. Pp.500. Bibliography. $7.50.)
            John S. Miller's The Colonial Image is another source book of sorts. It is
                    one of a series of six in an American Epochs Series under the general editorship
                    of Frank Freidel. The avowed purpose is to provide  "a
                    compact library of the original sources which supply historians themselves with their basic
                    material." Despite its ambiguity, this is a noble objective. Apart from Merrill
                    Jensen's monumental American Colonial Documents to 1776, there is no
                    general "readings" coverage accorded the colonial period of American history;
                    Professor Miller's volume could have filled a genuine need.
            The problems facing an editor in this area are indeed formidable. Students are entitled to something
                    more than the familiar yet dull documents; and they are surely entitled to more than selections from
                    familiar (and sometimes dull) colonists. Miller's book is essentially an anthology of
                    colonial literature. In this reviewer's humble opinion the selections will neither satisfy
                    the student of early American literature nor the student of early American history—the
                    omissions are too startling in both fields. This is not to say that The Colonial
                    Image is without merit but rather to suggest that it could have been a much more useful book.
            It begins well. Professor Miller has written a delightful introduction, and he prefaces each
                    selection with a few succinct sentences which establish an approximate context for what follows. His
                    selections are from eyewitnesses and participants in "the colonial experience."
                    Frequently the material is lively and enlightening; there is an immediacy to many of the accounts
                    which make them enormously interesting, apart from their historical significance. But there remains
                    the question of how much light these excerpts shed on American cultural beginnings. The fact is that
                    Professor Miller seems to conceive colonial culture in a very narrow fashion. His anthology bears
                    heavily upon such worthies as William Bradford, John Smith, Thomas Morton, the Winthrops, William
                    Byrd, and Benjamin Franklin. The section on religion finds room for Roger Williams, the Mathers, and
                    Jonathan Edwards. A variety of traveler's accounts is also furnished—from
                    William Byrd, Robert Beverley, Dr. Alexander Hamilton, and (inevitably, I suppose), de
                    Crèvecoeur. These seem well-beaten paths. There is so much more to the colonial image
                    than is suggested by this selection. It would have helped to have material reflecting on the
                    colonial professions—the law, education, the press, and especially colonial drama. What
                    of the colonial historians and politicians? Since so much of colonial literature was political literature, Professor Miller's apparent decision to pass it by seems
                    extraordinary.
            In short, the publisher's claims for this volume seem too ambitious and too extravagant.
                    Professor Miller's selections are a shade too personal and arbitrary to exert the charm his
                    felicitous introduction leads the reader to expect. There are some superb pieces
                    here—such as 
                        Franklin
                    's marvelous advice on taking a mistress—but the over-all portrait
                    that emerges is painfully sketchy and lopsided. Colonial culture was the product of an intellectual
                    as well as a physical environment. More attention to the colonists' educational process
                    would have been illuminating. Did the colonists read? What did they read? Did such reading affect
                    their social and political conduct? The Colonial Image is very imperfectly
                    conveyed in the choice of excerpts offered by Professor Miller.
            
            In fairness it must be noted that a further volume is announced for this series. To be edited by
                    Adrienne Koch, The American Enlightenment may very well encompass much of the
                    material eschewed by John Miller. But if this should be the case, the general editor should have
                    indicated as much.

            Despite self-imposed limitations, Professor Higginbotham has written a successful book.
                    Intentionally, he has focused on his subject from very close range and, partly as a result,
                    Morgan's background is not always clear. On the other hand, Higginbotham has searched the
                    manuscripts with apparent care; and since he has a sharp eye for intriguing details, a knack for
                    describing complex matters simply, and a fine understanding of how men fought in revolutionary
                    America, the result is a brisk and enlightening study of the burly teamster who won high rank in 
                        Washington
                    's army.
            This eighteenth-century tale of success lends itself to exciting treatment. Morgan, a rough wagon
                    driver in the northern Shenandoah Valley, managed to gain land, slaves, a common-law wife (whom he
                    later married), and the patronage of influential persons in his community. When the Revolution broke
                    out, Morgan, who had served with Braddock in the wilderness, became captain of a Patriot rifle
                    company. He fought at 
                        Quebec
                     and Saratoga and in much of the Southeast and rose to brigadier general in the
                    Continental Army. At Cowpens, 
                        South Carolina
                    , he achieved a brilliant tactical victory reminiscent of Hannibal's triumph at 
                        Cannae
                    . Afterward, wracked with arthritis, he went home, speculated in military certificates,
                    amassed tens of thousands of acres, ran several business enterprises, and lived affluently as one of
                    the most distinguished gentlemen of the Valley. Ardent Federalist and enemy of those who sympathized
                    with the French Revolution, he took up arms in 1794 against back-country people in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     who refused to pay a federal excise tax. In 1797 he began a term in Congress. Five
                    years later he died.
            In describing these events from a narrow perspective, Higginbotham has left important questions
                    unanswered. Since he says little about the grand strategy of the Revolution, one must look elsewhere
                    to understand fully the part that Morgan played. Higginbotham's analysis of revolutionary
                    politics is sketchy and he does not make clear either what Morgan was fighting for or what Morgan
                    thought he was fighting for. The general, he tells us, battled "foremost for ‘my
                    country’" (p. 211). But what did "my country" signify to
                    Daniel Morgan?
            Lastly, Higginbotham does not explain adequately how Morgan learned the art of war. He describes the
                    general as an "uneducated backwoodsman" (p. 93). Yet this description, which fits
                    the stock frontier general of folklore, hardly matches Daniel Morgan. Morgan  was sufficiently well educated that his letters compare favorably, in
                    quality, with Washington's. Being literate, he could have increased his knowledge of
                    tactics by General Nathanael Greene's method, that is, by reading books. With comrades like 
                        Greene
                     and 
                        Lafayette
                    , it is unlikely that the hero of Cowpens lacked opportunity to discuss previous wars
                    including, perhaps, the wars of Hannibal. Assuming that he took advantage of either possibility for
                    education, Morgan's accomplishments take on a new aspect and become the work not of natural
                    genius and practical experience only but of these plus a knowledeg of the past.
            The problem of Morgan's education is largely a speculative one; and while Higginbotham does
                    ponder other questions, such as the pros and cons of tactical plans, the forte of his book is not
                    interpretation. It is, rather, the lively, carefully organized presentation of facts. For these
                    facts scholars now re-creating Daniel Morgan's world will be grateful.

            Within recent years American economic development has become a popular research subject. Economists
                    and economic historians have carefully investigated different aspects of the economy in different
                    periods and geographic regions in an attempt to explain more fully the factors responsible for
                    economic growth in the 
                        United States
                    . In this connection there has been a new look at the role of government as an influence
                    on economic development.
            The books under review are outstanding contributions to the new literature on economic growth, and
                    they both emphasize the part played by state governments in fostering economic development during
                    the early nineteenth century. In The Enterprise of a Free People Nathan Miller,
                    co-winner of the Beveridge Award in 1959, considers how 
                        New York
                     State furthered economic development between 1792 and 1838. In the first place this was
                    done by state financing of the Erie and Champlain canals after private capital failed to provide the
                    necessary funds. Secondly, Miller shows how 
                        New York
                    , acting through the Commissioners of the Canal Fund, administered canal income to
                    assist growth and stability in the private sectors of the economy. State aid in building 
                        New York
                     canals and the reduced costs of transportation which followed completion of the Erie
                    Canal are well known, but the author has made a distinguished contribution by showing how surplus
                    revenues from the canals, principally between 1831 and 1837, were diffused through the
                    state's economy.
            
            The Commissioners of the Canal Fund found that they had large surplus revenues at their disposal.
                    Since they could not retire canal stock at a favorable price, their only practical alternative was
                    to make deposits and loans to state banks. By depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in banks,
                    the commissioners, perhaps at first unwittingly, found themselves playing an important part in the
                    state's economic development and stability. For example, a large canal deposit in a
                    particular bank could make more credit available and stimulate business in that locality, while a
                    withdrawal by the commissioners might create a scarcity of funds and bring hard times. Although the
                    commissioners could not always be governed by how their actions might affect the economy, they did
                    take into consideration the economic impact of depositing and withdrawing funds on local
                    communities. Canal deposits became an important influence on the economic life of many localities.
            
               
                        New York
                     had many economic assets including natural resources and an ambitious people, but it
                    lacked capital. With the approval of most citizens, this deterrent to economic development was
                    partially removed or at least mitigated by the state government. When people saw that they could not
                    perform a particular task, they turned to government.
            Miller's book is based on a wide range of primary and secondary sources. He has examined the
                    manuscript materials of both private individuals and state officials, as well as going deeply into
                    government documents and newspapers.
            
               Canals and American Economic Development, edited by Carter Goodrich, deals with two
                    main problems: why and by what means were the pre-Civil War canals built; and what effect did they
                    have on the American economy. Goodrich has written an introduction and conclusion, while the main
                    part of the book has been done by Julius Rubin, H. Jerome Cranmer, and Harvey H. Segal.
            In the first two chapters Julius Rubin discusses the important political decisions associated with
                    building the Erie Canal and the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Mainline. These decisions involved government planning and state aid on a large scale.
                    He points out that it was in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     that the first public debate took place between the supporters of canals and railroads.
                    The decision of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to build canals over most of the Mainline system was probably a mistake in the long
                    run, but it is easily understood when the strong sentiment for canals during that period is
                    considered. While 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     built their main canals with state aid, Mr. Cranmer shows that 
                        New Jersey
                     relied on private enterprise to construct its principal projects, the Morris and the 
                        Delaware
                     and Raritan canals. The author quickly punctures the enthusiasm of any modern laissez
                    faire advocates who might cheer this decision when he explains that 
                        New Jersey
                    's decision to rely on private enterprise was not based on any ideological or
                    philosophical objections to state aid. Rather, state help was rejected because of conflicting
                    economic interests which thought they would not get their full benefits from the state-financed
                    enterprises.
            In the last two chapters, Harvey H. Segal shows that there was not one major wave of canal building
                    but three definite cycles of construction between 1815 and 1860. He then evaluates and analyzes  the investments in canal construction, basing his estimates on
                    new materials, and concludes by showing how canals contributed to economic development in the years
                    before the Civil War. He provides firm substantiation for the general view that by connecting the
                    northern Atlantic Seaboard and the Northwest, canals stimulated and promoted rapid economic growth.
            
               The Enterprise of a Free People and Canals and American Economic Development are
                    "must" reading for anyone wanting a better understanding of American economic
                    development in the first half of the nineteenth century. Moreover, these volumes are not just of
                    historical interest; they carry contemporary implications for underdeveloped countries in the
                    mid-twentieth century. Both books are clearly written and purged of excess fat. Here are examples of
                    where writers have given readers the results of their research and not all of the
                    research itself. The authors are careful in drawing conclusions and do not claim more than their
                    evidence warrants.
            Supporters of laissez faire will be disturbed by these books; however, the record is clear that our
                    ancestors relied heavily upon government to foster and promote economic development in the early
                    nineteenth century. Where government could be used to benefit society, American citizens had the
                    good sense to use it as an instrument of economic growth and social betterment. They seldom entered
                    into doctrinaire discussions regarding the right of the state to promote enterprise. Their approach
                    was pragmatic and these studies further substantiate the idea that the growth of government
                    functions and responsibilities in the 
                        United States
                     has come from needs the people could not supply for themselves rather than from any
                    foreign ideology.

            Brackenridge was a native of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     who resided in 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Louisiana
                     between 1810 and 1814. In 1811 he was invited by Manuel Lisa, an important member of
                    the 
                        Missouri
                     Fur Company at 
                        St. Louis
                    , to accompany him on a trip up the Missouri River. In the
                    descriptive journal which Brackenridge kept he not only recorded the daily activities of the group,
                    but he also took note of the weather, the condition of the land along the way, animal life, and
                    perhaps most interesting of all, the encounters of his party with the Indians and the impressions
                    thus received.
            In the first portion of the book the author relates the various explorations of the Spanish and
                    French and discusses the historical determinants of the boundaries of the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase which were so much in doubt. He had extensive knowledge concerning the natural
                    setting of the country and its mineral wealth, as well as the uses that were being made of it at
                    that time and those possible in the future.  In accordance with
                    the belief of the times, he noted that the wooded areas had generally good soil but that the barren
                    plains "can scarcely be said to admit of settlement" (p. 29).
            The second part of the book presents a similar detailed account of the 
                        Missouri
                     Territory but includes in addition an explanation of its political subdivisions and
                    population. The appendix contains extracts from other works pertaining to the Indian mounds of the
                    region and the Trappist monks in the American Bottom; and there is also a short account of another
                    journey into the upper reaches of the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase. Throughout the book are tables concerning the length, conditions, and sources
                    of rivers, and the location, population, and trade of the various Indian nations.
            The dust jacket explains that this work was selected for re-publication since the Journal "is regarded as a notably precise and valuable contemporary document on
                    the early 
                        Missouri
                     fur trade and on the Indians of the area." This book is presented as it was
                    first published; it is not an edited work. Views of

                    source materials that have long been out of print. It thus promises to be a great boon to librarians
                    as well as scholars, both of whom occasionally feel the pinch of a limited budget when buying older
                    editions. The series is under the general editorship of Dr. O. Lawrence Burnette, Jr., of the State

            Here, at long last, is a highly reliable biography of James Buchanan by a scholar who thoroughly
                    understands both the man and the nineteenth-century environment in which he operated. So far as this
                    reviewer knows, no significant attempt has been made to narrate and analyze all the events of
                    Buchanan's long and active life since the publication of George T. Curtis'
                    biography in 1883. Since that date not only have Buchanan's Works been
                    published by John Bassett Moore and numerous manuscript collections been opened to scholars, but
                    many portions of the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century have been examined in detail by a
                    succession of able historians—one might cite Roy F. Nichols" works on the
                    Democratic party in the 1850's as an outstanding example.
            Professor Klein makes excellent use of this voluminous literature while basing his work solidly on
                    manuscript sources. Starting with Buchanan's forebears, the author traces the growth and
                    development of the fifteenth president through his early life and, especially, through his early
                    years in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     politics. He is convinced (and the reviewer heartily agrees) that no one who is not
                    intimately familiar  with Buchanan's personality and
                    character traits (which developed early) and the nature of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     political environment in which he was "blooded" can possibly
                    understand and evaluate the man. From these early years emerged the attention to detail, cautious
                    conservatism, reverence for property rights, ability to manipulate political fragments to form
                    coalition support, adherence to strict legalism, insistence upon the necessity for party regularity,
                    emphasis on restraint, and the coolly calculating political brain that marked Buchanan's
                    later career. Klein makes crystal clear the logical development of these traits in the first half of
                    his volume, which carries the 
                        Pennsylvanian
                     through his tenure as secretary of state, ending in 1849.
            Giving only brief attention to the intervening years, the author devotes most of the rest of the
                    volume to the period from 1854 to 1861. There will be more dissenting opinions filed on this portion
                    of the work than on the initial part. Defenders of Stephen A. Douglas will not be pleased with
                    Klein's evaluation of the 
                        Illinois
                     Senator's role in the passage of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act or his treatment of the southern election tour in 1860. His analysis of the 
                        Kansas
                     troubles and political complications growing out of them will seem to some excessively
                    prosouthern and his treatment of the "Seccession Winter" is more favorable to
                    Buchanan than most. These accounts are heavily documented, but it must be said that consideration of
                    facts presented and perusal of sources cited do not seem to this reviewer to lead inevitably to all
                    of the conclusions reached by Professor Klein. His characterization of Buchanan, however, is that of
                    a man whose every action might have been predicted with considerable accuracy by anyone who knew his
                    personality, character, and political creed. This portion of the book should prove valuable in
                    creating a more honest and less emotional image of Buchanan than previous ones. The author is
                    undoubtedly correct, for instance, in asserting that Lincoln's policy of dealing with
                    secession differed from Buchanan's in no important particulars, and he clearly brings an
                    air of cool reason to the impassioned 
                        Kansas
                     issue. His observations on the political significance of Sumter to the Republican party
                    have undoubted validity. Well aware of Buchanan's personal and political faults, Klein has
                    produced a biography which is sympathetic but by no means idolatrous.
            One or two minor dissents might be registered. The tendency to cite secondary works as the basis for
                    accounts of congressional activities is surprising in a work so heavily based on primary materials.
                    Also, is it completely correct to say that "antislavery extremists hailed [John] 
                        Brown
                     as a hero" (p. 254) after the Pottawatomie massacre in 1856? And, finally, it
                    is unfortunate that a book of this high quality should not have been subjected to more rigorous
                    proofreading which would have eliminated the numerous minor and inconsequential errors.
            Nonetheless this is an excellent and highly significant volume. It is well written, intensively
                    researched, and the product of careful and mature scholarship. It has been twenty-five years in the
                    making and is worth every day of it.

               Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850's. By Don E. Fehrenbacher. (

            Significant political episodes which occurred during the 1850's in which Abraham Lincoln was
                    a conspicuous participant are re-examined in this volume, making more understandable his spectacular
                    advancement to the presidency. The seven separate essays borrow heavily from monographs by the
                    author already published in leading historical magazines.
            Mr. Fehrenbacher's critical review of other writers with whom he has found himself in
                    disagreement has prompted him to divide Lincoln biographers into two schools: the
                    "panegyrists" represented by Josiah G. Holland and Isaac N. Arnold; and the
                    "revisionists" of whom he names Donald W. Riddle and several other prominent
                    historians, among them noted Indiana authors (p. 21).
            Discussing the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     question, Riddle states that Lincoln was not "fighting for a cause"
                    but "to advance his own political standing" (p. 22). Fehrenbacher prefers the
                    middle view between "hero worship and cynicism," recognizing Lincoln's
                    "moral convictions" as well as his practical politics (p. 22).
            Another "revisionist," James G. Randall, was born in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , graduated from 
                        Butler
                    , and became a member of its faculty. His reaction to the debates, from the
                    author's viewpoint, discovers no "vital principles" at stake but finds
                    instead an "exciting show" by partisans (p. 109). The widely accepted assertion by
                    another Hoosier, Albert J. Beveridge, that Lincoln's House Divided speech was his paramount
                    move "in the game for the Presidency," is strongly refuted by Fehrenbacher, who
                    can discover no contemporary record confirming it (p. 73). He draws the conclusion that
                    "Beveridge like James G. Randall found his true hero for the 1850's in Stephen A.
                    Douglas" (p. 161).
            The most uncomplimentary criticisms are reserved for Herndon's Lincoln,
                    written by Jesse W. Weik in a room over a grocery store at 
                        Greencastle
                    , Indiana, the town where Weik was born. The sources Herndon supplied for Weik are
                    described as having been "distilled from memory and imagination … a kind of
                    retrospective ghost writing" (p. 72). This description is especially applicable to
                    statements about the House Divided speech. Herndon's statements on the "Second 
                        Freeport
                     Question" are recorded as "second hand, based on a dubious
                    source" (p. 124).
            The author's criticisms are also directed to a recent contributor, Reinhard H. Luthin. The
                    supposed aloofness of Lincoln towards the founding members of the Republican group, which Luthin
                    supports, is pointed out as another instance of Herndon leading "scholarship
                    astray" (p. 45). Luthin declares that up to 1860, Lincoln "had left no record of
                    achievement, except the quest for office" (p. 161).
            A brief essay in the biographical note states that the "revisionists'"
                    theory about the causes of the Civil War led them to become "to a  certain extent, anti-Lincoln." They discredited and questioned
                    the soundness of his "anti-slavery stand," qualified his "sympathy for
                    the Negro," placed his "political opportunism" above his
                    "idealism," minimized his reputed "stature" during the
                    1850's and limited his "greatness" to the presidential terms (pp. 169,
                    170). The author has been successful in showing that there were some great moments for Abraham
                    Lincoln, even in the groundwork of the decade preceding his elevation to the nation's
                    highest office.
