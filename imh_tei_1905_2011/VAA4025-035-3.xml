                    cooperated in this unprecedented commemoration. It was a celebration conceived and carried through
                    to a noteworthy achievement around the living survivors, both Union and Confederate, of the battle

            <p>In the North, the battle fought on this field is known as the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the war of which it was a part, as the Civil War. In the South this battle is
                    known as the Battle of Sharpsburg, and the war as the War Between the States. The story of the

                    paper wrapped around what proved to be, upon examination, three cigars tied with a string. Private
                    Mitchell was no longer interested in stacking arms or making camp. Fortunately, he immediately
                    untied the string and unwrapped the paper from the cigars. For some unaccountable reason, instead of
                    crumpling up the wrapper and throwing it away, he examined the paper and understood its contents
                    sufficiently to know that he should take it immediately to First Sergeant John M. Bloss of his
                    company. Bloss, upon inspection of the paper, hurried with private <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Colonel Silas Colgrove, commanding the Twenty-seventh Indiana regiment. Colonel
                    Colgrove, upon hastily glancing at the paper, became much excited and the three hastened to the
                    headquarters of General A. S. Williams, commanding the Twelfth Corps, and delivered the paper to
                    Colonel S. E. Pitman of General Williams' staff, who delivered its personally to General
                    George B. McClellan, then commanding the Army of the Potomac.</p>
            <p>The paper, astounding as it may seem, was a duly authenticated copy, addressed to D. H. Hill, of
                    General Lee's "Order No. 191", dividing his Army of Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and detailing the routes over which the different units of his army were moving at that
                    very hour. His plan of campaign was contrary to every military principle in that it involved
                    dividing his army for the purpose of capturing Harper's Ferry and the immense army stores
                    concentrated there. Such a division of his army and separation of his forces in the face of the
                    Federal army was beyond question dangerous." However, Lee's knowledge of the
                    cautious and slow-moving McClellan doubtless made the move appear entirely feasible to him and
                    likely of success without involving undue risk. But Lee had not anticipated the discovery of his
                    plans. His purpose had been to destroy the <placeName>

                        plan that was excellent, and which would prolkbly have succeeded but for the "lost

            <p>McClellan, however, upon receipt of the lost order gained a full knowledge of Lee's plans
                    and instantly realizing his great good fortune acted with unaccustomed vigor and promptness. The
                    battles of South Mountain and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> were fought as a result of the carelessness of an officer of Lee and of the keen-eyed
                    observation and intelligent action of a private Indiana soldier. So much by way of explanation of
                    the preparation and setting for the Battle of <placeName>

            <p>It is not necessary to describe in any detail the formation and movements of the lines of battle on
                    either side, for, interesting as the story is in all its details, the purpose of this paper is
                    chiefly to present the battlefield seventy-five years after the battle and to direct attention to
                    the noteworthy significance of the unprecedented anniversary commemoration. However, this purpose
                    obviously cannot be intelligently and clearly developed without reviewing in some manner the
                    movements of the opposing armies.</p>
            <p>Following the battle of South Mountain on September 14, when McClellan had overtaken Hill, and
                        Longstreet<hi rend="sup">3</hi> had been turned back by Lee to aid Hill in holding the passes
                    against the Union forces, Lee ordered Hill and Longstreet to Sharpsburg to join the main body of his
                    army then marching south from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On September 16, the Confederate right lay at what came to be known as Burnside Bridge

                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>

            <p>Ultimately Burnside was on the Federal left at the bridge that was to take his name, facing the

                    facing Stonewall Jackson and D. H. Hill across the famous sunken road, long since known as Bloody

            <p>McClellan's orders developed the battle in three parts definite phases of the day's
                    fighting. In the early morning of September 17, McClellan hurled General, Hooker's First
                    Corps against the Confederate lines two miles north of Sharpsburg along the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> road. After an hour of hard fighting, Stonewall Jackson's old division,
                    supported by Hood and Early,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> repulsed Hooker's attack. During the
                    engagement, however, Hooker had destroyed the brigades of Lawton, Hays and Trimble<hi rend="sup">7</hi> and opened in the Confederate lines a disastrous gap, through which Hooker's corps
                    poured down the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> toward the Dunkard Church, until Hood's division, held in reserve in the west
                    woods, rose from its ambush and threw them back and held them until its own ammunition was
                    exhausted, when the Confederates were in turn repulsed by Mansfield's Twelfth Corps. Again
                    and again, each side attacked and was repulsed with heavy losses. The battle raged fiercely for two
                    hours. General Mansfield was killed. Green's<hi rend="sup">8</hi> division of the Twelfth
                    Corps held the Dunkard Church. When the firing ceased for a short interval, General Sumner with the
                    Second Corps came on the field. Sedgewick's<hi rend="sup">9</hi> division began the assault
                    in close formation with brigade front, three brigades deep. They passed to the right of
                    Green's division at the Dunkard Church and advanced toward the west woods. Suddenly
                    Sedgewick found himself and his division almost surrounded by Confederates under Early, Walker,
                        McLaws<hi rend="sup">10</hi> and the remnants of Jackson's old division. Then followed
                    one of the bloodiest engagements of the war. In twenty minutes more than twenty-two hundred officers
                    and men fell, and Sedgewick, forced into the open ground beyond the woods, was compelled to fall
                    back. Thus ended the early morning phase of the three-phase battle.</p>
            <p>About mid-morning, McClellan launched his second attack, against the Confederate center. The
                    remaining divisions of the Second Corps came on the field around ten o'clock, French on the

                    end of Bloody Lane. The lane was defended by four brigades of D. H. Hill's Division,
                    Jackson's command, and four brigades of R. H. Anderson's Division in
                    Longstreet's command. It has been often said by those competent to judge, that more
                    desperate fighting than occurred here along and across this sunken road did not take place anywhere
                    during the entire war. An enfilading fire by McClellan left the Bloody Lane heaped with Confederate
                    dead, two to five deep, but Hill withstood three such Union attacks; on the fourth successive attack
                    the Confederate line broke, but Hill in an insane rage rallied some two hundred men and with utter
                    recklessness charged the Union flank. Whereupon, General Sumner ordered General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> to withdraw his troops. The Cen-federates were again out of ammunition, were utterly
                    exhausted and some of them were apparently walking in a dazed condition without semblance of order
                    or command. Thus ended the second phase of the battle.</p>
            <p>Within thirty minutes, 4,915 men had fallen, killed or seriously wounded, in a <placeName>

                    and ever after more accurately described as the "Bloody Lane".</p>
            <p>The third phase of the battle was a Union attack by General Burnside, from the Union left, at the
                    bridge crossing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> Creek, now known as Burnside Bridge. General Burnside with fourteen thousand men faced
                    the Confederate General Toombs<hi rend="sup">12</hi> with two <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> regiments strongly entrenched on the rocky bluff overlooking the bridge. Realizing that
                    here was the key to Lee's right, Burnside hammered away for hours. Two additional regimentq
                    were brought to Toombs' support. At one o'clock in the afternoon Burnside carried
                    the bridge, and by doing so, cut off Lee's only avenue of escape should he lose the battle.
                    But his success was short-lived, for out of the streets of Sharpsburg and to the bridge suddenly
                    stormed Lee's missing division of three thousand men under A. P. Hill, which had been
                    hurried over the miles from Harper's Ferry. Burnside was driven back across the <placeName>

                    they had established the day before. The losses in that day's fighting were staggering; it
                    was "the bloodiest single day of fighting of the war." Lee had lost 10,700 men and
                    eleven generals; McClellan had lost 12,400 men and nine generals. Estimates of the strength of the
                    opposing armies differ. Perhaps a conservative estimate of the Union strength would be eighty-seven
                    thousand men, of whom not more than sixty thousand were engaged in the battle. The Confederate
                    strength, as estimated by General Lee in his report of the battle, was under forty thousand. The
                    total casualties, therefore, in the day's fight aggregated more than twenty-three thousand
                    out of about one hundred thousand engaged in the battle.</p>
            <p>A word as to Indiana's part at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> may not be uninteresting. Indiana had but four regiments of infantry, the Seventh,
                    Fourteenth, Nineteenth and Twenty-seventh, and one separate battalion of cavalry made up of six
                    companies that took part in the third phase of the battle. No state was more creditably represented
                    on the battlefield in each phase of the battle.</p>
            <p>The Third Indiana Cavalry was stationed near the middle bridge over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek, constituting a part of the cavalry command of General Pleasanton. Although its
                    losses were not large, it played a very important part in the day's battle.</p>
            <p>The Fourteenth Indiana Regiment reached the Bloody Lane, thus placing it in the thickest of the
                    fighting. The regiment carried into the battle three hundred twenty men of whom one hundred and
                    eighty-one were killed or wounded in the day's fighting.</p>
            <p>The Twenty-seventh Indiana Regiment is next in losses sustained in this battle. This regiment was
                    placed in an open field between the Dunkard Church and the corn-field in which the Confederates were
                    concealed in the early morning. The regiment went into battle with four hundred forty men, of whom
                    two hundred and nine were killed or wounded in the engagement in which General Mansfield, commanding
                    the corps, was killed.</p>
            <p>The Nineteenth Indiana had been so cut to pieces the previous two weeks at Manassas, or Second Bull
                    Run, and South Mountain that the number carried into action was <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-035-3-009"/>
                    small. Nevertheless the day's fighting yielded nine killed and sixty-three wounded. The
                    loss of the Seventh was small because it was held in reserve.</p>
            <p>Colonel Fox, in his <hi rend="i">Regimental Losses</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">13</hi> places the Fourteenth
                    and Twenty-seventh Indiana among the first twenty regiments engaged in this battle—a very
                    creditable percentage to furnish two out of the first twenty, with only five regiments in the
                    battle. The Third Indiana Cavalry sustained the greatest loss of any cavalry regiment in the battle
                    in proportion to its enrollment.</p>
            <p>Nor has our state failed properly to recognize this outstanding service. Men from each of the Indiana
                    regiments that fought in this battle are buried in the National Cemetery at Sharpsburg. Their memory
                    and that of all Indiana soldiers who saw action there is honored by a granite shaft fifty feet high
                    near the center of the battlefield. Markers in five different locations show the positions of the
                    regiments when the battle ended or where they saw their hardest fighting.</p>

                    spirit in which commemoratioE of the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> was conceived, I wish to quote a single sentence from Governor Marshall's
                    address. "I have come," he said, "to discharge a splendid
                    duty—the duty of consecrating and dedicating this monument to the common soldiers of
                    Indiana who thought life cheap if with it they might purchase a reunited people." This
                    sentiment was the same that inspired the <placeName>

            <p>It is a matter of note that this battle served to give President Lincoln an opportune time for
                    issuing his Emancipation Proclamation, first prepared in July, but held for a Union victory before
                    making it public. The emancipation policy is believed to have proved helpful in keeping <placeName>

            <p>The observance and celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the battle, on September 17, 1937,
                    was conceived with the high purpose that the survivors of this battle, both Union and Confederate,
                    should themselves together write the last chapter of a permanent and lasting peace on the
                    battlefield where three score and fifteen years before they had fought each other to the death in
                    the absolute conviction that each was right. Pitifully and pathetically few were those who now came
                    together for this final, impressive, unprecedented ceremony. Of the seventy-five thousand survivors
                    of both armies after the battle but sixty-five were living when the anniversary celebration was
                    held. Of this fragment of both Union and Confederate soldiers who participated in the battle, but
                    twenty-one were physically able to make the trip from their homes to the battlefield where the
                    President sealed the final and lasting peace between North and South in their presence, with more
                    than sixty thousand spectators—the largest number ever upon the battlefield at one time
                    since the battle.</p>
            <p>It was, indeed, a moving, thrilling occasion. The setting seemed another world for those in whose
                    special honor this celebration had been arranged. Few of them had seen the battlefield within the
                    intervening years. The program carried through for two days preceding the final episode served to
                    complete every important detail for the historically accurate re-enactment of one of the most
                    appalling phases of the battle.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting of these preliminary experiences was the visit to the battlefield by the
                    survivors of the battle during the afternoon preceding the commemoration program. It was all but
                    impossible for one to realize <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-035-3-011"/> that these men, all now above
                    ninety years of age, most of them ninety-four to ninety-eight, had themselves engaged in that
                    terrific struggle. They were now describing their positions on the battlefield with convincing
                    detail and incident, but without a discordant note in the complete reconciliation they were
                    cementing and sealing as their last act upon the memorable site. Impressive and stirring beyond the
                    power of description were the stories and recollections related by these Union and Confederate
                    veterans as they recalled their different positions on the field during the fighting on September
                    17, 1862. After listening to these personal reminiscences, one marvelled, not that twenty-five per
                    cent of all engaged were killed or wounded. but that the number of casualties and survivors was not
                    reversed.</p>
            <p>The President, born twenty years after the battle, spoke from a small stand, perhaps twenty-five feet
                    square, in which was seated every survivor of the battle, Union or Confederate, who had the
                    strength, notwithstanding his more than ninety years, to get to the battlefield. The President was
                    introduced by Senator Millard Tydings, Chairman of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> Celebration Commission. The introduction was a tactful and masterful performance. The
                    theme of Mr. Roosevelt's address was "not only acting but also thinking in
                    national terms." He stood barely a stone's throw from the famous sunken road where
                    the Union artillery had enfiladed Stonewall Jackson's troops and filled it almost to its
                    banks with dead. Today the Bloody Lane is a peaceful, green country road, part of a national
                    battlefield and lined with memorial markers and monuments which constitute the only visible proof of
                    the desperate struggle of three quarters of a century ago.</p>
            <p>It was in and about this road, following the brief address of the President, that the Bloody Lane
                    phase of the battle of seventy-five years before was re-enacted in all its important details by
                    twenty-five hundred <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName> and District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> National Guardsmen. In the reenactment, the opposing armies, in ratio of nine to six in
                    favor of the Union army, as it was on September 17, 1862, were dressed in distinctive uniforms,
                    though not in blue or gray, and the most minute details of the Bloody Lane phase were carried out,
                    requiring an hour and a half. During this re-enactment, the movements of troops, their commanders
                        <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-035-3-012"/> and positions were described over a public address system
                    by the chairman of the military committee of the Commemoration with clearness and accuracy. Thus
                    ended the final chapter of the seventy-fifth anniversary program of the commemoration of the Battle
                    of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in several respects was similar to the commemoration nine months previously of the

                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The underlying purpose—symbolizing a permanent peace between north and
                    south—was the same. In each instance the commemoration program reached its climax in the
                    presence of survivors who had participated in the battle on both sides, although at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the attendance of survivors was not restricted to those who had participated in the
                    battle. In this respect obviously there can never be another such commemoration on any battlefield
                    of the Civil War. In the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName> celebration the special effort was to secure the attendance of those who had

            <p>Before discussing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> commemoration it would seem pertinent to review hastily and very generally the three
                    days' battle which this celebration commemorated. Neither army knew definitely the
                    whereabouts of the other army when the first shot of the battle was fired on the morning of July 1,
                    1863, and neither commander had any clear conception as to when or where the opposing armies would
                    meet. General Lee, fresh from a decisive triumph over Hooker in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, was invading <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and bringing the war home to the north, General George G. Meade, three days
                    previously, had succeeded General Hooker and was charged <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-035-3-013"/> with
                    the responsibility of stopping the Confederate invasion. Neither Meade nor Lee knew definitely the
                    other's plans nor the movements of his troops. Consequently when General Hill reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the advance corps of the Confederate army, the stage was unwittingly set for the
                    battle which began within a few hours.</p>
            <p>The night before the first day of the battle, scouts sent out by General John Buford, who had the
                    only Federal troops within five miles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Confederates had Hill near Cashtown, Longstreet was with Lee about eight miles
                    farther west, Pickett at Chambersburg and Rodes<hi rend="sup">15</hi> and Early near Heidlersburg,
                    ten miles northeast of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday morning, July 1, 1863, Hill and Buford clashed about a mile and a half west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the Chambersburg road while Hill was carrying out his plan to march into the town.
                    The Confederates reached Willoughby Run before eight o'clock and encountered Union cavalry,
                    including three squadrons of the Third Indiana Cavalry under command of Colonel George H. Chapman,
                    troops that General Buford had advanced, dismounted, to the creek.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> For two
                    hours or more this force fought the strong infantry brigade of Archer and Davis, holding them in

                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with the First Corps. It is worthy of note here that in this first attack of the three
                    days' battle, Indiana troops participated in such creditable manner as to receive the
                    special commendation of the division commander, General Buford. It is likewise a matter of interest
                    that this cavalry regiment was commanded by Colonel George H. Chapman, a resident of <placeName>

                    distinction of having sustained the highest percentage of losses of any Indiana regiment during the
                    war, and this distinction was largely due to the heavy losses sustained in the first engagement of
                    the three days' battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the morning of July 1. It went into action at the beginning of this engagement with
                    279 effective officers and men; of this number 156 were killed or seriously wounded and fifty-four
                    were slightly wounded and taken prisoners, making the total loss sustained by this regiment during
                    its first day's battle 210 of the 279 who went into action. The father of Dr. M. L. Haines,

                    </placeName>, founded in 1780, is the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Adams County</region>
                    </placeName> and is located about forty miles southwest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harrisburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and seven miles north of the southern boundary of the state. Its population at the time
                    of the battle was less than fifteen hundred and today is about six thousand. The town is about the
                    center of the battlefield as the fighting on July first was north and west of it, while on the
                    second and third, the fighting was on the south and east of it. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> is situated in a beautiful valley between two ridges, which are now classic by reason
                    of the importance attaching to them from the battle.</p>
            <p>The hill west of the town is Seminary Ridge, the Luthek an Theological Seminary located there giving
                    it the name. The Ridge runs for many miles northeast and southwest, a portion of it being the line
                    held by the Federal troops during the first day's battle and forming the principal line of
                    defense of the Confederate army during the remainder of the battle.</p>
            <p>The ridge south of the town is Cemetery Ridge, so named because Evergreen, the town cemetery, was
                    located thereon, on the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a half mile from the town. It is an interesting fact that during the second and third
                    days of the battle some of the hardest fighting occurred in or about the cemetery grounds,
                    notwithstanding a sign on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> at the entrance to the cemetery which forbade <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-035-3-015"/> the
                    discharge of fire arms within its boundaries. Cemetery Ridge begins in Cemetery Hill a few hundred
                    yards northeast of the cemetery entrance and extends south for about two and a half miles, nearly
                    parallel with Seminary Ridge, rising to Little Round Top and again, a little to the south, rising to
                    (Big) Round Top. This ridge formed the main line of the Federal army during the second and third
                    days' battles; the wheatfield and the peach orchard are west and slightly north of Little
                    Round Top. A short distance from the cemetery toward the east, this ridge bends sharply to the right
                    forming two rocky and woody prominences—spangler's Hill and Culp's
                    Hill—terminating in Wolf's Hill, a steep knob to the east beyond Rock Creek.</p>

                    </placeName> almost as regularly as the spokes of a wagon wheel at the hub. From these unusual
                    facilities for the movement and concentration of large bodies of troops, together with the
                    conformation of the surrounding hills and fields, one cannot escape the feeling that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been designed by nature for a battlefield.</p>
            <p>The Union forces held a slight advantage during the greater part of the forenoon of the first
                    day's fightfing until the arrival of Rodes' and Early's divisions of
                        Ewell's<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Corps about noon turned the tide in favor of the South.
                    The Union forces were finally beaten back into the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and through the town to the south side, closely followed by the Confederate troops. The
                    Union force in action lost half its men, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for the time being, was lost. However, the Federal troops succeeded in reaching
                    Cemetery Hill southeast of the town after the enemy had ceased pursuit; Steinwehr's<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Division was engaged most of the afternoon in fortifying the hill. In the
                    meantime, in mid-afternoon, General Lee reached the field from Cashtown and witnessed the retreat of
                    the Union lines through the town. He ordered Ewell to follow up the enemy if he thought it
                    practical, but Ewell, fortunately for the Federal troops, did not do this for the reason he
                    afterwards gave, that his men were tired and that Cemetery Hill was so situated that he could not
                    bring his artillery to bear on the Union forces. He thought his men could not take the hill. Many
                    critics consider this to have been Lee's greatest opportunity to win the battle.</p>

            <p>Lee was anxious to hasten the arrival of General Pickett, who was in charge of the rear guard at
                    Chambersburg, with three of his brigades. He did not arrive, however, until the afternoon of July 2,
                    and was not pressed into service until the afternoon of the third. During the night of the first,
                    the Union forces had an opportunity to establish a line of defense that enabled them to hold off the
                    Confederates during the terrific fighting of the following day, the second day of the battle. On the
                    evening of the first, at Taneytown, about fourteen miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the larger part of General Meade's troops had been halted, scouts had
                    informed him of the results of the first day's fighting. Accordingly, Meade rushed every
                    available man that he had to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and he himself arrived on the field shortly after midnight. After surveying the
                    situation at daybreak, he laid plans for the disposition of his various corps as soon as they should
                    arrive.</p>
            <p>Both Meade and Lee spent part of the morning of the second day in the arrangement of their lines of
                    battle. The two had their forces formed at a distance of about a mile and a quarter apart, Meade on
                    Cemetery Ridge and Lee on Seminary Ridge. Lee intended to attack in the morning, but because of
                    Longstreet's delay in getting his troops into position, he did not strike until afternoon.
                    He attacked the left end of Meade's line. When Lee had planned his attack it was with the
                    belief that Meade's left terminated at the peach orchard. He did not know that Sickled<hi rend="sup">20</hi> advance line extended to the left from the salient at the peach orchard
                    through the wheatfield to Devil's Den.</p>
            <p>In the most desperate phase of this attack, Longstreet hurried every battery, every gun into action;
                    he pushed forward every regiment to the firing line. He believed he could take Cemetery Ridge
                    yet—on the evening of the second day. Finally, the wheatfield was all that remained
                    between Longstreet and Cemetery Ridge! The wheatfield became a seething whirlpool. At 5:30 the
                    battle lost all form of regularity—lines swayed, twisted, surged. Over and again the
                    Confederates all but succeeded in taking the Round Tops, and doubtless would have done so except for
                    the stubborn defense of the Union forces directed by General <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>

                    o'clock against Meade's left on the afternoon and evening of July 2 did not
                    constitute the high tide of the Rebellion and mark the success of the Union army at <placeName>

            <p>The Fourteenth Indiana lost thirty-one in killed and wounded. The Twentieth Indiana was engaged for
                    two hours in the desperate fighting between the wheatfield and Little Round Top, during which attack
                    Colonel Wheeler, in command of the regiment, was killed. This regiment had engaged in the battle
                    twenty-six officers and four hundred men. It lost two officers and thirty men killed, nine officers
                    and one hundred and five men wounded, and ten missing, making a total of 156 casualties of its 426
                    engaged.</p>
            <p>The Confederate attack next began on Meade's right. From Benner's Hill northeast of
                    the town, Ewell's artillery opened fire on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Ridge, where
                    the Union forces were well protected by earthworks, after Long-street had begun the attack on
                    Meade's left. On account of the destructive fire of Union batteries on East Cemetery Hill,
                    Ewell lost almost all of his guns and no advance was made by the infantry until
                    Longstreet's assault on the left had ended.</p>
            <p>At sundown came a final attack with General Johnson's iniantry advancing against
                    Culp's Hill and Early against East Cemetery Hill. Rodes, who was directed to move against
                    West Cemetery Hill, having farther to go than the others, was unable to carry out instructions on
                    time, and General Walker, who had been sent to guard Ewell's flank and who was expected to
                    assist in this attack, was prevented from doing so by a detachment of Union cavalry of
                    Gregg's division which had arrived by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Road in the forenoon. The second day's fighting ended about nine
                    o'clock in the evening.</p>
            <p>The attack of the Confederates lasting through the afternoon, was conducted with great courage, much
                    of it up rough slopes of woodland, over boulders that now seem insurmountable. On East Cemetery Hill
                    the fight among the Union guns became a hand to hand engagement with clubbed muskets, stones and
                    rammers used to stop the enemy. A portion of the hill, in fact, was taken for a time, but the Union
                    troops held practically all of their territory.</p>

                    fighting of the afternoon. The Fourteenth Indiana Regiment was in the heaviest of the fighting under

                    </placeName> on Cemetery Hill at the beginning of the Confederate attack, and the Twentieth Indiana
                    participated in the furious whirlpool as the fighting surged back and forth in the wheat-field.</p>
            <p>In the evening Confederate attack on Culp's Hill, Indiana was represented by the
                    Seventeenth. Fortunately its position, well up on the hill, was sb protected by breastworks and the
                    enormous stones on that part of the hill that its losses were not as heavy as those of the other
                    Indiana regiments engaged in the battle. The regiment's total losses during the evening in
                    killed and wounded aggregated ten men.</p>

                    that the Union army would continue its defensive tactics the following day. As Lee had attacked both
                    wings of Meade's line on the second, it was expected that if another attack were made on
                    the morning of the third, it would be against the center. This conjecture proved to be correct.</p>
            <p>Lee's general plan for the next day was unchanged. Longstreet, reinforced by the three
                    brigades under Pickett, that had arrived during the afternoon of the second, was ordered to attack
                    the Union center the next morning, and General Ewell was directed to attack Meade's right
                    at the same time. Ewell, during the night, reinforced General Johnson<hi rend="sup">??</hi> with
                    three brigades from Rodes' and Early's divisions.</p>
            <p>Neither army was given much rest during the night of July 2. The fighting continued until late and
                    the Confederates managed to gain a portion of Culp's Hill. Very early on the morning of the
                    third, General Meade determined to retake the portion of the hill that he had lost the previous
                    evening. From four o'clock in the morning of July 3 until about half past ten, Slocum for
                    the Union Army and Johnson for the Confederate, waged a bitter fight. The former tried to edge the
                    Confederates off the part of the hill they had taken the evening before, while the latter was not
                    only attempting to protect that gain but fighting desperately to win more of the hill. This action

                    losses in killed were almost as heavy as those of Pickett's division in the attack on
                    Meade's left center in the afternoon. General Meade, in the course of his description of
                    this engagement says in his report of the battle: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            breastworks. Their ranks, however, had been so thinned by the sweeping fire of the enemy
                            that it was impossible to dislodge him and the two regiments, after having sustained
                            enormous losses in officers and men, were ordered to retire.</p>

                    fighting at times was as desperate as any in the entire battle. In this early engagement, the

            <p>From about ten-thirty on the morning of the third until precisely one o'clock in the

                    of all others. After the artillery had operated perhaps half an hour, the Union Chief <list type="footnotes">

                    cool the guns, save ammunition and allow the atmosphere between the lines to clear of the dense
                    smoke before the expected attack was made. This pause in the fire led the Confederates to believe
                    that the Union line was demoralized and that the opportune time had arrived for the onset of the
                    infantry.</p>
            <p>Longstreet had protested in vain against the project and held such a strong conviction that a useless
                    slaughter of the best men in Confederacy had been ordained to die by Lee, that he had no voice to
                    give the final command, and Pickett having received word that the time seemed right for the charge,
                    saluted Longstreet and said, "General, shall I advance?" General Longstreet, in
                    his own account of the battle, says: "The effort to speak the order failed and I could only
                    indicate it by an affirmative bow." "I shall move forward, sir," said
                    Pickett as he rode away.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> A moment later the words of command had been given.
                    Pickett's division was to sustain the principal charge. The troops were formed in two
                    lines: Kemper's and Garnett's brigades in the first line and Arminstead's
                    brigade in the second line. Wilcox's and Perry's brigades supported Pickett on the
                    right; on his left were Heth's Divisions, now under Pettigrew, with two brigades of
                    Pender's Division.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The combined forces numbered about fifteen
                    thousand men, or something less than that.</p>
            <p>Within ten minutes after the artillery ceased firing Pickett's and Pettigrew's
                    brigades in close order marched out of the woods that had afforded cover, and with steady, measured
                    steps, as on parade, headed down the eastern slope of Seminary Ridge. The flower of the army of

                    Ridge, selected for Pickett's objective, was little short of a mile and a quarter. The
                    course of the march crossed the valley and the Emmetsburg Road. Along this frontage, Seminary Ridge
                    slopes rapidly to the eastward for the first three hundred yards, then for a thousand yards the

                    hundred yards to Cemetery Ridge. As the line advanced from the woods, seventy cannon opened up from
                    Cemetery Ridge, tearing great gaps in the advancing line. The gaps were closed and the men pressed
                    forward in close order. When they reached the Emmetsburg Road, three-quarters of the way across,
                    they smashed down the fences lining the road, halted and reformed their lines in the fields just
                    east of the road. In order to reach his objective, Pickett had made an oblique movement which
                    brought his lines under enfilading fire from certain of the guns on Cemetery Ridge. Now he made a
                    right wheel which nearly centered his lines on the copse of trees where Gibbon's men were
                    in line. For some never-explained reason, Wilcox<hi rend="sup">26</hi> and Perry had already drifted
                    off to the right in the smoke-and-dust-filled valley and had halted without making any attempt to
                    close in on Pickett's men or to carry the charge home. The Confederates were now within one
                    hundred and fifty yards of the Union line and charged forward, Pickett's first line, in
                    advance, was shot to pieces as it came on, followed by the second line. The Union battery hurled
                    double cannister into them at ten yards and then became silent as Cushing fell among his guns. The
                    struggle was now left to the infantry alone. Armistead<hi rend="sup">27</hi> pressed forward,
                    gathering up his shattered remnants for a final effort—a few yards further to the copse
                    on the top of the ridge, and to <placeName>

                    to that of Gibbon, and the attack was ended. When the smoke lifted the three brigades of

                    <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-035-3-023"/> anniversary was that of adequate provision for the proper care
                    of these nineteen hundred old men—of the average age of ninety-four years—and
                    of a like number of attendants who came along to see that these aged veterans had everything they
                    needed for their comfort and pleasure. Two camps were established, including thirty-five hundred
                    tents erected to accommodate the veterans and their attendants and for other provisional service.
                    Each tent had a wooden floor and heavy wooden frame, a screen door, and two comfortable beds, and
                    was equipped with electric lights and necessary furniture. Dining halls and other conveniences were
                    provided.</p>
            <p>On the first day of their arrival, Wednesday, June 29, the veterans had exchanged individual
                    greetings with their own comrades and former foes. On Thursday, the thirtieth, about half of them
                    were taken to places on the battlefield in which they were especially interested, most of them going
                    to the Bloody Angle. There Union and Confederate veterans discussed with each other
                    Pickett's heroic charge, and then exchanged vows of friendship and gave and received
                    personal assurance of complete reconciliation and everlasting good will for their re-united country.</p>
            <p>The official opening of the Commemoration's four day program took place on Friday afternoon,
                    July 1, 1938, in the stadium of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. At this opening meeting of the first day's official program, there
                    was no strict observance of a Confederate side and a Union side, as in the camps and on the
                    battlefields. This meeting was a mass reunion, sponsored by state and nation; it was not an isolated
                    picture of one man meeting another against a distant background of war with some evidence of
                    reconciliation; here the veterans in both Blue and Gray sat with their families of two and three
                    generations, and there was no division in the seating—<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    "Dixie," and finally "The National Anthem," and the
                    commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the three days' battle that had decided
                    the ultimate result of the war was appropriately under way.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of War extended very cordial greetings and felicitations to the veterans of both Union
                    and Confederate <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-035-3-024"/> armies, and the Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> joined heartily in the welcome extended by the Secretary of War. Dr. Overton 13.
                    Mennet, Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, then graciously responded for the
                    Union veterans. He was followed by General John M. Clay-pool, Commander-in-Chief of the United
                    Confederate Veterans, who spoke appropriately for the "Southern Element of this American
                    Fellowship," as he termed it, closing his response with the indisputable and felicitous
                    observation that "the courage of reconciliation was as great as the courage of
                    war."</p>
            <p>With such a beginning and with the remaining program including addresses, reviews, parades, band
                    concerts and religious exercises, all carried through in the same exalted spirit, it is obvious that
                    the commemoration program sustained throughout the high purpose of the celebration. It was properly
                    and appropriately climaxed in the dedication by the President, of the Eternal Light Peace Memorial,
                    on Oak Hill, In the late afternoon of July 3—just seventy-five years after
                    Pickett's charge had failed.</p>
            <p>For the theme of his address the President fittingly turned to Lincoln and recalled that he had
                    spoken "in solace for all who fought upon this field"; then observed most
                    appropriately that "the years have laid their balm upon its wounds." "Men
                    who wore the blue and men who wore the gray," the President continued, "are here
                    together, a fragment spared by time. They are brought here by the memories of old divided loyalties,
                    but they meet here in united loyalty to a united cause which the unfolding years have made it easier
                    to see." Then turning to the assembled veterans he declared, "All of them we
                    honor, not asking under which flag they fought then—thankful that they stand together
                    under one flag now."</p>
            <p>When President Roosevelt finished speaking there was a brief pause; then with tottering steps, two
                    aged veterans, one in blue, the other in gray, moved towards the ropes by which a giant American
                    flag was draped over the Peace Memorial. They gave a feeble jerk and the flag fluttered down,
                    revealing the strikingly beautiful and appropriate monument. The hush continued for a few seconds
                    until the sun's rays had set off an electric spark which, in turn, set aflame a stream of
                    natural gas issuing from the top of the <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-035-3-025"/> shaft, where it is to
                    continue to burn forever as the "Eternal Peace Light."</p>
            <p>The ceremony of dedication was the climax of the entire anniversary observance. It was the requiem
                    for the generation that had participated in the War between the States and the confirmation of
                    another generation in the service of an undivided nation. The scene was impressive and moving beyond
                    description, but the dedication would have been without its most comprehensive significance and
                    deepest meaning had it not been for the presence of the nineteen hundred aged veterans who had come
                    for this final reunion. As they moved along to their seats of honor the crowd seemed to realize that
                    somehow they personally transcended all the ordinary things about the occasion; that somehow they
                    stood for something that was also to be found in the altar-like monument and in the incredible
                    beauty of the landscape all about. In a word, the Eternal Light Peace Memorial symbolizes the peace
                    and amity which exists today between all the people of the nation.</p>
            <p>The monument is located northwest of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the beautiful, heavily wooded Oak Ridge area of the battlefield. It faces towards
                    the southeast. The site provides, as one stands on the platform, an extensive panorama of the scene
                    of the three-day battle, including Big Round Top three and a half miles to the south. There on this
                    site seventy-five years ago, for two and one-half hours in mid-afternoon, men fought as desperately
                    as on any part of the great battlefield. It was here that the Sixteenth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> lost eighty-four percent of its men who were engaged in the terrific fighting on the
                    afternoon of the first day of the battle. Because of its favorable location on elevated ground and
                    proximity to main roads, the memorial may be seen from many highways leading into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The monument is in the form of a tall square shaft rising from the center of an
                    elevated platform. Surmounting the shaft is a bronze urn containing a perpetually burning light. The
                    shaft is approximately forty feet in its over-all height above the platform, and the platform is
                    about eleven feet above the ground approach to the memorial. The platform is rectangular in shape,
                    forty-two by eighty-five feet. The memorial is of veined <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> limestone and the pavements of Crab Orchard flagstone.</p>
            <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-035-3-026"/>
            <p>On the principal face of the shaft near the base is a sculptured bas-relief by the well-known
                    American sculptor, Lee Lawrie. The bas-relief is eight feet high and symbolizes the peace and good
                    will existing between North and South today. This is represented by two standing figures in embrace,
                    holding a branch of laurel and a wreath with an eagle symbolic of the nation completing the group.
                    On two sides of the shaft at a level with the bas-relief are the two inscriptions:</p>
            <p>WITH FIRMNESS IN THE RIGHT AS GOD GIVES US TO SEE THE RIGHT</p>
            <p>AN ENDURING LIGHT TO GUIDE US IN UNITY AND FELLOWSHIP</p>
            <p>The platform is reached by means of steps at either side from the lower terrace, paved in Crab
                    Orchard flagstone, flanked by wide stretches of grass. On the face of this platform is the principal
                    inscription:</p>
            <p rend="center">PEACE ETERNAL IN A NATION UNITED</p>
            <p>This is the theme of the memorial. The eminent architect, Paul Philippe Cret, designed the memorial.
                    Its cost was sixty thousand dollars, which amount was contributed by seven
                            states—<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Thus the most significant monument, perhaps, since the one erected to mark the spot where Lincoln
                    delivered his immortal classic has been added to the more than eight hundred monuments and markers
                    in bronze and granite upon this battlefield, which has become our best known, if not our greatest,
                    military shrine.</p>

            <p>The northern part of Indiana was not settled permanently as early as the rest although it really had
                    in a way, the earliest start. LaSalle came through the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> area in 1679, but it was not until 1820 that the first white settler, Pierre Navarre,
                    built his little cabin by the side of the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. In 1823, when
                    Alexis Coquillard came to this spot as agent for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> had its real beginning. Four years later, Lathrop M. Taylor arrived as agent for Samuel
                    Hanna. These two men founded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Coquillard tacked this sign over his first trading post—"Big <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s Station." The "Big", of course, was to
                    distinguish it from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s station at Ft. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> which was on the little <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. In 1827, Taylor wrote "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s, Indiana" at the top of his account book. In 1829, the government
                    granted a post office to the little community, the commission reading: "Lathrop M. Taylor,
                    Postmaster, Southold, Allen county, Indiana." None of these three names was satisfactory.
                    The place had been known iocally as "The Bend" or "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>" for some time, due to its location at the southernmost point on the
                        <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. In 1830, the government changed the name to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>, <region type="county">St. Joseph
                            County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, and thus it has been known ever since.</p>
            <p>The county was organized in 1830; the town in 1835. The first city charter was granted in 1865. Two
                    years later, the first <hi rend="i">directory</hi> was issued. This contains the first printed
                    history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was printed by the Western Publishing Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was known as <hi rend="i">Holland's City Directory of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                        </placeName>.</hi> It runs to one hundred seventy-five pages, and is dedicated to the mayor and
                    business men of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a slight token of the publisher's esteem. That it was not looked upon with
                    favor by all, is plainly evident for now and then as we leaf over the pages we find a name and after
                    it this phrase enclosed in brackets "Don't care to have their name in the
                    directory." Early settlers believed in taking no risks! The wording of some of the
                    advertisements is very quaint and many of the things advertised are unnecessary in our present day
                    life. Take <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-035-3-028"/> livery stables for example—the coming
                    generation will not know what such a place was and yet with what a thrill some of our older citizens
                    can remember riding in a livery rig such as is pictured in these early directories.</p>

                            </placeName> was given the city from the fact of its being located on the river at its

                            </placeName>. The site of the city is elevated, the soil is a sandy loam, the surface level;
                            thus making the finest natural streets and sidewalks to be found anywhere.</p>
                    </quote>Notice the wording, "natural streets and sidewalks," of course this was
                    long before the day of asphalt or cement. "The city," the directory continues,
                    "enjoys a high character <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-035-3-029"/> for the healthiness of its
                    inhabitants and the purity and salubrity of the atmosphere."</p>
            <p>Of the public buildings in use in 1867, especial mention is made in the first directory of the Court
                    House which today serves so well as a historical museum. It was built in 1857–1858,
                    "of cut <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> stone, of a very beautiful appearance and we believe at a total cost of over
                    $40,000." In our day, when we read more often than not of court houses costing a
                    half million, $40,000 seems like a rather insignificant sum. "The lower floor of
                    the building is used for office purposes," the directory states, with the capacity
                    "to accommodate the whole of the county officers, while the upper floor is devoted
                    exclusively to the court and jury rooms. A valuable and handsome clock has been placed in the cupola
                    at a considerable height so that the correct time of day may be seen for a good distance. This is a
                    boon which is appreciated by all." This was clearly before the day of wrist watches.</p>
            <p>The jail, erected in 1860, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> stone and brick, is described as presenting "a very handsome appearance and
                    being well adapted for the purpose for which it was built." One wonders if the following
                    should be taken with some grains of allowance: "It is kept in a clean condition which goes
                    far toward assuring the health of those poor wretches who are unfortunate enough to be confined
                    within its walls. The internal arrangements of the building are very complete and we think could not
                    very well be improved, the cells are all well ventilated, admirably arranged and kept scrupulously
                    clean." The authors were not just writing a directory: "We will conclude by hoping
                    that the jail may not have many tenants in the future. People will do well to give it a wide
                    berth."</p>
            <p>The Post Office, erected two years before the directory was issued, was located on the corner of Main
                    and Market (now Colfax) streets. It, too, was a "handsome" building, being built
                    of brick. The editors say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We believe no better arranged post office exists in the state and for tasteful appearance and
                            for adaptation to the purpose for which it was built, can scarcely be excelled in the West.
                            The whole of the lower floor is used as a post office while the upper front rooms are
                            occupied as offices by the mayor. The rear room is used as the city council chamber.</p>

            <p>In this day and age, we mail a letter and expect it to be delivered as soon as possible with no
                    thought of the days on which mail is sent out to a certain place. In 1867 this was not the case. The
                    Post Office advises that mail goes to "North Liberty at 1:00 P.M. on Mondays and Thursdays
                    and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> on Thursday only at 5 in the morning." North Liberty is a little town about
                    fourteen miles southwest of <placeName>

            <p>Even if the mails were slow, people must have done quite a little traveling for the back cover of the

                    described as being "of modern construction well warmed and ventilated and every comfort and

                    </placeName>'s Patent Dusters were like.</p>
            <p>The year 1867 was before the day of street numbering and we find a store or residence located thus:
                    "w.s.Laf.bet.-Jeff.and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>," (west side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> between Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Streets) ; or, "s.s. Market be. William and Gen-Taylor" (south side
                    of Market street between William and General Taylor streets). Another way of marking the residence
                    of a citizen was by its location, thus: "John Smith, Goose pasture," referring to
                    that part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> then known as the "Goose Pasture."</p>
            <p>A little later as more houses appeared in the block, the directions became more explicit, for
                    instance: "s.s.Market 4 d.w.Laf" (south side of Market street, 4 doors west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> street). Some system of numbering was begun about 1871 for the directory of that year
                    shows such numbers as <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-035-3-031"/> "34 Gen. Taylor,"
                    "15 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>," etc. In some instances these places were quite far out. For example,
                    "184 W. Washington" was nine blocks from the center of town and not between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and Main streets as such a number would now indicate.</p>
            <p>The directory of 1883 was the first to give street numbers as we know them today. It was a year
                    earlier, when free mail delivery by the Post Office Department was commenced, that William Whitten,
                    then city engineer, submitted a plan to the council assigning numbers to houses and store buildings.
                    With few changes, the numbering has remained the same as adopted at that time. How nice it would be
                    if the same could be said of the names of streets, but alas, many of these have undergone sad
                    changes! Gone are the Market, Water, Pearl, Day, Alexis, Baker, Sanger, Vistula and Division streets
                    of yesterday.</p>
            <p>The first directory credits <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> with nine churches while the one published two years later, lists thirteen. Glancing
                    over the directory of 1938, we find ninety-nine churches, accommodating the worshippers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>: 79, Protestant; 4, Jewish; 2, Greek; and 14, Roman Catholic.</p>
            <p>Our present Y.M.C.A. is the outgrowth of the Young Men's Association about which comment is
                    made in the first directory. The organization was instituted in 1866 and held meetings "for
                    business and literary exercises every Wednesday evening and religious meetings on alternate Sundays
                    in their [Y.M.A.] rooms at the north-east corner of Main and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Streets." The Association also had a reading room in connection with the
                    organization, and boasted a president, vice-president, corresponding and recording secretaries and a
                    treasurer.</p>

                    Sumption was the school examiner and we read: "The city enjoys a wide reputation for the
                    excellence of her educational institutions and is second to no city in the West in the interest
                    taken in all matters pertaining to the education and proper training of her children. There are four
                    large public schools in the city, three of them being of brick, and will accommodate about 400
                    scholars each." Today there are about 5,000 pupils enrolled in parochial and over 16,000 in
                    the public schools.</p>
            <p>The Northern Indiana College, established in 1866, held <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-035-3-032"/> forth at
                    that time in a "fine brick edifice, capable of accommodating a large number of

            <p>Notre Dame and its sister institution, St. Mary's, were flourishing even in 1867. The
                    directory says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In the year 1836, the Rev. S. T. Badin, of venerable memory, while traveling through the

                            hands of Father Sorin, priest of the congregation of the Holy Cross who, with a few brothers
                            of the same order had come to America. They took possession of it in 1842."</p>

            <p>The University was incorporated in 1844 and enlarged in 1866. The announcement of 1867 says that
                    "board, bed and bedding, tuition (Latin and Greek included) washing and mending of linen,
                    doctor's fees, medicine and attendance in sickness" were all to be had at Notre
                    Dame for five months for $152.50. Each student was required to bring with him the
                    following, which certainly is not the list a modern college boy would make out: 6 shirts, 6 pocket
                    handkerchiefs; 6 pairs of stockings; 6 towels; 6 napkins; 3 pairs of boots or shoes; 2 suits of

                    examiner, in conjunction with a Mr. Adams conducted a Spencerian Commercial College in the St. Joe
                    block. That was the day of fancy writing, elegant with its many curves and flourishes. Many a person

            <p>Just as a present directory lists the names of the city and county officials, so we find them listed
                    in the first directory, that of 1867: William G. George, Mayor (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first); Jacob Hustor, Marshall; Joe Hagerty, Clerk; Joseph B. Eaker,
                    Treasurer; Matthias Stover, Engineer; Joe Hartman, Street commissioner. The city council was
                    composed of the following members: John Klingel, Seth Myers, Thomas Stanfield, David Stover, Alanson
                    Merritt, Wilkinson DeFrees, Andrew Russwurm, and S. Perry. John Brown-field is listed as chief
                    engineer of the fire department with Nathan Marsh and William Mack as his assistants. It is
                    interesting to note that no mention is made of a police department, though among the names in the
                    directory, however, that of Alexis Theodore Coquillard is given as chief of police. The sheriff and
                    marshall were evidently able to cope with any law breakers to be found in the peaceful little city.</p>
            <p>The manufacturers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> of 1867 are described as being almost in their infancy and yet the flour mills did a
                    business of approximately $560,000 in a year. In that year Studebaker Brothers had an
                    "extensive works located in the city for the manufacture of every variety of carriage,
                    buggy and farm wagon." They did "an immense business and employed several hundred
                    hands." The present Oliver Farm Equipment Company was then Oliver, Bissel and Company, the
                    firm made up of T. M. Bissel, George Milburn and James Oliver. The factory was located on the
                    mill-race between Market and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> streets.</p>
            <p>Very few places listed in the directory of 1867 are still doing business under the same name. One of
                    the few is the McDonald Studio which did a flourishing business even back in 1867. At that time, it
                    was located in the Barrett Building and was conducted by Albert McDonald, who, the directory says,
                    "does a very satisfactory work for the obvious reason <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-035-3-034"/>
                    that he always secures a good negative of a person before printing cards, vignettes or other
                    pictures and thereby secures accurate likenesses whereas we believe it to be the common practice
                    with second rate artists to take just one negative and print the picture from it be it a good one or
                    not." Mr. McDonald had for his motto the word "Excelsior."</p>
            <p>George Wyman and Company, and the Ellsworth store, then owned by John Chess, grandfather of J. C.
                    Ellsworth, are still two of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s big business houses but Klingel's shoe store and
                    Livingston's clothing store closed their doors within the last few years as did the Coonley
                    drug store which for many years occupied the south-west corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> streets. Of this drug store the 1867 directory says that it had a "fine marble
                    soda fountain all silver mounted."</p>
            <p>The younger generation of today may think of soda water as a rather modern, twentieth century
                    concotion but our grandmothers regaled themselves with this favorite drink. A Mr. Hume kept an
                    "ice cream saloon" in that day and he advertised "separate rooms for
                    ladies and gentlemen." Now what fun could there have been going to an ice cream parlor in
                    those days? Did a young man leave his "sweetie" at the door and meet her there
                    again after she had refreshed herself in solitude? Just how does anyone suppose Mr. Hume managed to
                    keep all customers satisfied with his "separate rooms for ladies and gentlemen" ?</p>
            <p>The diction in some of the advertisements seems odd and stilted to us today. Here is one which reads:
                    "J.A.M. LaPierre has disposed of his candy factory to O. H. Palmer, who prosecutes the
                    business at 57 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> St." The barber shops were all spoken of as tonsorial parlors presided over by
                    tonsorial artists. An advertisement of a music teacher reads: "In the vocal department I
                    call special attention to the cultivation of the voice." A photographer advertised that
                    "all those wishing to secure the shadow 'ere the substance
                    fade"' " should call on him and he will do his best "to give
                    them a picture that they will find hard to beat for truthfulness and artistic finish."</p>
            <p>J. C. Knoblock, father of the late Otto Knoblock who did so much toward preserving local history,
                    kept a grocery store in 1867, so the directory of that year says that "all those seeking
                    choice groceries, flour, etc., should call on our <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-035-3-035"/> friend J. C.
                    Knoblock on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> St. To our certain knowledge this house occupies the front rank in the grocery business
                    and this their sales will testify."</p>
            <p>What does the "etc." stand for in the expression "choice groceries, flour,
                    etc."? The classified part of the directory indicates just what goods were sold at a
                    grocery store in 1867. Evidently J. C. Knoblock was not "an old fogy merchant"
                    referred to in the introduction for his store was listed under all of these headings:
                    "Amunition and sporting goods;" "Bakers;"
                    "Brushes;" "Children's carriages;" "china,
                    glass and Queens ware;" "Cigars and tobacco;" "Commission
                    merchants;" "Confectioners;" "Cutlery;"
                    "Earthen and stone ware;" "Flour and feed;" "Fruits,
                    both foreign and domestic;" "Garden and field seeds;"
                    "Grocers;" "Lamps and glass ware;"
                    "Perfumery;" "Potato dealer;" "Powder shot and
                    lead;" "Produce dealer;" "Rockinghorses;"
                    "Small wares;" "Toys, Wooden and willow ware and Yankee
                    notions", whatever the latter may have been!</p>
            <p>Many are the headings in the classified section of that first directory which seems odd to us today.
                    Here are a few noticed: Axes; Balances; Bar and Rod Iron; Basket Stores; Bathing Rooms; Bellows;
                    Blacksmith Shops; Brittania-ware; Buckskin Goods; Buffalo Robes; Carriages and Wagons; Cooper Shops;
                    Glove makers; Gunsmiths; Hubs and Spokes; Japanned-ware; Lamps and Oil; Livery, Sale and Boarding
                    Stables; and Paper Collars.</p>
            <p>How strange some of the classified headings in the present directory would have seemed to the makers
                    of the first one. Unheard of things, most of them at that time, including: adding, calculating and
                    tabulating machines; advertising agencies; apartment buildings; air transportation; automatic
                    heaters; air-conditioning, automobiles and accessories; outdoor advertising; pasteurized milk;
                    typewriting machines —but no "Yankee notions" today. Thus have things
                    changed from 1867 to 1939.</p>

                    He was one of the city's early lawyers. He was considered both brilliant and shrewd. After

                    published, it is safe to say that he was also very sarcastic.</p>
            <p>He began the <hi rend="i">Historical and Business Review</hi> of 1871 with: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            labors to the consideration of the public. The necessity for a new and correct directory is
                            best proved by the fact that the corrections, alterations and additions, viewed in reference

            <p>A street directory was compiled which begins on page one hundred forty-five of the volume of 1871.
                    The author says that the street names were "from Smith's new map (now in the
                    press)". There were at that time quite a number of streets—a four-page list. The
                    array contained many short ones, whose names are now unknown. The preceding directory had listed
                    only fifty-four streets. Evidently these are some of the 1500 errors to which Mr. Turner referred.
                    He further said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In effecting this compilation we have to acknowledge the assistance of several of our best

                            especially of our business men and those who are using their best efforts to advance public
                            interests. Fortunately we have in our midst but few of those public leeches who desire to

                            encumber our pages with further allusions to such trash. The mutations of life, the

                            will soon effectively dispose of them all and their fossilized remains and their names will

            <p>An interesting advertisement in the issue of 1871 was for a patent peat cutting machine invented by
                    Herman Mielisch and manufactured by Mielisch and Rilling of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and all interested were urged to come and see the machines in operation. According to
                    the advertisement, 1,600 had been sold in Europe. Mr. Turner added his comments to the
                    advertisement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mielish and Rilling have commenced the manufacture of a superior peat machine, the invention

                    to drive out in a "hired one" could be accommodated, according to an advertisement

            <p>Mrs. Nellie Pine, a Clairvoyant Physician carried quite an impressive advertisement in the directory
                    for 1871. She requested "that those who are afflicted with disease send a lock of their
                    hair, their photograph or autograph, give age and on receipt of this information, she will examine
                    their case, describe symptoms and diseases and state whether she can help or cure." She
                    claimed to have had twelve years of practice, five of them in <placeName>

                    $2.00." Two things are plainly evident. One is that the early settlers were very
                    gullible or they would not have supported a "Clairvoyant Physician" for five
                    years. The other, postage must have been high in those days, or else she charged for the mental
                    energy used in the "examination by mail" for it cost one dollar more than the
                    examination in the office.</p>
            <p>Something must have gone wrong with the Hoosier Fly Catcher, advertised in this same directory, for

            <p>In 1874, Mr. Turner declared that "the footprints of iniprovement and progress are all
                    around us." In spite of the fact that the financial storm of 1873 burst upon the country
                    "scattering industrial debris in every direction," and suddenly ruining thousands
                    of the well to do and severely crippling many of the towns and cities, amid the disaster
                    "South <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-035-3-039"/> Bend stood more firm and undisturbed than most

            <p>"The Pleiades Club, a literary institution composed of some of our most intelligent and
                    aspiring young people of both sexes, has become defunct," wrote Turner, "chiefly
                    on account of the marriage and dispersion of most of its members. It had a brilliant and useful
                    career and although dead will not soon be forgotten. The Woman's Literary Club, instituted
                    within the past year, has already become a power and a blessing in the intellectual
                    circles." Then Mr. Turner added, with characteristic irony, that "perhaps some
                    day, the men of our city, with their giant intellects and proud preeminence, may unitedly attempt
                    some sort of a mental advance."</p>

            <p>Mr. J. C. Knoblock, who it will be remembered did such extensive advertising in the very first
                    directory, had a most unusual advertising scheme in that for 1877. The names in the directory being
                    arranged alphabetically, he arranged to have the first line after each letter, used to advertise his
                    store. The A's begin with "All hail the Knoblock grocery store." The
                    B's with, "Buy your groceries at J. C. Knoblock and company." The
                    C's "Cash down and cheap groceries at Knoblock's"—and

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> so hard that no directory was issued in 1878, and the one for 1879 is the smallest of
                    the entire collection. The upgrade, however, was near. The "Historical Business
                    Review" introducing the 1879 directory, includes the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>After a, long and dreary night, who does not hail with delight the first faint gleams of

                            dawn of prosperity dispels the shadows which have for years enveloped our industrial affairs
                            in darkness and gloom.</p>
                        <p>The question so long and so often asked, "Watchmen, what of the night?" has
                            ceased to be appropriate, for the day is here. To moralize upon the distress of the past; to
                            keep alive the memories of departed horrors; to drink again from the challice whence our
                            lips have drawn so many bitter draughts; or even to pride ourselves with the fortitude with
                            which we have met and overcome misfortunes, would now be a waste of effort when the cause of
                            grief no longer exists. That we have suffered long and terribly cannot be denied; but there
                            is compensation in the thought that we have only felt the just penalty of broken laws.</p>

                    repaired. The St. Joe Hotel block burned on Christmas eve but as the Oliver House it became
                    "more substantial, imposing and useful than ever." The Keedy Flouring Mills also
                    burned but were rebuilt almost immediately. On April 23, the main edifice of Notre Dame and some of
                    the smaller college buildings were burned to the ground. The ashes were hardly cold before the
                    reconstruction was commenced, resulting in Notre Dame University as we know it today.</p>
            <p>Mr. Turner was not fully satisfied with the public school system of 1879, judging from his remarks:

                            what are called scholars. The conundrum has not yet been answered. In our city, an able
                            Board of Trustees are extracting all the good there is in the system. In this they are
                            seconded by a competent force of teachers and by a public sentiment which needs

            <p>The advertisements in the 1879 directory are few and small. Mr. Knoblock however, continued to run

                    schools," he said, "are in a flourishing condition, viewed from the popular
                    standpoint. As the system is one of almost absolute gratuities, we get, if anything, something for
                    nothing. The annual enumeration of scholars gives 4,267 against 3,824 for 1879, an increase of 443.

            <p>There is not much advertising in the 1880 directory and what there is, is confined to small space and
                    terse statements. Here is an example: "George W. Reynolds' new livery stables, 66
                    Jefferson near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Splendid horses; elegant turnouts; neat buggies; new harness; no old plugs; fair
                    prices; honest dealing and satisfaction."</p>
            <p>With this 1880 directory, Turner seems to have retired from the field. The directory for 1881 was
                    issued by Hupp <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-035-3-043"/> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>. They continue Mr. Turner's numbering and call it volume VIII. The 1881
                    directory is of course the tenth directory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> issued to that time, as there were two published by the Western Publishing Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> before the Turner series was started.</p>
            <p>It is of slightly smaller dimensions than its predecessors, but it boasts two hundred forty-six
                    pages, and many advertisements occupy a full page. Hupp and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its business conditions. "It must be a matter of pride," say the
                    editors, "to every citizen that a directory of this size can be made in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There is no better evidence of a city's magnitude, enterprise and growth than
                    a list of bona fide residents." They evidently approved the school system, for they said:

                            educational institutions that raise their towering walls on every hand. The present
                            flourishing condition of our Public Schools is such that every one even the most fastidious

            <p>The 1882 directory was issued by the Register Printing Company. Its resume notes many improvements in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here are a few: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            beautified their premises. The principal public work of the year was the erection of an iron
                            bridge across the river at Jefferson street and the recent order for numbering of the houses
                            of the city in preparation for the free delivery of mails. Before the close of 1882 the city

            <p>Under the heading "Worthy institutions," we read: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The 1883 directory was the first one issued by William Farr. The Y.M.C.A., organized in March of the
                    preceding year, advertises that it offers, "mental, physical and social attractions and
                    religious meetings." Frequent receptions and entertainments, lecture courses and
                    educational classes were held. Free reading rooms and writing material were provided. Religious
                    meetings were held on Sunday for every one, on Monday night for boys, and on Wednesday for young
                    men, with a Bible class on Saturday night. Quite a full program.</p>
            <p>The editorial "Business Review" in the 1884 directory is very complete. Many of the
                    advertisements are illustrated and the pictures of the high, button shoes for ladies, cause one to
                    smile. They are not exactly in style today. This was the last of the small directories. With the
                    year 1885, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s directories took on a citified look, the whole makeup being similar to those
                    of today.</p>
            <p>The advertisements continued to be interesting. One page was given over to the "Andrews
                    folding Bed." The directory says that "it is the only perfect folding bed on the
                    market. Closed it resembles an organ; with the front section, down, behold it is a wonderful
                    bed." No mention is made, however, of what became of the ink bottle when the bed was
                    opened. "A fine point about this piece of furniture," declared the merchant,
                    "is that it occupies only 1/4 the space of a clumsy common bed and when moving or in case
                    of fire, both bed and bedding can be easily and instantly rolled out of the room."</p>
            <p>The 1884 directory also contains an advertisement for patent sliding blinds that were the cheapest
                    and best and not so apt to get out of order as the old fashioned folding blinds. Outdoor advertising
                    was coming into style in 1885 for this directory listed "Bill posters" for the
                    first time in the classified business section. Here are a few other headings that attract attention:
                    "Aurists," "Costumiers," "Dress and Cloak
                    Makers," "Oil Dealers (illuminating) and Well Sinkers."</p>
            <p>The directory of 1886–7 is very similar to the one of 1885. Volume XIV, issued in 1889,
                    gave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> a population of 25,000. It also stated that there were seven public schools and a high
                    school which 'boasted a principal and three assistants. And so we begin on the years of the
                    gay nineties. <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-035-3-045"/> Mr. Farr continued to edit the directories, but
                    from 1891 on they were printed by the Hibberd Printing Company. Mr. Farr's last issue, the
                    one of 1898, is a most pretentious book. It numbers seven hundred pages and is the first attempt at
                    issuing a complete county directory. Besides listing the names of the residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and each of the smaller towns in the county, every township is taken up. Consider
                    Liberty township, for example, with "Smith, John fr 40 A jd w Susan P.O. North
                    Liberty." Interpreted this entry means John Smith, farmer, owns forty acres of land in
                    joint deed with his wife Susan and their mail address is North Liberty. No free rural delivery at
                    that time.</p>
            <p>In 1899, the Hibberd Company took over the editing as well as the publishing of local directories.
                    The first one is very complete. It is a directory of both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the remainder of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName>. It lists officials of the city, township, county and state; names the schools and all
                    the teachers; and is the first one to contain a street directory giving streets, numbers and the
                    names of those residing at any given number. It also is the first directory to list, in its
                    information about the city, the name of the Public Library which had been established in 1888 and
                    had occupied its own building since 1895. This directory is also the first to have pictures of the
                    following: the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName> Court House; the Public Library; the Oliver Chilled Plow Works; the Birdsell
                    Manufacturing Company; the Ep-worth Hospital; and the Studebaker Factory.</p>
            <p>As the twentieth century began, there seems to have been a little feeling between two rival printing
                    companies, each thinking they could get out a better directory than the other. The result was that
                    for each of the years 1901, 1904, 1906, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was blessed with two directories. The Hibberd Printing Company bound its directory in
                    red while the Tribune Printing Company resorted to blue. They were referred to, respectively, as
                    "The Red Book" and "The Blue Book."</p>
            <p>"The Blue Book" gives just <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and, in an "Introduction," says: "It will be well to
                    remember that the 'Blue Book' was and always has been the first to introduce the
                    new and up-to-date features of the directory field. This year an <hi rend="sup">⋆</hi> is
                    placed after each residence in the street directory, which has telephone connections and as <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-035-3-046"/> soon as any other new ideas appear, this book will have the
                    preference." The "Red Book" says in the "Introduction":
                    "Bear in mind the Hibberd is the only complete directory of the entire county. It is bound
                    in RED."</p>
            <p>A street and person directory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> is included in all the directories from 1900 to date. This is as it should be, for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> adjoins <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> so closely that one cannot discern the dividing line between the two cities. A special
                    feature of the 1908 directory gives the "location, kind of phone and number of all parties
                    over fourteen years whom it is possible to reach by phone." During the early
                    nineteen-hundreds, two telephone companies were in competition in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> as in many other cities. The Home Company (Citizens' Company in many cities)
                    and the Belle Company fought a hard fight but the Bell Corporation won. During the warfare between
                    local organizations and the Bell System, two phones were maintained in many homes and business
                    places. Especially were both necessary in the offices of merchants and professional men in many
                    cities of the country.</p>
            <p>In the front of <hi rend="i">The Red Book</hi> of 1908 is a bibliography of all preceding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> directories; beginning with Holland's publication of 1867. It is amusing to
                    see that those issued by the Tribune Printing Company, and known as "The Blue
                    Book," are listed as "volumes <hi rend="i">231/2</hi>, 25% and
                    27?/2," at least a more charitable way of handling them than that of ignoring them
                    completely as Mr. Turner had ignored the first two directories issued by the Western Publishing
                    Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>During the years 1917 and 1918, no directories were <hi rend="sup">-</hi>issued in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1919, R. L. Polk and Company presented their first edition of the <hi rend="i">

                            <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>

                        </placeName> Directory</hi>, having acquired the right to publish by agreement with Mr. John
                    Hibberd, owner of the Hibberd Directory Company. The 1919 directory lists the electric street
                    railways and the interurban lines. Today street cars are being replaced by busses and all of the
                    interurban lines, except the one to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, have been discontinued. This is the age of the automobile. Items of interest in this
                    directory include names, location, and a few facts about: fourteen public parks; eight playgrounds;
                    twenty-four clubs and societies; sixty-four office buildings and flats; ten fire stations; one
                    hundred <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-035-3-047"/> sixty-one fire alarm boxes; and the seven wards into
                    which the city was divided at that time. Since 1919, all of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> directories have been issued by the efficient firm of R. L. Polk.</p>
            <p>The directories of the city from 1867 to date constitute a little historical library in themselves.
                    They show how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> has grown from a trading post in the wilderness to an industrial city with products
                    known all over the world. In closing, Mr. Turner's remarks at the end of the
                    "Introduction" to the 1880 directory must be quoted: "And thus ends our
                    gossipping and we launch our little craft on the waters of public favor and pray for pleasant gales
                    and a smooth sea."</p>

                    </placeName>. The road, or trail as it was long called, was established in the fall of 1822. An
                    unusual fact connected with it was that it was marked out by dragging a log, or brush, as different
                    reports have it, with an ox team over the entire distance of 120 miles, through the woods, prairies
                    and marshes. The thick, high grass on the prairies and the wild pea vines in the woods so obstructed
                    progress that the dragging of this log, or brush, was considered the best and cheapest way to mark
                    the route, as mowing would have been too slow. An engineer or surveyor was employed by the State to
                    keep the course, as many variations had to be made from a straight line to suit the lay of the land
                    and the best crossings of the many streams and marshes. The route was directly through the site of
                    Linton, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>, and near the home of Martin Wines. Latta's creek marsh, named for John Latta,
                    one of the early settlers, was exxactly in the line of the survey, and as Mr. Wines was familiar
                    with the lay of the country he was asked to mark out the best ground to cross the marsh. The way by
                    which he piloted the company became the roadway, and was so used until a few years ago. Along the
                    trail in the woods trees were blazed, and in the prairies tall poles reaching above the high grass
                    were set to guide the travelers.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>On November 9, 1903, the names of Joseph G. Cannon and John Sharp Williams were placed before the
                    House of Representatives as candidates for the Speakership. Since the Republicans were in the
                    majority, their candidate was chosen Speaker by a majority of thirty-one votes and Williams
                    automatically became the leader of the Democratic minority. The two men were fast friends although
                    it is hardly possible to imagine more widely divergent backgrounds than these two leaders had
                    experienced.</p>

                    family set out to find a country where the sight of slaves would not destroy the
                    youngster's inherited opposition to this ancient institution.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A haven
                    was found near Blooming-dale in Park County, Indiana, and here Joseph spent his youth. He gained
                    what schooling he could in the community until he was thirteen years of age when the drowning of his
                    father in a swollen stream made it necessary for him, though but a lad, to start working to help
                    support the family. After diligent searching, employment was secured as a clerk in a small grocery
                    store.</p>
            <p>Near the close of a five year tenure in the grocery store the Cannon family moved into Bloomingdale,

                    </placeName> faith. Perhaps no story was more frequently told about Cannon than the account of how
                    the young bridegroom informed the elders of the church in a very stormy interview that he was not
                    sorry he had married Mary Reed.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The <placeName>

            <p>When Cannon was leaving the grocery store and getting started in the law profession, John Sharp
                    Williams was born at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, on July 31, 1854. The Williams family had come to <placeName>

                    </placeName> but they were from an entirely different type than were the Cannons. The Williams
                    family was one of wealth and belonged to the slaveholding aristocracy of the old South. Left an
                    orphan by the death of his father who was killed in action at the battle of <placeName>

                    the early years of his life. He entered the University of the South at Sewanee, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1870, and, a few months later, entered the University of <placeName>

                    interests far deeper than the courses in which he happened to be enrolled at the time. He dceided

                    miles west of his plantation. He had a long time to wait before he realized his ambition to embark
                    on a political career. He tried for the nomination from the fifth congressional district in 1890. In
                    ithis initial effort, he was defeated just as Cannon had failed in his first attempt in 1870. In the
                    second attempt in 1892, Williams met with success and, in the special session of the fifty-third
                    Congress, he began his career in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The former, indeed, had begun his service in the House exactly twenty years earlier

                    Congress in 1890. This Congress had enacted the unpopular McKin-ley Tariff. Cannon's defeat
                    of 1890 was reversed in 1892 and, thus, he was taking anew his place in the House at the time that
                    Williams entered for the first time.</p>

                    and through extensive travels. This accomplishment did not in any degree prevent the Mississippian
                    from making the individual qualities of a man the sole standard of his friendships. Both he and
                    Cannon were simple in their tastes, direct and honest in their dealings, and, most fortunate of all,
                    each was possessed with a keen sense of humor. They were able at anyrate to keep their friendship
                    above their political battles.</p>
            <p>The first speech of Williams as Minority Leader was his presentation of Cannon as Speaker. He then
                    expressed his firm conviction that the Republican House had chosen a most effective leader. As soon
                    as the presentation ceremonies were over Williams immediately launched into a speech that gave
                    evidence of the fact that he was going to take his job as Minority Leader as seriously as Cannon was
                    to take the Speakership. Because of the added strength of the Democrats as a result of the elections
                    of 1902, Williams stated that fairness demanded an increased minority representation on all
                    important committees.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Congressman James E. Watson of Indiana, a Republican crony of Cannon, "induced Uncle Joe to

                    the House."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> It was no easy task to convince the Speaker of the wisdom
                    of giving any of his powers to any one and especially to the political enemy. However, when Watson
                    insisted that the new power would only increase the difficulties of the Minority Leader, Uncle Joe
                    consented to grant Williams the power. In delegating this power to the minority, Uncle Joe created a
                    precedent in House procedure. Regarding this practice, Speaker Cannon afterwards said:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was well understood between Representative Williams and the Speaker of the House that he
                            should have his way about minority appointments, and as I recollect now there were not to
                            exceed four cases where the minority leader did not have his way and in those cases the
                            limitation placed upon him was where the organization of the minority for geographic
                            reasons, or as a matter of policy, interfered with the organization of the majority.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    Democratic friends."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Watson recalled later that during the time that
                    Williams was making his appointments, Uncle Joe came home each night to say with a chuckle:
                    "Well, Jim, you certainly proposed a 'hot one' when you recommended that
                    Williams be permitted to name the Democratic members of the committees."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a difficult task to organize the minority into a unit that could make its influence felt, but
                    almost from the first, Williams was given credit for having "breathed into the Democrats of
                    the House a spirit of discipline and of common intention."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> He had
                    accomplished this difficult task through persuasion rather than through domination as did the
                    Speaker in relation to his party. Democratic colleagues could often go to the little room in the
                    library wing of the Capitol, determined to have some problem out with Williams, but would
                    "go forth pleased and flattered and inclined to help him out."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Cannon, perhaps, more often than Williams, removed the iron hand for the velvet glove and
                    showed authority. The spirit of amiable harmony that prevailed during the first Congress in which
                    Cannon and Williams were the leaders has been attributd to the warm personal friendship which they
                    developed for each other. It was said that "The mutual admiration and esteem between the
                    two has ever been the subject of comment in the House."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the close of the first session of their leadership, Williams took the floor and eulogized Cannon
                    for the latter's genial humor. During the speech he recounted a conversation between them
                    in which Williams had said: "Mr. Speaker, I will always think you are as fair as I believe
                    you will be." Cannon had immediately replied: "John, I'm going to be as
                    fair as I can consistent with the exigencies of American politics."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                    On one occasion when the two men were in heated argument, Williams remarked with a dry smile:
                    "We are just reasoning together in brotherly love."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> One

            </p>
            <p>A favorite Williams joke on Cannon was that, one day when he walked into the Speaker's
                    private conference room, Cannon absent-mindedly thought Williams was a Republican and began in
                    strictest confidence to discuss committee appointments with him. About five minutes later when
                    "Uncle Joe" realized what was happening, he laughed heartily as did Williams.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Cannon appreciated Williams sense of humor and later remarked that the latter
                    was "never more entertaining than when he was attending a meeting of the Rules Committee
                    when he always had a new story that he had kept to tell us."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the adjournment of Congress on March 4, 1905, the customary House resolution of appreciation
                    relating to the Speaker was reënforced by the presentation of a magnificent loving cup.
                    Williams was selected to make the presentation speech. In the course of his remarks, the Minority
                    Leader stated that he wished "the mere spontaneous thought and intent of friends, without
                    the intervention of money could originate things beautiful." He told the Speaker that the
                    cup would be a pleasure to him because it was an expression of appreciation and because it would
                    remind him of the truth of the saying—"He that showeth himself friendly hath
                        friends."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Speaker concluded the few remarks of acceptance, amid the tremendous applause of the House
                    and the galleries, Champ Clark gained the floor and made a similar presentation to the Minority
                        Leader.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In reply to this display of confidence on the part of the men he
                    had been trying to lead, Williams said that he would derive increasing pleasure from the knowledge
                    that he had "measurably well succeeded" in doing the will of the minority.
                    Proceeding, he stated that the world was too broad to forget that a man was not measured by his
                    professional, religious, or political occupation, but "by his heart and good will, by his
                    sincere efforts to do right."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> An observer in the press <list type="footnotes">

                    object of this tribute of manliness to manliness bent his head and blushed like a school

            <p>Before becoming Minority Leader, Williams had determined to use his influence to change the general
                    attitude of the Democratic Party. He thought that too much emphasis had been given to destructive
                    criticism of the Republican Party. That the Democratic Party should no longer remain merely a party
                    of negation was the decision of Williams. He wanted to aid his party in formulating a constructive
                    and progressive program in order to present an attractive platform to the independent voter. During
                    the spring of 1906, the House minority began to demand reforms. At times, the minority was more in
                    tune with the program of President Roosevelt than the controlling element in the Republican
                        majority.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to focus national attention on Congressional inactivity, in the regular session of
                    1907–1908, Williams began demanding roll calls "on every affirmative matter of
                    legislation" and refusinng unanimous consent.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> As Alexander correctly
                    asserted in his <hi rend="i">History and Proceedure of the House of Representatives</hi>, Williams
                    "did not expect to break the Reed rules, but he sought to create a campaign issue and he
                    hoped to arouse national attention and interest."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> As might have been
                    expected, the majority party lost no time in throttling the aggressive movements of the minority.
                    Having sufficient strength, stringent special rules were adopted that completely tied the hands of
                    the Democrats.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In realtiy, the rules increased the Speaker's powers
                    at the expense of both majority and minority members of the House. Williams commented: "We
                    have gotten to the point where the procedures of this House lie within the secret conscience of the
                    Speaker. There is no duty anymore for him to communicate his reasons, his motives, or his feelings

            <p>At least once during this struggle, the friendship between Williams and Cannon suffered a temporary
                    collapse. One day the Speaker declared the House adjourned when Williams was on his feet clamoring
                    for recognition.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The Speaker then "made his way down and offered John
                    Sharp Williams his outstretched hand," but "Williams ignored it, turned his back
                    and left the floor." The angered Minority Leader declared that "the Speaker
                    exceeded his constitutional authority by declaring the House in recess" in such a manner,
                    and further that he resented such treatment from the Speaker and would insist on his right as a
                    member of the House, both for himself and for his colleagues.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> During this
                    period Williams and Cannon were at swords points at each daily session from the fall of the gavel to
                    the motion to adjourn, but the temporary coolness in their personal relations was soon forgotten.
                    Champ Clark remarked that Cannon and Williams "kissed and made up at the close of that
                    Congress. Williams offered the usual vote of thanks to the Speaker."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1907, Williams made a successful campaign for the <placeName>

                    be a candidate for his seat in the House in 1908. In the summer of 1908, Williams wrote Clark that
                    he was going to resign as Minority Leader and suggested that the Missourian take steps to become his
                    successor. Williams aided Clark in every way that he could and made certain the latter's
                    unanimous election.</p>
            <p>Before Williams left the House a fight began that was to end in the stripping of the autocratic
                    powers of the Speaker from Cannon in 1910. As early as 1907, Mark Sullivan began to urge in <hi rend="i">Collier's Weekly</hi> the overthrow of this despotic parliamentary system.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Signs of the revolt appeared in 1907 and again in 1909. It is impossible to

                    Although Cannon was not shorn of his power until after Williams left the House, beyond a doubt the
                    latter's work in molding the minority into a compact group which contested every foot of
                    parliamentary ground was an important factor in the victory for the House. Williams had constantly
                    pointed out the undemocratic features of the system under which one man completely controlled all
                    the activities of the House. In February, 1909, "speaking as one who is going to retire
                    from the House in less than a week," Williams talked at length concerning the faults of the
                    rules of procedure in the House that throttled all freedom.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>The fight against the Speaker was soon made a national issue.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The combination
                    of Democrats and insurgent Republicans outweighed the regular Republicans and the latter group was
                    overpowered. The real revolution came in March, 1910, when the Reed-Cannon Rules were overthrown.
                    Cannon was retained as Speaker, the latter fact being a clear indication that the fight was not
                    against Cannon personally but against the system which he had felt it his duty to uphold. When
                    Williams learned of the overthrow of Cannonism, he shouted "Hurrah for us;" After
                    reviewing his more than five years in opposition to the House Rules while he had served as leader of
                    the Democrats, the Mis-sissippian concluded: "A good start has been made but more remains
                    to be accomplished before the lower house of Congress will be a truly representative
                        body."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>The friendship of Cannon and Williams did not stop when Williams left the House in 1909. On March 4,
                    1911, Williams took up his work in the Senate and the contacts of the two friends continued.
                    "Uncle Joe" was not re-elected in 1912, going down to defeat with many of the
                    other members of the thoroughly divided Republican party. In 1914 however, his district returned the
                    seventy-eight year old legislative veteran to the House. Cannon's attitude toward the
                    Wilson administration was one of complete distrust and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Both Cannon and Williams voluntarily retired from public life in 1923. Near the end of their careers,
                    while chatting with a group of congressmen in a cloak room, Uncle Joe paid a great tribute to his
                    former adversary in the House: "I have known and heard every great debater in both houses
                    of Congress since the Civil War; I have read and studied the great orations and debates of every
                    super orator of this nation from its inception to the Civil War; I have studied carefully the

            <p>In 1921, Williams wrote to one of his friends of Cannon: "Speaking seriously, he is one of

               <hi rend="sup">47</hi> When the invitations to Cannon's annual birthday
                    dinner were sent out in February, 1923, Williams accepted with a feeling of sadness, saying:
                    "I expect it will be the last opportunity for Uncle Joe and me to swap jokes across the

                    the house and the other was accorded the same place in regard to the Senate. One editor in speaking
                    of their departure spoke of "John Sharp" as Uncle Joe's "old

                    conscious all over again of the traits that had made him powerful. His chief characteristics were

                    especially popular because the church was relatively far from the homes of many of the members and
                    at times hard to reach on account of the condition of the roads.</p>
            <p>In 1839, the construction of the second church was begun. The site of the old log church was
                    abandoned because churches had been built at Maysville and in <placeName>

                    erection of this building were members of the Horrall, Johnson, Wallace, Thomas, Peek and Chapman

                    rearrangements were made until the present grouping was arrived at—namely, Wesley

                    </placeName>, on the 17th of October, 1879.</p>
            <p>The deceased was born at Dunbarton, N. H., July 29, 1806, and graduated at Dartmouth College in 1828.
                    After spending two years in the South and Wst in the interest of Sunday-schools, he returned East,
                    and entering Andover Theological Seminary, graduated in the class of 1833, with the late Dr. Hovey,
                    of <placeName>

                    who have since obtained distinction.</p>
            <p>In 1833, on the recommendation of Prof. Hovey, who had recently come West as a pioneer missionary,
                    and had taken an active part in founding the college, Prof. Mills was appointed instructor, and

                    and 1855, during which he served as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He was the second
                    man who filled that office in Indiana.</p>
            <p>He early became deeply interested in the subject of popular education, and wrote for publication a

                    of Indiana, signed "One of the People," which was one of the means contributing to
                    the enactment of the school law of 1848.</p>
            <p>He was a man of great purity and energy of character, and will long be remembered as one of the most

                    </placeName>, in the eighteen-forties, was a center for the economic life of the community. It was
                    not only the supply house for the manufactured goods of the community, but it was also the
                    purchasing agency that handled the products which the pioneer farmers had to sell. Further, the
                    store served as paymaster for the men in the community who hired others, and as a bank for those who
                    had money to deposit or who needed to borrow. When tax-paying time came, individuals finding
                    themselves a little short of cash, it was to the store that they went for the amounts needed, the
                    advances being charged to the accounts of the borrowers. When a citizen wanted to transfer funds to
                    a distant city, it was the general store that expe-ditiously accomplished this by a simple transfer
                    of debits and credits with a firm in the far-away place. If a housewife needed a stamp or an ounce
                    of some drug from the apothecary's shop, it seems that she often went first to the store,
                    obtained twenty cents in cash, and then hastened on lo- make her other purchases.</p>
            <p>The most interesting facts gleaned from the pages of the old journal of John Vestal are those which
                    picture for us the details of home life among the early settlers. The entries examined were for the
                    period from February 15 to April 16, 1847. The record is, therefore, somewhat seasonal, but yet
                    fairly complete as winter goods were yet in demand while the coming season was being prepared
                        for.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As one might expect, the article which found most ready sale in the pioneer community was iron. Bar
                    iron, selling for five and six cents a pound, constituted most of the entries, although special
                    kinds and qualities sold as high as eighteen cents and English Blister Steel was even higher. There
                    were twenty-eight entries for iron in the sixty-day period.</p>
            <p>Calico and tobacco ran almost neck and neck, with the former winning by a slight margin. Presumably,
                    both should be classed as luxuries. Even among pioneer folk, the women must have had certain things
                    they wdnted. Cof <list type="footnotes">

                            John Vestal. who operated a general store in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                            </placeName> from 1841 to 186—. The journal has been used by Mr.
                            Vestal's descendants as a scrapbook. but a few of the entries for
                            1847–48 are intact as the clippings have not been mounted that far.</item>

                    the two-months. Strange to say, the pioneers bought their coffee for less than the cost
                    today—leven cents per pound. The only other articles bought more than ten times in the
                    period were harness, thread, linen, shoes, sugar, and saleratus. Shoes were evidently made by the
                    local shoemaker as he was credited in one place with $24 for thirty-eight pairs of shoes.
                    The cost to the consumer was froni fifty cents to $1.25 for a pair of shoes, and forty
                    cents to ninety cents for slippers. Of course, it must be remembered that the purchasing value of
                    money was considerably higher than it is today. Saleratus may mean little to the present generation,
                    but it was actualy plain baking soda that a few housewives were learning to use.</p>
            <p>The items bought fairly often but not as frequently as these above mentioned are quite varied. Those
                    appearing in the journal from five to ten times are handkerchief-pins, needles, combs, carpenter
                    tools, buttons, sheetings, and cornmeal. These seem to have brought about the same price as they do
                    today. For instance carpenters' saws were fifty cents to $1.25, which,
                    considering difference in exchange value, compares favorably. Cornmeal selling for fifty cents per
                        bushel<hi rend="sup">2</hi> is, of course, an exception because it was a home product.</p>
            <p>Items occurring more than once, and less than five times were dishes, onion sets, gloves, copperas,
                    white flour, molasses, socks, nails, candlesticks, silk handkerchiefs, tea, spelling books, powder
                    and lead, brown muslin, cotton yarn, tumblers, plow lines, jeans, sweet potatoes, cotton edging,
                    gingham, red flannel, hoes, and children's stockings.</p>
            <p>It is in this last list that some of the most interesting information is to be found, some haphazard
                    bits of which should be mentioned. That all the cloth used was not homespun is evident. Pioneer
                    homes were not dry or warm enough to keep sweet potatoes over for seed. Only one family could use
                    white flour bought at the mill. In the busiest repair season of the year, it seems as if more nails
                    would have been bought. The purchase of copperas probably indicates that it was to be used for
                    dyeing. Only two families bought store socks for the men, and only one had the taste or pocketbook
                    for tea, which was one dollar per pound.</p>
            <list type="footnotes">
               <item>
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> This probably meant the amount of meal made from a bushel of
                    corn.</item>

            <p>Forty-eight other items appear in the journal as purchases made by the pioneer community, but once
                    during the sixty-days. This list includes turpentine, suspenders, cotton-batts, fishhooks,
                    razor-strop, apples, thimble, fur hat, potatoes, brass-kettle, boots, window-glass, matches,
                    tinbucket, candlewick, dried apples, ribbon, tin-cup, grindstone, almanac, Bible, lace, Italian
                    cravat, spinning wheel, bed-ticking, and tea-pot. It seems significant that cotton-batts, matches,
                    tin-bucket, thimbles, and potatoes should appear in this list of things which evidently were the
                    luxuries of the period. The Bible at fifty cents may be understood, but the almanac being sold at a
                    nickel is something to ponder.</p>
            <p>In this journal, the articles bought by the store are also recorded. From February 15 to April 16,
                    the store bought eggs only once, paying three cents a dozen. One of the entries listed hens bought
                    at one dollar a dozen, and chickens at eight cents each. Sugar was bought six times as this was the
                    maple season. Eight cents per pound was paid for it. Fifteen yards of flax-jeans brought some
                    pioneer a credit of $3.75. Apples were bought twice, molasses three times, the former at
                    two and one-half cents per pound and the latter at sixty-two and one-half cents per gallon. Meal was
                    procured six times, wheat twice, and feathers three times. The prize purchases were butter, nine
                    purchases being made, totaling almost 100 lbs. at ten cents per pound. It must have gone hard to
                    have traded fifteen yards of flax-jeans at twenty-five cents for seven and one-half yards of
                    gingham, but we must consider how the hearts of pioneers were gladdened with
                    "store" goods. The man who sold thirty dozen eggs for ninety cents bought a fur
                    hat costing $2.50.</p>
            <p>These prices coupled with the extremely low wages are ample proof that a dollar was worth more than
                    it is today. There are dozens of entries that vouch for the fact that men carpentered, cut briars,
                    put up hay or repaired rail-fences for seventy-five cents a day. Others furnished timber, cut the
                    wood, and hauled it to town for thirty-five, forty, and sixty cents a cord. These were the old,
                    genuine cords, 8¢4¢4 and not our ricks 8¢4¢154, which
                    are but one-third of an actual cord.</p>
            <p>Yet these people found time and inclination to enjoy life as much as we do. What a world of dreams is
                    hidden <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-035-3-068"/> behind the prosaic entry: "three painted toy
                    tin cups—fifteen cents." And what a new note is sounded here: "three
                    subscriptions to the Saturday Evening Post—$1.25 each, for Silas Whitted,
                    Isaac M. Scroggan, and James Erwin."</p>
            <p>On April 14, just before Easter, one family bought the largest bill of goods of record in the old
                    account book—$10.30. Every bit of it was spent for slippers, buttons, calico,
                    cotton tweed, and a velvet cap. And was that family decked out? Twenty-five yards of calico required
                    $4.00, and seven yards of cotton tweed cost $1.50.</p>
            <p>It is the common understanding that little manufactured cloth was used in pioneer communities. This
                    journal in sixty days, included twenty-four entries for calico, five for domestic, thirteen for
                    linen, three for gingham, two for flannel, and one each for casinette, modelaine, brown Holland,
                    cottonade, as well as the usual drill, tweed, lawn, checks, and shirting. The effects of the
                    industrial revolution were just reaching the Middle West and the new goods were quite popular with
                    the public that had known only the harsh, coarse, drab, home-weaves for so long.</p>
            <p>By and large, the old journal presents some new interpretations and many odd facts concerning these
                    very frugal, hard-working, but none-the-less human forefathers whose world was so different from
                    that of the present. The general store was a community center for the pioneers.</p>

                    enough to print one six column page at a time. It was operated by means of a lever and it required a
                    good strong man to handle it. There was in addition one small job press, and barely enough type of
                    various kinds for the two presses. The type was inked by hand and the papers had to be laid on the
                    press one at a time, which made the printing a very slow process. Besides doing what little writing
                    was required, the editor also did the mechanical work with the assistance of a
                    "devil" in the person of a boy about twelve years old. Not a great deal of type
                    had to be set as the paper made use of more or less "boiler plate." As a matter of
                    course, the editor was also the reporter. He was a young, unmarried man and depended to a
                    considerable extent on boarding house gossip for his news. As he was quite popular with the young
                    ladies of the town, they furnished occasional information concerning local happenings. A good share
                    of the day was spent at the case, so the most of his writing was done at night. Notwithstanding the
                    crude equipment and methods the paper compared favorably with its contemporaries in the small towns
                    of that day. <placeName>

                    prior to 1880, it had enlarged and improved its equipment. Its equipment was, however, far below
                    that of even the small town papers of today. Its type was all set by hand and it was printed on a
                    hand-press of the cylinder type which was operated with a crank instead of being worked with a
                    lever. While the editor had grown up in the <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-035-3-070"/> office and was a
                    practical printer, he did none of the mechanical work. He had two or three printers to set the
                    straight matter and several to set the advertising and job work. The paper was a weekly, nine-column
                    folio. The editor did not have a separate office, but did his work on a table in one corner of the
                    room.</p>
            <p>The editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrat, at that time was William A. Beane, known throughout northern Indiana as
                    "Billy Beane." He had entered the office as "devil" in 1844 and
                    was connected with the paper in one capacity or another until his death in 1893—for
                    almost thirty-five years as its editor. His name became so thoroughly identified with the journal
                    that the mention of one always suggested the other. The Democrat had an individuality such as few
                    papers have today. Beane was a hater of all kinds of sham, pretense and trickery and had the courage
                    to expose them. Notwithstanding his ability and inclination to wield a vitriolic pen, when he
                    thought occasion demanded it, no kinder hearted man ever lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His friends were legion and his friendships did not run along political lines. He had
                    as many friends among his political foes as in his own party, and he seemed to take more delight in
                    excoriating a Democratic rascal than he did a Republican rascal. He wouldn't have fitted
                    into the impersonal journalism of today. His own personality appeared in every issue of his paper.</p>

                    <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> was edited by George T. Ager, a man of far different type. Before
                    taking up journalism he had been a high school principal and had served a term as county surveyor.
                    He was a master of biting sarcasm which he employed in nearly every issue of his paper. Unlike Mr.
                    Beane, he was not the kind of person to make friends. In fact he did not seem to care very much
                    whether he had friends or not. His office was equipped about as were the others. He had a partner
                    who did all of the mechanical work while he did everything else. At that time there were three
                    weeklies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> and all seemed to thrive.</p>
            <p>My own experience in journalism began in 1899, when I accepted a position on the editorial staff of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> of which John B. Stoll was the editor and publisher. For nearly ten years I
                    had been writing occasionally for several agricultural papers, but that was the extent of my
                    newspaper work. My regular occupation had been <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-035-3-071"/> farming. Going
                    from a farm into the office of a daily paper in a city of 35,000 population was a decided change. At
                    that time, type was all hand set and so continued to be for a year or so after I entered the office.
                    There were about twenty employees altogether in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> office. There was a city
                    editor, one regular reporter, and a bookkeeper. I acted as assistant to Mr. Stoll. The employees
                    were in the mechanical department. The place at that time was just a country office on a larger
                    scale.</p>
            <p>My duties were similar to those in any other newspaper office of that day. They included writing
                    editorials, reading proof, getting news over the telephone, and assignments to report the
                    proceedings of meetings, particularly those of farmers and teachers. My greatest difficulty was in
                    learning to read proof accurately. Mr. Stoll was very exacting in regard to this work. At first I
                    thought he was unnecessarily exacting, but in the course of time I learned that he was not.</p>
            <p>Before I had been in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> office quite two years, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Union</hi> was offered for sale and I embraced the opportunity to acquire a newspaper
                    of my own. Knowing nothing about the mechanical department, I was unable to judge the equipment but
                    ventured blindly and made the purchase. After taking possession, I found out that part of the
                    equipment was little better than junk. The press was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, probably not less than forty years old. The former proprietor had a blind man in his
                    employ to turn the press, and I kept him until I was able to get a better press and a gasoline
                    engine. The office was just a typical old time newspaper office. My help consisted of a young man
                    and a young lady who did all of the mechanical work while I did the rest. I was editor, reporter,
                    proof reader. solicitor, collector and general roustabout. That is what all country editors had to
                    be in those days. In fact some of them had to do most of the mechanical work besides. The office was
                    not equipped with a folder or a mailing machine. The papers had to be folded by hand and the
                    addresses had to be written in long hand. With a circulation of 1800, this was a tedious task at
                    which all three of us worked until we were through. That had to be done every week for a year and a
                    half when I was able to buy a folder, but we continued to write the addresses by hand.</p>
            <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-035-3-072"/>
            <p>There was one familiar character in earlier days who needs to be mentioned and that was the tramp
                    printer. He was usually a master of the trade who had the wanderlust and could not content himself
                    long in one place. When he entered a town, he would call at the printing office and if there, was a
                    rush of work he would be welcomed and given employment. Sometimes he would stay a week and sometimes
                    longer, but seldom more than a month, no matter how badly he might be needed. Sometimes he would
                    work right along with every appearance of contentment, but on a morning after pay-day, he would be
                    missing. Some of those fellows would end their stay by getting gloriously drunk. If work was slack
                    when the tramp put in an appearance, he would be given a single day's work to furnish him
                    enough money to live on until he got to the next town.</p>
            <p>There are very few offices today like those which have been described and the tramp printer has
                    become extinct. Nearly all of the offices, even those in the smaller towns have modern equipment.
                    But there was something fascinating about newspaper work a generation ago, in spite of all the
                    handicaps. To men who have a taste for it, journalism is still an attractive profession, as it was
                    at the turn of the century.</p>

            <p>The death of Florence Venn on August 22 put an end to one of the most important and efficient
                    services ever performed in the Indiana Historical Society. For twenty-five years prior to her
                    engagement by the Society, she had been head of the Reference Division of the State Library. Here
                    her remarkable, one might almost say intuitive, command of sources of information had not only made
                    her the final resort on general questions referred to the Library, but had contributed in large
                    measure to the building up of a noteworthy collection with the comparatively small funds at the
                    disposal of the Library. When the William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Historical Society,
                    bequest of the late Delavan Smith of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Lake Forest, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, was to be installed in the new State Library and Historical Building, the Society was
                    fortunate in Securing Miss Venn's services as librarian. She took charge on February 1,
                    1934, and, from then until her death, her work was a source of the utmost satisfaction and
                    gratification to all who had any contact with the Society's library. A large part of it was
                    composed of standard sets of literature and of other books which, while important in a fine private
                    library, were not very serviceable in a special historical library. The decision of what books to
                    retain and what books to exchange or sell was made by Miss Venn, as time has shown, with unerring
                    accuracy. The policy of the library was shaped in the direction of making it a collection of rare
                    and valuable items relating directly or indirectly to Indiana and the surrounding
                    states—the region historically known as the Old Northwest. Under Miss Venn's
                    direction, the purchases made contributed definitely to this end. Valuable additions were also made
                    through gifts. It is due largely to Miss Venq that the Society can now be very proud of its library.</p>
            <p>To all committees of the Society and to others with questions relating to sources of information,
                    Miss Venn gave most gracious and efficient service. Though her untimely death limited her work with
                    the Historical Society Library to only five and one-half years, she rendered a service of permanent
                    and inestimable value. In and beyond this, her fine personality and her charm made all associations
                    with her <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-035-3-074"/> a privilege which was highly prized and will be long
                    remembered.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the Library Committee on September 22, Caroline Dunn of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was elected librarian of the William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana
                    Historical Society. Miss Dunn is a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, and of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Library School with the degree of Bachelor of Library Science. She has had
                    sixteen years library experience, the larger part of it as librarian of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library. Her more recent experience has been in the Indiana State Library. She
                    is president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Special Libraries Group. She is expected to take charge of her new work on November 1.
                    Meanwhile, the library is in charge of Richard C. Smith, who has been assistant to Miss Venn during
                    the last three years and who is an active member of the Committees on Old Mills and Covered Timber
                    Bridges.</p>
            <p>The Indiana History Conference will be sponsored this year, as formerly, by the Society of Indiana
                    Pioneers, the Indiana Historical Society, and the state Historical Bureau. It will be held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, beginning Friday noon and closing Saturday evening, December 8 and 9. This conference
                    is the one annual meeting ground of the historical societies of the state: high school, college and
                    university teachers of history, local and state historical societies, junior county historical
                    societies and high school clubs, archaeologists, genealogists, and an increasing number of
                    individuals for whom history is either a major or minor interest. The program naturally is given
                    largely to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history and especially to the history of this part of the country. However, it is not
                    limited to Indiana history. It is an Indiana conference, not because it deals solely with Indiana,
                    but because it is a conference of Indiana persons and organizations. The meetings are open to the
                    public.</p>

            <head>History Teachers' Forum: THE LENGTH OF THE TETHER</head>
            <byline>W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> O. L<hi rend="sc">YNCH</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>There is a story that a professor who showed up at Johns Hopkins University back in the
                    eighteen-nineties to take some graduate courses, when asked by a fellow graduate student why he
                    came, replied: "I came to lengthen my tether." This answer, said to have been
                    given by Albion W. Small to Frederick J. Turner, is full of significance. It impressed me very much
                    when I heard it, and, in the years since, I have often passed the simple but profound message which
                    it holds on to people capable of further education.</p>
            <p>Everyone has sometime seen a cow grazing on a village common tied with rope or chain to a stake or
                    rod driven into the ground. The tether in such a case is the radius of a circle. Often the cow will
                    exhaust the supply of grass within the circle. Then she will stick her neck out (not here a slang
                    expression) and reach after every bite of grass at her command around the entire circumference. Even
                    a cow knows enough to enlarge her circle of operations and thus increase her happiness or
                    well-being. Should her owner double her tether he quadruples her grazing area, and, should he treble
                    it, he multiplies it by nine, since circles are to each other as the squares of their radii.</p>
            <p>A fundamental reason for acquiring an education, if not the most fundamental, is that it enlarges the
                    circle of life. An education does not create any gray-matter, but it enables the possessor of
                    gray-matter to make better use of what he has. It does not matter whether one obtains his knowledge
                    and skills in college or out of college, or both in and out of, his horizon is pushed farther
                    away—he lengthens his tether.</p>
            <p>The teacher of history who constantly increases his knowledge or adds to his understanding of
                    historical events and movements, not only enlarges his own circle, but is enabled to do more for
                    those who study under his direction. There is something nourishing in the learning process that one
                    engaged in any kind of teaching cannot remain alive without. The teacher of history who does not to
                    some extent constantly seek new knowledge loses what is truly essential. In fact, such a teacher
                    proves by the lack of an inner urge to <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-035-3-076"/> further study that he
                    missed the most important acquisition when taking his training. There is no such thing as acquiring
                    an education in history, or in any other field, and remaining fit ever afterwards. A life-license to
                    teach any subject is no guarantee against certain deterioration unless there is a never-ending
                    search for more knowledge and meditation on its meaning. To reach a certain degree of training and
                    efficiency and then stop means that the tether is not lengthened, and that the area on which one
                    feeds becomes more and mare barren. To increase the length of the tether, on the other hand, means
                    growth and a richer life.</p>

            <p>Jesse Lynch Holman was born on October 24, 1784, near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. After
                    taking a preparatory course, he read law in the office of Henry Clay. In 1806, or the following
                    year, Mr. Holman took up the practice of law in Carrollton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, then known as Port William. He married Elizabeth, the daughter of Judge Richard
                    Masterson. In 1810, Mr. Holman and wife came to Indiana and settled near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The name of the Holman home, Veraestau, was formed by combining the Latin words
                    meaning spring, summer, and autumn. There was to be no winter at the Holman home.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Mr. Holman served in the territorial legislature and as a territorial judge. Later, he was
                    for a number of years a member of the state supreme court. In 1830, Governor James <placeName>

                    </placeName> Ray refused to re-appoint him. As the correspondence printed below shows, he sought
                    appointment to the vacancy after Benjamin Parke, federal judge for the Indiana district, died in
                    1835. He was appointed to this judgeship during the recess of Congress, and, after a somewhat
                    prolonged wait, his nomination was sent to the Senate by President Jackson and confirmed by that
                    body in the spring of 1836. The letters here presented relate to the appointment. The originals are
                    owned by Miss Mildred Wagenhals of Calistoga, <placeName>

                        <p>I have delayed writing in expectation of hearing from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> the result of my application. That has terminated favorably. I this day
                                    rec'd a Commission as Judge of the District Court, as long as the President
                                    had power to appoint in vacation until the close of the next session of the Senate.
                                    In obtaining this Commission, I am specially indebted to Mr. Hendricks, Amos Lane,
                                    &amp; Jon. McCarty within the State. And to some influential friends without the
                                    State. Some others in our State, not Representatives, have written warmly in my
                                    favor. Gen'l <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> previously recommended another, but gave a strong (secondary)
                                    recommendation in my favor (and I have been informed that it was believed at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that both he &amp; Hendricks wished me appointed)…. I
                                    feel under particular obligations to Hendricks, for had it not been for his
                                    encouragement &amp; his influence, with men out of the State, who could operate
                                    indirectly, but powerfully on the heads of department at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I should have given it up at the outset. I am well satisfied, too,
                                    that he had an eye to what my friends might do for him in time of need. I am
                                    therefore anxious, that my friends should remember this favor from him &amp;
                                    requite it as far as lies in their power.</p>
                        <p>My course was a very quiet one as to the appointment. My nearest neighbors knew
                                    nothing of it. I named it to no one but those that I was confident could aid me, but
                                    with those I took as effective measures as lay in my power, so that if I had failed
                                    I should have known it was not for the want of exertions.</p>
                        <p>I have been thus full on this matter, knowing you feel an interest in it, &amp;
                                    especially I wished you to know the part Hendricks took in <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>As to the confirmation of my appointment, or the President's making a
                                    different nomination, I have nothing definite to observe. Nor do I know of anything
                                    specific to apprehend. The President has the power to nominate another, but such a
                                    course would be, I believe, almost unprecedented. It is certain that my friends

                                    forward with any material objection to my success. <hi rend="i">This however among
                                        ourselves.</hi> I should be glad if Kinnard<hi rend="sup">⋆</hi>, or
                                    any other of our Delegation could be indirectly influenced to favor my appointment.
                                    You perhaps or some of your acquaintances, might have some bearing upon Gov. Cass,
                                    or other members of the Cabinett [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] or the Senators of other
                                    States. I know, as I said, of no ground of apprehension, but my motto is never to
                                    consider anything sure, that may by any possibility be defeated, but at the same
                                    time, never to embolden opposition by acting as if I considered any real danger as
                                    existing. Every point should be carefully guarded, and for that reason I wish the
                                    earliest intelligence of any efforts that may be making to counteract my success. As
                                    to the appointment of a Clerk I have not yet determined as to the course I shall
                                    pursue. I have consulted some of our delegation on the subject. I shall consult
                                    others, and act accordingly; I am somewhat apprehensive that, any hesitation on my
                                    part, as to the appointment of a Clerk, may be construed into an idea that I am
                                    afraid to take that independent course that a Judge ought to pursue. Bassett is
                                    strongly recommended by Hendricks &amp; Lane, as well as others, &amp; if
                                    they and particularly Hendricks should think the appointment should be made at the
                                    organization of the Court I shall venture to do it….</p>

                        <p>Permit me to congratulate you on your late appointment. It was so much out of the
                                    order of things that it was some time before I could believe it. If I am not
                                    mistaken the Judge has the appointing of his own clerk. Should this be the case I

                                    </placeName>], he I believe is honest and faithfull and I think capable, and is
                                    really needy of som assistance. If it should be consistent with your own feelings to
                                    confer the appointment to Mr. Bassett I assure you that it will much gratify one of

                        <p>On reading again this morning your letter of the 27. Oct. which had found its way
                                    into a file of unanswered letters I feel mortified &amp; ashamed that I should

                        <p>On that subject I see not the smallest unpropriety in your addressing yourself to the

                                    requesting their friendly feelings in the matter. This on the principle that men
                                    generally are fond of some attention, and it might bury efforts to raise an
                                    opposition to your app't among the delegation, should any such be made.

                                    mind that this should be my last effort for office whether successful<hi rend="sup">1</hi> or not, I consented to do all my friends thought was incumbent on me,
                                    although everything seems rather against me. I was detained at <placeName>

                                    detained the greater part of today at Cincinnatti by the same cause. And before
                                    this, a failure in the mails left me unapprized of what was <list type="footnotes">

                                    that might be made at the Convention. Lane had previously written to me under date
                                    of Dec. 21st stating the charges that five of our members had allyed [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] against me, [writing] to the President, &amp; urging him to
                                    nominate Howard, but added that I need not fear as the nomination would be made next
                                    week. And <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> in his letter to Bassett, suggests a rumor or something of that nature
                                    that my name would be sent to the Senate in a few days. Since Dec. 31 my <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> papers have entirely failed for three mails. This left me entirely in
                                    the dark on the subject nor was I able while in Cincinnatti to get sight of a
                                    regular file of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> papers, and not knowing but letters from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> directed to me, as well as my papers, might have failed by the way,
                                    there seemed the more need of my going on to the City. I thought when I left home
                                    that perhaps by the time I arrived at Wheeling the matter would be settled, but I am
                                    afraid if it is I shall learn nothing about it without delaying too long as while I
                                    staid in Cincinnatti [sic] I could not get hold of a regular file of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> papers. I am very much afraid the opposition against me will be too
                                    numerous for my success. If the members of the Convention generally recommended
                                        Whitcomb<hi rend="sup">16</hi>, no matter how much they may have been deceived
                                    in the business, it will seem to justify one of the reasons … against me
                                    that the friends of the Administration throughout the State are dissatisfied with my
                                    appointment…. Although I am going to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> it is not with any particular hope of influencing the matter
                                    particularly in my favor, and I know it has been said that applicants for office
                                    have been at times so numerous at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that their presence in general does more harm than good but my being
                                    there may at least repel some charges that are alleged against me, if it does
                                    nothing more. I am astonished at the course said to be taken by McCarty. Nor can I
                                    conjecture what his motives can have been for such an entire change. <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> in his letter to Bassett states that Cam is violent on the subject,
                                    &amp; had authorized him to inform the President that he had no objection to my
                                    appointment. But if my friends at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> were not able to prevail in having my name sent to the Senate; before
                                    the 8th of January petition comes to hand I fear they will fail entirely afterwards.
                                    There is but one thought that would counteract this idea, &amp; that is that the
                                    Western members at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> all recommend Howard &amp; the petition from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> will recommend Whitcomb, which may produce some confusion in council. I
                                    expect I have now written more than you can read as the Boat shakes so much that I
                                    can scarcely form my letters at all.</p>

                        <p>Agreeably to the information I gave you from Portsmouth, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, I arrived here on my way to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington City</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Here on the evening before last, about 9 o'clock at night,
                                    the stage upset about half way up the green ridge of the Allegany Mountains. Myself
                                    and one other, a Doctor Jamison [Jameson] of Cincinnatti, late of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> were considerably injured, the Doctor apparently more serious than
                                    myself. I rec'd a severe wound on my head which bled very profusely, but is
                                    not as yet very painful, though I expect it will be a bad sore. But the worst injury
                                    I rec'd was in the back of my neck &amp; between my shoulders. I am not
                                    conscious of how I received the injury. I was stunned by the blow on my head, so as
                                    to be insensible of the manner in which I was hurt, but suppose that my neck was
                                    strained or wrenched in some way as my head struck, as I rec'd no bruise on
                                    that part of my body, &amp; am in hopes that I shall get over it before long.
                                    Myself and the Doctor are with a very kind family, &amp; the stage agents
                                    proffer us every assistance in their power. Some blame is attached to the driver by
                                    every person but those interested. The stage upset going uphill in a walk, &amp;
                                    the horses were quiet &amp; stopped immediately. The only excuse made for
                                    upsetting was that the snow was deep &amp; falling very fast, &amp; had
                                    drifted so that the horses left the road, which was thrown up about their [three]
                                    feet, &amp; drove the carriage over the bank. We were near a house or I know not
                                    what might have been our condition, as I was stunned by the blow &amp; my head
                                    so dizzy as to be unable to stand for some time, &amp; was supported to the
                                    house with some difficulty, &amp; Doctor Jamison fainted before he got out of
                                    the carriage. He is un <list type="footnotes">

                                    without severe pain. I have apprized Hendricks and <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> of my situation &amp; expect to hear from them in a few days. I am
                                    about a hundred and twenty miles from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; expected to have reached the city in twenty four hours. I
                                    know not when I shall be able to travel, and cannot now say whether I shall proceed
                                    to the City when I, recover or not, it will depend on the intelligence I receive
                                    from the City. The stage proprietors proffer us a sleigh or any mode of conveyance
                                    we wish, and I now feel as if it would be a long time before I can bear the jolting
                                    of the stage. I am awaiting information from the City with much anxiety, and shall
                                    not close this letter until I hear what is likely to be done in my case.</p>
                        <p>Jan. 30. I am recovering very fast. The pains in my back &amp; shoulders are
                                    abating every day. I have just had my coat on for the first time &amp; find I
                                    can now wear it without much pain. I have just rec'd a letter from Mr.
                                    Hendricks, advising me to come on to the City as soon as I recover. He intimates an
                                    opinion that the affair will ultimately terminate in my favor, but thinks my
                                    presence in the City will help. But says no inconvenience will result from delaying
                                    until I am well. I cannot yet bear my hat on my head, as the weight falls on the
                                    principal wound, but the wound has occasioned but little pain as yet. The cut was
                                    about three inches long in the forepart of my head, &amp; a small cut in the
                                    top. Doctor Jamison thinks it will probably heal up without occasioning much
                                    suffering. I think, according to my present feelings, that by Monday or Tuesday I
                                    shall be able to travel slowly in a sleigh, &amp; the snow in the mountains is
                                    now highly favorable to that mode of travelling. I could not bear the jolting of the
                                    stage.</p>
                        <p>If I get on I shall write you again from <placeName>

                        </salute>
                        <p>I have this morning rec'd your letter of the 25th and regret your stage
                                    accident. Have consulted the friends you name and they all say <hi rend="i">come
                                    on.</hi> I say, get well first, for there is no danger of hasty action of the
                                    President. I saw him on Saturday last read him a portion of your letter denying
                                    abolition, etc. I believe all will ultimately be well. Your coming will help.</p>
                        <p>I wrote you at length some time ago and regret you did not get it before you left
                                    home. I have rec'd many letters and have showed several to the President. <placeName>

                        </salute>
                        <p>In reply to your letter of 26 last month I have to inform you that nothing has been
                                    done here in relation to your nomination, but receive and lay before the President
                                    letters and papers on both sides, the opposition to your nomination originated with
                                    our Delegation in Congress and was intended to affect others besides yourself. You
                                    have been mistaken in regards to Genl. Carr's course, of which I wrote to
                                    you but suppose that my letter had not arrived when you left home the Gen'l
                                    is not opposed to you.</p>
                        <p>I delayed answering your letter two days with a view of seeing the P. and urging what
                                    I suggested some weeks ago, viz., to appoint you to our Court and Mr. Whitcomb to a
                                    Judgeship in the new Territory. I called on Saturday and found the P. surrounded
                                    with company. I can do no more than hand him some letters from your friends and
                                    request an interview before a decision is made.</p>

                        </salute>
                        <p>I am here and nearly well. All that remains of my disaster in the mountains is a sore
                                    head. The wound is nearly healed up. Today I have gone without a bandage with
                                    nothing but a plaster, which the hair on my forehead nearly covers, so that I can go
                                    out without any particular inconvenience. Hitherto I have not gone out, &amp;
                                    have seen but few of our delegation. My operations thus far have been to soothe <placeName>

                           <hi rend="sup">25</hi> and McCarty as far as possible. Our delegation is
                                    in a sad condition at open war wik each other, &amp; this is the sole cause of
                                    all the difficulty in my case. <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, and has aimed to defeat me for the principal purpose of destroying
                                    their influence. McCarty is extremely bitter against <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName> &amp; Lane, &amp; will oppose any man they advocate. He
                                    pretends to think there was some secret understanding between Lane &amp; myself
                                    which he gives as the reason for opposing me. I think I have removed this
                                    impression. As Hendricks has eluded their penetration, as to the part he has taken
                                    in this matter, &amp; I am not at liberty to disclose the efficient agency in

                                    promised by Lane, which is an idea peculiarly obnoxious. I go as far as I can in

                                    wishes to have his opposition quieted down before he makes the appointment. I am
                                    already convinced that my coming on has thus far had a good effect. I am not

                                    I have more intercourse with the opposition members than with my friends. I have had
                                    a long talk with NcCarty. I believe he regrets the course he has taken, &amp; I

                                    are, for their own sakes, as well as mine, laying out all their might in it. My
                                    intention is to visit the President tomorrow &amp; also to go up to the Capital.
                                    I have written thus far to show you <hi rend="i">in confidence</hi> the real state
                                    of the case. Though I shall not close this until the nomination is made, unless it
                                    should be delayed too long. A word as to my defeat in the mountains. I was detained
                                    there nine days, &amp; after that I travelled by easy stages in a sleigh,
                                    &amp; was four days travelling what might have been done in half a day in the
                                    stage. But I resolved to run no risk. I am afraid my long absence from home will
                                    derange my affairs very much. I had purchased the quarter section of land adjoining
                                    me with four or five hundred cords of wood on it, &amp; had just completed a
                                    wood shoot down the hill, &amp; was just preparing at least to establish a wood
                                    yard. Everything was finished but the boat the evening I left home. I have a good
                                    waggon &amp; train, &amp; two men employed to haul wood &amp; several
                                    others were about commencing to cut me a quantity more. I had also rented out my
                                    farm or the greater part of it, &amp; the man was sick who was to have it, so as
                                    to render it doubtful about his taking it. So that altogether I left home at the
                                    most inconvenient time that could have been selected for several months. But when
                                    the subject of coming here was proposed &amp; concluded on, I knew that if I
                                    came at all I must come immediately. So I dropt all, and left it to chance and the
                                    agency of others. I started, thinking to have been at home by this time. If I should
                                    not succeed in this business it will embarrass me very much…. I have just
                                    called on Doctor Davis. His first preferences were in favor of Whitcomb &amp; he
                                    still adheres to him, but is by no means obstinate, says he will leave the matter
                                    entirely to the President &amp; be content who will be appointed. I have been to
                                    see the President. I was accompanied &amp; introduced by Gen'l Carr,
                                    who stands somewhat neuter in this business, though rather inclined to favor my
                                    appointment. The President received me very cordially. I was fortunate enough to
                                    find him alone. He conversed freely on a great variety of subjects. Talked for <list type="footnotes">

                                    &amp; the opposition that WBS got up against me; seemed to be apprized that the
                                    opposition was not so much against me as against my friends. He mentioned the charge
                                    of abolition, which Hannegan &amp; others had started &amp; which I had
                                    answered in several letters, which I had shown him. I satisfied him completely on
                                    that subject, &amp; especially by repeating my decision in the first Negro case
                                    I acted on a few days after I rec'd my commission, &amp; which I gave a

                                    </placeName>. I stated the principles upon which I decided. It gave him entire
                                    satisfaction &amp; Carr remarked afterwards that the Gen'l was
                                    particularly pleased with my decision. He spoke of the appointment as if he intended
                                    to give in my name, but said there was no need to be in haste about it, &amp; he
                                    wanted to have <placeName>

                                    not even name Kinnard. Spoke slightly about McCarty, &amp; named Hannegan as

                                    I suspect Hannegan &amp; Kinnard, the one rough &amp; the other
                                    designing…. A man who has as much influence with the President as any
                                    man, &amp; who knows how matters of the kind generally go, told me today that I
                                    had nothing to fear, as I would certainly be appointed. But there is no telling when
                                    the matter will be determined &amp; my friends say I must not leave the ground
                                    until the matter is settled. So that I know not how long I may have to stay. I have

                                    him to bring the matter to a close, as no good can result from the

                        <salute>My dear Judge,<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                        </salute>
                        <p>With the exception of the very unexpected pleasure of meeting with yourself, I assure
                                    you that no circumstance could give us more real, sincere gratification, than your
                                    very kind and friendly letter of the 9th March last, which was handed me on Sunday
                                    the 20th by your friend the Hon. Mr. Lane, who carried it to my house, and with whom
                                    I had a long and very satisfactory conversation, principally about you, and the
                                    artful efforts that had been made by your opponents to prevent your appointment. I
                                    was very much pleased to hear Mr. Lane speak of you in such high terms as he did,
                                    and for the friendly expression of his feelings for you. I'm sure I respect
                                    him very much. To tell you the truth, when we learned that you had started for home,
                                    —of which circumstance by the bye, we were apprized in a day or two after
                                    your departure,—we were fairly nonplused,—it was to us
                                    inexplicable,—unaccountably so, but still we could not for a moment
                                    entertain an unfavorable or unkind feeling about you, nay on the contrary we felt
                                    well satisfied in our minds, that you had good and sufficient reasons for so doing,
                                    and although in painful suspence as to the cause of your return, we hoped it was not
                                    on account of any disagreeable or unpleasant occurrence, in our City, in reference
                                    to the object of your visit; and now My Dear Sir, you have removed every thought in
                                    relation to this matter, except that feeling of real unmixed pleasure which we
                                    experienced, as I read over your kind letter, and perfectly satisfactory
                                    explanation,—I will not say apologies, because we neither required nor
                                    expected any,—all I wished for I have now obtained,—that is
                                    the assurance of Judge Holman's unabated and sincere
                                    friendship,—conveyed to us in such a manner as to enhance its value, and
                                    here permit me to say, that it is highly prized, and most sincerely and truly
                                    reciprocated, by both Mrs. Brady and myself.</p>
                        <p>I'm sure after your long absence, and your "hair breadth
                                    scapes" [sic], that the meeting of Mrs. Holman and your dear children was a

                        <salute>My dear Mr. Lynch:</salute>
                        <p>I duly received the June Issue of the Magazine of History, and want to express
                                    appreciation on the part of the Riley Old Home Society and the people of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for the most interesting and illuminating story of Mr. Riley. So many
                                    of the items are well known to us of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and we feel indebted to Mr. Price and Mrs. Wood for the contribution.</p>
                        <p>However, there is one point that we of the Old Home Society would like to have
                                    corrected, as it is going to materially affect the history of our Shrine. In the
                                    second paragraph [p. 132], the article tells of the Riley home being in the old <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Academy which stood on South <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> Street just north of the railroad. This is correct. The children,
                                    however, were born in the home which was located on West Main Street. The first-born
                                    and the first daughter Celeste, who died in infancy, were born in the log cabin
                                    standing on the lot where the present house now stands. In 1848, the log house was
                                    moved back and the house now standing was begun.</p>
                        <p>James Whitcomb Riley was born in the log cabin when it was standing in the back part
                                    of the present lot, and when he was just one month old, they moved into the house
                                    which is now known as the Riley Shrine.</p>
                        <p>The house Mrs. Wood mentions, namely the Crawford home, is three doors east of the
                                    Riley home, and she evidently failed to remember the exact location.</p>
                        <p>In 1870, after the poet's mother died, through the change in financial
                                    circumstances, Reuben A. Riley sold the original home place, and then moved to the
                                    old Academy. In 1893, the year Reuben A. Riley died, James Whitcomb Riley purchased
                                    the old home site, and it was from his heirs that the city of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> purchased it some years ago.</p>
                        <p>All of this is fresh in my mind, as I was mayor of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at the time the negotiations were started with the heirs, and since
                                    then of course have been president of the Old Home Society, thus fully acquainted
                                    with the facts.</p>
                        <p>The Rileys never did occupy the Crawford house. The name <hi rend="i">Binfield</hi>
                                    [p. 1323 should be <hi rend="i">Binford</hi>, the superintendent of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Hancock County</region>
                                    </placeName> Schools, John H. Binford. Another statement I wish to clarify is that
                                    the present house standing was the home of James Whitcomb Riley until 1870; when he
                                    repurchased the home in 1893, his younger sister came out here to live for a while;
                                    then, again in 1912, he refurnished the house and lived here for a short while.</p>
                        <p>Another fact that should be corrected historically is that Mr. Riley did not give the
                                    house to Julia. The property was beaueathed <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-035-3-093"/> to
                                    the nieces and nephew, with the understanding that Julia was to have the right of
                                    occupancy as long as she so desired, and it was for this reason that the City of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                                    </placeName> was unable to purchase the Home and establish it as a Shrine until she
                                    moved west to reside with her brother, William Wilson, in Long Beach.</p>
                        <p>In reading the article, it occurs to the writer there is one human interest story
                                    that some day a writer of ability should handle, and that is his [James Whitcomb
                                    Riley's] story of Mary Alice Smith. If you have an opportunity to read the
                                    same, do so, as he tells of the "winding stair" in this house and
                                    how intimately it became a part of Mary Alice Smith and the stories she related to
                                    all of the Riley children. This piece alone will prove conclusively that the house
                                    we now have as a Shrine was really the childhood home of the poet.</p>
                        <p>Again expressing our appreciation for the work done by Mr. Price, and thanking you
                                    for the prominence given it, we are,</p>

                                    much that I failed to catch the confusion when checking the memoirs for my article.</p>

            <p>It was in September, 1920, that I came to Indiana University, but I did not teach in the summer
                    session until 1924. Class-work ended that year on Friday, August 8, and Mrs. Lynch and I took a
                    train for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the evening. For about a week, Indiana had been passing through a severe heat wave.
                    This did not seem a very fitting time to begin a trip that would take us into the Lower South, but
                    there was a certain advantage, the same being a strong probability that no warmer weather would be
                    found in Dixie-land than we had been enduring in the Hoosier domain for a while. Indeed, for a few
                    days, though the weather was hot, it was a bit less uncomfortable than it had been, and then a cool
                    wave that included the entire South spread over the country from the West. Just as we got back to
                    Ashland, <placeName>

                    a cooler region than the North. However, we knew that, while we were favored by pleasant summer
                    weather, fires were started in many furnaces back home and President Coolidge sat by a roaring fire
                    at his new <placeName>

                    and we found a considerable number of students and several members of the faculty on the campus. It
                    was at this time that we first met Dr. Albert B. Moore, head of the department of history and dean
                    of the graduate school, one of the finest of the new generation of history teachers in the South. I

                    which occurred the next day. It was in this address that the "Orator of Secession"
                    said so eloquently—"The man and the hour have met"—though it
                    seems he really had desired the hour to meet a different man. It was hard to disassociate the <placeName>

                    punctuate our journey by short runs from place to place, and take these runs as far as possible in
                    the daytime. Traveling from <placeName>

            <p>The total cost of the trip was $277.31. The total railroad mileage was 1,760, and I paid
                    out in fares (for two) the sum of $126.74. For taxi, street car, and bus fares (side
                    trips), the outlay was $20.18. At hotels, the rate for double rooms with bath varied from
                    $2.50 to $6.00, and we paid out for "lodgings" (fourteen
                    nights, including Pullman berths for one night) a total of $62.00. The night of August
                    21, we spent with relatives in Ashland, <placeName>

            <p>At the time of this trip, cotton was not ready for picking and ginning, except in the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> and Tuskegee. Even in this area, these processes had just started, but we saw pickers
                    at work and gins in operation. We picked some cotton with our own hands, as we have done many times
                    since, and we studied the work of a modern cotton-gin. Many of these are out in the country. They
                    are seldom painted, and are therefore dull and unattractive structures. They are, however, very
                    efficient. They are a far cry from Whitney's simple machine, but are in reality the same in
                    multiple form with other features added.</p>
