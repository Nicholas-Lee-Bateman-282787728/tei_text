					<p>Several English sparrows lit on th' blacksmith shop t'day an' give th' locality quite a

					<p>Th' feller that hugs his wife in company often kicks her at home.</p>
					<p>Speakin' o' opportunity, Hon. ex-Editur Cale Fluhart says that years ago he wuz offered
						a job o' runnin' a threshin' machine, but somehow he drifted in t' journalism, where he
						frittered away th' best years o' his life.</p>
					<p>With all th' newspapers filled with beauty hints it's funny we don't see more

					<p rend="center">St. Helena</p>
					<p>In his address before the Colonial Whist Club last evening at the home of Miss Fawn
						Lippincut, Professor Alex Tansey talked most entertainingly of the little Napoleon. In
						referring to the Island of St. Helena he said: "Instead of this historic speck being the
						desolate rock that it is popularly supposed to be, the Island of St. Helena is the most
						beautiful spot imaginable, rank with tropical greenery and superbly wooded. Besides the
						climate, which is the most healthy in the world, the island supports a nine-hole golf <figure>

						<pb id="VAC1104-028" n="[]"/> course. The river Sane winds its way to the sea through a
						beautiful peaceful valley. In this valley Napoleon spent much of his time, and those who
						picture him standing on a barren, volcanic rock looking for a sail would be surprised if
						they could see how charming that favorite spot is. There once stood the old house of
						Count Bertrand, through whose shutters Napoleon loved to watch the British troops drill
						on Deadwood plain. Napoleon did not like the idea of being seen, so in the shutters he
						had two holes made&mdash;one on a level with his eye when standing and the other when
						seated."</p>
					<p>Continuing, the Professor said: <q rend="blockquote">"Bertrand's house with its little
							front room has long since disappeared, but the holes are still there."</q>
					</p>

					<p>Things you order by telephone seem t' weigh less.</p>
					<p>No matter how mad a office holder gits he never quits.</p>
					<p>Speakin' o' sand papered spareribs, you might jist as well buy a xylophone fer
						dinner.</p>
					<p>Ever notice what pretty women th' girls have grown t' be that you used t' snub at
						school?</p>
					<p>Folks that unwrap caramels durin' a play should be made t' spend one whole Sunday in
						Urbana, Ohio.</p>
					<p>Who remembers th' ole fashioned butcher that used t' give away th' liver?</p>


					<pb id="VAC1104-030" n="[]"/>
					<p>Dr. Mop says he allus hates t' see th' cool fall days come 'cause his wife builds a
						fire in th' settin' room stove an' burns all th' money he's saved durin' th' summer.</p>
					<p>Lafe Bud never gits through tellin' 'bout gittin' kicked out o' a hut-tel at New Paris,
						Ohio, fer usin' a orange spoon on St. Patrick's day.</p>
					<p>After causin' a lot o' inconvenience an' extra work Mrs. Tipton Bud's niece has
						returned t' her home at Lilac, Indianny, after a most delightful visit.</p>
					<p>Tell Binkley has a new auto suit&mdash;fer th' spring term.</p>
					<p>Ther wuz a ole fashioned one-ring weddin' at th' Tilford Moots home t'day. </p>

					<p>Some folks git credit fer havin' hoss sense that haint ever had money enough t' make

					<p>It's better t' hand it t' others than it is t' receive.</p>
					<p>Th' school o' experience has no holidays.</p>
					<p>One o' our prominent society women has been doin' her own work fer three days without

					<p>Miss Fawn Lippincut has written a new polar song called "Beautiful Moonlight Days."</p>
					<p>Hon. ex-Editur Cale Fluhart, who is well educated in th' higher branches, is trimmin'

					<p>What's become o' th' couple that used t' live happily ever afterwards?</p>
					<p>A feller should never marry a girl till they've tried t' pick out a rug t'gether.</p>
					<p>Th' trusts know we all want t' live, no matter how much it costs.</p>
					<p>Ther's lots o' honest people who never had a good chance t' be anything else.</p>
					<p>Th' worst sensation I know of is gittin' up in th' night an' steppin' on a toy train o'
						cars.</p>
					<p>I guess "Th' Music Master" is a purty pathetic play, as Lafe Bud cried when he paid fer
						his ticket.</p>

					<p>Uncle Ez Pash has a son that's holdin' out at th' People's Bank.</p>

					<p>Th' more cultured th' audience th' less you see o' the first act.</p>
					<p>It's almost impossible fer a total stranger t' git a drink in a dry town.</p>

					<p>George Washin'ton never told a lie an' he wuz also a poor business man.</p>
					<p>Some feller stole a load o' peaches here Saturday night an' Constable Newt Plum has

					<p>All signs fail when you pick out a canteloupe.</p>
					<p>What comes easy goes easy&mdash;unless it's relatives.</p>
					<p>A big tombstone don't mean nothin' but money.</p>
					<p>Speakin' o' th' wave o' extravagance, lots o' workin' men now eat hominy at every meal
						that used t' be satisfied with th' cheaper cuts o' beef.</p>
					<p>Next t' a Californy railroad folder th' most allurin' thing is a poultry catalog.</p>
					<p>I guess th' hardest thing in th' world t' do is think o' a name when you git caught in

						<head rend="center">To the Reader</head>

						<p>Gentle Reader&mdash;In relating the life story of Marion Ellsworth I have struggled
							hard to avoid those commonplace conventionalities that go to make the modern novel so
							tiresome.</p>
						<p>It has been my purpose always to take the most direct route, regardless of tunnels,
							and bring the reader as quickly as possible, without change, to the climax of each
							event as they follow one another in rapid succession. Unavoidably, you will have a few
							hills to climb, but, I am pleased to say, no long, tiresome journeys to and fro across
							the continent, as I have terously kept the theater of my simple narrative <figure>
								<p rend="i">Miss Faten Lippincut </p>
							</figure>
							<pb id="VAC1104-046" n="[]"/> entirely within a mile square. At the beginning of each
							chapter it has been rather necessary to add a little dash of scenery&mdash;just enough
							to serve as a background for the different settings as the story unwinds itself.</p>
						<p>If, as I so fondly hope, this tale shall be the means of saving only one young girl
							from the snares and pitfalls that even lurk in the most out-of-the-way country
							nooks&mdash;of teaching her that all is not gold that glitters and that many a black
							and treacherous heart beats beneath a frock coat&mdash;I shall feel amply repaid for
							my efforts, even tho' I am left with the whole edition on my hands.&mdash;<hi rend="i"

						<p rend="i center">Behind the Honeysuckle Vines</p>
						<p>It was the month of primroses. A warm spring rain had fallen throughout the day and
							the evening air was heavy with the perfume of bursting buds.</p>
						<p>Situated in a natural amphitheater, the little county-seat town of X was completely
							hedged in by almost insurmountable wooded hills whose jagged crests were sharply
							silhouetted against the leaden sky. The stores and bazars of curious architecture that
							flanked the old, tumble-down court house on every side were dark and silent. A horse
							hitched to a narrow buggy <ref id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">*</ref>
							pawed restlessly under the flickering light of a soft drink pool room and nickered
							loudly as a few belated rounders emerged with boisterous laughter.</p>
						<p>Far to the east, nestled among the foliage <note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001"
									rend="super">*</ref>Buggy. A vehicle.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-048" n="[]"/> on the hillside, stood a sanatorium, and the rattle of
							crutches on the hard floor of the low, spacious veranda that fronted it could be
							distinctly heard across the wide expanse of pasture land. All was life and bustle
							about the green roofed structure, and cries of both torture and merriment filled the
							night air, while the wheezy notes of a leaky accordeon added to the weirdness of the
							scene. It was a motley crowd that filled the brilliantly lighted porch. The fame of
							the crystal springs that bubbled near at hand had spread to many lands, and the great
							hotel had become a shrine for the lame and halt of every tongue, and the babel was
							deafening.</p>
						<p>In a secluded nook completely hidden by a particularly early variety of sweet
							climbing honeysuckle sat two men who conversed in tones scarcely audible. One was a
							stocky, well dressed man who had probably lived beyond the scriptural allotment of
							years and <pb id="VAC1104-049" n="[]"/> whose white beard was neatly cropped. He had
							the manner and bearing of a well-to-do cattle raiser or an expert judge of hogs. His
							companion was a handsome, willowy chap of splendid proportions and bore all the
							evidences of a man of the world; a drooping, raven black mustache of no great length
							served its purpose by concealing a hard and cruel mouth, while his nervous glances and
							highly polished manner at once proclaimed him to be a bigamist or a promoter. After
							listening for quite a while to the low murmurings of his aged companion he hurriedly
							arose and grasping his cane tightly he pushed the vines aside and scampered down the
							steep rustic stairway that led to the beautifully parked grounds below. Once reaching
							the bottom he turned to look back, and as he did so he hissed between his even pearly
							teeth, "Fool, we shall see!" and was soon lost among the olives. His rotund companion
							sat for some moments and <pb id="VAC1104-050" n="[]"/> then slowly arose and tearing
							an advertising page from a popular magazine he carefully wrapped it about the butt of
							a soggy, thick five-cent cigar which he placed snugly away in a pocket of his corduroy
							waistcoat. Winding his way among the tables and chairs and now and then stumbling over
							a crutch he finally reached the office, where he left a call for five o'clock, as he
							filled a small granite pitcher with sulphur water and ascended the stairs to his
							room.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="center">CHAPTER II</head>
						<p rend="center i">The Mystery of Tharp's Corner</p>
						<p>It was still the month of primroses. After a warm rain that had fallen throughout the
							preceding day the morning dawned on a refreshed landscape. The varying shades of
							sunkissed greenery were most entrancing; across the billowy grassland the sweet notes
							of the <pb id="VAC1104-051" n="[]"/> red-winged blackbird charmed the ear, while far
							beyond the valley the dark woodland was relieved here and there by bright patches of
							red bud. Occasionally the bob white's soft call was wafted along on the dewy breath of
							morn and all nature seemed to rejoice.</p>
						<p>Slowly down the winding yellow road came a light-hearted farmer perched high on his
							rumbling wagon. His lines hung carelessly while his faithful team picked its way in a
							lazy fashion. The deep wrinkles in his long copper-colored neck were filled with clay
							and his brawny hands were gnarled and knotty after a hard season of toil. His left
							cheek was bulging with an overgenerous quid of "old Lincoln green," and a smile of
							perfect contentment scattered itself over his well weathered face as he amused himself
							by spatting with unerring aim at the nodding dandelions that peeped from the grass
							that fringed the roadway.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-052" n="[]"/>
						<p>As he approached a sharp turn known as Tharp's Corner and half concealed by the low
							hanging boughs of a great willow his team stopped with a suddenness that almost threw
							him from his seat. Recovering his equilibrium and looking ahead the prostrate form of
							a man lying face downward in the highway met his astonished gaze. Hurriedly jumping to
							the ground he made a hasty examination. A crimson stream had trickled from a wound on
							the stranger's head and wended its way in a wagon track for some distance down the
							hill, and the man was apparently dead. Returning to his wagon he unhitched the traces
							of his fleetest horse and galloped at high speed to the village of Z, where he told of
							his grewsome find.</p>
						<p>Soon the road leading to the scene of the awful discovery was black with humanity,
							while plows stood idle in the fields and homes and shops were deserted.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-053" n="[]"/>
						<p>Constable Plum was the first to reach the lifeless form, and with his heavy cane held
							the fast assembling peasants at bay till Dr. Mopps, the aged coroner, should
							arrive.</p>
						<p>After some hours the frail and bent doctor drew up in his gig. Alighting with much
							effort, the nonagenarian handed his high, primitive plug hat into the keeping of a
							morbid onlooker. Quietly rolling back his sleeves and displaying his thin, pale wrists
							he carefully tucked his long, white whiskers into the bosom of his tightly buttoned
							and glossy Prince Albert; then, adjusting his spectacles, he slowly kneeled over the
							dead body with all the nervous effort of a trained horse and fumbled about for the
							heart.</p>
						<p>Life was extinct, and the most careful search failed to reveal the slightest evidence
							whereby the dead stranger might be identified. Even the trademark on his rich and well
							made clothing had disappeared, as had also the laundry <pb id="VAC1104-054" n="[]"/>
							mark on his polka dot shirt; only a toothbrush was found, and as the prehistoric
							coroner held it triumphantly in his trembling hand high above his pink bald head he
							exclaimed in a weak, piping voice, <q rend="blockquote">"Evidently a man of
								culture."</q>
						</p>
						<p>That one so well dressed and groomed should be found dead and penniless left no doubt
							in the minds of the now infuriated villagers that a murder for gain had been
							committed, and loud cries for vengeance echoed and re-echoed through the wild
							hills.</p>
						<p>The fragile coroner arose and pleaded for cooler heads. After the hisses died away he
							mounted a stump and addressed the frenzied mob, saying: <q>"Neighbors and friends, the
								fact that this poor dead stranger is found well dressed and without money must not
								be interpreted to mean that he has been slain and robbed, as such a condition is not
								an unusual one. There <pb id="VAC1104-055" n="[]"/> can be no doubt that the gaping
								wound at the base of his skull readily argues that he walked away from death instead
								of into it. Yet there is no legal proof that he did either or both, or any reason to
								suppose that he might if he had."</q></p>
						<p>The venerable homeopath then gave it as his opinion that the stranger had suicided,
							and, taking up the large pearl-handled revolver of the latest pattern that had been
							found near the scene, he attempted to demonstrate <ref id="ref_002" rend="super"
								target="note_002">*</ref> to the now quieted multitude how easily one might shoot
							himself with his left hand from the rear. In doing so he blew off his right ear and
							killed a fat steer in a field hard by.</p>
						<p>This fresh sensation caused great tumult, and it was some time before the excitement
							died down and the crowd dispersed, much chagrined at the verdict.</p>
						<note id="note_002"><ref target="ref_002" rend="super">*</ref>Demonstrate. (French)
							demonstrer. To point out, to show.</note>



						<pb id="VAC1104-056" n="[]"/>
						<p>Constable Plum was the last one to leave the scene, and as he walked reluctantly from
							the blood-stained spot his eagle eye was attracted to a bright, shining object lying
							just beneath a clump of sassafras. Picking it up it proved to be a small silver fleur
							de lis of peculiar design that had undoubtedly ornamented a purse or pocket case. He
							carefully placed it in his wallet and proceeded on his way to the village.</p>
						<p>In due time the dead stranger was given a decent burial in the little churchyard, and
							the mystery of Tharp's Corner passed out of mind while the chipmunks burrowed in his
							silent mound.</p>

						<p rend="center i">Red Stone Hall</p>
						<p>Since early in the eighteenth century Red Stone Hall had been the home of the
							Ellsworths. The original estate had embraced many thousands of acres, but as it passed
							from one shiftless generation to another its fertile fields and grand old forest lands
							had been seized for debt until now the last remaining heir could only boast of the
							great, steep, barren knoll upon which reposed the ancient and venerable mass of stone
							and mortar that sheltered her and her feeble uncle.</p>
						<p>In the past the old turreted mansion had been the scene of riotous revelry, for the
							early Ellsworths were lavish entertainers, and their famous hospitality had attracted
							distinguished men and women from far and near to the romantic spot. The later heirs,
							too, were built much along the same lines, but their intentions were seriously
							crippled by a dwindling <pb id="VAC1104-058" n="[]"/> exchequer, and their efforts at
							sociability were sometimes pitiful to behold.</p>
						<p>Simon Ellsworth, the last male heir, inherited not only the combined shiftlessness of
							those who had passed before him, but also their passion for the cup and love for the
							chase. When not sitting by a sticky table in the tap room of the tavern or chasing a
							fox he was polishing ramrods or carving a powder horn. When flushed with ale he loved
							to gather his cronies about him and tell them over and over again the story of the
							French soldiers who had visited Red Stone Hall years before and begged to be permitted
							to bury a chest of rich treasure far beneath the cellar floor, how his grandfather had
							consented and how it had remained untouched ever afterward.</p>
						<p>Many wondered why he did not dig it up and get a hair cut and a suit of clothes, but
							Simon Ellsworth was a hotheaded man and no <pb id="VAC1104-059" n="[]"/> one had
							ventured to take the matter up with him. His wife, to whom he was tenderly attached,
							faded and died when their only child, <figure>
								<p rend="i">The Tale of the Hidden Treasure</p>
							</figure> a daughter, was but a babe, and Simon Ellsworth, whose great grief had
							destroyed his mind, wandered away to parts unknown.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-060" n="[]"/>
						<p>Marion Ellsworth was now a beautiful gazelle-eyed girl of eighteen who lived solely
							upon a small annuity settled upon her by the good aunt who had tenderly cared for her
							up to the time of her death some months before.</p>
						<p>Marion had inherited, along with the vine-covered bat's nest and the proud spirit of
							the Ellsworths, the sweet, confiding nature of her mother, and went about her daily
							tasks with a light heart and an arched expression. Her only suitor was Steve Warren, a
							husky young farmer. While his collar never seemed to come together right and his hair
							was cut with clippers, Marion looked upon him fondly, and the knowing ones pointed him
							out as the coming master of Red Stone Hall.</p>

						<p>There is a rich hectic flush on the woodland and every wind that blows pales the
							crimson hue or scatters its beauty on the empty air, for everywhere around us leaves
							are falling. In the orchard a few apples hang and the elders still nod under the

							feeling which we are seldom sensible of at the change of any other season of the year.
							Everything is decaying to produce the life and beauty of a coming spring.</p>
						<p>It is now almost six months since the mysterious murder near Tharp's Corner startled

						<p>Poor old Constable Plum is now but a wavering shadow of his former self. Ever since
							the bright spring morning when he walked slowly away from the blood-stained highway he
							has known no rest, and during the long, dreary interval he has made many fruitless
							pilgrimages to where nobody knows, returning each time with a few new lines of despair
							and several pounds lighter. His whole heart and soul are wrapped up in the solving of
							the crime. Visiting strangers are watched closely and often detained and carefully
							questioned. Indeed not a few embarrassments are the result of the unflagging
							zealousness of the tireless constable. As time goes on and the mystery deepens the
							aged sleuth rattles like a dried pod as he glides softly in and out of the alleys, and
							many and ludicrous are the disguises he assumes as he sits in the tavern office and
							eyes the guests as they arrive and depart, often changing his whiskers in their very
							presence with a deftness that defies detection.</p>

						<figure>
							<p rend="i">A Consummate Scamp</p>

						<p>As the old yellow bus, piled high with trunks and bags, rolled up and halted in front
								<pb id="VAC1104-064" n="[]"/> of the Valley House a solitary <ref id="ref_003"
								rend="super" target="note_003">*</ref> passenger alighted, and pushing his way
							through the crowd of curious villagers he entered the hostelry and approached the
							desk, where he hurriedly grasped a pen and dashed across the register with a firm but
							graceful hand the name, "Gerald Leigh, New York." After giving some instructions as to
							the disposal of his luggage he asked to be shown the best room the modest inn
							afforded, as he wished to retire after his long, tiresome journey.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh was the only son of erstwhile wealthy and aristocratic parents. He had
							been given all the advantages that money could command-educated in the schools and
							colleges of European capitals, and pampered and petted at home. His splendid
							educational attainments together with his handsome appearance and natural grace of
							manner well equipped him for a first-class lady killer. His <note id="note_003"><ref
									target="ref_003" rend="super">*</ref>Solitary. Just one.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-065" n="[]"/> father's sudden reverses, which were brought about by
							his own mad speculations, were a great shock to him and brought him face to face with
							a situation that at once called for some tall humping. Cursing his father roundly he
							left his mortgaged roof vowing that the world should pay for his predicament&mdash;and
							pay well&mdash;and he launched forth on a career of loot and crime.</p>
						<p>Never before had anyone appeared in the village that seemed so distinctly and
							thoroughly out of drawing with its environments as dashing Gerald Leigh. At first
							there was a flutter and then a general shrinking from his very presence. However, it
							was short lived, for this affable scoundrel by his masterly style of pitching soon won
							favor and fairly slipped into the confidence and good graces of all&mdash; high and
							low. Even Constable Newt Plum fell an easy victim under the charm of this <pb
								id="VAC1104-066" n="[]"/> genial, captivating villain, beneath whose glossy veneer
							there lurked a murderous heart.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh soon became a familiar figure as he rode about the village or along the
							country lanes on his spirited chestnut mare with all the ease and manner of a prince.
							He knew every crook and crevice of Red Stone Hall, of the rich treasure that lay
							hidden beneath the old ruin and of the valuable ore deposits that honeycombed the
							somber clay knoll from which it reared its crumbling chimney pots. He, too, had seen
							Marion Ellsworth, the proud rustic beauty and only heir to the tumbledown,

						<p>It was on a bright morning in October, just cool enough to be bracing and to bring
							the rose bloom to the cheek, that lovely Marion Ellsworth skipped with a light heart
							on her way to the stile to meet Steve Warren. Her lithe, girlish form, clad in pink
							chambray, swayed to and fro as she fairly danced through the tall, wet grass, stopping
							now and then to pluck some dainty flower that had escaped the blighting hand of the
							early frost. Her wealth of golden hair hung in a fluffy mass from her well-poised head
							and her red lips smiled as she approached the trysting place near the wild,
							long-neglected orchard.</p>
						<p>As she freed herself from a great tangle of wild grape vines that impeded her
							progress she stood face to face with Gerald Leigh. She drew back with a startled, half
							pleased <pb id="VAC1104-069" n="[]"/> look, and in another instant made bold to dash
							by him, when his strong arm held her a willing captive. "Ah, fairest flower, don't be
							startled," said he as he raised his English riding hat and displayed his perfect brow
							and raven hair. "I have quite lost my way to the village," he continued as he stooped
							to look into her downcast face.</p>
						<p>After releasing her well-rounded arm he followed Marion to a small eminence from
							which they could see the moss-covered roof of the town hall.</p>
						<p>"There, sir, is the village," she said falteringly as she tried to hide the crimson
							flush that had rushed to her face. Thanking her as he twirled his crop carelessly,
							Gerald Leigh replaced his hat and retraced his steps to his restless chestnut mount
							and was soon dashing down the hill to the road.</p>
						<p>Trembling with emotion as her pretty bosom rose and fell, poor Marion stood

							Marion Ellsworth somehow managed to reach the well-worn seat where her strong, florid

						<p>Partly on account of the beauty of the day and partly because he wished to meditate,

							Marion Ellsworth. While he loved the freedom of country life, the profession of
							agriculture <pb id="VAC1104-072" n="[]"/> had always been a huge joke with him. On

						<p>Stroking the glossy mane of his lively mare he laughed aloud as he said, "How could
							the great factories thrive if farmers allowed such trivial matters to interfere with
							their happy existence?"</p>
						<p>Then, scowling, his thoughts reverted to the simple beauty he had met in the weeds
							earlier in the day.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh had known many handsome women in his day and had survived many affairs
							of the heart. The one thing in connection <pb id="VAC1104-073" n="[]"/> with Marion
							Ellsworth, and the only thing that interested the oily rogue, was her inheritance.
							Aside from that he reasoned that she had nothing new to offer. He meant to win her
							confidence and wrest from her the riches that lay buried beneath the bleak, ungainly
							fortress that sheltered her&mdash;the fabulous fortune of which she knew nothing.</p>
						<p>Returning to his hotel Gerald Leigh quietly repaired to his chamber, where he stood
							for some moments by the window admiring the beauties of the quiet autumn evening.
							Beneath him were the well kept dooryards of the little cottages wherein thrifty
							housewives were singing as they prepared the simple evening meal, while their sturdy
							children romped on the village green.</p>
						<p>Wheeling suddenly about Gerald lit an Egyptian cigarette and then seated himself by
							the table<ref id="ref_006" rend="super" target="note_006">*</ref> and dashed off a
							cunning note to <note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">*</ref> Table.
								Relating to or resembling a table.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-074" n="[]"/> Marion Ellsworth, which he read over slowly to satisfy
							himself that it was up to his usual high standard, as he prided himself on his mastery
							of English and spirit of expression. "She'll be there," he hissed to himself as he
							arose to dress for his customary stroll about town. Selecting a brand new walking suit
							and a fresh pair of green gloves he soon emerged from the hotel and walked toward the
							postoffice dressed in the height of good taste and leaving a trail of vile-smelling
							cigarette smoke in his wake.</p>
						<p>Gifted with the unusual ability to adjust himself to any strata of society, Gerald
							Leigh had grown to be a wonderful favorite throughout the hamlet. With Constable Plum
							he was the thickest of chums, and they were often seen together discussing this and
							that phase of modern crime&mdash;its alarming growth and how it would eventually
							destroy our whole social fabric. Often, too, in following <pb id="VAC1104-075" n="[]"
							/> some new lead that gave promise to the unraveling of the mystery of Tharp's Corner,
							Gerald had tendered the constable the use of his high-spirited chestnut
							hunter&mdash;an offer, by the way, the foxy old sleuth always politely declined.</p>

						<p>It was one of the few remaining mornings of golden October and Marion Ellsworth sat
							upon an upturned milk pail <ref id="ref_007" rend="super" target="note_007">*</ref>
							beneath a red haw tree, from one of the lower branches of which a rusty scythe swung
							in the breezes and made her position at once perilous. She was drying her hair in the
							sun, and her purple kimona hung loosely from her shoulders, exposing her perfect neck.
							She had quarreled with <note id="note_007"><ref target="ref_007" rend="super">*</ref>
								Pail. An open vessel of wood or tin.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-076" n="[]"/> Steve Warren on the day previous and she was peevish and
							fretful. It had been her first break with the rugged young field hand and she half
							regretted her harsh words.</p>
						<p>Marion was quite another being since her meeting with the handsome, dark-eyed
							stranger, and her head was fairly filled with thoughts she hardly dared to own.
							Visions of a gay social life, fine clothes&mdash;a life of love and happiness
							&mdash;passed quickly before her as the rays of the autumnal sun danced on her great
							mass of soggy hair. She wondered who the gallant horseman was and if he might still be
							in the village.</p>
						<p>Rushing by her childish old uncle, who sat in the kitchen doorway plaiting a chain of
							fall asters, she was soon in her room. Arranging her fluffy hair in a becoming fashion
							she quickly jumped into her most fetching frock and was soon skipping across the
							fields to the village. Stopping at the postoffice she was <pb id="VAC1104-077" n="[]"
							/> handed Gerald's note. Her great eyes opened wide as she studied the beautiful
							handwriting on the envelope, and stuffing it securely in her corsage she exchanged a
							few simple pleasantries with the freckle-faced clerk and departed for home.</p>
						<p>Singing merrily along the unfrequented path she mused all the while over her
							mysterious letter, looking up now and then to see if anybody was approaching on
							horseback. Suddenly she stopped and drew back as if to avoid a vicious blow.</p>
						<p>"What if it could be from Steve!" she said to herself as a cloud fell across her
							countenance. "Maybe he got the hotel clerk to back it," she cried aloud as her eyes
							grew moist with tears. As she continued on her way she finally concluded that Steve
							Warren was not apt enough for such a trick, and she broke into a low, musical laugh as
							she stooped to pick up a fall mushroom.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-078" n="[]"/>
						<p>Once in her old-fashioned chamber with its high ceiling and massive carved woodwork
							she drew her favorite rocker to the latticed window and slowly withdrew the lavender
							scented note from her bodice and timidly broke the seal. In an instant a low, muffled
							shriek followed and poor Marion fell back limp and lifeless among the cushions of her
							antique chair. Presently her eyes opened and a faint smile played about her pale lips
							as she arose and half reeled to a little mirror framed with varnished pine cones,
							where she surveyed herself long and critically.</p>
						<p>"Am I indeed so beautiful?" she said aloud as she noted every line of her oval face,
							which had now quite recovered its usual radiant glow. Slowly turning about she threw
							herself on her high quilted couch and said, half sobbing and half laughing, "Yes, I
							will meet him."</p>
						<p>As this resolution died on her lips Marion <pb id="VAC1104-079" n="[]"/> Ellsworth
							sank into a peaceful slumber and dreamed of the dashing deceiver that had now entered
							her life.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="center">CHAPTER IX</head>
						<p rend="center i">Under the Sycamore</p>
						<p>It was dusk and the blue October haze was fast deepening into an inky darkness. The
							distant tinkle of a cow bell far across the wild marsh or the rustle of some feathered
							songster among the dry leaves on the boughs high above was all that marred the quiet
							stillness, while the great golden moon was just peeping from behind the left wing of
							Red Stone Hall.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh was taking his leisure as he rode through the shadows of the lonely road
							on his proud, high-headed steed. Holding his <pb id="VAC1104-080" n="[]"/> cigarette
							between his tapering gloved fingers he half smiled as the blue smoke rings arose from
							his hard mouth and scattered themselves on the evening air like long imprisoned birds
							set free. He had slackened his pace to give the moon a chance, for he well knew that
							his finely chiseled features appeared to best advantage in the soft white light of
							pale Luna. Indeed there were few effects that Gerald Leigh had not studied, for he was
							a born artist as well as a finished scoundrel.</p>
						<p>Marion Ellsworth at this moment was fretting and fuming before her mirror. With the
							last dash of violet talcum she sank into her chair for a breathing spell.</p>
						<p>How glowingly beautiful she looked in her simple gown as the color played about her
							perfect temples. As she arose her full lips wore a smile of disdain as she placed a
							cheap gold ring with a purple set, that Steve Warren had given her, upon her tall
							cherry bureau. Standing <pb id="VAC1104-081" n="[]"/> for a few moments as if seized
							by indecision she silently left her chamber and quietly closed the door and
							noiselessly stole out of the cold, gray mansion and through the orchard and across the
							field to the giant sycamore that stood by the entrance to the estate near the main
							road. Here in the gloomy shadows she patiently stood and listened until the iron-shod
							hoofs of a horse were heard on the hard, dry road leading over the brow of the hill
							but a short distance in the offing. <ref id="ref_008" rend="super" target="note_008"
								>*</ref>
						</p>
						<p>"It must be he," she falteringly said half aloud as she sidestepped an owl that
							swished by her.</p>
						<p>Presently Gerald Leigh dashed up and, with a deep breath of satisfaction, drew rein
							and dismounted. Rushing to Marion's side he threw his arms about her trembling form
							and said: <note id="note_008"><ref target="ref_008" rend="super">*</ref> Offing. Some
								distance away.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-082" n="[]"/>
							<q rend="blockquote">"My angel, how I have longed for this hour."</q></p>
						<p>Marion managed to squeeze out of the fervent embrace of the gallant home-wrecker, but
							not until she felt his hot cigarette breath on her neck.</p>
						<p>They strolled up and down a lonely shaded path until far into the night, Gerald
							talking tenderly all the while of the beauty of the autumn night, of love and the kind
							Providence that had thrown them together. Poor Marion, she was quite captivated by his
							rich, deep, mellow voice and gentleness, and eagerly drank in every word that Gerald
							uttered, occasionally venturing some trifling remark in her prettiest manner.</p>
						<p>It was a highly successful first meeting taken from any angle, and when Marion
							reached her room she was all in a pretty flutter. She sat down by her window and it
							was <pb id="VAC1104-083" n="[]"/> fast turning day when she was awakened by the
							clarion notes of the old family rooster.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh rode slowly back to the village. As he passed through the tangle of
							underbrush into the open the moon's rays lit up his romantic face and showed a smile
							of fiendish satisfaction.</p>
						<p>It was a great night's work for Gerald Leigh, great as had been others in his wild
							life. He had learned many new things about Red Stone Hall and, best of all, he had won
							the love and confidence of the girl that stood between him and the coveted prize.</p>
						<p>"The little fool," he hissed as he lit a fresh cigarette and gave rein to his
							charger.</p>

						<head rend="center">CHAPTER X</head>
						<p rend="center i">Laying the Lines</p>
						<p>It was a dismal, rainy November day&mdash;and a day, too, well suited to the dark,
							ugly thoughts that filled the mind of Gerald Leigh as he sat in his room clothed in a
							rich crimson bath robe smoking innumerable cigarettes. As the rain beat furiously
							against his window he arose and watched the drenched and downcast fowls as they
							skulked about the barn yard below and sought shelter beneath the narrow eaves of a low
							shed that stood therein. Gerald Leigh had been much in the society of Marion Ellsworth
							since their memorable meeting in the moonlight beneath the giant sycamore that guarded
							the entrance leading to Red Stone Hall, and so sure was he of the love of the simple,
							willowy heiress that his plans had long been made for a cruise of the Mediterranean, a
							trip he had always wished to take. <pb id="VAC1104-085" n="[]"/> His ingenuity was now
							taxed to its utmost with the details that had to do with his coming marriage to
							Marion, which they both had agreed should occur on Christmas eve.</p>
						<p>It was Gerald Leigh's one desire that this newest splotch <ref id="ref_009"
								rend="super" target="note_009">*</ref> on his long list of criminal offenses should
							be the boldest and blackest of all, and he was proceeding with great care.</p>
						<p>Many schemes to gain possession of Red Stone Hall without taking over its fair
							occupant in the bargain had evolved themselves, and, clever as they might appear to
							the eyes of a novice, the shrewd criminal alertness of Gerald Leigh had at once
							detected the bungling features whereby the finger of suspicion might easily point to
							himself and thereby lose to him the prize that was now so easily within his grasp.</p>
						<p>"It is an ideal day to plan a crime, old chap," said he, addressing himself to his
							cigarette, <note id="note_009"><ref target="ref_009" rend="super">*</ref> Splotch. Not
								given.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-086" n="[]"/> and he walked to a cut glass decanter and refreshed
							himself with a dash of rare old brandy. Pacing the room like a fellow waiting for a
							long distance call, his brain was soon aflame with the powerful liquor and he was
							becoming saturated with inspiration.</p>
						<p>"Ah, I have it," he said, bursting into a laugh that lasted some moments.</p>
						<p>"We will have her snatched at the altar," he continued, his face still purple from
							laughter. Then he cursed himself roundly for not thinking of so brilliant a scheme
							before and threw himself heavily into a chair. The various details of this new
							proposition now came one upon another in rapid succession. It would be easy enough to
							have Marion spirited away at the close of the marriage ceremony, and Steve Warren
							would be an excellent fellow to do it. Why not? Was he not the jilted lover of Marion
							and did he not harbor a feeling of resentment? Would it be difficult <pb
								id="VAC1104-087" n="[]"/> to have him appear in the village on the day of the
							wedding and later have him waylaid and done away with? Certainly not.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh now set about to arrange for the return of Steve Warren. A dragnet
							covering the universe should be thrown out, and accordingly he at once commenced to
							get into communication with the trusty confederates of former days who were now
							scattered among the many great cities of the world. Indeed it was an undertaking that
							would easily appall Scotland Yard, but Gerald Leigh was a fellow who stopped at
							nothing to gain his ends. "It will be a fine story to flash over the wires and stagger
							humanity on Christmas day," said he as he refilled his cigarette case.</p>

						<p rend="center i">Nearing the Abyss</p>
						<p>The morning broke bright and clear. The first snow had fallen during the night and
							the landscape wore a mantle of purest white. The black, crooked pathways of the
							streams were clearly marked through the hills and bottom lands, and around the snow
							capped stacks the shivering cattle huddled.</p>
						<p>It was a typical country winter scene in the tranquil valley far removed from the din
							of the city streets&mdash;from the cares of money and the cark of fashion.</p>
						<p>It was the first real taste of winter, and Gerald Leigh and Marion Ellsworth were
							speeding along the village streets behind a 'ively roadster, the envy of every
							onlooker. Their merry laughter harmonized perfectly with the musical jingle of the
							silver sleigh bells that completely encircle the lathered girth of their proud and
							high-headed mare. </p>

						<pb id="VAC1104-089" n="[]"/>
						<p>They drove far into the country and feasted their eyes on the beauties of nature and
							talked of their plans for the future. The chill air, supplemented<ref id="ref_010"
								rend="super" target="note_010">*</ref> by the joy and thrill of being with her
							lover, made Marion appear more beautiful than ever to the demon who rode beside
							her.</p>
						<p>Their wedding arrangements were all but completed. It was Gerald's desire that the
							affair be entirely private, for he considered it a serious step in both their lives
							and one not to be accompanied by any pomp or splendor, but rather to be conducted
							quietly and with a full mutual understanding of its sacredness. An extended journey
							through Jamaica was to follow the ceremony. After their return to America they would
							live in some great city where Gerald's interests would demand him and where Marion's
							life would be one of love <note id="note_010"><ref target="ref_010" rend="super"
									>*</ref> Supplemented. (Italian) supplemento. Added to.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-090" n="[]"/> and happiness surrounded by every conceivable
							luxury.</p>
						<p>No wonder great frozen tears stood upon her round, red cheeks and glistened like
							pearls in the bright winter sun. She was crying for joy as they whizzed over the
							smooth, snowy surface.</p>
						<p>Marion's feeble old uncle, who had watched tenderly over her through childhood when
							he had had health and strength, was to be kindly cared for during his few remaining
							years in some soldier's home where nothing would be too good for him. So they drove
							along and laughed and talked, occasionally stopping to admire some particularly pretty
							prank of nature.</p>
						<p>Returning to the village as darkness gathered they dined together at the hotel, and
							as they pushed their way through the crowd of admiring loungers and into the little
							dining room the landlord shook his head and remarked <pb id="VAC1104-091" n="[]"/>
							that it would be a devilish hard matter to find a handsomer pair in all the world.</p>
						<p>Later Gerald and Marion parted at the sleigh under the shadow of Red Stone Hall, and
							the happy bride-to-be skipped into the majestic old ruin and started to wash the
							breakfast dishes long before the tinkling bells of her departed lover died on the

							The little shops of the hamlet wear a gay holiday attire, and behind their frosted

							impossible hues and other Christmas wares are piled high.</p>
						<p>As evening approaches the cheery forge of the smithy is seen through the open door
							and <pb id="VAC1104-092" n="[]"/> merry children are sliding&mdash;as they break the

						<p>As he approached the great battered door of Red Stone Hall and grasped the clumsy
							iron knocker, which was covered with hoary rime, it seemed to cut his fingers like a
							knife and he cursed profusely till the creaking door swung open and covered him with a
							flood of light, when his wicked face softened in the presence of the girl who loved
							him madly.</p>
						<p>As he slunked down the long hall to the drawing room he fairly cowed beneath the

							frames. "Curse them, they seem to read my innermost thoughts," he said, as he sunk
							heavily into a broad cushioned chair near the cozy hearth fire like some hunted
							criminal who had at last, after a long, exciting chase, found a haven of safety.</p>
						<p>Finally regaining his old composure Gerald Leigh watched the lithe, yielding figure

								<p rend="i">One of the Early EllsWorths</p>

						<figure>
							<p rend="i">"And Will you always love me, Gerald.?"</p>

						<p>The perplexing situation now seemed solved and he laughingly arose and softly

						<p>The season of winter gayety was now at its height. Croquet, picnicking and other
							lively sports of summer and autumn were now replaced by such entertaining pastimes as
							taffy pulling, who's got the button, and charades.</p>
						<p>At all the merry social gatherings Gerald Leigh and Marion Ellsworth were the central
							figures&mdash;sweet-faced Marion enjoying them hugely, while her black-hearted fiance
							worried through gracefully, appearing at all times the handsome and gallant lover of
							the belle of the <pb id="VAC1104-097" n="[]"/> whole countryside and easily adjusting
							himself to the rude, simple folk that hung about and bored the life out of him.</p>
						<p>The wedding was now just in the offing and the days were speeding swiftly. Marion's
							dressmakers were working 'way into the night that no last moment hitch might cause any
							vexatious delay. Gerald Leigh, too, was busy not only into the nights but all through
							the dark, tedious days. Steve Warren had at last been located in Honolulu and a swift
							mail steamer had been chartered and was plowing her way through the treacherous blue
							waters of the peaceful Pacific bearing him home at an incredible speed. Things were
							turning fine for Gerald Leigh, and the daily advices from his horde of unscrupulous
							confederates kept him in a constant state of good cheer, a fact that was generally
							remarked about his lodgings. Around this hostelry he was looked upon as a gentleman of
							rare ability&mdash;not only <pb id="VAC1104-098" n="[]"/> a skilled checker player but
							a wizard at pool as well.</p>
						<p>Marion had deeded Red Stone Hall and the yellow knoll upon which it stood to Gerald,
							and she could scarcely wait till the time should come when she could deliver it, along
							with her life and happiness, into the hands of the man her love for whom was fast
							consuming her.</p>
						<p>She often stopped while engaged in her simple duties about the household to laugh at
							her old silly fondness for Steve Warren&mdash;how she had trailed through the long
							grass, wet with dew, to talk and blush before the rough country bumpkin as he leaned
							upon his plow, <ref id="ref_012" rend="super" target="note_012">*</ref> of odor of
							pigs and gummy harness that at all times hung about him&mdash;in parlor or furrow
							alike.</p>
						<p>From her chamber window Marion could see on the crest of upland where the orchards
								<note id="note_012"><ref target="ref_012" rend="super">*</ref> Plow. A field
								implement.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-099" n="[]"/> thrive above the oaks, in shelving distance, the little
							cottage Steve Warren had built for her and him. But never once in all the many times
							she had looked at it had she known one single pang of regret.</p>
						<p>Poor Marion, she was not only drunk with happiness&mdash;she was soused!</p>

						<head rend="center">CHAPTER XIV</head>
						<p rend="center i">A Cloud Appears</p>
						<p>It was a biting cold Sabbath morning and the snow covered housetops glistened in the
							deceitful December sun.</p>
						<p>A straggling, motley pageant of God-fearing peasants filed slowly up the steep, icy
							pathway to the little church on the hill that huddled snugly among the low, white
							mounds and evergreens, now drooping under their burden of snow. The wild, hesitating
							peals from the <pb id="VAC1104-100" n="[]"/> belfry tower seemed to penetrate the
							remotest corners of the earth so sharp and distinct did they reverberate across the
							bleak lowlands in the cold, clear atmosphere.</p>
						<p>On this particular Sunday morning Gerald Leigh had been asked to fill the pulpit.
							After the rosy-cheeked choir was seated and the last soft, soothing notes of the organ
							had died away he arose pale and handsome. He talked of the joy of living and the
							comfort and sweetness of religion&mdash;of the promised reunions in the great beyond
							with loved ones who had been called before. Indeed it was a masterful sermon,
							beautiful to listen to and wonderfully delivered&mdash;a sermon that caused much
							sniffling and sobbing among the folk that sat thrilled before this eloquent
							deceiver.</p>
						<p>At the close of the services Gerald Leigh started the contributions with a crisp
							raised bill and then joined Marion in the vestibule. How proud she was when the
							congregation <pb id="VAC1104-101" n="[]"/> gathered about them and told Gerald how
							helpful and impressive his words had been and how he had missed his calling.</p>
						<p>On their way home Gerald was solemn and uncommunicative. He was worrying and studying
							over that part of his desperate game that had to do with Steve Warren's return&mdash;
							how he was to be kept in ignorance of Marion's marriage&mdash;how he should be decoyed
							to the old mill and there murdered. How these details were to be managed might well
							cause him uneasiness since they were to be most important factors in the final chapter
							of his nefarious plot.</p>
						<p>Poor, foolish Marion! she attributed his moodiness to the holiness of the day. Oh,
							love! how sightless.</p>
						<p>After Gerald had left Marion at the threshold of Red Stone Hall she soon found
							herself with the whole short December afternoon on her hands and retired to her
							chamber to rummage <pb id="VAC1104-102" n="[]"/> among the sacred belongings of her
							dead mother which had for many years remained undisturbed in an old chest.</p>
						<p>Gently Marion raised the cumbersome lid and there, carefully folded, lay her mother's
							grosgrain wedding dress just as she had fondly placed it away years before. Under it
							she found a little box covered with flowered paper and tied with a faded silk ribbon.
							As she reverently opened it the odor of dried roses filled the room. It contained her
							mother's hoop earrings and two daguerreotype portraits &mdash;one of her father taken
							in young manhood with his face reclining in his left hand, on the second finger of
							which was a massive ring which the artist had cunningly touched up with bright gold
							foil; her mother's portrait, too, had been taken in her young days and was encased in
							a heavy brooch, on the back of which was clumsily soldered a thick brass pin. Marion's
							eyes filled with tears as she studied <pb id="VAC1104-103" n="[]"/> the sweet, gentle
							countenance, which so closely resembled her own, and she thought of her mother's
							lonely, unhappy life.</p>
						<p>These treasures Marion wished to take with her, and as she arose a feeling of
							distrust crept over her. She endeavored to cheer herself by recalling Gerald's many
							thoughtful little attentions and expressions of tenderest love&mdash;things that had
							made her engagement days so happy, but try as she might she could not dispel the
							gloomy forebodings that had now quite taken possession of her, and she sobbed herself
							to sleep.</p>
						<p>Slowly the shadows lengthened; the light waned; the glare of the snowy hills was
							softened and the outlines of Steve Warren's empty cottage in the far distance grew
							dim.</p>
						<p>The clouds were gathering.</p>

							in the gale like a huge silken banner unfurled to the breezes.</p>
						<p>He had long passed the three score and ten mark, and his tireless efforts to solve
							the mystery of Tharp's Corner had been more than his aged frame could stand. His
							emaciated condition caused much concern among his kindly neighbors, and the tradesmen,
							too, were excited lest his overzealousness should seriously cripple the business
							interests of the community, since now the indefatigable old constable <pb

						<p>The constable's face was now sunken and wrinkled and looked not unlike a dried
							quince, but the steel-eyed sleuth kept his own counsel <pb id="VAC1104-106" n="[]"/>
							and guarded the silver clew that reposed at all times in his leather wallet like a
							miser, confident all the while that the metal trifle would one day solve the crime
							that had besmirched the county's fair name.</p>
						<p>It was now the twenty-third day of December and Gerald Leigh's plans so far had
							worked out to the letter. Steve Warren was being held in a neighboring town under some
							pretense while a modern airship lay anchored behind the hills in readiness for the
							morrow.</p>
						<p>Cheery and loving as Gerald had been when he called on Marion earlier in the day his
							manner had quite failed to drive forth the dark, ominous thoughts that had filled her
							mind since their last meeting. It was with a heavy heart that she now looked after the
							final preparations for her marriage, and she wept bitterly when she realized that she
							was to leave dear old Red Stone Hall with all its associations behind her forever.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-107" n="[]"/>
						<p>Gerald Leigh was pacing about his apartments smoking a final cigarette before
							retiring after a busy and most satisfactory day. As he stood by his window looking at
							the bright, full winter moon he smiled and said, addressing the great yellow orb: "Ah,
							old fellow, when you rise on Christmas eve I shall be the richest chap in all
							Christendom." And then he laughed heartily.</p>

						<p rend="center i">The Abduction</p>
						<p>The morning of December twenty-fourth broke calm and clear, and Gerald Leigh was
							quick to note the ideal conditions for air sailing. He had ridden far into the country
							for a last secret conference with his hirelings and now returned in splendid spirits
							and was on <pb id="VAC1104-108" n="[]"/> his way to assure Marion that every detail
							looking to her uncle's departure and comfort had been looked after. He found her sad
							and depressed, but his ardent and fervid avowals of tenderest love quite revived her.
							When he left to return to his lodgings her old happy spirit and courage had returned,
							and he chuckled as he thought of his magnetism.</p>
						<p>The hours had fairly whizzed by and Gerald Leigh was once more ascending the roadway
							to gloomy Red Stone Hall for what he hoped would be his farewell meeting with Marion
							Ellsworth. Beside him in the rickety hotel omnibus sat Rev. Wiley Tanger, the grave,
							stiff minister who was to officiate at his wedding. His prominent, smoothly shaven
							chin was held aloft by a high celluloid collar and came dangerously near hitting him
							in the back at times as they jolted along. The sea bean buttons on his cuffs, which
							were of the same inflammable material as his collar, rattled like <pb id="VAC1104-109"
								n="[]"/> hail with every motion of the old-fashioned vehicle as it rolled over the
							rough, icy surface. The strong, foul odor of Gerald's imported cigarette quite stifled
							the ashen faced preacher, and as they alighted in the dooryard of the ancient and
							venerable mass of stone and mortar he sniffed the fresh, bracing air like a skittish
							colt.</p>
						<p>They were ushered into the drawing room by a prim neighbor woman who had kindly
							assisted Marion through the worry and excitement of the last few hours and who was to
							be the only witness to the ceremony.</p>
						<p>Marion looked bewitching in her beautiful gown of white tulle as she embraced Gerald
							and led him into the hall, where she placed into his hands a deed for all she
							possessed in the world. Returning to the drawing room they stood beside the frail
							colonial center table, which was wobbling beneath a mass of fragrant roses, while the
							good minister pronounced <pb id="VAC1104-110" n="[]"/> the words that were to unite
							them forever. As the last syllable died away on his thin lips a cloaked figure
							appeared in the dimly lighted room and, like a flash from the heavens, gathered the
							radiant bride in its arms and vanished before the astonished groom and those about
							him.</p>
						<p>Long before any one could realize what had happened a pitiful shriek was heard which
							seemed to come from high above the Austrian pines that clustered near the shuttered
							window.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh played his part perfectly. Reeling across the room as one terror
							stricken he frantically called for an alarm to be sounded and fell exhausted before
							the dying embers* of the hearth fire.</p>
						<p>The news of the sensational abduction spread rapidly, and soon posses of determined
							men were scattering in every direction eager *Embers. Coals of fire. <pb
								id="VAC1104-111" n="[]"/> to lay hands on the villain who had borne the fair bride
							away just at the happiest moment of her blameless life.</p>
						<p>Gerald Leigh, crushed and broken, was carefully moved to his hotel, where his legion
							of friends called and proffered every assistance. During the early hours of morning a
							low whistle called him to his window. It was one of his confederates bearing the news
							that Steve Warren had escaped, a bit of information that nettled him greatly.</p>
						<p>He remained in his room apparently grief stricken for several days and directed the
							officers who had charge of the searching parties.</p>
						<p>The fact that Steve Warren was at liberty worried Gerald Leigh more and more as the
							hours flew by, and he determined to connect him with Marion's abduction in a new and
							more desperate way. Accordingly during his next conference with the officers he
							related to them that Warren had been seen in the village <ref id="ref_013"
								rend="super" target="note_013">*</ref>
							<pb id="VAC1104-112" n="[]"/> on the day of the wedding, that he was a jilted lover of
							Marion and that it was not impossible that he knew more than he would be willing to
							tell. The whole story seemed so plausible that the sheriff at once started on this new
							clew with a light heart and a fresh box of cartridges.</p>

						<p>After darting through the portals of Red Stone Hall and clearing the decaying
							balustrade with a single bound the mysterious ab of Marion Ellsworth quickly sped
							across the fields with his swooning burden to the airship which he had but a few
							moments before secreted behind a tall locust hedge.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1104-113" n="[]"/>
						<p>It required but a second to strap Marion's limp and apparently lifeless form to the
							frail seat and start the flapping wings of the aerial monster and guide it on its long
							journey through the clouds. Gracefully the huge craft soared heavenward like a winged
							specter, and the whirr of the shuttle was soon lost among the stars.</p>
						<p>Poor Marion, unconscious from fright, was a willing captive as the great machine
							whizzed through the chilling currents at an amazing speed over lighted villages and
							cities, across abyss and wooded hill&mdash;moving majestically on while the moon's
							rays played on the rippling rivers and streams, or turned the bosoms of countless
							lakes into flaming sheets of hammered gold. Like some beautiful phantom the pale bride
							in her snowy gown reclined motionlessly among the rigging as they flew.</p>
						<p>Many, many miles must they have traveled ere consciousness returned to Marion. As <pb
								id="VAC1104-114" n="[]"/> her eyes slowly opened she was looking into the rough,
							ugly features of the brute beside her. Sitting erect she looked about her and, at once
							realizing her predicament, she summoned all her strength and made a frantic effort to
							free herself, only to be repulsed by the powerful beast at the wheel.</p>
						<p>Her utter helplessness now dawned upon her and, terror stricken, she wondered what
							awful fate awaited her and where Gerald could be. Presently she rallied and seemed to
							be possessed of superhuman strength as she made a final struggle to break the stout
							cords which held her. In this desperate contest for supremacy her fastenings snapped,
							and in her heroic fight for the control of the steering gear she, lost her balance and
							was dashed to the earth miles below.</p>

						<p rend="center i">The Third Degree</p>
						<p>It is the first day of January and soon the lengthening daylight will fall upon the
							dim patches of green and show where gentle spring lies sleeping.</p>
						<p>It is too early for the hardy crocus to throw its banded gold across the pathway, but
							the bluebird, spring's first harbinger, calls to the "rathe primrose" from the naked
							hawthorn spray to open its yellow eyes as it sits huddled up in its cloak of green.
							The trees covered with hoarfrost are beautiful to look upon, and the wild grass
							bending beneath its weight seems laden with crystals.</p>
						<p>It was an easy matter to locate Steve Warren, and his arrest and subsequent sweatings
							were carried out under the personal supervision of Gerald Leigh. He was thrown into
							the rude jail in utter ignorance of the suspicion <pb id="VAC1104-116" n="[]"/> that
							rested upon him, and there he remained for several days without food or water. When
							sufficiently weak from thirst and hunger Gerald Leigh entered his cell, accompanied by
							the sheriff, and dealt him a thunderous blow with his gloved hand which felled the
							helpless victim to the stone floor where he lay in a heap.</p>
						<p>"What have you done with your old sweetheart, you miserable cur?" asked Gerald Leigh,
							sneeringly.</p>
						<p>Warren staggered to his feet and asked for mercy, only to be felled again, this time
							by the famous trip-hammer<ref id="ref_014" rend="super" target="note_014">*</ref>
							jolt. As he lay on the floor he tremblingly disclaimed all knowledge of anything
							whatsoever. It was the sheriff's turn this time and he kicked him in the side.</p>
						<p>"We will leave him alone for a few days <note id="note_014"><ref target="ref_014"
									rend="super">*</ref> Trip-hammer. A powerful tilt-hammer operated by steam.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-117" n="[]"/> longer till he can refresh his hateful memory," hissed
							Gerald Leigh, and he scornfully spat at the seemingly lifeless form and passed out of
							the cell followed by the sheriff, who threw a musty soda cracker near the prostrate
							victim as the iron door clanked behind them.</p>
						<p>Thoroughly satisfied that Steve Warren would wilt eventually, they set about to
							invent some new torture. It was decided that the jail should be turned about so the
							prisoner could have a full and unobstructed view of Red Stone Hall on the hill high
							above.</p>
						<p>"That should soften him if he has a fiber of sentiment," said Gerald Leigh as he
							laughed in his sleeve at the uncouth, bewhiskered sheriff, whose small, close set eyes
							sparkled like raindrops at this newest scheme.</p>
						<p>It was agreed, too, that the sheriff should prepare a tray full of tempting victuals
							and place it near the prisoner's grated window and allow the appetizing fumes to enter
							therein.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1104-118" n="[]"/>
						<p>It was fully five hours before another effort was made to wrest a confession from the
							now crazed and guiltless farm hand. This time the sheriff entered the stuffy cell with
							a lighted candle and Constable Plum, the tottering old scout, approached Warren and
							held a pair of dainty white slippers, which had been found near Red Stone Hall soon
							after the abduction, before his bruised face and said:</p>
						<p>"See here, Steve Warren, blame your ornery hide, I've knowed ye ever since a lad, an'
							now you 'fess up," emphasizing the last word by striking the innocent prisoner across
							the face with his heavy hickory cane, which even in the hands of a toddling infant
							would have been a dangerous weapon.</p>
						<p>Poor Steve sank to the floor for the fifth or sixth time within twenty-four hours,
							and the officers left the cell much discouraged over their poor success. Finally it
							was agreed that <pb id="VAC1104-119" n="[]"/> the prisoner should be fattened up and
							allowed to take his chances with the grand jury.</p>
						<p>* * * * * * *</p>
						<p>In due time Steve Warren was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced to be hanged.
							As the brave, young, innocent farmer walked with head erect from the ill ventilated
							court room Gerald Leigh leaned back in his seat near the judge and smiled.</p>

						<p rend="center i">Unmasked</p>
						<p>February has been likened to a sturdy country lass who, with the tinge of the hard,
							red winter apple on her healthy cheek, strives against the wind and draws her russet
							colored cloak about her while, with bent head, she keeps throwing back the long hair
							that blows about her face.</p>



						<pb id="VAC1104-120" n="[]"/>
						<p>In and about Gerald Leigh's tavern all was astir as the busy landlord and his good,
							plump wife added the finishing touches to the sumptuous feast that their scoundrelly
							guest had ordered for himself and friends in honor of Steve Warren's execution, which
							was set for the following day.</p>
						<p>At one end of the long dining room a stage had been erected whereupon the gaily
							uniformed silver cornet band sat. Just back of this elevation there hung from the
							wall, imbedded in bright bunting, a portrait of the fat, bald judge who had presided
							at Warren's trial. It was indeed a queer assemblage that filled every chair about the
							tables while the savory mist from the hot, toothsome viands floated gracefully to the
							ceiling and mingled in friendly rivalry with the discordant notes of the battered
							brass instruments.</p>
						<p>After the last blatant note of "Marching Through Georgia" the round, purple circuit
								<pb id="VAC1104-121" n="[]"/> judge delivered a stinging address on the majesty of
							the law and then all eyes were turned toward Gerald Leigh as he arose with a smiling
							face. The smile, however, was short lived. As he faced the gaily festooned <ref
								id="ref_015" rend="super" target="note_015">*</ref> entrance his whole countenance
							changed and his face wore an ashen hue as he gasped and fell backward to the floor.
							The loquacious throng now sat in open mouthed amazement as the lost heiress of Red
							Stone Hall, frail and haggard, but still retaining many traces of her former unusual
							beauty, passed through the dining room's flag bedecked entrance and pointed the finger
							of scorn at the inflamed face of Gerald Leigh, which now was altered past all belief
							by anger and tortured vanity. As he stood with clenched fists and eyed her wildly
							Marion related her awful adventure in a low, calm voice to the crowd that had gathered
							about her and accused Gerald Leigh as <note id="note_015"><ref target="ref_015"
									rend="super">*</ref> Festooned. Furnished with festoons.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1104-122" n="[]"/> being the sole instigator of her frightful

							<pb id="VAC1104-123" n="[]"/> he edged his way toward the door only to be more closely

						<p> With the strength of a maniac he frantically pushed them aside and rushed to the
							door, where he turned and hissed: <q rend="blockquote">"My curses on you all!"</q></p>
						<p>As he wheeled about he fell into the strong arms of the sheriff, and in the struggle
							that followed his cigarette case fell at the feet of Constable Plum.</p>
						<p>There was just one little bit of silver ornamentation missing on this case, otherwise
							both sides of it would have been identical&mdash;and it reclined at this moment in the
							leather wallet of Constable Plum.</p>

						<p>The proud, dashing, affable Gerald Leigh was soon in the toils, and a peep into his
							trunks and bags brought to light many evidences of his double life and served to clear
							up a long chain of mysteries reaching almost across the continent, not the least among
							which was the murder of Langdon Ellsworth, the father of Marion, who had disappeared
							during her babyhood and who was returning from the West after years of prospecting
							with his golden harvest, and who, at a neighboring sanitarium where he had stopped,
							had related the fabled tale of the riches of Red Stone Hall to Gerald Leigh.</p>
