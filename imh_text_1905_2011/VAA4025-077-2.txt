            The two decades following the War of 1812 were not happy years for the Indians of the Old Northwest.
                    With the collapse of Tecumseh's confederation after the American victory in the war, all
                    armed resistance to the white settlers who flooded into the region was gone. Not only did the new
                    pioneers settle on lands formerly claimed by the tribesmen, they also depleted the diminishing game
                    population, depriving the Indians of a major source of subsistence. Attempting to ameliorate
                    conditions, the government urged the Indians to settle on small farms and adopt an agricultural life
                    similar to that of the settlers, but few of the Indians seemed interested and most continued to
                    wander throughout their old homeland, barely able to feed their families.
            During the 1820s federal officials abandoned their efforts to transform the Indians into small yeoman
                    farmers in favor of removal of the tribesmen to "unoccupied" areas west of the 
                        Mississippi
                    . As white settlers continued to pour into 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                    , state and local spokesmen clamored for the removal of the Indians, and the federal
                    government attempted to purchase the remaining Indian lands in these states, hoping to force the
                    tribesmen west. By the mid-1830s Indian affairs in northern Indiana were entangled in such a
                    bureaucratic and economic morass that some Indian agents despaired of ever removing the Potawatomis
                    from the area.1

            In Indiana, much of the problem resulted from the government's lack of foresight in
                    negotiating for Potawatomi lands. In the late 1820s and early 1830s federal officials had purchased
                    large sections of northern Indiana from Potawatomi leaders,2 but, because the
                    Indians had been reluctant to sell, the purchasing agents had allowed two dozen village chiefs to
                    retain fifteen small reservations of from one to thirty-six sections surrounding their villages. The
                    government envisioned these small reservations as temporary devices, designed to placate the village
                    chiefs and to insure their compliance with the transfer of large tracts of Potawatomi lands to the 
                        United States
                    . Federal officials also believed that only the few tribesmen living in each
                    chief's village would occupy these "village reservations" and that the
                    reservations could later be purchased inexpensively. They were mistaken. The officials assumed that
                    all Potawatomis living within the recently purchased areas, but not members of the small reservation
                    villages, would be forced to move since these Indians no longer held lands in Indiana. To their
                    dismay many of the tribesmen opposed to removal simply moved onto the village reservations.
            Disgruntled, Secretary of War Lewis Cass in 1834 instructed Indian agents to purchase the village
                    reservations but warned them that President Andrew Jackson wanted the tracts bought as cheaply as
                        possible.3 During the next two years Indian agents William Marshall and Abel
                    C. Pepper met with the village chiefs and used all their influence to induce the leaders to sell.
                    They achieved mixed results. In December, 1834, Marshall acquired four small village reservations in
                    north-central Indiana, proudly reporting back to Cass that he had purchased the lands for about
                    fifty cents per acre, or about one-fourth their actual value on the open market. Pepper also

                     met with Potawatomi leaders and by late summer, 1836, had
                    bought six small reservations scattered along the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     and Yellow rivers. Although Pepper was forced to pay about one dollar per acre, the
                    lands were worth at least twice that amount.4 Pepper was less successful in
                    persuading other village chiefs to sell. Several Potawatomi leaders, including Ashkum, Checawkose,
                    Weesionas, and Kinkash, had been awarded small reservations through treaties signed in 1832, and
                    they stubbornly refused all of Pepper's offers. Although the Indian agent offered them the
                    market value of their land, these chiefs were determined to retain the reservations.
            Angered by their recalcitrance, Pepper turned to other Indians. In September, 1836, the agent met
                    with tribesmen whom he described as "the chiefs, warriors, and head men of the Pata
                    Avattamies of the 
                        Wabash
                    ." This second group of Indians was heavily in debt to George W. and William G.
                    Ewing, brothers who headed a trading company in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . The Ewings used their influence in Pepper's behalf, and during mid-September
                    the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs sold the remaining small village reservations to the 
                        United States
                     government. The 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs had no legal right to sell the lands, since the 1832 treaties specifically had
                    awarded the reservations to Ashkum and the other village chiefs. But Pepper rationalized that the
                    more cooperative Indians were "paramount chiefs" and therefore had the power to
                    sell any Potawatomi lands in Indiana.5
            
            The chiefs' indebtedness to the Ewings reflected the economic deterioration of their tribe.
                    By the mid-1830s the small village reservations were being surrounded by white settlement, and the
                    three thousand Potawatomis remaining in Indiana were hard pressed to support themselves. They still
                    hunted, trapped, and planted small fields of corn, but such traditional economic ventures no longer
                    provided an adequate

                     income. Although the Potawatomis received a yearly annuity from
                    the past sale of tribal lands, the funds were insufficient to sustain them, and most of the money
                    was spent long before the year ended. To provide for their families, Indian men purchased food and
                    other necessities on credit, promising to pay frontier merchants from future annuity payments or
                    land sales. Every autumn, when the tribe received its annuity, the traders presented Indian agents
                    with vouchers for the tribal debts and the agents paid the bills, distributing the remainder of the
                    money to the Indians. Such practices had originated in the late 1820s, but by 1835 the 
                        Wabash
                     Potawatomis had so extended their credit that their annuities no longer paid for their
                    accumulated debts. Frustrated, local traders vied with one another over whose bill should be paid.
                    Other merchants presented greatly exaggerated vouchers, hoping to receive partial payment or to
                    capitalize on the confusion. Bewildered by the turmoil, government officials in 1835 announced that
                    they no longer would pay tribal debts from the annuity payments. Pepper attempted to negotiate
                    between the tribesmen and their creditors, but many of the traders remained dissatisfied.6
            
            To appease the traders Pepper persuaded those chiefs selling the village reservations during the
                    summer and fall of 1836 to pay outstanding debts from the proceeds of the sales. The Potawatomi
                    leaders agreed that they would accept payment for their lands in late September, when they received
                    their usual annuity payment, and that they would appoint commissioners to examine past debts and to
                    pay those that were valid. Therefore, during September, 1836, frontier entrepreneurs flocked to the
                    Potawatomi "payment ground" on the Tippecanoe River. Some of
                    the traders brought valid vouchers for goods actually sold. Others, less honest, envisioned the
                    payments as a rare opportunity to turn a fast dollar. Some carried claims for merchandise the value
                    of which was much inflated. Others held forged receipts for goods never delivered.7
            
            The many traders wrangling over whose claims should be paid were not the only belligerents present at
                    the payment grounds. Ashkum, Checawkose, and those village chiefs whose reservations had been
                    illegally sold by other Potawatomis also were in attendance. Incensed over the sale of their
                    villages,

                     these tribesmen intended to protest the transaction. If their
                    protest failed, they hoped to at least claim the lion's share of the proceeds from the land
                    sales. They also planned to seek revenge against those Indians who had sold their lands. Led by
                    Ashkum, the embittered village chiefs denounced those Potawatomis who had signed the recent
                    treaties, calling them nothing more than "boys and hog-thieves." In addition, they
                    threatened to kill 
                        Iowa
                    , Pashpoho, and Kewaunee, leaders of the faction that had cooperated with Pepper.8
            
            Ashkum's protest was encouraged by a group of traders operating along the St.
                        Joseph River in northern Indiana and southern 
                        Michigan
                    . Led by Alexis Coquillard, a merchant from the 
                        South Bend
                     region, these businessmen traded extensively with Potawatomis from the protesting
                    chiefs' villages. Although Coquillard attempted to curry the favor of Ashkum and his
                    followers by verbally supporting the chiefs claim that the reservations had been illegally
                    purchased, he actually was more interested in receiving payment for goods he had sold to the
                    Indians. Since the government had ignored the village chiefs in the purchase of the reservations,
                    Coquillard and his friends feared that federal officials also might refuse to recognize the debts
                    incurred by these tribesmen.9
            
            Coquillard was particularly apprehensive over the manner in which the claims against the Potawatomis
                    were to be adjudicated. In return for their cooperation Pepper allowed 
                        Iowa
                    , Pashpoho, and the other

                     chiefs to select the commissioners who would judge the validity of all claims against
                    the tribe. Since the Ewing brothers had assisted the agent in concluding the recent treaties, Pepper
                    did not protest when 
                        Iowa
                     and his friends appointed George Ewing and Cyrus Taber, a friend of the Ewings, to
                    serve as claims commissioners. A bitter rival of the Ewings, Coquillard complained loudly about the
                        appointments.10
            
            Pepper had scheduled the payments to begin on Sunday, September 25, 1836. When he arrived at the
                    payment ground, he found the clearing crowded with people.

                     with the government. Opposing the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs were Ashkum, Checawkose, and their kinsmen, still angry over the treaties and
                    determined to disrupt the proceedings. The village chiefs and their supporters also numbered almost
                    three hundred, and many of them were heavily armed. In addition to the six hundred Indiana
                    tribesmen, about fifty Potawatomis from southern 
                        Michigan
                     had arrived at the payment ground on Saturday, September 24. These 
                        Michigan
                     tribesmen were opposed to removal and supported Ashkum against the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs. Finally, between three and four hundred traders swarmed across the payment
                    grounds, eager to press their claims for a share of the spoils.11
            
            Coquillard's fears over the distribution of the payments were soon confirmed. On the morning
                    of September 25, 
                        Iowa
                     and the other 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs assembled at the log council house on the payment ground. They were joined by
                    George Ewing, Taber, and several of their friends. Meanwhile, about twenty armed guards, hired by
                    the Ewings, surrounded the council house and prevented other claimants from entering. When Captain
                    William Simonton, the military disbursing agent, turned over almost $64,000 in land
                    payments and annuities to the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs, the latter claimed $16,000 for themselves and relinquished the
                    remaining funds to Ewing and Taber. Although several hundred other merchants crowded around the
                    council house, Ewing and Taber promptly processed their own and their friends' claims
                    first. Out of the remaining $48,000 the commissioners paid the Ewings' firm
                    $16,000 and Taber's firm $8,000. Joseph Barron, a friend of the
                    Ewings, also received $8,000. Three other traders friendly to the commissioners were paid
                    considerably smaller claims ranging from $75 to $2,500. Thus, after the first
                    few minutes of the proceedings, more than $50,000 was gone. Only $14,000
                    remained to satisfy the claims of all the other traders.12
            
            Not surprisingly, the unpaid claimants raised a storm of protest. Several traders, led by Nicholas
                    Grover and Francis Comparet, peacefully entered the building and asked the commissioners to suspend
                    the payments until all claims could be presented and their validity judged. Meanwhile, Coquillard

                  CYRUS TABER
               
                     complained to William Ewing, the commissioner's
                    brother, who also was present on the payment ground. But the protests were ineffective. The
                    commissioners ordered Grover and the irate Comparet from the council house, while William Ewing
                    "made some insulting reply" to Coquillard and refused to intercede.13
            
            Angered over their failure, the crowd resorted to stronger measures. Some tore away clapboards nailed
                    over the log walls of the council house, trying to get a better view of what was taking place
                    inside. Others shouted insults at the commissioners and threatened to tear the building down. Ashkum
                    and the other village chiefs joined the mob, hoping to get at 
                        Iowa
                     and his comrades, who remained cowering inside. Intimidated, some of the guards
                    retreated into the building while others primed their weapons, fearing for their lives.14
            
            Afraid that the village chiefs might fire upon the council house, Grover asked Coquillard to calm the
                    Indians. To gain an elevated position Coquillard attempted to climb up to the roof of the building
                    but slipped and fell when one of the support poles gave way. Before he could clamber up again,
                    Pierre Andre, one of Ewing's guards, placed a musket to his head and threatened to
                    "blow out his brains" if he repeated his efforts.15
                    Momentarily subdued, Coquillard retreated to a neighboring rooftop; from there he addressed the
                    crowd, urging the traders to stop the payments and warning the Indians that the Ewings were
                    "designing men, seeking a fortune." He also argued "that the Ewings were
                    attempting to cheat them out of their money. I told them not to be still like boys, and let
                    themselves be robbed; but to come out like men, and pay their honest debts, but no more."
                    Coquillard was followed on the rooftop by Jean Baptiste Chandonnai, a mixed-blood Potawatomi from 
                        South Bend
                    , who harangued his kinsmen in stronger terms. Widely known for his violent temper,
                    Chandonnai charged that the government was stealing Potawatomi lands and that President Jackson was
                    a "rascal" whose agents "lied to and cheated" the Indians. He
                    admonished Ashkum to tear down the building and seize all the funds. The mixed-blood also labeled

                    cut their throats.16
            
            Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. Grover spoke to the crowd, asking them to remain peaceful but
                    again demanding that the payments be suspended. Apprehensive of the crowd's mood, Allen 
                        Hamilton
                    , a business partner of Taber, agreed to Grover's demands and promised to
                    return the $8000 awarded to the Taber-
                        Hamilton
                     partnership until all claims against the Indians had been investigated. Afraid that he
                    might lose both his money and his life, even William Ewing reluctantly consented to
                    Grover's proposal. Finally, both the Ewings and the crowd agreed that Pepper and Captain
                    Simonton, the disbursing agent, should appoint new commissioners to investigate all claims and make
                    the payments.17
            
            While Allen, William Ewing, and the crowd were reaching an agreement, George Ewing, Taber, and Barron
                    remained in the council house listening to the debate. Although George Ewing evidently felt
                    obligated to honor his brother's promise, both Taber and Barron were reluctant to part with
                    their newly acquired fortunes. Both men maintained residences adjacent to the payment grounds, and
                    when they heard William Ewing and 
                        Hamilton
                     agree to give up the money they slipped out of the council house, carrying their
                    payments. Learning of the flight, an angry mob of traders followed the two fugitives to their
                    houses, where the frightened Taber quickly surrendered his share of the money. In contrast, Barron
                    armed several of his sons and threatened to shoot anyone trespassing on his property. Not
                    intimidated, the mob gave notice that it would tear down his house and lynch him if he refused to
                    relinquish the payment. Since the crowd also was well armed and greatly outnumbered his family,
                    Barron wisely surrendered. When the traders entered the house, they found that, in addition to the
                    original payment, Barron had absconded with an extra $2000.18
            
            The return of the money and Pepper's appointment of five "gentlemen of high
                    character in the community" to serve as new commissioners did much to alleviate the
                    traders' complaints. But Ashkum and the village chiefs remained on the payment grounds,
                    still vowing to kill 
                        Iowa
                     and his comrades if they dared to leave the council house. Inside the building, the

                    protection when they had signed the recent land cessions. Concerned for their safety, Pepper assumed
                    command of Ewing's guards and brought all the returned funds into the building. He also
                    sent a message to nearby 
                        Logansport
                    , asking local officials to call out the militia.19
            
            Pepper, the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs, and the guards spent the night of September 25 without sleep, huddled together
                    in the council house. The following afternoon, a force of about one hundred militia arrived from 
                        Logansport
                    . Disgruntled, Ashkum and his followers abandoned the payment ground and returned to
                    their villages. The siege had ended.20
            
            Accompanied by the militia, the new commissioners collected all the remaining funds and withdrew from
                    the payment grounds. Judge William Polke, one of the new commissioners, lived only three miles from
                    the council house, and the officials believed his farm would offer more security for the
                    redistribution of the payment funds. Since the new commissioners were "surprised at the
                    number and magnitude of the claims," before redistributing any of the money Polke addressed
                    the assembled traders, informing them: 
                        should they [the commissioners], through mistake, pay any one more than should thereafter,
                            upon an investigation, appear to be just, the claimants would be required to pay them back;
                            and further, that the undersigned [the commissioners] would recommend to the Secretary of
                            War the propriety and necessity of instituting an investigation, by the appointment of a
                            commissioner for that purpose, of all claims against the aforesaid tribe of Indians.
                     Following the speech, Polke and the other officials spent four days examining claims and
                    making payments. Although some of the new commissioners also held small claims against the
                    Potawatomis, they took precautions to guard against favoritism, and the money was parceled out as
                    fairly as possible.21
            
            If the redistribution of funds pleased more of the traders, it still engendered complaints from a
                    sizeable minority. Most vocal were the Ewings, Taber, and Barron, whose original

                     payments were much reduced by the new commissioners. George
                    Ewing charged that the redistribution was a plot fomented by "priests and degraded
                    Frenchmen" working in the British interest. Further twisting the lion's tail,
                    George Ewing singled out Coquillard, whom he described as a "British-hearted
                    rascal" infamous for "insulting and torturing American prisoners, and practicing
                    outrages upon their persons and their feelings" during the War of 1812. Ewing complained
                    that since he had used all his influence to help Pepper negotiate the recent treaties his claims
                    should be paid first. Moreover, he warned the government that he would advise the Potawatomis
                    against removal, boasting, "Nor shall these Indians ever get out of Indiana until we are
                    paid if it is in my power to prevent them."22
            
            But the Ewings' power was diminishing. Following the claims payment, the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs were so frightened of Ashkum and Chandonnai that they refused to return to their
                    villages. 
                        Iowa
                    , Pashpoho, and others spent the winter of 1836–1837 in 
                        Logansport
                    , relying upon Pepper for protection. Meanwhile, the federal government attempted to
                    placate the village chiefs, and during February, 1837, the dissidents visited 
                        Washington
                    . Although the government refused to invalidate the recent treaties, it did reimburse
                    Ashkum and his fellowers for the loss of their lands.23 Yet the
                    government's actions did little to diminish the hostility between the two factions of
                    Potawatomis, and the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs still feared for their lives. Eager to leave Indiana, they asked for removal to
                    the West, but they were afraid to share the new Potawatomi reservation in 
                        Iowa
                     with their enemies. Finally, to facilitate their removal, the government established a
                    second reservation in 
                        Kansas
                    , setting aside a tract of land along the Osage River. In August,
                    1837, most of the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs abandoned Indiana for new homes in 
                        Kansas
                    .24
            
            Meanwhile, federal officials responded to the new commissioners' request, and in April,
                    1837, the government appointed

                     Judge John W. Edmonds of Hudson, 
                        New York
                    , to investigate all outstanding claims against the Potawatomis in Indiana. Commissioner
                    of Indian Affairs Carey Harris instructed Edmonds to examine the claims of those traders
                    dissatisfied with the final 1836 payment and to meet with both the merchants and those Indians
                    supposedly in their debt. Edmonds also was directed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the
                    1836 claims payment and to ascertain who was responsible for all the turmoil.25
            
            Edmonds journeyed to 
                        Logansport
                    , Indiana, where he arrived in late May, 1837, establishing an office in the 
                        Washington
                     Hall Hotel. During the next month he met with traders, Indians, and local politicians,
                    examining claims and investigating the recent payments. The proceedings attracted large numbers of
                    people, the crowd evidently anticipating further encounters between Coquillard and the Ewings, but
                    the hearings progressed peacefully. On June 24, 1837, Edmonds concluded his assignment and moved on
                    to 
                        Wisconsin
                    , where he investigated similar claims against the Menominees.26
            
            Edmonds' report indicates that during his month in 
                        Logansport
                     he examined 146 separate claims against the Potawatomis. The amount of the individual
                    claims ranged from $2.87 to over $27,000 (the latter was one of several claims
                    presented by the Ewings), with the total amount submitted by all traders and other individuals
                    reaching $169,446.64. After a short investigation Edmonds was able to prove that claims
                    totalling almost $84,000 were fraudulent. Of the remaining $85,000 in valid
                    claims, over $62,000 already had been paid at the 1836 claims payment and at smaller
                    Potawatomi annuity payments during 1837. Therefore, the Indians still owed the traders about
                    $23,000. Federal officials promised that these claims would be paid.27
            
            Edmonds' investigation satisfied most traders but brought a chorus of complaints from a few.
                    Leading this overture were the Ewings, who again lamented that the government was unappreciative of
                    their efforts and argued that all their claims should be paid. Ironically, however, Edmonds had been
                    much more lenient in approving the Ewings' vouchers than those of

                     their competitors. Although he disallowed about
                    $7,900 worth of their statements, he did validate over $35,000 in recent
                    payments or in notes still held by the Ewings against the tribe. Still dissatisfied, the Ewings
                    unsuccessfully spent the next ten years seeking further payments from the government.28
            
            After examining participants in the 1836 claims payment, Edmonds concluded that Pepper had purchased
                    the village chiefs' reservations from Indians who had little claim to the lands.
                    Sympathetic to Ashkum and his followers, Edmonds admitted that the dissident Potawatomis had
                    threatened violence, but he pointed out that they had disbanded peacefully, causing no property
                    damage or bodily harm. Although the State of Indiana eventually charged Coquillard, Chandonnai, and
                    several others with inciting a riot, Edmonds observed that they had broken no federal statutes. The
                    commissioner was very critical of the Ewings and their friends for grabbing the lion's
                    share of the payment funds but conceded that, with the exception of Barron's seizure of the
                    extra $2000, they also had broken no law.29
            
            In retrospect, events surrounding the 1836 Potawatomi claims payments illustrate several facets of
                    the traders' influence upon both Indians and government officials. Obviously, by the
                    mid-1830s the tribesmen were mired in an economic morass of insufficient annuities and overextended
                    debts. Since the Potawatomis relied upon the traders for the necessities of life, these merchants
                    exercised considerable power over tribal politics. Such influence is apparent in the
                    Ewings' ability to persuade the 
                        Wabash
                     chiefs to sell reservations belonging to Ashkum and the other village chiefs.
                    Pepper's reliance on the Ewings' assistance in negotiating the treaty indicates
                    that government officials were aware of the traders' influence, and his willingness to
                    allow George Ewing and Taber to serve as the original claims commissioners illustrates that Indian
                    agents sometimes granted special favors in return for the traders' cooperation.
            The investigation of the claims payment also suggests that considerable fortunes could be amassed in
                    the Indian trade. Undoubtedly some traders lost money through credit extended

                            Coquillard, Jean Baptiste Chandonnai, and the others later were dropped.
               
                     to the tribesmen, but Edmonds' investigation indicated
                    that most merchants counterbalanced their losses with inflated prices and swollen vouchers. Prior to
                    Edmonds' queries, the government made little attempt to judge the claims, and most vouchers
                    evidently were accepted at face value. Although Edmonds was forced to examine over 140 claims in
                    less than one month, he easily was able to prove that almost half of the claims were fraudulent.
            Finally, the 1836 claims payment shows that many of the traders were willing to use questionable
                    methods in championing their claims, regardless of the impact upon the Indians or the government.
                    Given the characteristics of Jacksonian society, such opportunism is not surprising. Many Americans
                    were after quick profits, and the traders were no exception. But the Ewings' threat that no
                    Indians would be removed until all their claims were paid indicates a shocking selfishness, even by
                    the standards of the 1830s. Ironically, later officials would harness such self-interest, and in the
                    1840s the government hired the Ewings to help remove some of the Miamis. Coquillard received a
                    similar contract for a belated Potawatomi removal in 1851. Edmonds' analysis of the
                    traders' importance was certainly perceptive when he reported back to Harris that
                    "no influence over them [the Potawatomis] is stronger … and none …
                    more powerful, for good or ill, as it may chance be exerted."30

            The Automobile Workers Unions and the Fight for Labor Parties in the 1930s
            
                    Hugh T. Louin
                    ∗
                
            Despite the New Dealers' innovative social and economic programs during the 1930s,
                    discontented agrarians and labor unionists judged the New Deal's shortcomings so severe
                    that they began to nurture third party movements. Scrappy automobile industry unionists in
                            
                  Ohio, Michigan
               , and Indiana at first ignored the new third party efforts of
                    impatient New Deal critics. Instead, with many other organized and unorganized workers, they
                    expected New Dealers to provide better times after the "lean years" of the 1920s.
                    During the post-World War I decade union rolls had declined, the American Federation of Labor (AFL)
                    had lost prestige, and unions had exercised little influence with lawmakers and other elected
                    officials. Consequently, employers easily avoided collective bargaining with unions, strikes often
                    were ineffective, and unionists charged that public officials consistently deployed police forces
                    and the National Guard to tilt the balance in industry's favor during labor-management
                        conflicts.1
            
            The New Dealers of the 1930s, although clearly pro-labor, failed to effect many of the changes which
                    automobile industry workers anticipated. In response, disgruntled automobile unionists in the Great
                    Lakes states attempted to build labor parties. That they failed to create viable labor parties calls
                    attention to the remarkable resiliency of America's two party system even during the
                    nation's most severe depression. More important, the unionists' failures to
                    establish labor parties reflect the New Deal's hold on so many industrial workers and AFL
                    craft unionists

                    defused the menace to it from labor party exponents and made allies of such third party crusaders as
                    the automobile unionists in 
                        Ohio

                    for what they reveal about the New Deal's good political fortune and the angry
                    unionists' decisions to become New Deal supporters.
            Nationally, the drive for labor parties began in the 1920s, when self-styled "labor
                    progressives" initiated worker education programs designed to remedy labor's
                    escalating ills. Primarily Socialists, a few union leaders, and liberals, these labor progressives
                    founded the Workers' Education Bureau, which the AFL Executive Council also supported until
                    1928, when this group finally tired of the progressives' industrial union concepts and
                    unconventional political action ideas. Progressives also created several labor colleges, the most
                    ambitious of them Brookwood College at Katonah, 
                        New York
                    , which A. J. Muste and his followers established in 1921. Brookwood College, a model
                    for the others, developed a two-year curriculum, published Labor Age, distributed
                    printed materials, and conducted institutes on labor issues. Meanwhile, labor progressive orators,
                    labor college teachers, and Labor Age writers challenged the AFL's
                    insistence that organized labor strive only for wage increases, improved hours, and better working
                    conditions. Because the most difficult labor problems had developed in industries where craft unions
                    were less practical than industrial unions, the reformers urged the formation of industrial union
                    organizations and "independent political action" by labor.2
                    Most labor progressives believed AFL-organized labor parties were best suited to reaching the latter
                    end. Such parties could tap the political clout of AFL craft unions and command votes in
                    multi-million member industrial unions, elect legislators, and establish labor party governments
                    that would speedily enact needed labor laws and eliminate the misuse of police and military force
                    during labor-management disputes.
            Although AFL leaders deplored these ideas, progressives bypassed federation sachems and carried their
                    proposals to local unions, city central and trades councils, and state federations of labor. There
                    progressives won many converts, only to lose some of them when unions such as the United Automobile,

                     Aircraft and Vehicle Workers of America folded during the
                    1920s. Meanwhile, progressives and the Socialist party experimented with labor parties in half a
                    dozen cities. By 1932 persevering progressives claimed that their unionist supporters supplied them
                    a solid foothold in the largest mining, garment, and textile industry unions.3
            
            The AFL, still resisting the labor progressives, voiced more convincing arguments against labor
                    parties following the 1932 elections. AFL chiefs insisted that supporting President Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt and the New Deal best served all laborers because labor-minded New Dealers in Congress had
                    enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. Section 7A of this law encouraged collective
                    bargaining and speeded union growth, and opportunistic union leaders soon furnished apparent proof
                    of the AFL's contentions about it. John L. Lewis, for instance, took advantage of the New
                    Deal's pro-labor philosophy and laws to expand his miners' union. He dispatched
                    swarms of organizers to the coalfields, where they proclaimed that "President Roosevelt
                    wants you [miners] to join the union." Thousands enrolled.4
            
            Unimpressed labor progressives replied with anti-New Deal rhetoric and, fortuitously for them, were
                    able to cite enough industrial evasions of the NIRA to suggest that large numbers of laborers and
                    unions had been deprived of those benefits which the NIRA regulatory system was designed to bestow.
                    Noting instances where employers treated the law as a "scrap of paper," one
                    progressive singled out unscrupulous automobile industrialists for manipulating NIRA codes
                    "every week" to "entrench their company unions" at the expense
                    of independent unions and, consequently, escape meaningful collective bargaining with their
                        workers.5 Progressives called for stricter laws guarding against such
                    industrial machinations but added that only labor party officeholders could provide and enforce

                     such statutes. Then, to strengthen their labor party appeals,
                    progressives obtained a statement from AFL President William Green holding that no AFL
                    "constitutional prohibition" restrained either the AFL or its member unions from
                    forming "an independent party of labor." With Green's ruling in hand and
                    over his opposition to third parties, progressives again solicited unions for support.6
            
            Progressives hoped for favorable responses from automobile workers generally and particularly from
                    members of the United Automobile Workers of America (UAWA). A union whose members were organized
                    along industrial lines in so-called federal labor unions chartered by the AFL, the UAWA had expanded
                    from a handful in 1934 to a claimed 375,000 members in 1937.7 It was, therefore,
                    a plum worthy of labor progressives' efforts to pluck. Happily for the progressives, UAWA
                    international union leaders, all AFL appointees who opposed third parties, argued to little avail
                    that the New Deal had truly served labor, such representations having ever less impact on their
                    subordinate union officials and many automobile plant workers.8 Some workers
                    expressed outrage that Democrats had failed to make workable the New Deal laws intended to benefit
                    labor; others cynically quipped that NRA really signified the "National Run
                    Around." These workers noted that Henry Ford incurred no penalties when he refused to abide
                    by the NIRA automobile code and that other entrepreneurs simply paid the law lip service while they
                    manipulated it for their own ends. Consequently, company unions proliferated, employers rewarded
                    workers who opposed the UAWA, and industrialists readily avoided collective bargaining.9 Then, in 1935, after the

                            automobile, cement, and aluminum industries. Organized for assembly line workers, these were
                            industrial-type unions from which traditional AFL craft organizations remained apart.
                            National AFL heads maintained tight reins on the new federal locals by appointing the
                            federal local union leaders.

                     Supreme Court struck down the NIRA, Congress passed the Wagner
                    Act, which momentarily raised automobile workers' spirits. But the new law, resisted by
                    industry, effected little immediate betterment of workers' lot. Unionists charged that
                    automobile industry executives still sidestepped genuine negotiations with their employees with
                    strategems running the gamut from bellicose refusal to negotiate to forcing unions to bargain under
                    company-imposed rules which were "incongruous to [real] collective bargaining." In
                    the automobile factories, a union journal complained, the bosses ignored both worker and union
                    protests against the "speed-up" on assembly lines which extracted excessive labor
                    for a day's pay. According to a report prepared in 1936 for Committee for Industrial
                    Organization chiefs, industry not only compelled automobile workers to endure the drudgery wrought
                    by the speed-up and the stretch-out but parlayed its advantages through labor spies who supplied the
                    information necessary to crush all dissent against the prevailing factory practices. A union journal
                    asked: "Spies, company unions, intimidation, discrimination—can the worker say
                    he is free as long as these things are permitted to exist?"10
            
            At the same time, unionists ascribed pervasive hostility and widespread antilabor acts to state and
                    local governments in the Great Lakes states, where Democrats had held most public offices since
                    1933. According to these critics Governor William Comstock in 
                  Michigan, Ohio
               's governors George White and (after 1935) Martin Davey, and
                    their Democratic lieutenants not only denied unions a fair hearing during industrial disputes but
                    permitted misuse of the National Guard during such conflicts. The unionists cited incidents such as
                    those at 
                        Toledo
                    , where two persons were killed during strife accompanying the Auto-lite strike of 1934.
                    Similarly, unionists charged, many county and municipal officials vented their antagonism toward
                    industrial labor groups. In the eyes of many, 
                        Detroit
                     Police Chief Heinrich Pickert best symbolized those local officials—a solid

                     factories. Backing up the unionists' charges, liberal
                    sympathizers pictured Pickert as "the man who broke the copper strike in northern 
                        Michigan
                    " before becoming a 
                        Detroit
                     official, and they attributed Pickert's authoritarian and antilabor mentality
                    to his military background and current position of "ranking officer in the National Guard
                    and Reserve Army Corps."11
            
            Frustrated by adversity within the automobile plants, thwarted on picket lines, and critical of New
                    Dealers who had not rigidly enforced the federal labor laws to improve the industrial
                    worker's lot, automobile unionists discussed several proposals for radical political
                    action. Matthew Smith, secretary of the Mechanics Educational Society at 
                        Cleveland
                    , urged that unions "establish a free society of the workers'
                        commonwealth."12 That plan, endorsed by A. J. Muste and his
                    American Workers' party organizers as well as many labor progressives, received a hearing
                    in various labor quarters. In leaflets and industrial shop papers Communists added to the third
                    party clamor by advocating a "Workers and Farmers Labor Party" committed to
                    "political liberation" for both groups.13 In turn, several 
                        Ohio
                     automobile union leaders publicly boosted for a predominantly labor party. Richard E.
                    Reisinger, an officer in Local Union #32 and president of the 
                        Cleveland
                     District Auto Council, argued that labor needed its own political party because
                    Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike practiced duplicity toward labor by enacting only
                    "stop gap" laws that "camouflage[d]" their designs to
                    "pacify and fool the wage earner."14
            
            When these discussions generated interest, several unions conducted labor party experiments in 
                        Ohio
                    . Unionists ran a

                    from teacher unionists, railroad brotherhoods, and even the AFL's 
                        Toledo
                     Central Labor Union Council. The Lucas County Congress wrote a pro-labor, anti-private
                    utility, soak-the-rich platform and, later in the same year, ran seven candidates for seats on the 
                        Toledo City
                     Council and the Board of Education. In the October, 1935, municipal elections,

                     mayoral candidate polled substantially fewer votes than his two opponents; conversely,
                    the electoral results at 
                        Toledo
                     encouraged labor party promoters because four labor nominees won seats, two each on the
                    City Council and the Board of Education.15
            
            Counting on the political momentum generated at 
                        Toledo
                    , union leaders made plans to build a statewide labor party. Several 
                        Toledo
                     unions promised their support, and during the next few months the 
                        Cleveland
                     District Auto Council and its nine affiliated local unions announced their backing for
                    a labor party. Labor organizations at Girard, Barberton, Akron, and Youngstown also expressed
                    interest in the labor party movement. But insufficient support materialized to warrant additional
                    organizing work. The 
                        Ohio
                     State Federation of Labor publicly deprecated these labor party efforts, causing most
                    of its affiliates to cooperate in blocking the third party movement.16 More
                    crippling to the new movement was the fact that the federation doubtless would obstruct an 
                        Ohio
                     labor party as long as the AFL opposed such bodies.
            The automobile unionists and their allies, now thwarted in 
                        Ohio
                    , promoted their cause in national AFL councils. There they joined a
                    faction—comprised of painters, garmentmakers, teachers, and textile
                    unionists—that had nagged the AFL for a labor party since 1930. Expecting continued
                    resistance from President William Green and the AFL Executive Council, these groups denounced AFL
                    conservatives and devised plans for bypassing Green and the council when the 1935 annual AFL

                     convention met at Atlantic City. They hoped to persuade the AFL
                    delegates to vote in defiance of their leaders for a labor party. Meanwhile, the 
                        Ohio
                     unionists worked feverishly toward securing UAWA endorsement of national-and
                    state-level labor parties. In that way they might enhance significantly the labor
                    progressives' contentions to AFL delegates at Atlantic City that, despite the federation
                    leadership's opposition, each year thousands more workers desired a labor party. But the
                    Ohioans labored in vain, because AFL appointees occupied the principal UAWA international union
                    offices and, their sway momentarily unassailable, blocked the progressives' labor party
                    resolutions when the UAWA national convention met at 
                        Detroit
                     in August, 1935.17
            
            At the AFL's Atlantic City assembly in October, automobile unionists introduced several
                    labor party measures. One championed labor parties on the grounds that the Republican and Democratic
                    parties "function[ed] in the interest of finance capital" and forced unions to
                    "fight not only the employer, but the police, national guard, courts, and all other
                    agencies of a supposed impartial government." The resolution demanded AFL
                    "endorsement" of a labor party composed of "trade unions and working
                    class and farming organizations." A second resolution required the AFL Executive Council to
                    initiate a labor party referendum no later than January 1, 1936.18 Ultimately
                    the AFL Atlantic City assembly received a total of sixteen third party resolutions. All were
                    rejected, but labor party advocates believed it significant that their proposals received a
                    "strong minority vote." None would accept the views of observers who believed the
                    AFL was still bound inextricably to its "hoary policy of backing whichever [major] party
                    promises the juiciest favors."19
            
            Meanwhile, labor party activity had spread from 
                        Ohio
                     to other Great Lakes states. Labor journals like the Racine (
                        Wisconsin
                    ) Day, which a UAWA official edited, publicized arguments for labor

                     debated the issue more seriously than ever since the Republican
                    administration of Frank Fitzgerald, after replacing the conservative Democratic regime of Governor
                    William Cornstock early in 1935, had opposed union-inspired legislation for bettering working
                    conditions in automobile plants. Continued hostility from local governments, too, spurred automobile
                    unionists to think about political unorthodoxy. As a first step in that direction 
                        Michigan
                     unionists ran labor tickets for municipal offices at Port Huron, 
                        Dearborn
                    , and Hamtramck, and they backed a controversial "United Labor Ticket"
                    for 
                        Detroit
                     Common Council seats. Maurice Sugar, a 
                        Detroit
                     lawyer whose labor and civil rights cases had insured him notoriety, headed the latter
                        slate.21 Similarly, Indiana automobile unionists speculated that a third
                    party might better serve them since Indiana Democrats had treated them so shabbily. By threatening
                    those Democrats who had urban constituencies, the unionists in 1934 had negotiated concessions in
                    return for the unions' "yeoman service" to Democratic candidates running
                    for election that year. But, according to unionists, Governor Paul V. McNutt and most state
                    legislators had since accorded the unions less than "cordial treatment."
                    Furthermore, one unionist accused, politicians of both major parties constantly greeted the
                    UAWA's militancy toward employers with "a cold, hostile attitude of
                        disapproval."22
            
            When automobile unions became nuclei for labor parties in 
                  Michigan, Ohio
               , and Indiana,
                    labor progressives beamed. Even more encouraging, not only were many individual unionists
                    supportive, but backing was also widely dispersed through local unions and larger automobile
                    district councils such as the 
                        Cleveland
                     council. Nevertheless, third party promoters still had to overcome formidable hurdles.
                    The state federations of labor in 
                  Ohio, Michigan
               , and Indiana could be expected to
                    obstruct labor parties, for they remained as loyal as ever to the AFL leaders who opposed all third
                    party endeavors. But the worst roadblocks immediately ahead were UAWA international union officers,
                    who stood in the way of shaping the automobile unions

                     into effective third party forces. Already UAWA president
                    Francis Dillon and his handpicked subordinates had threatened to array the prestige, power, and
                    finances of the international union against all progressive proposals for change, including new
                    labor parties.23
            
            Fortuitously for labor party proponents, the tenure of Dillon and his appointees proved unexpectedly
                    brief. A rebel faction of self-labeled "progressives" (for sake of clarity, called
                    UAWA progressives in this essay) organized late in 1935 to eliminate AFL controls over the UAWA,
                    inaugurate more genuine industrial unionism in the UAWA, and depose Dillon and his staunchly pro-AFL
                    allies. UAWA progressives staged their revolt and, successful by April, 1936, soon transferred the
                    UAWA and its member unions from the AFL to the Committee for Industrial Organization. Typed
                    "radically different" from "the old line labor leader" by a
                    financial journal, many UAWA progressives had university, seminary, or labor college training. Some
                    boasted radical political pasts, and most criticized the AFL's "pork
                    chop" union traditions for unduly restricting the goals and scope of union activity.24 Consequently, they were receptive to labor party proposals. While still
                    reaching for power, the UAWA progressives promised five fundamental reforms, including support for
                    an AFL-organized labor party and, until the AFL acted, UAWA participation in the midwestern
                    farmer-labor parties that anti-New Deal agrarians had earlier organized. UAWA progressives based
                    their political action program on a recent proposal from textile industry unions to the AFL.25 That proposal had first attacked past Republican and Democratic failures
                    "to preserve the constitutional and civil rights of the workers, farmers and small business
                    men" and then urged formation of labor parties to protect "the masses of our
                    people" from "oppressive, autocratic control of big business and powerful
                    financial and industrial interests." Until the AFL created a national labor party,
                    unionists were counseled to create state-level parties to which they admitted sympathizers

            UAWA progressives unveiled their labor party plans two months before formal ratification could be
                    secured from the UAWA national convention at 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana, on April 27, 1936. During that interim many groups pressured the progressives
                    to modify their political plans. As advocates of a popular front, Communists demanded broad
                    farmer-labor parties which welcomed non-farm and non-union elements. Socialists denounced this
                    popular frontism because they correctly perceived the Communist party's real intention of
                    working for the reelection of Roosevelt in 1936 and, moreover, because many Socialists preferred
                    pristinely pure workingmen's parties.27 Wobbly (Industrial Workers of
                    the World) automobile industry workers, mainly 
                        Michigan
                     residents, scoffed at labor and farmer-labor parties because, in their view, unionists
                    should distrust all politics in a capitalist order. Meanwhile, Congressman Thomas Amlie of 
                        Wisconsin
                     invited UAWA progressives to hitch their wagon to his American Commonwealth Political
                    Federation. Amlie had initiated his so-called "Farmer-Labor" movement in 1933 and
                    spoke principally for agrarian left groups and sympathetic townsmen. In Amlie's opinion the
                    depression had discredited capitalism, but New Dealers had failed to banish the Great Depression or
                    reorganize the American economy. He promised eternal prosperity when victorious farmer-labor
                    legislators took office, dispensed with capitalism's "production for
                    profit" penchants, and established an "economy of abundance" based on
                    uninhibited "production for use" of goods and services.28
            
            UAWA progressives wavered, with many leaning toward an exclusive labor party, although outside labor
                    progressives lectured them that automobile unionists need not fear farmer-labor parties for, as was
                    happening in the 
                        Minnesota
                     Farmer-Labor party led by Governor Floyd Olson, farmers and laborers worked together
                    harmoniously. But Amlie finally lured the UAWA progressives to his camp. Happily for him, his forces

                     had formed the 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor party in 1934 and offered UAWA progressives ties to well-established
                    political organizations in many rural counties where unionists alone might be unable to overcome the
                    farmers' aversions to the UAWA's union militance. Moreover, important
                    Farmers' Union groups made evident their cordiality to the UAWA by praising a 
                        Wayne County
                     Farmer-Labor organization which automobile unionists helped to organize early in
                        1936.29
            
            Amlie's forces were weaker in 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana. There his supporters had established the 
                        Ohio
                     Farmer Labor Progressive Federation, a lackluster organization beset by destructive
                    internal friction. However, UAWA progressives judged the 
                        Ohio
                     federation's political spadework valuable and believed that unionists could
                    make the organization a satisfactory and vigorous political tool.30 In Indiana
                    Amlie luckily had persuaded 
                        South Bend
                     unionists to lead a local Farmer-Labor movement. Many of these unionists were also
                    small farmers who alternately manned industrial assembly lines and tilled their acreages near 
                        South Bend
                     during the lengthy periods of unemployment which plagued virtually all automobile
                    industry workers. These unionists greatly admired Amlie and his "economy of
                    abundance" panacea since he promised to resolve the economic problems of both
                    agriculturalists and urban labor.31
            
            When UAWA progressives veered toward Farmer-Labor, alarmed AFL, CIO, and Democratic party leaders
                    tried to change the progressives' minds. Denigrating third party arguments, they said that
                    unionists misjudged the New Dealers, who had decided to deny conservative, antilabor Democrats any
                    important places on industrial state tickets in 1936. For proof, these groups pointed out that
                    Indiana's McNutt probably could never again become governor. Further, they argued,
                    Roosevelt had handpicked Frank Murphy, a liberal Democrat, to head the Democratic ticket in

                     chieftain John L. Lewis, for his part, expressed his view that
                    labor must work to reelect Roosevelt. In April, 1936, Lewis organized Labor's Non-Partisan
                    League, designated it the CIO's political arm, and commanded the league to gather AFL and
                    CIO union support for Roosevelt.32
            
            Progressives shrugged off AFL and Democratic pleas, with one of their publications denouncing AFL and
                    Democratic opportunists for trying to "unite labor behind a movement [for Frank Murphy] to
                    bedeck with roses the mountain of manure in the Democratic Party."33
                    Less readily dismissed were the CIO's importunings, because Lewis had promised the UAWA
                    $100,000 to finance the body's organizational work; to ignore his wishes invited
                    sacrifice of those funds. But progressives finally chose to stand their ground and easily secured
                    approval of their third party program at the UAWA national convention in April, 1936. As earlier
                    instructed by their local unions, convention delegates from 
                  Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio
               , and Indiana supplied the votes to pass a
                    third party resolution and also to withhold UAWA backing of Roosevelt. Then left-wingers, led by
                    Wyndham Mortimer and George Addes, controlled the UAWA convention machinery so that opponents of
                    third parties could not thwart the progressives by resort to parliamentary maneuvers.34 Nevertheless, CIO representatives fought back at the convention, attempting to win
                    votes for at least a reconsideration of the progressives' third party course. They failed,
                    and John L. Lewis, forced to intervene personally, threatened to withdraw the $100,000
                    earlier promised the UAWA. With only minutes remaining until the assembly adjourned, the delegates
                    relented to the extent of endorsing Roosevelt.35
            
            Except for principle, UAWA endorsement of Roosevelt under duress cost UAWA progressives little,
                    because Farmer-Labor soon dropped its plans to run a nominee against Roosevelt. Amlie and his
                    agrarian aides believed this step essential since Lewis probably would persuade most unions to
                    support Roosevelt. To no avail, UAWA progressives tried to

                     lead Amlie to the opposite conclusion.36
                    Meanwhile, the progressives' main third party measure stood as adopted at the 
                        South Bend
                     convention. That document characterized the Republican and Democratic parties as
                    "parties of big business" equally ready to "break strikes and otherwise
                    continually encroach upon the rights of labor, the farmer and small businessmen." UAWA
                    unions were instructed to form state and local farmer-labor parties and keep these organizations
                    "exclusive of no worker."37
            
            During the next few months Lewis permitted the UAWA unions to continue state-level third party work,
                    but he publicly advised the unions that such activity would be more appropriate following the 1936
                    elections. UAWA progressives ignored his counsel, and several automobile district councils and local
                    unions even criticized the UAWA's endorsement of Roosevelt. But, as UAWA officials defended
                    the latter action under pressure from Lewis, eventually most UAWA local unions placated the CIO
                    chief by also endorsing Roosevelt.38 These disputations aside, UAWA progressives
                    busily organized Farmer-Labor parties. Aiming at AFL unions, they contributed to the labor party
                    propaganda coming from groups such as the United Textile Workers of America and, since the UAWA had
                    deserted the AFL, they found sympathetic AFL unionists to expound progressive views at the 1936 AFL
                    national convention at Tampa.
            To expedite their political work in the Great Lakes states, progressives secured UAWA funds for
                    purchase and distribution of Farmer-Labor political materials.39 Then they
                    bargained with the CIO in order to minimize its opposition to Farmer-Labor candidates in
                            
                  Michigan, Ohio
               , and Indiana. In 
                        Michigan
                     the progressives succeeded. There UAWA leaders, positioned in the leadership of the 
                        Michigan
                     Labor's Non-Partisan League organization, proposed that the league, although

                    it publicly opposed none of 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor's nominees for state and local offices.40
                    Rolling their sleeves higher during the summer of 1936, UAWA progressives drew many more unionists
                    to the 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor party. They attracted primarily automobile workers and AFL painters,
                    claiming to have gained the interest of automobile unions with membership exceeding 70.000.41
            
            Equally encouraging was Farmer-Labor progress in 
                        Ohio
                    . There UAWA progressives established Farmer-Labor clubs and county organizations in six
                    major industrial counties, conducted political work in Mahoning Valley manufacturing centers, and
                    appointed a "State Committee for the Promotion of a Farmer-Labor
                    Party." However, that committee scaled down 
                        Ohio
                     progressive plans after lengthy deliberations, deciding to restrict Farmer-Labor work
                    to electing 
                        United States
                     congressmen from four districts and candidates for local public offices in the
                    principal industrial counties.42
            
            Progressives made similar headway in Indiana. After founding a state-level party on May 16, 1936,
                    they established permanent organizations in three counties and appointed provisional committees for
                    work in several others. Then more good fortune came the progressives' way. Unexpectedly,
                    central labor union councils at 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        South Bend
                     defied the AFL and supported Farmer-Labor, and, unlike state federations of labor in 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    , the Indiana State Federation of Labor also endorsed the Farmer-Labor party.43 A full Indiana Farmer-Labor ticket was named for state offices; John Bartee,
                    an automobile union leader in 
                        South Bend
                    , headed the slate.44

                         until 1936, he joined the international union staff, returned to 
                            South Bend
                         in 1938, became secretary of the Indiana state CIO organization, and held that
                        office until 1941. See "Oral History Interview of John Bartee" (1961),
                        1–3, 8 (Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs).
            
            
            Their campaigns launched, UAWA progressives encountered their first serious troubles in the summer of
                    1936 with the establishment of the Union party and its nomination of William Lemke for president.
                    Running on a radical agrarian platform and wishing to qualify readily for a place on the 
                        Michigan
                     ballot, Lemke asked for the 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor party's presidential nomination. His supporters deemed that
                    request reasonable since Farmer-Labor had neither its own presidential nominee nor liking for
                    Roosevelt or Republican candidate Alfred M. Landon.45 But Lemke's
                    request triggered destructive warfare within the 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor organizations. Agrarian party members rallied to Lemke while labor
                    elements declared such support unthinkable because his main backers included Father Charles
                    Coughlin. Although Coughlin earlier had defended automobile industry unionism, urban radicals and
                    many unionists had come to consider Coughlin's views "fascist." They
                    accused him of admiring the dictators in power in 
                        Germany
                     and 
                        Italy
                    , and they deplored Coughlin's recent vacillations on labor questions.46
            
            UAWA progressives grasped at straws to rescue their 
                        Michigan
                     party as it became so divided that the loss of many farmers was possible. They
                    bargained with AFL officials, proposing that the federation sufficiently strengthen the 
                        Michigan
                     Farmer-Labor party so it could afford to lose those agrarians who admired Lemke; in
                    return, progressives promised to help the AFL keep Lemke off the 
                        Michigan
                     ballot. AFL leaders seriously reviewed the proposition, consulted with Labor's
                    Non-Partisan League officials, and prepared to accept the progressives' offer if New Deal
                    Democratic interests were served by so doing. Finally AFL leaders concluded to the contrary because
                    both Lemke and Farmer-Labor seemed safely ignored, as neither could exercise much impact on the
                    upcoming presidential election.47 That decision left the

                     factions to battle destructively. The factions, never able to
                    compromise, each ran their own tickets with predictably dismal results in the general elections;
                    candidates of each group polled at most about 50,000 votes.48
            
            Next, Socialist leaders compounded Farmer-Labor's electoral headaches. Walter Reuther and a
                    few others excepted, Socialist leaders urged their unionist followers to resist the Farmer-Labor
                    parties and wielded a countervailing influence against Farmer-Labor in several larger UAWA local
                    unions. Less obstrusively, Socialist leaders argued to unionists that labor party advocates should
                    momentarily heed the CIO, join Labor's Non-Partisan League, and build credit with Lewis and
                    his lieutenants by helping to reelect Roosevelt. Then, having earlier entrenched themselves in the
                    Non-Partisan League, labor party promoters could orchestrate the building of genuine labor parties
                    in 1937 and 1938.49
            
            Despite these setbacks UAWA progressives predicted success in November, at least in 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana, where Farmer-Labor groups had repulsed intrusions from Lemke's
                    Union party followers and where the Socialists were less disruptive to the movement. However,
                    progressives badly miscalculated, for the greatest perils for them lurked in quarters that most had
                    overlooked. During the autumn of 1936 New Dealers and CIO leaders unleashed a juggernaut which
                    overwhelmed all opponents. Roosevelt built an "urban coalition," attracting ethnic
                    minorities and workingmen's groups on whom progressives had counted for votes.50 Hammering at unionists, in the meantime, Lewis described Roosevelt to them as
                    a "good and faithful servant," and for the president Lewis gathered endorsements
                    from uncounted CIO and AFL local unions, thirty-five state federations of labor, and officers of
                    eighty-five international unions.51 Consequently, progressives watched

                     helplessly while the CIO took its toll in the Great Lakes
                    states where Farmer-Labor parties were the progressives' political vehicle. By resorting to
                    "Skull Cracking," a 
                        Michigan
                     Non-Partisan League officer gloated, the CIO kept labor's
                    "friends" behind the Democrats. Influenced by the CIO, United Rubber Workers of
                    America delegates voted 61 to 39 not to back the 
                        Ohio
                     Farmer-Labor movement, although UAWA progressives once claimed these rubber industry
                    unionists for their side. In Indiana, even with AFL aid, the Farmer-Labor ticket met humiliating
                    defeat at the polls. Meanwhile, the 
                        Ohio
                     Labor's Non-Partisan League organization, judged by CIO leaders to be one of
                    their most effective state-level political arms, rallied industrial workers to the Democrats with
                    slogans such as "Down with the Company Union" and "Vote
                    Roosevelt." When the CIO demonstrated its overwhelming power in 
                        Ohio
                    , UAWA progressives threw in the towel in that state several weeks before the general
                        election.52
            
            Organized and unaffiliated industrial workers contributed heavily to Democratic victories in
                    November, 1936, but labor progressives were unimpressed and believed that the Democratic landslides
                    in no way rendered labor parties less practical. Francis Gorman, a United Textile Workers officer,
                    declared that Roosevelt and his fellow Democrats could not sate labor's "hopes and
                    aspirations," leaving the rationale for labor parties as compelling as ever. Alex Rose of
                    the Cap, Hat and Millinery Workers generally agreed, though he was friendly to Roosevelt, whom he
                    characterized as "a truly representative spokesman of the people." Rose called the
                    president's recent reelection "a great historic accident" that
                    "may not repeat itself for another hundred years"; moreover, he reminded
                    unionists, "Political friends of organized labor are usually also friends of many others,
                    and in crucial moments they are not dependable, they desert the labor cause when they are most
                        needed."53
            
            Labor progressives renewed their fight nationally, sometimes before all of the 1936 ballots were
                    tabulated. Asking first for CIO aid, they were rebuffed on the grounds that a bright future awaited
                    labor since Roosevelt and other Democratic politicians dared not renege on their recent campaign
                    promises.

                     According to Lewis, federal agencies now must protect workers
                    from ever again being "clubbed, gassed, or shot down with impunity." Progressives
                    disputed such rosy forecasts, but CIO officials replied that the CIO could promise only to
                    "adjust" if differing "political alignment[s]" developed later.
                    That seemed unlikely, several CIO leaders added, for the election of Roosevelt in 1936 had initiated
                    a labor party in America.54
            
            Repulsed by the CIO, labor progressives turned to the AFL in desperation. Realistically, however,
                    they could expect little from the federation; at best they could hope their overtures would help
                    them sustain the very limited AFL union support which they had generated in 1936 in such places as
                    Indiana. Moreover, the progressives' gestures to the AFL pleased various radical groups
                    which supported labor party movements. Still leading agrarian forces billed as Farmer-Labor,
                    Congressman Amlie encouraged progressives to build labor parties under the AFL's aegis. He
                    reasoned that his own groups were so weakened by their 1936 debacle that only unions could sustain
                    viable third parties and, in that event, the organizations must closely resemble the Labour party in
                    Great Britain.55 Communists advocated a "broad national Farmer-Labor
                    Party" which Earl Browder, the chief Communist party official, compared to the
                    People's Front in 
                        France
                    . The "progressive trade unions" were to be the "backbone of
                    this new [American] political alignment." However, Browder cautioned that such a party also
                    required CIO backing.56 For their part, Socialists urged two duties on
                    unionists: to work for third parties through the CIO and its political agency, Labor's
                    Non-Partisan League, and to help labor progressives confront state and local AFL leaders with labor
                    party demands. Pursuing the latter course vigorously, Socialists and their unionist allies sometimes
                    managed to evoke encouraging responses from the AFL. In 
                        Michigan
                    , for instance, they prodded the

                     of Labor until it appointed a committee to "canvass
                    the possibility of forming a Labor Party."57
            
            Labor progressives next urged UAWA progressives to lead labor parties in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Michigan
                    . These requests seemed reasonable because UAWA progressives still were receptive to
                    unorthodox political adventures and, despite the recent Democratic victories there, UAWA
                    progressives might readily tap support from thousands. In those states many sit-down and
                    conventional strikes followed the 1936 elections. Public authorities often repressed the outbreaks,
                    and Roosevelt deeply disappointed unionists when, during one bitter struggle, he declared a
                    "plague" on both unions and the "Little Steel" companies.
                    Furthermore, unmistakable labor party rumblings accompanied the strikes. Automobile unionists openly
                    flaunted their political might. Workers, an automobile union journal reported, were "openly
                    razzing their straw bosses and their stooges for touting [Alfred] Landon" in the recent
                    presidential canvass. Another journal noted that the automobile unions, keenly aware of their
                    "dynamic strength and vitality," recognized the "great need of the
                    working people to organize politically as well as in trade unions."58
                    Then, on March 23, 1937, 60,000 persons openly defied 
                        Detroit city
                     authorities and demonstrated at Cadillac Square. The demonstrators vented their rage
                    against Mayor Frank Couzens and Heinrich Pickert, the city's police chief to whom unionists
                    ascribed "police fascism." The crowd applauded wildly when orators advised workers
                    to elect only public officials who "put human rights above property rights" and to
                    ensure "a[n] automobile worker as mayor and a labor man as police commissioner after the
                    next election." Listening politely, the group also heard out Leo Krzycki, an Amalgamated
                    Clothing Workers union leader, who counseled, "I urge you to organize politically as a
                    labor party, and your rights will be protected."59
            
            Nevertheless, UAWA progressives hesitated to launch labor parties in 1937. AFL unions doubtless would
                    resist such parties, and progressives disliked offending the pro-Democratic CIO since that agency
                    had contributed so mightily to their political miseries in 1936. Moreover, progressives thoughtfully

                     mulled over the merits of three possible courses.
                    Philosophically, many deemed labor parties the most practical vehicles for labor over the long haul.
                    But a second group, citing political immediacy as the controlling consideration, argued that the
                    UAWA should revive the farmer-labor movements of 1936 in order to preserve labor's old bonds with
                    sympathetic agrarians. A third group of progressives advocated that unions instead simply make the
                    Democratic party more responsive to labor's wishes.60 Unionists, the latter
                    group admitted, had plenty of grievances against the Democrats since the New Dealer landslides of
                    1936. Industrialists still defied the UAWA, and Henry Ford demonstrated such tenacity in resisting
                    the UAWA that he became the automobile unions' toughest nut to crack. On another front, unions
                    complained that too many federal lawmakers refused to support new legislation which would force Ford
                    and like-minded holdouts to the collective bargaining table. Scarcely less offensive to many
                    unionists was the 1937 "Little Wagner" Act which was passed by Michigan Democratic
                    legislators. This act was so outrageously defective from the standpoint of organized labor that
                    unionists successfully petitioned for its repeal. Satisfactory "Little Wagner"
                    laws seemingly could not be secured from Ohio and Indiana lawmakers. Nevertheless, one UAWA
                    progressive faction excused New Dealers from blame for such conditions, held conservative Democrats
                    responsible, and argued that labor needed only purge conservatives to make the Democratic party
                    suitably labor-minded. In so doing, unions could avoid the pitfalls which had always beset American
                    third party movements.61
            
            During these discussions CIO chieftains scowled and discouraged all third party talk, and finally the
                    UAWA progressives listened to their CIO superiors. The die cast, progressives urged unionists not to
                    participate in farmer-labor endeavors and, with greater misgivings, declared against UAWA unions
                    marching with the labor party drummers. UAWA president

                            leaders, third party sentiment survived in 1937 among Socialist unionists mainly in

                     Homer Martin explained the progressives' decision in
                    August, 1937. Walking on eggs so that the CIO remained unoffended and labor party supporters in the
                    UAWA were at least partly mollified, Martin remarked that labor was not ripe for its own exclusive
                    party. Although unionists accepted the need for independent political activity, he added, too many
                    laboring people did not agree that only their "own" deserved public office, making
                    it impossible to organize a labor party "based on and firmly rooted within the ranks of the
                    organized labor movement."62 Later in August, UAWA national convention
                    delegates ratified the progressives' decisions. Passed after cursory review was a
                    resolution favoring "independent political action" but reserving such initiatives
                    for the CIO's political arm, Labor's Non-Partisan League.63
            
            Thereafter automobile unions awaited the CIO's nod or "developments of
                    tomorrow" which might revive the labor party "question."64 But labor party declarations never came from CIO officials, although Lewis toyed until 1938
                    with the possibilities of farmer-labor political action. Finally, CIO leaders spoke, projecting
                    "politics on a basis that is going to be effective" in the 1938 state and
                    congressional elections. Denouncing many Democrats elected two years earlier, Eli Oliver (vice
                    president of Labor's Non-Partisan League) called them "plain, simple,
                    old-fashioned liars" and directed CIO unions to defeat those conservatives who had winked
                    wickedly to garner labor votes in 1936 and then ignored "the power of organized
                        labor."65 Late in 1938, delegates to the CIO's first
                    national convention laid down new political action rules. They dismissed "independent
                    political action" and confined the CIO's political activity to working in the two
                    major political parties. For the immediate future, as Lewis then explained CIO policy, the CIO
                    intended to ensure that the Democratic party nominated and elected liberals. When that goal was
                    reached the CIO and its member unions planned to stand watch so that these liberals stayed in line,

            UAWA unions cooperated, repeatedly rejecting third party overtures to them in 1938 and 1939. Typical
                    of such incidents, an assembly of UAWA local union presidents, principally officers in 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     unions, declared "political expression" of combined "labor,
                    farm, radical and other Progressive groups" unacceptable until the CIO sanctioned such
                        endeavors.67 Meanwhile, CIO and UAWA leaders discouraged incipient labor
                    party sentiment in the unions by providing their followers with plenty of outlets for conventional
                    forms of political activity. The UAWA governing council established a permanent Political Action
                    Committee that worked in concert with Labor's Non-Partisan League to promote the
                    candidacies of CIO political favorites.68 The CIO established state-level
                    organizations in most states between 1939 and 1941, and CIO industrial union councils and permanent
                    Non-Partisan League organizations proliferated. All supplied unionists with additional mechanisms
                    for acceptable political activity.69
            
            When the CIO and UAWA leaderships confined the automobile unions' politics to conventional
                    channels after 1937, labor progressives acknowledged defeat in the long fight for labor parties in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Michigan
                    . Only a few cared to renew that battle during the ensuing decade. Socialists attempted

                     1938.70 In 1944 radicals and a handful of
                    lower-echelon automobile union leaders formed the 
                        Michigan
                     Commonwealth Federation, a body they envisioned as the nucleus for a third party.
                    Citing farmer-labor activity in 
                        Canada
                    , the MCF News argued: "If the Canadian workers and farmers
                    can do it, so can we." Two years of fruitless effort followed before the federation
                        collapsed.71 Meanwhile, for most labor party crusaders of the 1930s all that
                    remained were major party politics and the inevitable post-mortems of their failures. A few have
                    recently appeared in print, but unhappily these old-time reformers have preferred nostalgia in their
                    reminiscences to full intellectual dissection of their abortive movements.72
            
            Capitalizing on industrial worker frustrations with the New Deal's shortcomings became a
                    major pastime for radicals by the mid-1930s. That agrarian practitioners of this art—such
                    as Congressman Thomas Amlie—and their labor counterparts, the labor progressives, built
                    respectable followings among automobile industry unions proved to aspiring reformers that labor
                    parties were possible in Indiana, 
                        Ohio
                    , and 
                        Michigan
                    . Eventually automobile unions became nuclei of the proposed political organizations.
                    New Dealers, however, did not quake, although there were reasons for so doing. They had failed to
                    make the National Industrial Recovery and Wagner acts effective tools in labor's service;
                    conservative Democrats in state and local governments fired ever more indignation among industrial
                    laborers and caused critics to rank Democrats and Republicans as equally antilabor; and rising from
                    labor ranks were persistent wails that, instead of collective bargaining, police and military power
                    were deployed unfairly against unions to resolve labor-industry conflicts. But New Dealers were
                    vindicated at the polls in 1936; to win they had belatedly swayed many automobile unionists into
                    their ranks, ruthlessly trampled midwestern labor parties, and established for the

                     automobile unions a repute as Democratic strongholds that has
                    since persisted.
            Yet the Democrats' conceit in the wake of their triumphs was misleading. New Dealers did not
                    inspire automobile unionsts to uncritical admiration for the New Deal. Nor did astute engineering by
                    Democratic politicians play more than a secondary role in the outcome in the automobile industry
                    unions. Instead, for several reasons the automobile unionists formally abandoned all third party
                    ventures in 1937. They heeded the pro-Democratic CIO, adoptive parent of the UAWA after it severed
                    its relationships with the AFL. Occasionally Lewis and his CIO lieutenants secured UAWA acquiescence
                    by applying pressure against labor party activity in the UAWA unions. But more often they resorted
                    to persuasion, appealed to UAWA unionists' sense of loyalty to the CIO, and successfully
                    hammered in the logic of CIO arguments that the Democratic party, although encrusted with
                    conservatives and containing liberals negligent about paying their labor debts, was the best
                    political vehicle for the CIO and its member unions. Meanwhile, two other considerations supplied
                    compelling reasons for UAWA progressives and their subordinate unionists to follow the
                    pro-Democratic course desired by the CIO. First, the AFL stressed its abiding faith in the two party
                    system and, with such minor exceptions as were seen in Indiana in 1936, consistently served notice
                    on UAWA progressives and their allies that labor parties were exceedingly risky since they could
                    never tap support from the powerful, well-entrenched craft union forces of the Great Lakes states.
                    And, finally, there remained the ultimate restraint of America's historical experience and
                    its clear lesson that third parties were doomed. Thoughtful UAWA progressive leaders could scarcely
                    gainsay this practicality, especially after their bruising political setbacks in 1936; and, were
                    progressives still myopic in the wake of such failures, their AFL and CIO elders reminded them
                    forcefully of the futility that came from defying American political traditions.

            Even the young, who did not experience the perils of battle, design the grand strategy, or speed the
                    production of factories, had to face the challenge of war. The date was December 8, 1941. More
                    quietly than usual, students in 
                        Indianapolis
                     shuffled into their high school auditoriums to hear President Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt's radio speech. They listened attentively as he asked Congress to recognize what
                    by then to most Americans seemed plain—war with 
                        Japan
                    ! At the time when these adolescents were preparing to greet maturity, at the moment
                    when "we … should be about to live," world war inescapably had become
                    "the outstanding fact" of their lives.1
            
            Not all adolescents responded to the disorder of war in socially acceptable ways. Eventually,
                    revelations of juvenile delinquency awakened many adults to tensions young people faced.2 In early 1944 social workers, youth leaders, correctional authorities, and
                    other interested persons from Indiana assembled

                    concluded that the children most affected by the war were those of high school age. Just when allied
                    military success had greatly reduced the threat of Axis victory, and shortly before the Normandy
                    invasion and Soviet advances in the east would almost assure the final conquest of 
                        Germany
                    , the conferees worried that adolescents were suffering major setbacks on the home
                        front.3
            
            The sensationalism surrounding juvenile delinquency concealed a more common yet significant malaise,
                    one that, like delinquency, surmounted class and ethnic barriers. For while only a small proportion
                    of adolescents lapsed into delinquency, some authorities argued that the problem was only
                    symptomatic of more widespread dissatisfaction—of low morale—among large
                    numbers of teen-age youth.4
            
            Although the question of morale was important during the war, it did not become generally a serious
                        problem.5 Most people benefitted psychologically from the feeling of
                    national unity, from the enjoyment and anticipation of the fruits of wartime prosperity, and
                    probably even more from the satisfaction

                            delinquent acts, juvenile delinquency received enormous attention. According to one count,
                            in the first six months of 1943 magazines saturated the country with 1,200 articles on the
                            problem. Summary of Minutes of Conference on Juvenile Delinquency, August 3, 1943, p. 2,

                            agreement on causes of errant behavior, and the extent of the problem could easily be
                            exaggerated; what is conclusive is that arrests of juveniles increased dramatically during
                            the war. In

                            behavior may have been in part a response to low morale, a cause-and-effect relationship is
                            difficult to confirm. For views that delinquency reflected low morale, see Robert J.

                            converse hypothesis, that delinquency contributed to low morale, is far more tenuous.
                            Because of this and because of the low percentage of adolescents involved, the relationship
                            of low morale to delinquency receives no further treatment in this essay. For additional

                     and enhanced sense of self-worth that derived from involvement
                    in the war effort.6 Not surprisingly, historians have emphasized the impressive
                    unity and patriotism they have noted among Americans on the home front. According to an early study
                    by Isaac Kandel, "there was at no time any fear about the morale or the patriotism of the
                    American people…." Popular accounts of the home front by Richard Lingeman and
                    Geoffrey Perrett announced that "the whole country [was] … bursting out in a
                    springtime of patriotism" and that "the country had plunged into a spontaneous
                    outpouring of patriotic emotion." Academic writers, while more reserved, have proclaimed
                    "the spirit of unity," "determination and unity," and
                    "a high degree of unity and wartime enthusiasm" on the home front.7
            
            Yet these findings can lead to exaggeration or oversimplification of cohesion and enthusiasm during
                    World War II— particularly among high school students. The variegated responses of
                    students to "the outstanding fact" in their lives counsels circumspection. Left at
                    best with a reservist role in mobilization, many adolescents did not receive the satisfactions or
                    exhibit the enthusiasm adults drew from the war effort. Although students faced and reacted to many
                    wartime experiences in ways similar to adults, they were kept at the edge of this great historical
                    event by their ill-defined status between child and adult; adolescence was akin to minority group
                    status, with incomplete civil rights and lack of access to the full range of American life.
            In spite of well-defined enemies and ample appeals to patriotism, accustomed features of adolescence

                     uncertainty, and uninvolvement flourished among students
                    throughout the war. As early as March, 1942, a representative of the national YWCA voiced a concern
                    that others would come to share. "The boys and girls whose wartime nervous excitement can
                    find no useful outlet," she warned, "will become a dispossessed generation that
                    may once more lose the peace." Four years later the federal Office of Community War
                    Services concluded that "while the rest of the world mobilized its resources and swung into
                    the grim business of war, youth too often was the ‘forgotten
                        man’."8 If not neglected, students were largely
                    restricted to a narrow range of activities. Fewer opportunities were available for them to
                    contribute to the common cause, to be an integral part of the response to national emergency; hence,
                    compared to others in society their opportunities for self-enhancement were fewer. This had long
                    been true in American life. In a war that demanded so much from other elements in society, the
                    discrepancy was magnified. During mobilization, one of society's recent
                    creations—the adolescent itself—proved its resilience.
            The first two decades of the twentieth century, according to historian Joseph Kett, witnessed
                    "the invention of the adolescent, the youth whose social definition—and indeed,
                    whose whole being—was determined by a biological process of maturation."
                    Moreover "adolescence was essentially a conception of behavior imposed on youth, rather
                    than an empirical assessment of the way in which young people actually behaved. The architects of
                    adolescence used biology and psychology … to justify the promotion among young people of
                    norms of behavior that were freighted with middle-class values."9
                    Accompanying these intellectual developments and fortifying their middle-class values were social
                    movements that accelerated the segregation of youth within the new urban-industrial culture:
                    compulsory education, prohibitions on child labor, and special legal procedures embodied in the
                    juvenile court. Legislation associated with these movements conferred a more precise chronological

                     definition on adolescence.10 Age grouping
                    had become a powerful factor in the social lives of teen-age youth.
            By 1940, particularly in urban areas, the cultural determinants of adolescence, and along with them
                    the institutional sway of the high school, set students apart.11 Within the
                    group itself the influence of such factors as race, class, religion, and ethnicity served to
                    differentiate youth, as they did the members of other social groups such as women and the elderly.
                    Student viewpoints and morale were not homogeneous, and how much the differences among them derived
                    from the above variables remains beyond the scope of the present analysis. But youth can be defined
                    as a social group largely because of affiliation with the high school and age itself. Both of these
                    factors identified adolescents as deserving of special treatment, helped shape adult expectations of
                    them, and contributed to their sometimes special perspective on issues.12 Age
                    designations conditioned their lives and brought diverse individuals together to share common
                    experiences.

                  12 Hollingshead observed that youth who withdrew from high school were
                        viewed by the adult community as young adults, with responsibility for their actions, while
                        those of the same age in high school, the adolescents, were regarded as dependent children.
                        Hollingshead, Elmtown's Youth, 389. Characteristics of the age group
                        often flowed easily through class barriers. "Even though variations do exist in the
                        behavior of youth," David Gottlieb and Charles Ramsey wrote, "it is possible
                        to identify a number of areas where the actions of adolescents are distinct in style from those
                        of other age groups. In these situations the norm of acceptance or preference is set for the

            Almost as a reflection of their lesser social status, adolescents have remained largely hidden from
                    historical inquiry. Bereft of positions of command, they leave little conventional historical
                    debris. As with other social groups that tend to be historically mute, historians must recognize
                    that not all questions regarding adolescents can be addressed. Some remain beyond reach.
            To approach the group's interests and unsettled thought requires the historian to examine
                    novel sources. Student publications permit some inner views of the world of high school students.
                    Although possessed of weaknesses, they reveal much about the wartime pressures and confusions among
                    young people. Especially in student newspapers, though edited with the counsel of faculty advisers,
                    youth expressed opinions, voiced the concerns of peers, and directed attention to matters, petty and
                    grand, relevant to their lives.13 They also provided an information link between
                    adults and students who spent so much of the day in different milieus. One adviser of student
                    journalists proclaimed that it "is substantially the fact, that only the student
                    publications remain as lines of mass communication with the adults of your city."14

                            example, a student of the subject concluded that the problem of cost paled before the desire
                            to emulate mainstream tastes. Similar styles constituted "virtually a
                            uniform" among all classes of high school girls. See Sylvia S. Silverman, Clothing and Appearance (

                     mirrored the group's behavior and attitudes, student
                    journalists might have been inclined, even if unconsciously, to try to present themselves in a
                    favorable light. Moreover, the adult influence presents problems. Administrative censorship
                    certainly precluded, for example, adverse comment on school and staff and direct criticism of
                    government and community. These publications, then, do not lend themselves to all questions and must
                    be used with care. Still, their important limitations seem to make all the more noteworthy the not
                    infrequent expressions of dissatisfaction that appear in student papers.
            Such expressions creep in because the student press remained largely a creation of students, even if
                    only select ones. Competition for staff positions could be fierce. The winners probably were among
                    the most able and acute observers and expositors of student behavior and attitudes. They no doubt
                    knew their peers at least as well as the average student did and better than nearly all adult
                    observers. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that distortion of the entire group's views
                    might result because the papers were written by a small and generally "elite"
                    group of students. Because public high schools were inclined to reflect middle-class values and
                    standards and because students over sixteen—those not required to attend— were
                    disproportionately middle class, one would expect a middle-class outlook, difficult to define and
                    variable as it might be, to prevail in these newspapers.15 But if student
                    journalists embodied middle-class characteristics and if they now and then catered to social elites,
                    the desire to obtain a large circulation kept them from editing and speaking for the sole interest
                    of any one segment of student society. At any rate, many other students besides staff journalists
                    contributed commentary and a range of reports to each school paper. War-related issues that affected
                    students in similar ways regardless of class or clique affiliation were of course unavoidable and
                    irresistible to the high school reporters.

                            Indianapolis
                         during the war. It is likely that most of the thousands of students who dropped out
                        of school to take jobs were from lower income families; vocational schools suffered severe drops
                        in enrollment in the city from 1940 to 1944, with Manual High School having the sharpest
                        decline, 37 percent. High School Enrollment Data Forms (

            Weaknesses intrinsic to student sources are alleviated when the historian understands they do not
                    stand alone as evidence. Polls of student opinion and studies by wartime journalists, educators, and
                    social scientists complement or corroborate material in the student press, and they are essential to
                    the task at hand. Together, the documentation reveals the viewpoints and morale of an important
                    segment of American society.
            Judging from the flurry of comments in the high school press, most adolescents in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , like their elders, yearned for neutrality when war erupted in Europe in 1939. They
                    rejoiced that the 
                        United States
                     remained aloof from the fighting. In a virtual shout from the printed page, a boy at 
                        Washington
                     High School thundered: "War!!—Three little letters, the symbol of
                    what may be the destruction of civilization…. We do not want war! Who does?"
                    Such outbursts were not unusual. A "spirit of peace" permeated school halls.
                    "It is up to us, the youths of America, students that we are," this same boy
                    continued, "to foster and perpetuate this spirit." The student made this plea:
                    "Nothing has ever come out of war but misery, weariness, hate, and oppression, the seeds
                    for other wars…. Let us believe in peace—let us live!!!!"16
            
            If writing punctuated by exclamation points accompanied notice of the war in Europe, in calmer
                    moments, apparently unaware of the effects of increased defense expenditures, adolescents argued
                    that war endangered the economic health of the nation. Some young people had an almost apocalyptic
                    vision of how the war would affect their country. According to the essayist who received honorable
                    mention in a 1940 contest, "Youth treads the daily paths of existence, unconscious of the
                    treacherous pitfalls of betrayed trust that will fling it to the depths of war and its hideous
                    sequels, economic disaster, corruption, spiritual collapse, ruin." Others shared the same
                    grim vision. "Should it come," wrote a boy from Manual High School,
                    "another war will make some drastic and terrible changes in our nation. It is probable that
                    after the war we will revert to some form of totalitarian government. It is certain that this will
                    be true during the war. There will be a total depression, striking even the government with
                        poverty."17
            
            Gradually, as events in Europe and the Pacific pulled the nation nearer to war, students in 
                        Indianapolis
                     became less sure

                     of the staying power of neutrality. Their uncertainty
                    paralleled that of Indiana adults, who were divided over the question of intervention. A seemingly
                    widespread feeling developed among students that "democracy is on the wane" and
                    that America remained the "last fort" protecting the privileges of democracy.
                    During the fall term of 1941, high schools assumed a stance close to the war footing they would soon
                    experience. Posters imploring students to "Buy a Share in America" sprouted in
                    school halls in support of the sale of defense bonds and stamps.18 Yet the
                    belief remained common that America deserved to remain above the fray. Even three months after the
                    attack on Pearl Harbor, a Shortridge High School student considered war a violation of American
                    innocence and found it difficult to accept. "War has come to America," he said,
                    "the America that was impregnable, the America who [sic] looked upon war as a foreign thing
                    that could never reach her distant shore."19
            
            The strength found in unity might have assuaged such dejection. It is well known that the Japanese
                    treachery at Pearl Harbor fashioned an unusually united nation, one whose people were eager to aid
                    the war effort. A Fortune poll in the fall of 1942 appeared to demonstrate
                    convincingly that solidarity also prevailed among high school students: 91 percent of a nationwide
                    sample thought the fighting worth continuing.20 Yet this survey masks the wide
                    variety of attitudes toward the war and justifications for fighting it.
            An indication that adolescent attitudes were complicated came in a study conducted in the summer of
                    1942 by Mandel Sherman, a University of 
                        Chicago
                     social scientist. Sherman compiled seven classifications of responses to the war,
                    basing them on examination of 6,500 essays entitled "How the War Affects Me,"
                    written by high school students in 
                        Chicago
                    , and 500 interviews with 
                        Chicago

                     emerged. Five percent of the sample expressed direct
                    antagonism, including criticism of the government, the war effort, and reasons for the war. Some of
                    these students believed Roosevelt's policies had goaded 
                        Japan
                     into attacking the 
                        United States
                    ; some were sympathetic to 
                        Germany
                     and 
                        Italy
                    ; others were pacifists. It is responses such as these that one does not expect to find
                    in the high school press. Another group of 6 percent shared a critical attitude toward the war,
                    believing it would not solve anything. Instead they feared that a war-induced depression would leave
                    the country in worse condition than before. More significant than the first two categories was a
                    third group of 21 percent who expressed indifference. Because they believed the war was unavoidable,
                    they simply resigned themselves to it. They too worried about depression and deprivation. A typical
                    response from a student in this category was, "This war doesn't mean much to me
                    except that we have to get along with less sugar and maybe other things." A fourth group,
                    comprising 12 percent of the students, responded that they were confused; the war and its issues
                    were a mystery to them. A fifth group of 9 percent showed a mildly favorable attitude toward the war
                    but complained about certain aspects of it, such as younger people having to join the armed forces,
                    the impact on their families, and the rationing of certain items. Twenty-six percent of the sample
                    expressed a favorable attitude, absent of criticism and morale problems, and 21 percent were
                    strongly favorable, with many of them expressing vindictiveness toward the enemy and believing that
                    the nation should have entered the war sooner. Residents of 
                        Indianapolis
                     would have had reason to be startled when they read a summary of these results in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star: in a time of apparent national unity, 44 percent of these youth expressed
                    either criticism, confusion, or indifference toward the war.22
            
            These findings need to be interpreted cautiously. The title of the essay may have led some
                    respondents to think in terms of adverse effects, and Sherman's judgment of the
                    essays' contents is subject to error. Furthermore, he did not distinguish between race;
                    perhaps black youth were more critical because of the Double-V civil rights campaign, and if they
                    formed a large percentage of the sample the results may be distorted. Thus, although the student
                    press in 
                        Indianapolis
                     did reflect similar concerns, precisely how representative the 
                        Chicago
                     findings were of 
                        Indianapolis

                     uncertain. Nevertheless, they strongly suggest that wartime
                    attitudes were more varied and complicated than such sources as the Fortune poll
                    would lead one to believe.
            Like their counterparts in 
                        Chicago
                    , high school students in 
                        Indianapolis
                     assessed the impact of the war on their lives in different ways. An analysis of the
                    student press reveals fluid thought; individuals cannot be fitted into specific attitudinal
                    categories. They flowed from one to another, perhaps often holding, as no doubt did many adults,
                    contradictory views. Still, a pattern of the group's concerns throughout the war years does
                    emerge.
            Young people commonly recognized that compared to other groups in society the war left them
                    relatively untouched. They often behaved accordingly. In spite of gas rationing, for example, enough
                    "joy-riding" by adolescents took place to incur the wrath of workers hard pressed
                    to reach their jobs. Transportation problems prompted the student press to comment frequently on the
                    "current date problem," but dating continued and even flourished. In response to
                    the solicitations and gregarious inclinations of teen-agers, communities established youth centers
                    for them.23 One young writer stated near the end of the war that "the
                    younger set, high school age, seems to be the least hard hit by present conditions….
                    [because] boys and girls look to themselves for entertainment." She failed to elaborate,
                    but the war did release youth from the constraints of the depression years and turn their attention
                    even more toward their group life. From their peer-centered social life evolved fashions, styles,
                    and patterns of acquisitive behavior that transformed adolescents into the
                    "teen-agers" who composed what Daniel Boorstin has called in another context a
                    "consumption community."24 The phenomenon lent credence to the
                    view of many youth counselors that depression-induced frugality had given way to an exaggerated
                    emphasis on materialism.25 In this sense adolescents' lives fit John
                    Kenneth Galbraith's description of the home front as being "an almost casual and

                     pleasant experience."26 At worst
                    this attitude contributed to complacency, lack of concern for the war effort; at best it guarded
                    against psychological disorders and low morale.
            An opposing viewpoint encouraged youth to be more sensitive to the exigencies of war, to sacrifice,
                    and to assume more responsibility. For some students influenced by such considerations, shortages,
                    rationing, and disrupted habits and pastimes portended a bleak future for their adolescent years.
                    Frequently tinged with self-pity, numerous comments in the student press showed that adolescents
                    sometimes thought the war was particularly unfair to them, whether in trivial matters such as not
                    being able to have formal gowns cleaned, or in more profound concerns, such as friends and relatives
                    departing for war. In some households youth might undertake greater responsibilities and even move
                    rapidly into young adulthood. "Just a few months ago we were a perfectly normal American
                    family," wrote one girl a year after Pearl Harbor. "But now that has
                    changed." Her father worked overtime in a war plant; her mother left home for much of the
                    day at her own war job; her brother had quit school to enlist. "The job of running the
                    house is now left to me," she said. While some of her peers shared similar
                    responsibilities, this experience was less evident than in the depression years.27 Some students, realizing they were the generation embodying the nation's future,
                    expressed an attitude that respected the serious implications of the war. This view compelled them
                    to assume such obligations as the study of the intricacies of government and international relations
                    in the hope that they might help make the next peace last. One boy at Arsenal High School, who had
                    witnessed several of his peers change educational plans or sacrifice preferred vocations and leisure
                    time for work in war industry, argued "that this war is affecting the lives of the youth
                    even more than those of older people." If this perspective was not widespread, it had
                    rewards, particularly the opportunity to show that youth can perform important functions in
                        society.28

            The confusion between feeling free to pursue one's personal interests and feeling burdened
                    with unusual responsibility was further compounded by the uncertainty about what people still in
                    school could actually do to help the war effort. A panel of youth convened by the 
                        United States
                     Children's Bureau agreed that most young people wanted to contribute in a
                    significant way and have a larger stake in the community.29
                    
                        Indianapolis
                     student spokesmen were eager to pledge the services of youth. The pressure could be
                    intense. "Headlines scream at you … radios blare…. Friends
                    … [are] helping the country in many ways," a student at Shortridge observed.
                    "You become caught up in the excitement and want to do your part too. And that is
                    right." Expressing a popular sentiment, another writer insisted that "today we all
                    want a share in some type of work which will help towards the victory of our nation." At
                    Broad Ripple High School in 1942 a student responded to those who questioned young people's
                    commitment to the war. "We … already have begun making plans to aid our
                    nation," he claimed. "Many will say this is the foolish notion of youth; but, to
                    us, this is the only attitude which we could take at such a time of stress." It would be a
                    kind of banishment to feel useless and idle.30
            
            Even in a city where total employment increased by more than 29 percent during the war, however, the
                    nagging question was what meaningful role adolescents could play. Their gradual removal from the
                    adult world of work was largely complete by 1940.31 But as the defense emergency
                    unfolded, it seemed more important than ever to participate in the affairs of society. Neglected
                    social groups suddenly seized the attention of manpower recruiters as employers found that the
                    supply of out-of-work males quickly ran dry. In autumn, 1942, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Chamber of Commerce surveyed unemployed women to locate those willing to work. The

                    that also included the elderly and out-of-school youth. Such appeals, together with an influx of
                    migrant workers, enabled the industrial labor force of 
                        Indianapolis
                     to more than double during the war, with the number of women in industrial work
                    expanding nearly threefold and the number in clerical and service jobs growing by more than 50
                    percent. Even the city's rigid pattern of racial discrimination yielded somewhat to the
                    requirements of the wartime economy.32
            
            High school students had less chance for suitable participation. A disturbing number recognized this
                    and chose to drop out of school, although the jobs they secured customarily lacked opportunity for
                        advancement.33 Most young people responded to the widespread entreaties to
                    stay in school. Yet in the classroom concentration proved difficult. In the words of one student,
                    filled with visions of glory, "merely to dream of shooting a gun or diving in a plane at
                    unsuspecting Japs while learning of past … things, will be harder to do than face
                    … death itself." Many teachers testified to a feeling of restlessness in the
                        classroom.34 Enthusiasm for school wartime activities quickly

                             public high schools declined by 3,150 or 17 percent, about the same percentage
                            as the nation, which lost 1,200,000 from school rolls. As noted earlier, vocational schools
                            suffered particularly severe drops, and it is likely that students from lower-income
                            households composed a disproportionate number of the dropouts. The importance of education
                            for future advancement in society was not lost on middle-class students, frustrating though
                            it was for many of them to remain in school. See Richard M. Ugland,

                     waned, and youth organizations that established wartime
                    services, like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, did not attract many teen-age youth. While part-time
                    jobs proved popular with youth and important to the community, they often did not satisfy the
                    longing for war service. One study of boys in war service activities reported that well over half of
                    them wanted "adult" jobs, not believing their position was "big
                    enough." To improve the morale of youth, Professor Sherman prescribed factory or other
                    "real" work for part of the day, not the well-publicized play-acting chores like
                    scrap collecting. Participants at a conference on youth centers concluded that adolescents needed
                    recognition, for "the boy under 18 is apt to feel useless and unimportant because he is not
                    old enough to serve in the armed forces."35
            
            In some ways girls faced greater barriers to assuming adult roles. Although they matured earlier than
                    boys, they did not have the same opportunities for employment in industry. Nor did the armed forces
                    offer an equivalent route to adulthood. Their male contemporaries could anticipate adult status
                    almost overnight upon reaching age eighteen, but females could not enlist until age twenty. The
                    "manpower" shortage delayed marriage and motherhood for many. "It is the
                    young teeners who are feeling part of the burden of this war," said one girl. "Our
                    elders do not seem to realize it." Another girl lamented, "Being sixteen and
                    seventeen, we're considered too young for the armed forces and too young for work in war
                    factories…. If we go to college, the boys have only a short while, and after they leave,
                    the girls will feel very unimportant and unpatriotic spending money on schooling while their
                    comrades go to fight the war…." The result of such thinking, according to an
                    observer of youth in 1944, was that "numbers of our young girls

                            Progressive Education Association noted in 1942 that "children and youth have
                            suffered more from the frustration of not being invited to share in solving real problems
                            than from being overtaxed in working at them." High School Victory Corps and

                     today are suffering from a continual sense of frustration in

            At the root of the morale problem was the peculiar position adolescents held in American society.
                    Neither children nor adults, students who considered themselves mature and capable were frustrated
                    in being unable to make the contribution they wanted to make. For them it was not total war; society
                    frankly did not require their services until they reached an older age. As home front reservists
                    their addition to the war effort too often seemed to entail little more than mouthing patriotic
                    slogans. Until the day when they could join the armed forces or find a spot on an assembly line,
                    they were trapped in an age group that society had come to expect little of.37
                    The upshot was, in the words of the National Recreation Association, as if "history is
                    being made—and they are being left out."38
            
            A girl at Shortridge summarized the issue in a statement that attracted the interest of the local
                    press and that her school newspaper said voiced the "sentiment of high school girls
                    everywhere with respect to youth's philosophies." The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star said that she spoke for "thousands of teen-age American girls in
                    … appeal for understanding of their war viewpoint." In the opening line of her
                    statement she exclaimed, "you may think that a girl of 16 thinks about nothing but clothes,
                    dates and looks, and that what she has to say isn't of much importance anyway but
                    you're wrong. I have plenty to say, and I'm asking you to listen." An
                    emotional defense of young people ensued. She attempted to show that youth were as concerned with
                    and involved in the war as anyone, but through no fault of their own they could not contribute in
                    conventional ways. Not being able to fight, she said, was the most difficult actuality to face.

                     tomorrow." But still they craved to be involved in
                    some more immediate way. "We know we've got to do something; we know
                    we've got to go out there and help … or we'll go crazy but what can we
                        do?"39 It seemed silly to ask what one could do when surrounded by
                    feverish wartime activity. Still, the question had no answer.
            Youth who did little out of despair or lack of interest became the targets of student journalists who
                    harped to them about doing something for the war effort. "Wake up and do your
                    part!" rang the theme of many features in the high school press. But the articles and
                    editorials that tried to minimize the sense of uselessness often ended up having the opposite
                    effect. As one editor declared, "even the seemingly small part played by us students is
                    important in the winning of the struggle." Another taunted young people who tended not to
                    contribute at all because they thought their "small contribution" could be of no
                    help. While not questioning his peers' patriotism, still another writer chastised those who
                    too often neglected the "small duties," thinking them unimportant or expecting
                    other people to act. Students must have become weary of hearing that a war was on, and they must
                    have become bored and irritated with continual comments earnestly exhorting them to new standards of
                    dedication, when to many there seemed little worthwhile or noteworthy for them to do.40
            
            To counter perceptions among youth of the war as something of adult concern only, of themselves as
                    adrift in a society whose goals they did not share, it was important that they become aware of what
                    the conflict was about and what its implications might be for America. Although they wanted to
                    participate in a time of public excitement, this was not the same as understanding how great events
                    impinged on their lives. By and large the work of educating them in the origins and purposes of the
                    war, as opposed to encouraging an outpouring of patriotic fervor, appears to have been poorly
                    carried out. According to a report of the National Recreation Association, "We have taken
                    it for granted that the teenage understands as much about the war as we do—or that they
                    needn't be touched by it at all. There hasn't been much explaining, or tying it up
                    with what they have read about in their histories, or analyzing just what it means—why we
                    are fighting or what we are fighting

                    longer working hours, rationing, and various problems hounding them, they had little time or desire
                    to explain or discuss the conflict with youth.41
            
            Adolescents displayed little knowledge of world affairs. The Fortune poll disclosed
                    a dismal level of knowledge among them. It rated less than one in five well informed, with the rest
                    nearly divided between being poorly informed and simply uninformed. The amount of space high school
                    newspapers devoted to encouraging young people to learn about the war and current events reveals how
                    uninformed student journalists thought their peers were. Editors challenged students familiar with
                    Buck Rogers, Popeye, Li'l Abner, and Blondie to identify the

                            war and the conflicting statements about it as another principal reason for the low morale
                            he discovered.

            The relatively poor state of information raises the question of how much, and what, adolescents read.
                    The evidence suggests that they read little and that it was generally only material of a light sort.
                    Their chief stimulation seems to have come from movies, radio, and comic books. Not even books on
                    World War II appear to have had wide appeal. Although in 1943 the librarian at Arsenal claimed there
                    was demand for books with war themes, a student journalist making an informal survey of the student
                    body reported that few people were reading or had ever read a book on World War II. Magazines held
                    more attraction. Life was popular, as were the Saturday Evening Post,
                        Look, and Reader's Digest. Monthlies such as Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping attracted girls,
                    while Popular Mechanics and Popular Science found favor with
                    boys. The problem was that periodicals like these provided at most only peripheral insights into
                    current events.43
            
            Students apparently learned little more from newspapers. From research conducted in
                    "Elmtown" in 1941, August B. Hollingshead reported that most adolescents avidly
                    read the comics, boys the sports page, and girls the women's page and society column. They
                    only scanned the front page, however. Another study did show increased attention to war news and
                    headlines after Pearl Harbor, which is hardly surprising and not too significant when one considers
                    that few read war news before. The study concluded that in the war years adolescents'
                    favorite features of the newspapers remained, in order, photographs, comics, cartoons,
                    illustrations, sports, and movies. A poll at Arsenal in December, 1943, showed little interest in
                    newspapers beyond the comics and sports pages. Indeed, the students who did not read a newspaper at
                    all outnumbered those who claimed to take serious interest in the hard news it contained. Mulling
                    over the results of the survey a reporter could only feebly reply, "we should keep up with
                    the news of the day."44

            Most adolescents, it appears, simply had little interest in major questions of current affairs, other
                    than specific events associated with relatives or friends in the service. They ordinarily pulled out
                    maps to locate where battles had been fought or where relatives and friends were stationed.45 But, without belittling such interest, it is not the same as serious
                    attention to the reasons for the war, its impact on the country, and the nature of the postwar
                    world. Even as late as the week after the sinking of the Reuben James on October
                    30, 1941, Lee J. Cronbach, a psychologist who examined student morale and attitudes toward the war,
                    found many high school students in the state of 
                        Washington
                     unmindful of current affairs and the threat of imminent war. He asked them:
                    "If the 
                        United States
                     enters the war, how will your life be affected, both during the war and
                    permanently?" A typical response came from a girl who answered candidly, "Before
                    this question was asked of me I can honestly say that I had never thought about it, and I doubt
                    whether many other students had."46 Although data gathered from
                    students in 
                        Washington
                     does not necessarily apply to students in 
                        Indianapolis
                     or elsewhere, Cronbach's survey is all the more convincing because students in
                    a coastal state presumably would have been more aware of the possibility of war than, for example,
                    those in the Midwest. In spring, 1942, the editor at Shortridge expressed an all-too-common attitude
                    when he dismissed the need for understanding the background of the war, considering it "a
                    trivial matter," to be "treated insignificantly."47
            
            
               Seventeen magazine, a periodical aimed at teen-age girls, elicited at best a mixed
                    reaction when it began a monthly feature on world affairs. A characteristic response came from the
                    girl who wrote: "Why must you print articles on world affairs in a magazine that a girl
                    looks to for advice on clothes, charm and personality? I'm sure (and I'm speaking
                    for our gang) that when a girl feels like boning up on the brain food that she would turn to a
                    magazine devoted to politics and world affairs." Perhaps she had a point. But it is
                    difficult to imagine this girl taking the time to pore over news magazines and 
                  of the

                     listen to radio news broadcasts. While other responses endorsed
                    the feature, they often did so on the grounds that the magazine's readership was so
                    uninformed. "I think … that seven out of ten teen-age girls don't know
                    half as much as they should about world affairs," one girl remarked. "I very
                    seldom bother to read or even look at a news magazine…. Too many teenagers, like myself,
                    are wrapped up completely in their own teen-age world and know little or nothing of what goes on
                    outside of it."48
            
            As this statement implies, it is likely that the adolescent's place in the social structure
                    contributed to apathy. On the one hand, consciously or not, students may have excused their
                    ignorance as a result of their having little or no influence on national policy and community life;
                    to be told to wait for the future seemed scant compensation in a world shaken by war. On the other
                    hand, many adolescents of the early 1940s found increasing solace and pleasure in the vibrant social
                    life of their own peer culture.49 Moreover, peer pressure was not conducive to
                    reading. Hollingshead noted that "reading … is not an important trait in the
                    students' leisure hour activities. A youngster who is known as ‘a
                    reader’ … is left out of the group activities which form such an important
                    part of ‘life’ in this age group."50 Poorly
                    informed before the war, adolescents remained so after the fighting began.
            This situation in turn directly affected the outlook or morale of high school students.
                    Cronbach's investigations suggested that in all high schools a morale problem of various
                    degrees existed, which he attributed in part to the woeful lack of knowledge among students. He
                    found that ignorance led some to an unrealistically dire outlook, with attendant anxieties and
                    depression; on others it worked the opposite way, encouraging them to be complacent and overly
                    sanguine about the outcome of the war; still others were simply indifferent.51
                    Similar patterns emerged in the student press throughout the war. The three categories of morale
                    were not mutually exclusive; individuals shifted from one to another depending on

                            416–20. Two sociologists studying student morale also noted three types other
                            than the cheerful and confident: the depressed, the complacent, and the demoralized, with
                            the last being those who manifested delinquent and abnormal behavior. See Havighurst and

                     events or mood of the moment. Yet each response, together with
                    the absence of morale problems among some youth, was characteristic of the group during the war.
            Fear of economic depression, a fear shared by parents and politicians, accounted for much pessimism.
                    Before Pearl Harbor students worried about the economic consequences of military intervention.
                    Uncommon only because of its certitude was the following statement of a Manual student in spring,
                    1941: "All the bouyant heights of prosperity will deflate and once again depression will
                    hover over the nation…." When American involvement became a reality and the
                    economy failed to collapse, concern shifted to the state of postwar affairs. Another doomsayer at
                    Manual prophesied: "When the war is over … inevitable depression will again
                    cover the 
                        United States
                    ."52 Such dreary thoughts stimulated purchases of defense
                    bonds and stamps, which some students considered a prudent investment in light of the inevitable
                    crash. Their anxiety was not unique to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . A Purdue Opinion Panel survey in fall, 1943, showed that 54 percent of high school
                    students in the Midwest believed there would be high unemployment for at least a year or two after
                    the war. Only three in ten had no fears on this score. These misgivings did not diminish over time.
                    In December, 1945, 69 percent of the students polled believed the government would have to mount
                    depression-era programs to put people to work. With hard times still of such recent memory, the
                    thought that wartime prosperity might soon be lost haunted even young people.53
            
            The threat of material deprivation added to the pessimistic outlook. Wartime shortages came as a
                    "shock" to those students who did not understand the gravity of the situation.
                    Others were not surprised. Revealing neglect of the previous decade's economic history as
                    well as anxiety, one boy wrote in spring, 1942, "When we return to Shortridge next
                    September we will be in a far different world. The American standard of living will have been
                    arrested in its hitherto constant rise."54 This kind of baleful outlook
                    is easy to understand when one considers

                that many adults felt the same. In a book on civilian defense published in 1942, for
                    example, the authors predicted that "Inevitably the living standards of the people of the 
                        United States
                     will be reduced to levels below those of the worst depression years, in terms of
                    consumer goods." Enough people agreed to encourage hoarding and scare buying, tactics
                    hardly calculated to buoy youthful spirits. In August, 1941, an order from the Office of Production

                    Star reported that consumers were overrunning butcher shops. While no one actually
                    suffered want as a result of rationing, it became a serious matter to students, if for no other
                    reason than that it was a form of deprivation, which easily could have recalled memories of the
                    depression or raised the specter of approaching hard times.55

                     essays titled "What War Means to Me," written
                    by high school students in 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , uncovered large numbers of anxious
                    responses, especially regarding family disruptions. Following closely were concerns about the
                    sundering of romantic relationships. Cronbach discovered that a high proportion of students expected
                    to be killed in the service or have friends killed or wounded.56 Not long after
                    Pearl Harbor, "Gold Star" columns appeared in student papers listing the names of
                    alumni killed in the war. The columns reminded young people of what they feared might happen to
                    them, which in turn may have helped to encourage a carefree, live-for-today attitude. As one
                    adolescent confessed to a psychologist: "Knowing that I am going to war … I like
                    to get a little fun that can be still had before I go…. Many people think there will be
                    happiness after the war; I hope so, but I don't see how there can be, with all those that
                    will never come back and with all those that come back cripples…. So I figure the fun is
                    before you go…." A girl who had a brother in the service and another about to
                    leave said simply, "The war has left a big dent in my life."57
            
            Another problem was that the war made the future even more unpredictable for those already at a stage
                    of life normally beset with uncertainty and confusing questions about life goals. "Never in
                    recent years," wrote a Manual student in May, 1941, "has a senior class of any
                    high school had to face a future of greater uncertainty…." The temptation to
                    pursue the immediate rewards of the job market instead of college or preferred occupations proved
                    decisive to many of these last prewar high school graduates, who thought that defense-induced
                    affluence might be ephemeral. But Selective Service, soon to embrace eighteen-year-olds, complicated
                    any planning. Nearly three years later uncertainty remained a major theme, though by then large
                    draft calls usually presaged one's immediate

                     future. A Broad Ripple student reiterated that "war
                    times are definitely not those in which to lay plans for the future."58
            
            If one of youth's characteristic responses to uncertainty was pessimism, another was
                    indifference, which led to a lack of concern with the war effort. The number of articles on this
                    subject in the student press suggests that the viewpoint caused considerable self-consciousness.
                    Student writers went to some pains to deny what at times seemed altogether too manifest.
                    "Shortridge students are deeply concerned about the war," one declared.
                    "Adults are sometimes inclined to make superficial judgments about high school girls and
                    boys—that they are not serious but are too frivolous." More often they conceded
                    the merit of the criticisms and chided readers for their lackadaisical attitude and frivolity:
                    "Is the youth of today too happy? Is everything a joke? … Is
                    the youth of today too lazy? What do we need to awaken us? Do our homes have to be bombed before
                    we'll realize that now is the time to prepare?" Part of the problem was that most
                    students knew the chance of enemy bombs falling on them was remote.59 Early in
                    the war a student at Broad Ripple admitted that he and many peers had been "walking through
                    the halls with … our heads in the clouds, never giving much thought to the war going on
                    around us." Indifference angered commentators such as the one at Arsenal who wrote:
                    "Your reporter has been listening to some of the ‘war’ comments from
                    the younger generation … until she just cannot stand it any more. Such statements as,
                    ‘What has this war got to do with me?’ … just can't go
                    unchallenged." Even at the end of 1942, the worst year for the American cause, high school
                    papers revealed a surprisingly prevalent casual student attitude toward the conflict. "Are
                    we, as the future America, truly taking this thing seriously?" wrote one student.
                    "Have we actually gotten down to business? Or are we still the same pleasure-loving idlers
                    that we have often seemed to be."60

            Related to the above attitude was complacency, which held the danger of distracting youth from
                    concentrating on what they could do for the war effort. In this area, as in others, young people
                    often reflected the expectations of their elders. An informal survey in May, 1942, around Monument
                    Circle in downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                     revealed that more than half of those interviewed believed the war would end in the
                    coming winter or in the spring of 1943. Not all students, of course, were complacent. The Fortune poll of November, 1942, reported that over half believed the Axis had a
                    chance to win the war, although only 8.2 percent believed they had a good chance. The more informed
                    the student the more likely he or she was to believe the Axis had a chance to win. Confidence had
                    increased by 1943, when more than a third of the students questioned by Purdue pollsters believed
                    the war with 
                        Germany
                     would be over within the year. Such expectations might indicate healthy optimism to
                    some, but to others it more closely resembled smugness. One exasperated girl lectured her peers:
                    "All right, so you're tired of hearing about it. You're tired of having
                    your school paper all cluttered up with war editorials…. Somehow, most young folks have
                    gotten the idea that the war is just about over…. Can't you see how wrong this
                    idea is?"61
            
            Many people no doubt hoped the call to patriotism would blur distinctions among adolescent attitudes
                    and ease inconveniences on the home front. Student newspapers fed readers a steady diet of articles
                    on freedom and democracy and an ideology they fondly referred to as Americanism. Before the 
                        United States
                     entered the conflict numerous essays held forth on the special blessing in not having
                    to live in fear of being killed in battle or experiencing the destructiveness of war. This theme
                    would not do after Pearl Harbor. Then patriotism meant loving the flag, willingness to give
                    one's life for the country, doing as one was told at home and at school, and working in
                    assorted ways for the good of the country. A common device used to demonstrate how much Americans
                    had to be thankful for was to contrast the lives of American and German youth. The flag must be
                    revered because it stood for Americanism. Never adequately defined, Americanism apparently
                    encompassed such

                            that Americans, on average, consistently thought the war with 
                                Germany
                             would end in a year. Hadley Cantril, "Opinion Trends in World War II:

                     high ideals as freedom of speech and religion, as well as more
                    mundane pleasures like baseball, corner drugstores, and even the right to be lazy. For those finding
                    certain pleasures hard to dispense with, patriotism provided both rationale and consolation.62
            
            So insistent was this appeal that even before Pearl Harbor one boy felt compelled to complain that
                    love of country was being reduced to a version of hucksterism. "Our patriotic feelings are
                    in danger of becoming so over-commercialized and insincere," he warned, "that all
                    the good in it originally may disappear. An example of this is a fad to show patriotism by wearing
                    clothes and trinkets designed with the stars and stripes." But he was atypical at a time
                    when Americans, youth not excepted, vied to find words to express the glories of their land and
                    reflect the theme that America was better than other nations. "Thank God there is still an
                    America," one student wrote months before the end of the war, "for our country is
                    the hope of the world." And in the hands of Americans, particularly American youth,
                    "lies the hope of the world," because "European countries are old and
                    tired…. They need our help in reestablishing business and freedom. They look to you for
                    that." Perhaps one student reached the limits of patriotic fervor when he said that,
                    "today, there is a new name for America … that name is ‘America,
                    God's country’." Few of his countrymen would have disagreed with
                        him.63
            
            The dictates of age group behavior helped shape the responses of adolescents to war and their
                    experience on the home front, most notably their relative lack of involvement in the war effort.64 While the youth of 
                        London
                     and Leningrad would have envied such a plight, the lack of participation enhanced
                    problems of morale and thus the task of adjusting to the wartime environment. Since the invention of
                    adolescence in the early twentieth century, the social role imposed on this phase of life has
                    delayed the acceptance of young people into the main course of American life. In the 1940s it added
                    to youth's burden

                     of finding purpose in a society confronting a national
                    emergency. When the shadow of war fell upon the nation in the closing days of 1941, adolescents
                    found themselves in a safe stage of life, but one that offered relatively few opportunities for
                    contributing to society.
            One should not infer from the preceding discussion that age was the only factor influencing
                    individual response to the war, or that other social groups moved through the war years free of
                    cares. Rather, while this study recognizes that nearly all people shared such enthusiasms as that
                    for the material prosperity of the period and such anxieties as concern over relatives in the
                    military, it affirms that social groups also responded in more complicated ways depending on their
                    peculiar circumstances.65 The remarkable determination of Americans to bring the
                    Axis to their knees and the splendid patriotism that accompanied that resolve should not obscure the
                    more intricate responses of people to a popular war.

               "No Cheap Padding": Seventy-five Years of the Indiana Magazine of

            In 1905 a hesitant editor began a new historical journal. Uncertain of his success, unsure of his
                    finances, George S. Cottman paused only slightly, then pushed forward with resolution. The fruits of
                    that labor and birth are presented in this book, a celebration of seventy-five successful years. It
                    is a work that will delight and educate Hoosier and non-Hoosier alike.
            As with most works of this genre, "No Cheap Padding" is a
                    compilation of twenty-eight articles previously published in the Indiana Magazine of
                        History. They have been reset, and in some instances reedited, for this volume. But if
                    typical in those regards, the book is somewhat atypical in others. First of all, many such works are
                    organized either by subject matter—politics, agriculture, and the like—or by
                    chronology—the antebellum period, the "modern" era, etc. This book is
                    arranged instead by date of original publication of the article (with one strange
                    exception—the third article).
            The reason for such an arrangement is evident when the second unusual feature of this book is noted.
                    Unlike compilations that present themselves as the "best" articles from the
                    various journals involved, "No Cheap Padding," in Lorna Lutes
                    Sylvester's words, includes selections "meant to be representative of the
                    materials published in the magazine through the years" (p. xvii). In other words, this is
                    more a historical sample of the journal and its contents, and less a piecemeal history of the state.
                    Such an approach has both drawbacks and rewards, but, in this selection at least, the rewards
                    dominate.
            Indeed, Indiana history comes alive in this volume. Not only through the well-known
                    historians—John D. Barnhart, Paul W. Gates, Kenneth M. Stampp, Donald F. Carmony, Robert
                    W. Johannsen, Emma Lou Thornbrough, Reginald Horsman, Francis Paul Prucha, and others—but
                    also through writings of lesser-known and, on occasion, almost forgotten authors. Their topics range
                    widely, from flatboat building to fugitive slaves, from the Civil War to the 1916 Centennial, from
                    Indians to immigrants. They include documents, one extended book review, articles on local history,
                    studies of national scope, and reminiscences. In fact, of all the selections, my favorite  was the recollection of George W. Busbey, a retired army
                    officer. His few lines, for example, about the numerous meetings, picnics, and reunions that so
                    abounded in his youth include both wit and insight: "Upon these, a freeloader with a good
                    memory of blood and marriage lines, a fluent line of flattery, and unlimited gall, could subsist all
                    month without spending a cent or losing an ounce" (p. 435). Ah, for the good old days.
            This, then, was—and is—the Indiana Magazine of History, as
                    presented in this book. While a desperate editor has perhaps included some padding in his journal,
                    overall the magazine has remained faithful to its 1905 promise that "There will be no space
                    given to advertising ‘write-ups,’ and no cheap padding" (p. 2). In
                    fact, it has gone far beyond that, for its six previous editors and present one have combined to
                    make it today one of the most respected of state journals. This book serves as a proud tribute to
                    that worthy heritage.

               Local History Today: Papers Presented at Three 1979 Regional Workshops for Local
                        Historical Organizations in Indiana. By David J. Russo, Dorothy Weyer Creigh, Roger Fortin,
                    John J. Newman, and Pamela J. Bennett. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1980. Pp. viii, 100. Notes, tables, appendix. Paperbound,
                    $1.50.)
            The Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana Historical Bureau co-sponsored regional workshops for
                    historical societies and organizations in Indiana in two series, one in 1978–1979 and the
                    second in 1979. The first volume of Local History Today was published by the
                    Society in 1979 and contained papers presented at the four workshops in the first series. The second
                    volume, under consideration here, contains papers presented at the three workshops in the second
                    series (1979).
            Both series were prompted by the sponsors' desire to help local organizations upgrade
                    present programs in order to accomplish their common purpose, which is to study and promote local
                    and community history. The workshops were a combination of lectures, slide presentations, and
                    hands-on demonstrations, covering such topics as funding for local societies, conservation of museum
                    artifacts and library materials, oral history, historic preservation, publications, operating a
                    small museum, and several others. Each workshop contained a keynote address  that emphasized the need for local history and two or more papers that
                    clearly fell into the "nuts-and-bolts" or "how-to" category.
            The present volume contains three keynote lectures and two "how-to" lectures. David
                    J. Russo in "Some Impressions of the Non-academic Local Historians and Their
                    Writings" develops a profile of local historical writing. Briefly he introduces the
                    academic historian to the local field and deplores the possibility that the specialist will dominate
                    local historical scholarship. Roger Fortin in "Humanities and the Study of Local
                    History" presents guidelines to examining the American past. Dorothy Weyer Creigh in
                    "Writing Local History" belongs to the "how-to" category in that
                    she presents detailed instructions to local organizations interested in the publication of
                    periodicals and books.
            One real strength in this series is Indiana state archivist John J. Newman's "Using
                    County Records in Writing Your Community's History," which includes an extensive
                    chart indicating type of county record, dates issued, and valuable comments as to content. Another
                    strength is "Indiana's Historical Service, and Beyond," in which Pamela
                    J. Bennett of the Indiana Historical Bureau lists and discusses resources for local historical
                    societies. She includes names, addresses, and telephone numbers of organizations that can offer
                    support for programming and funds.
            The Indiana Historical Society is to be commended for issuing this publication. The last two papers
                    alone make it valuable to local history organizations.

            Who made the laws of Indiana? The 6,500 men and women who sat in the first one hundred General
                    Assemblies (1816 through 1978) have until now been anonymous—collectively far less well
                    known than the governors or congressmen. In 1976  the Indiana
                    legislature decided to review and evaluate in historical perspective its efforts and effects as an
                    institution. The purpose was not so much to create a memorial, although that goal could not have
                    been overlooked, as to strengthen and stimulate interest in the people's branch of
                    government.
            Senator Robert D. Garton, of 
                        Columbus
                    , the guiding force behind the project, argued correctly that the history of an
                    institution "is also the story of individuals—their actions and inactions,
                    causes and concerns, debates and defeats, values and visions" (p. v). The case for a
                    biographical compendium has never been better put. Very generously funded, guided by boards of
                    leading legislators and scholars, with access to superb research collections, the project promised
                    to be an outstanding historical enterprise. Furthermore, it had a good head start, since ninety
                    years ago William English had collected a large body of information on most nineteenth-century
                    legislators. The historical profession, with many highly trained, underemployed young scholars
                    available, had decades ago perfected the art of compiling succinct interpretive biographies. 
                        Wisconsin
                     had already published a model biographical dictionary.
            What went wrong? Why has such a grand project produced such an unsatisfactory first volume? (One or
                    two additional volumes of biography and narrative history are planned.) There may have been
                    administrative fiascoes and a crisis of leadership. Certainly there has been a failure to realize,
                    or even remotely come close to, Senator Garton's goals.
            Two approaches, the inside and the outside, were possible. Garton clearly preferred the former, in
                    which the contribution of each legislator would be assessed, or at least chronicled. Leaders would
                    be identified, advocates of various proposals would be credited with their work, showhorses and
                    workhorses would strut and heave. Unfortunately, there is absolutely none of this here. Presiding
                    officers are identified, but not other leaders or committee chairmen. Not a single quotation or
                    reference to issues, proposals, hearings, debates, votes, successes, or failures is provided. The
                    reader learns nothing about what the members ever did or thought while in office.
            The compilers (fifteen paid staff members are listed) opted instead for an
                    "outside" approach—that is, to describe what sort of person was elected
                    to the legislature. Unfortunately, the compilers' understanding of interesting
                    characteristics is incredibly narrow. For 3,500 men, readers are given name; dates of service;
                    district represented; relatives who also served; dates of birth, residence, and death; ethnicity;
                    religion; education;  party; military service; occupation;
                    marriage details; other offices held; and civic activities. Cryptic bibliographical references
                    complete the entry. Did no one display his wit or learning or understanding of the needs of his
                    constituency? Did no one harangue crowds, articulate issues, conjure up new projects, become
                    tarnished with scandal or defend the rights of the people? The historians who have sifted through
                    countless sources doubtless know more of this than anyone, but they do not tell. The outstanding
                    statesmen of Indiana receive the same treatment as the most obscure hacks—less, in fact,
                    since far more effort was needed to trace down the nonentities. Readers learn little about Indiana
                    politics and government.
            The "biographies" read like coded entries for a quantitative collective biography.
                    In fact, computer analysis has been attempted, but it is not reported here. Thorough statistical
                    profiles of twentieth-century Hoosier legislators, and of various nineteenth-century political
                    elites, have been in print for years. They prove quite conclusively that "outside"
                    approaches tell almost nothing about legislative behavior. It may be that the compilers either knew
                    nothing about politics or were so insecure that they slapped together the least
                    "controversial" information in the hope that somehow history would benefit.
                    "Much of the labor behind the present volume was devoted to gauging the reliability of
                    sources and the accuracy of information in order to eliminate as many errors as possible"
                    (p. xxxi). Alas, the one error that was not eliminated was disregard for the sponsors'
                    intention.

               Indiana's Citizen Soldiers: The Militia and National Guard in Indiana
                        History. Edited by William J. Watt and James R. H. Spears. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : The Indiana State Armory Board, 1980. Pp. vi, 232. Notes, illustrations, appendixes,
                    index. $5.00 plus postage.)
            The militia and National Guard form the oldest component of the American armed forces, they have
                    often been praised by analysts concerned about civil control of the military as fitting especially
                    well the military needs of a democracy, and they have played large and on the whole creditable roles
                    in every major American war before 
                        Vietnam
                    ; yet they have not fared  well in
                    historians' hands. The first systematic historian of American military policy, General
                    Emory Upton, in his late-nineteenth-century writings so strongly fastened upon subsequent works his
                    regular army bias against citizen-soldiers that many histories have done little more than echo him,
                    while writers seeking to vindicate the militia have tended to become excessively defensive special
                    pleaders.
            It is thus both remarkable and a hopeful sign of growing maturity in the study of American military
                    history that the Indiana State Armory Board should produce a book largely free of special pleading.
                    The writers, who blend in various measure historians' and citizen-soldiers'
                    credentials, have achieved a model for subsequent efforts in other states. They avoid Indiana as
                    well as National Guard parochialism; an opening chapter by Professor George W. Geib of 
                        Butler
                     University on "The Militia as a National Institution" sets the
                    Indiana experience into a national context with special thoroughness and detail, while all the
                    chapters continue to pay reasonable attention to what was going on outside Indiana. Meanwhile, a
                    detailed, unit-by-unit chronicle of the Indiana militia in every war and every noteworthy civil
                    disorder or natural disaster will not only enlighten any student of the history of the state but
                    will also offer useful suggestions to those concerned with American citizen-soldiers in general. The
                    specifics about how Indiana troops were mobilized for each war, for example, flesh out some rather
                    vague generalizations about militia mobilization that tend to recur in surveys of national military
                    history.
            Professor Geib and Captain William J. Watt, a National Guard public affairs officer and board member
                    of the Military History Section of the Indiana Historical Society, detail the beginnings of the
                    Indiana militia as a compulsory-service organization typical of the frontier era. Because the
                    population of Indiana remained small throughout the region's period of Indian wars, this
                    early Indiana militia mainly supplemented the regular army and other militia forces rather than
                    waging independent campaigns. With the end of the frontier era, genuine compulsory militia service
                    passed away in Indiana as elsewhere. After 1832 the state could no longer maintain the accurate
                    muster rolls required by law. Volunteer companies replaced in part the original "organized
                    militia." By the time of the Civil War, discussed by co-editor James R. H. Spears, a
                    lieutenant colonel of the Army Reserve whose activity in the Indiana Historical Society parallels
                    Watt's, Indiana had twenty or thirty militia companies, none of which received state arms
                         or funds. But after having seen these and a new crop of ad
                    hoc companies off to war, Indiana felt obliged, close as it was to the rebel border, to reorganize
                    an official though voluntary home guard militia during the Civil War. This organization, the Indiana
                    Legion, became the foundation on which a permanent reestablishment of an official state military
                    system was built after the war. The name Indiana Legion persisted until it formally became the
                    Indiana National Guard in 1895.
            In both factual coverage and sound, restrained interpretation this is an admirable volume.

                        North Carolina
                     Press, 1979. Pp. xviii, 247. Notes, index. $17.50.)
            According to Jeffrey Crow and Larry Tise, 
                        North Carolina
                     history has usually been studied simply "to shed new light on broad national
                    and regional problems" (p. xii) or to serve as an "antilogism to 
                        South Carolina
                    's erratic course and 
                        Virginia
                    's phlegmatic conservatism" (p. x). To correct this imbalance the
                    editors commissioned eight historians of 
                        North Carolina
                     "to explore the development of standard interpretations and the principal
                    themes" (p. xvi) emphasized in the major works, monographs, and articles focusing on the
                    state.
            William Powell opens the collection with an essay exploring the historical literature on colonial 
                        North Carolina
                    . In discussing the works in chronological order, he reveals little about their relative
                    merits or their relationship to major themes. Alan Watson's examination of revolutionary 
                        North Carolina
                     surpasses Powell's by organizing itself less around chronology and more around
                    the relative value of studies of the Revolution's origins and its institutional,
                    ideological, and military character. Robert Calhoon considers Tar Heel culture from 1790 to 1834. He
                    finds that earlier historians portrayed the state as "a pastoral, lethargic entity within a
                    buoyant, restless new nation" (p. 76). In contrast, studies in the last two decades have
                    revealed a society believing in "limitless possibility," experiencing
                    "unleashed emotions and energies," seeking "order and
                    predictability," and asserting "social control by the strong over the weak, the
                    many over the few, and especially whites over blacks" (pp. 80–81). Given
                    emigration from 
                        North Carolina
                    
                     to Indiana, Calhoon's essay is highly suggestive for
                    Hoosier historians; in fact, Calhoon calls for a study of the "living patterns" of
                    North Carolinians in Indiana (p. 109). Of similar high quality, Harry Watson's essay
                    emphasizes a paradox in Tar Heel history: the creation of democratic political procedures in 1835
                    followed by a non-democratic outcome in the form of the Civil War. Although the state's few
                    slaveholders succeeded in effecting secession, this action was "contrary to the interests
                    and … the wishes of a majority of the state's population" (p. 112).
                    Watson notes that historians' efforts to explain this discrepancy have not unearthed
                    subsuming causes, but he suggests possible answers in the works of George Fredrickson on racist
                    ideology and Eugene Genovese on class hegemony.
            Allen Trelease argues that "neo-Whig and Negrophobic attitudes have dominated" 
                        North Carolina
                    's literature on the Civil War and Reconstruction (p. xvi). Robert
                    Durden's examination of 
                        North Carolina
                     from 1877 to 1912 holds that the state's industrialization was
                    "Reconstruction that took" but that historians have hardly studied its influence
                    (p. 171). Sarah McCulloch Lemmon and H. G. Jones complete the volume by focusing on specialized
                    studies from 1913 to 1945 and from 1945 to 1976 respectively. They find the works limited either in
                    number or in analysis.
            In surveying 
                        North Carolina
                    's historical literature, these historians reach "an unexpected
                    consensus" that, paradoxically, the "monumental contributions" of their
                    predecessors in Tar Heel history "inhibited later historians from probing deeper or asking
                    different questions" (p. xvi). Clearly, a volume such as this one encourages historians to
                    consider their own assumptions and to raise new questions about 
                        North Carolina
                    —or state history in general.

                    index. $20.00.)
            According to historian Donald F. Tingley of Eastern 
                        Illinois
                     University, this examination of the 
                        Prairie
                     State's past should  result in an
                    understanding of "the way in which [
                        Illinois
                    ] society was structured" (p. 395). His work serves as a sequel to John H.
                    Reiser's Building for the Centuries, 1865 to 1898 and is part of a fresh
                    trilogy embracing the state's history since the Civil War.
            The volume is organized both chronologically and topically. Following a portrayal of the state circa
                    1900, chapter-length attention is accorded to developments in industry, land use (including mining
                    and oil), labor, and culture. In two separate chapters the author traces the swing of the political
                    pendulum from the modest progressivism of governors Charles Deneen, Edward F. Dunne, and Frank
                    Lowden to the "hogpen mores" of Len Small in the 1920s. A watershed within the
                    volume as well as in the state's history is World War I, with its emergency regimentation
                    and regulation climaxing first in the intolerance and bigotry of the Red Scare and then in the
                    materialism and nihilism of the 1920s. Additional focus centers upon shifts in the modes of
                    transportation, in the economic foundations, in the role and status of blacks, and in the facets of
                    popular culture. A two-page conclusion provides a pessimistic synthesis of three decades of
                    historical development.
            As a contribution to state and local history this effort provides excellent treatment of a key
                    midwestern state; it may be read with pleasure by laypersons, used with profit by professionals, and
                    consulted with ease by students. An especially strong feature is the use of vignettes of colorful
                    personalities and varied events which comprise the state's past. The research is based upon
                    extensive inquiry into contemporary documents and newspapers. The documentation is impressive and
                    the bibliography extensive. A picture portfolio facilitates the identification of heroes and
                    heroines.
            While the book has the above merits plus others, it also has its faults. The theme of
                    "structure" is handled descriptively rather than conceptually. Frequently
                    interpretive controversies among historians are summarized but not resolved by the author. The
                    attention given to transportation neglects the substantial developments relating to the 
                        Illinois
                     Waterway. Certainly any comprehensive bibliography of secondary sources should include
                    mention of the best current treatment,

                    typographical and mechanical errors for a work of this stature. Nevertheless, the  contribution overall represents a substantial improvement over its

            For several years persons interested in state and local history have pointed to the need for an
                    updated comprehensive treatment of the history of 
                        Michigan

                    The Nation" series, devoted almost all of its coverage to events prior to 1900. Although
                    beautifully written in a warm, personal style, it cannot serve as a textbook within the usual
                    meaning of that term. F. Clever Bald's

                        : A History of the Wolverine State, revised in 1970, are still acceptable in
                    many respects; however, more recent scholarship in areas like biography, economic development, and
                    the role of racial and nationality groups has contributed significantly to understanding 
                        Michigan
                     and deserves to be incorporated in any textbook adequate for today. We have more than
                    an adequate treatment now in George S. May's new revision of Willis Dunbar's 1970
                    volume.
            The late Willis Dunbar was, for many years, chairman of the history department at Western 
                        Michigan
                     University. His writings on 
                        Michigan
                     combined a skillful narrative style with a broad knowledge of most of the major themes
                    associated with the history of his state. He was particularly impressive in his discussion of 
                        Michigan
                     prior to statehood and in his treatment of developments in the arts, education, and
                    popular culture, areas not always given adequate coverage in textbooks on state history. May wisely
                    retains Dunbar's general approach to those subjects, an approach which remains one of the
                    major strengths of the book. May has reworked, however, the section on twentieth-century 
                        Michigan
                    , and in the process he provides a much clearer chronological interpretation of
                    political party developments in that period as well as a more detailed picture  of 
                        Michigan
                    's vital automobile industry, an industry which has drawn important attention
                    from several scholars during the past decade, including May himself. Readers should also be
                    impressed with May's efforts to stay abreast of very recent developments in social history
                    (schismatic problems in today's Episcopal church, for example) as well as in business
                    history (the automobile industry's problems in the late 1970s) and to incorporate those
                    trends and events in the book. However, those who are interested in the state's political
                    history may wonder why Senator Homer Ferguson is barely mentioned and why Grand Rapids'
                    colorful and powerful Republican leader, "Boss" Frank McKay, is left out entirely.
                    Some readers, at least, will be pleasantly surprised to encounter footnotes and a bibliographic
                    essay at the end, in lieu of the list of sources that sufficed for the 1970 volume. Finally, this
                    reviewer would suggest the following corrections in an otherwise excellent book:
                    "blacks" rather than "Negroes" should be the index entry;
                    Cardinal John Dearden's name is spelled incorrectly on pages 680 and 793; and Studebakers
                    were not dropped in 1963, as stated on page 625, but rather continued to be sold in the
                    "Lark" model at least until 1966.

                     sources, index. $13.50.)
            In this tightly written book, John C. Schneider emphasizes spatial over ethno-social causes for both
                    the breakdown and the restoration of order in a nineteenth-century city. Schneider says that the
                    rapid expansion of early 
                        Detroit
                     temporarily created "battle zones" where ethnic and moral interests
                    clashed but that soon the development of residential segregation by class, ethnicity, and race
                    eliminated most opportunities for such conflicts. In his view, public concern over disorder was
                    shaped primarily by another kind of segregation in downtown 
                        Detroit
                     where, to accommodate the many single men attracted to the booming city, there
                    developed a transient area favorable to vice and crime. The proximity of this area to downtown
                    business directly threatened the city's business elite, who resided in their own segregated
                    zone near downtown, but the clear-cut character of this threat also enabled the elite to devise an
                         effective response to it in the form of a professional
                    police force, the 
                        Detroit
                     Metropolitan Police. Insulated by a state-appointed commission from the political
                    influences that complicated policing in many other cities, the new force dealt effectively with the
                    problem of crime as defined by wealthy reformers. Acting on the premise that crime stemmed chiefly
                    from the transient population, the police concentrated their efforts downtown and, with a heavy
                    hand, were able to control the criminal element located there. Thus, the combination of residential
                    segregation and efficient police work restored order to 
                        Detroit
                     by 1880.
            Schneider's thesis can be applied, with appropriate modifications, to other cities such as 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Supported as it is by a wise use of city directories and censuses as well as more
                    traditional sources, the thesis makes sense. It is, however, a narrow sense, achieved by
                    undervaluing non-spatial influences for disorder and order during the fifty years under study.
                    Education and temperance, for example, are slighted, as are such other factors as changing patterns
                    of immigration and of social mobility: the entry of German and Irish immigrants coincided with the
                    period of greatest disorder, while the more orderly 1870s saw a significant increase in the
                    proportion of professionals, proprietors, and other order-disposed components of 
                        Detroit
                    's labor force. Schneider thus gives partial rather than definitive
                    explanations. By providing a convincing demonstration of the influence of spatial arrangements on
                    crime, riot, and policing, however, he has made a valuable contribution to the lengthening bookshelf
                    labeled "the new urban history."

               Savagism and Civility: Indians and Englishmen in Colonial 
                            Virginia
                        . By Bernard W. Sheehan. (

               Savagism and Civility is an intellectually deterministic work. Sheehan's
                    thesis is that a mythology contrasting savage and civil society determined the actions of English
                    colonists toward the 
                        Virginia
                     Indians, leading inevitably to violence between the races. Even when reality
                    contradicted myth, the myth prevented colonists from perceiving the truth.
            The book falls neatly into two sections, the first part defining the myth, the second interpreting
                    events in 
                        Virginia
                     in the context of this myth. Savagism had a well-developed, paradoxical  meaning in the western world. A savage was immature, bestial, lacking
                    in control and foresight, living without order or religion. Yet savages also were the inheritors of
                    paradise, innocent, uncorrupted, enjoyers of a world uncluttered by civilization.
            For colonists the dark side of this myth dominated, leading them to see no order, religion, or
                    rationality in Indian life and to expect that Indians would be improvident and vicious. Colonists
                    thus coerced food from the Indians, viewing Indian refusals as hostility and the later starvation of
                    the tribe as confirmation that Indians lacked foresight and planning. Similarly, the colonial
                    response to Indian religion was to order the killing of religious leaders because they were
                    irrational barriers to conversion to civility. Likewise the English considered whites who
                    "deserted" to the Indians as traitors to rationality and civility. At the same
                    time, the English feared the attraction of savage freedom.
            Sheehan insists that the massacre of 1622 was not a turning point in Indian-white relations. Whites
                    were already convinced that savages were treacherous and that their duty to
                    "civilize" the savages did not preclude salvation by force. The author argues that
                    policy was violent from the beginning and did not shift until 1700, when Indian culture was
                    thoroughly demoralized.
            While the thesis is highly intriguing and does provide new insight into cultural conflict, including
                    the importance of sex roles to the debate, several weak points remain. Firstly, the book
                    demonstrates that intellectuals contrasted savagism and civility but not that the distinction
                    reached into popular culture. Yet Sheehan assumes that ordinary settlers in 
                        Virginia
                     thought in these patterns. Secondly, Sheehan makes questionable use of some materials.
                    If 
                        Virginia
                     sources are weak, he substitutes evidence from other parts of the new world. He also
                    fits his information to his thesis; for example, he maximizes the number of runaways among the 120
                    new settler casualties in 1621 in order to emphasize the threat of savagism to English civility.
                    Mortality rates would suggest otherwise.
            On the whole this little volume is provocative, but not definitive, and the author's
                    interpretation of the Indian massacre is sure to elicit comment from scholars who see the massacre
                    as a turning point. Provoking discussion is no small accomplishment.

            The American abolitionists, who so ardently believed in freedom, have themselves now been liberated
                    from their over-identification by historians with the internal dilemmas and tactical and ideological
                    disputes of the civil rights reformers of the 1960s. Lewis Perry and Michael Fellman are correct in
                    their introductory comment that "if ever a decade and an historical subject were meant for
                    each other, they were the 1960s and abolitionism." But however appealing this match has
                    been, it is time that both partners be understood in their own right and in the context of their own
                    times.
            This superb collection of fourteen original essays does just that. The antislavery movement is seen
                    here against the larger backdrop of its age: religious revivalism, Jacksonian politics, law,
                    literature and fugitive slaves, the northern competitive labor market, the black church, antislavery
                    in 
                        Ireland
                     and 
                        Scotland
                    , and the intellectual and popular "collisions" between proslavery and
                    antislavery forces in the 1850s. The variety of methodological lenses used in studying abolitionism,
                    as well as the scope, is widened by these essays, which reflect quantitative techniques, the new
                    political history, feminist and black perspectives, and other developments of the past decade. If
                    there is a somewhat consistent point of view in this eclectic collection, it is a preference for
                    cultural rather than economic analysis.
            The new approaches and fresh perspectives are represented generally at their best. There are two
                    excellent studies of the "connections" between feminism and abolitionism. In one,
                    Ellen Du Bois argues that feminist consciousness, if not strategies for change, preceded the
                    Garrisonian relationship; in the other, Blanche Glassman Hersh shows how feminist abolitionists like
                    Abby Kelly and Lucretia Mott set model examples "for a new type of woman who was both a
                    private and a public person." There is a compelling and sensitively written essay by James
                    B. Stewart on the way in which Wendell Phillips' need to balance intellectual control and
                    emotional impulsiveness in his own life, in part because of marriage to an invalid, was reflected in
                    his vision of heroes (Elijah Lovejoy, John Brown, and Edmund Burke!) and villains (Daniel Webster,
                    slaveholders, and French revolutionists!). And to mention just two others, Leonard Richards writes a
                    convincing indictment of the Jacksonians  as pro-southern and
                    anti-black, and Michael Fellman offers a captivating study of the popular images that northern and
                    southern settlers in 
                        Kansas
                     had of each other (subhuman "Pukes" and
                    "nigger-stealing" Yankees) and of themselves (chosen saviors of 
                        Puritan
                     morality and Constitutional order).
            Obviously a collection like this is bound to be uneven. Ronald Walters' opening essay on the
                    "Boundaries of Abolitionism" is so brilliantly wide-ranging and concerned with
                    establishing continuities that one is left with virtually no boundaries at all. Donald
                    Scott's essay on "Abolition as a Sacred Vocation" suffers from too much
                    religious analysis and not enough examples of sacred vocations. Alan Kraut's noble attempt
                    to rescue the reputation of the Liberty party fails through an excess of methodological zeal. His
                    social profile is based upon insufficient quantitative data and is internally contradictory.
            Overall, however, Antislavery Reconsidered admirably succeeds, as Perry and Fellman
                    hoped, in treating abolitionsim as "an historical subject" and
                    not for "its resemblance … to modern movements." Our knowledge and
                    insights are enhanced not just about antislavery but about a fascinating and wide variety of
                    intellectual, cultural, and social phenomena in antebellum American life. Any connections to the
                    1960s are left to the interpretive imagination of the reader. (And they are there.)

               The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War. By Kenneth M.

                     University Press, 1980. Pp. xv, 320. Notes, index. $15.95.)
            Kenneth M. Stampp, whom students of Indiana history will recognize as the author of an early study of
                    Hoosier politics during the Civil War, has compiled a volume of eight interpretive essays, six of
                    which have previously appeared in print between 1945 and 1978. Organized under four basic headings,
                    each comprised of from one to three chapters, these pieces focus upon the issues central to the
                    antebellum and Civil War years: the nature of the federal union, the effects of slavery upon its
                    immediate victims, the birth of the Republican party, Lincoln's presidential nomination and
                    his subsequent role during the secession crisis, the North-South dichotomy, the defeat of the
                    Confederacy.
            
            Because only Chapter IV ("Race, Slavery and the Republican Party of the 1850's") and Chapter
                    VII ("The Irrepressible Conflict") are here published for the first time, the remaining six essays
                    restate and reiterate previously held views and, thus, offer little that is new to scholars. To be
                    sure, however, these essays have been revised and refined in the light of new and additional
                    scholarship since their original publication.
            Whether in book or article form, Stampp's scholarship has stimulated critical response. The Imperiled Union will undoubtedly also generate further critical discussion. He
                    strongly castigates, for example, Stanley Elkins' Slavery as well as
                    Robert Fogel's and Stanley Engerman's Time on the Cross. In
                    fact, he rather convincingly demolishes their hypotheses, assertions, and conclusions, all of which
                    should provoke further rebuttal. Again, in "The Southern Road to 
                        Appomattox
                    " (Chapter VIII), Stampp argues, not very persuasively, that many southerners
                    were not averse to a Union victory over the Confederacy. Finally, in "The Irrepressible
                    Conflict," he offers again quite convincingly, the view that the antislavery movement and
                    the proslavery response each produced their own internal dynamics which made for an irrepressible
                    conflict during the antebellum era.
            
               The Imperiled Union is highly interpretive, strongly historiographical, and an
                    interesting and worthwhile addition to the existing literature. Only two lapses in proofreading are
                    discernible: "patry" for "party" (p. 107) and
                    "stiring" for "stirring" (p. 194). Somewhat puzzling is
                    Stampp's failure to cite Herbert Gutman's Slavery and the Numbers
                        Game anywhere in Chapter III ("Time on the Cross") or in its notes. One caveat should be added: Stampp's excellent craftsmanship and fine literary style may
                    well mesmerize the unsuspecting or incautious reader to concur with his views, which have been
                    brilliantly argued. In any case, this volume will provide several hours of delightful, stimulating,
                    and rewarding reading.

            Kentuckians have always believed that they were Americans sui generis. Spawned from 
                        Virginia
                    , descended from  Scotch-Irish folk, and proud of
                    their trans-Allegheny origins, residents of the Commonwealth recognize fully their unique
                    geographical position just below Mason and Dixon's line. Although the state remained in the
                    Union during the Civil War, Kentuckians were divided deeply over the secession crisis. Writing in
                    1860, Philip Lightfoot Lee of Bullitt County best represented 
                        Kentucky
                     sentiment. Lee avowed his allegiance to his hearth and home. Should the South secede,
                    Lee said, he would support 
                        Kentucky
                    . Should 
                        Kentucky
                     fall, then Lee would defend Bullitt County. If Bullitt County dissolved, Lee proclaimed
                    his allegiance to Shepherdsville, his hometown. Should Shepherdsville fall, then Lee would defend
                    his side of the street. Kentuckians were and are unique.
            In this engaging volume William C. Davis chronicles the Civil War experiences of an extraordinary
                    band of Kentuckians—the First 
                        Kentucky
                     Brigade. Independent and resourceful, these sons of the Commonwealth cast their lot not
                    with the North, but with the Confederacy. They served with distinction in some of the fiercest
                    fighting of the war—at 
                        Shiloh
                    , Stone's River, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, 
                        Atlanta
                    , and finally, in the Carolinas Campaign of 1865. Because they were removed from 
                        Kentucky
                     throughout most of the war, these expatriates later were dubbed "The Orphan
                    Brigade." Their heroism earned for them a reputation not only among Kentuckians but
                    throughout the Confederacy as well. Proud of their accomplishments, members of the First 
                        Kentucky
                     Brigade possessed a remarkable esprit de corps. Recollecting this sense of comradeship,
                    brigade captain and historian Ed Porter Thompson recalled proudly that his unit had "a kind
                    of title of nobility" (p. xv).
            Pride was the common denominator for members of the First 
                        Kentucky
                    . While General John C. Breckinridge is perhaps the best-known member of this unit,
                    Davis probes the wartime experiences of a variety of other men, many of whom were observing the
                    carnage of war for the first time. He views combat, disease, and fatigue duty through the prism of
                    the common soldier. Readers learn of Johnny Green and John Jackman, of Ed Bishop and Leander
                    Applegate. They follow them not only in battle but also constructing rude fireplaces of sod in their
                    tents and celebrating in camp with a barrel of "
                        Kentucky
                     shuck." Although disciplined fighting men, these Kentuckians refused to bow to
                    an abusive superior officer. In one episode a captain demanded that a private sweep his tent for
                    him. Responding promptly, the enlisted man informed the officer that he might "go to
                    hell" (p. 54).
            
            Davis is the author of four other books on the Civil War, and he narrates the marches and battles of
                    the First 
                        Kentucky
                     with the charm and grace of a seasoned hand. He relies heavily on an invaluable
                    collection of the Orphan Brigade's official papers now housed in the National Archives.
                    Davis also draws frequently upon Captain Thompson's excellent History of the
                        First

                    open to debate, few will question the valor of the Orphan Brigade or the quality of this superb unit

               The Development of American Agriculture: A Historical Analysis. By Willard W.

            Willard W. Cochrane is an agricultural economist who, in addition to having served many years as a
                    college teacher, has been an agricultural policy adviser to presidents since the days of Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt. He has also written extensively on a variety of topics related to his field. For all
                    these reasons, any assessment he makes concerning the development of American agriculture is likely
                    to be of some value.
            Although billed as a historical analysis, the work is long on analysis and short on history. The
                    discussion of events up to 1900 comprises only the first third of the book and is somewhat facilely
                    done. The narrative here is written in a straightforward, textbook-like manner, and it contributes
                    little new information. References to events indirectly related to the development of agriculture,
                    such as changes in attitudes toward slavery in the territories between 1820 and 1860, are often
                    hasty and the explanations sometimes simplistic.
            The valuable material in this book is to be found in the last two-thirds of the text. Dealing with
                    the area of his expertise, Cochrane explores and assesses developments in American agriculture in
                    the twentieth century. With the use of models, charts, and graphs, he also evaluates the effects of
                    current and possible trends in the field.
            
            Cochrane argues effectively that beginning in the 1920s the adoption of new technologies tremendously
                    improved the productivity of American farmland. His analysis indicates, however, that such growth
                    has begun to level off and that perhaps farmers will have to adopt new techniques to increase
                    production in order to maintain present profit levels.
            The author's second major topic in his discussion of modern American agriculture concerns
                    the results of the government's farm policy beginning in the 1930s. Although Congress has
                    increasingly reacted to farmers' demands by passing bills providing such aids as price
                    supports and production controls, these programs have not, says Cochrane, solved the
                    farmers' problems. They have only changed the characteristics of those problems. Rising
                    costs and indebtedness have not been eliminated; in general, expenses have increased to the point
                    where a farmer needs more capital than ever before. One of the related but unpredicted effects of
                    federal legislation in the past twenty-five years has been the consolidation of farmland into fewer,
                    larger operations at the expense of the small, family-owned unit.
            Cochrane does not make predictions for the future of American agriculture, but he provides much
                    valuable information about the past, as well as models to be used in evaluating current trends. The
                    book as a whole is interesting reading and should prove a helpful resource for those concerned with
                    the evolution of American agriculture and government farm policy.

               The Peace Reform in American History. By Charles DeBenedetti. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1980. Pp. xvii, 245. Bibliographical essay, notes, index.
                    $18.50.)
            "There is no reform that Americans have talked of more and done less about than that of
                    world peace," states Charles DeBenedetti in his new book on peace reform (p. xi). Indeed,
                    it is an appropriate statement when one considers the past violence and wars of America, a nation
                    that professes adherence to Christian ideals of love and peace.
            The purpose of this book is to survey the history of the peace movement. It is not based on primary
                    documentation but is a smooth synthesis of existing scholarly writing. DeBenedetti defines the peace
                    movement as either an attempt to form ideal  communities that
                    serve as models or as organizations that try to reform society. He has approached the topic by
                    dividing the past into eight chapters: the colonial years, in which he discusses European heritage
                    and sectarian groups; the period 1763 to 1815, when the movement was influenced by the revolutionary
                    spirit; the humanitarian era, which was part of the romantic antebellum reforms; the cosmopolitan
                    period after the Civil War and until the end of the century, when the movement increased Anglo-Saxon
                    ties and accepted Social Darwinism; the progressive years, labeled by the author as the birth of the
                    modern peace reform movement; the period between the world wars, when the movement was divided about
                    America's role in the world; the 1940s and 1950s, when anti-Nazi and anti-Communist
                    feelings became more important than peace; and, finally, the youth causes of the 1960s and early
                    1970s, which stimulated new organizations concerned about peace.
            Broad in scope, the book examines a myriad of topics and arrives at a number of conclusions.
                    DeBenedetti states that the movement remained modest in size and limited in effectiveness, that it
                    generated its greatest appeal among professionals and educators with a Christian conscience, and
                    that it was located in the metropolitan northeast, with some more recent participation in cities of
                    the upper Midwest and west coast. Yet overall, "organized peace seeking has never succeeded
                    as a movement in penetrating the dense layers of American society" (p. 199). The author
                    concludes that the reason for failure is that the movement was a subculture opposed to the dominant
                    values and power structure in America.
            Although dealing with the peace movement as a national issue, DeBenedetti also discusses a few
                    relevant Hoosiers, such as Eugene Debs, who was in opposition to the Great War, and Louis Ludlow,
                    the congressman of the 1930s who attempted to amend the Constitution so that a national referendum
                    would be required before Congress could declare war. The proposal brought chills to President
                    Franklin Roosevelt and was defeated, never reaching the states for ratification.
            DeBenedetti has written a fine book. He relates the peace movements to the general social trends of
                    each era. His chapters are logical, the writing precise and literate, making the book a pleasure to
                    read. Perhaps the only demerit demonstrates the writer's merits—one wishes the
                    book was longer and more comprehensive. For example, most readers will demand more than just a few
                    pages on all the anti-war protests of the 
                        Vietnam
                    
                     era. Nevertheless, the author of The Origins of
                        the Modern American Peace Movement, 1915–29 has succeeded in writing a very good
                    survey of the Peace Reform in American History.

               The Communist Party and the Auto Workers Unions. By Roger Keeran. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1980. Pp. x, 340. Notes, index. $22.50.)
            Roger Keeran's solidly researched book moves the quarter-century debate over the role that
                    Communists played in the organization and early years of the United Automobile Workers to a more
                    fruitful and politically meaningful level. Along with Bert Cochran, but in greater detail, Keeran
                    demonstrates the extent to which the very formation of a strong and permanent industrial union in
                    the automobile industry depended upon the dedication of a cadre of individuals whose own social
                    vision far transcended the union movement itself. Relying on internal party documents, numerous oral
                    interviews, and a wide range of labor archives, Keeran clearly demonstrates that Communist activity
                    in the automotive industry provided an unbroken link between the revolutionary dual unionism of the
                    late 1920s, the American Federation of Labor federal locals of the mid-1930s, and many of the
                    strongest UAW locals thereafter. In this context Communists easily moved into influential posts as
                    the UAW grew in size and strength. As Keeran emphasizes, their "legitimacy" as
                    trade-union militants in the UAW arose out of their day-to-day work in building the union itself.
            The author devotes the latter half of his book to answering the question: why did the Communists fail
                    to hold the strength that they had built in the 1930s? Keeran's analytical framework in
                    answering this query runs largely parallel to that of the Communist party itself,
                    and he argues that party influence waxed and waned for a multitude of reasons, not all of which were
                    directly related to developments on the world scene or the party line. In keeping with the postwar
                    Communist critique of its wartime activities under the leadership of Earl Browder, Keeran believes
                    that the party failed to take advantage of the favorable conditions that existed in the first half
                    of the 1940s. Communists relied too heavily upon alliances with friendly, sometimes opportunistic,
                    nonparty union officials, while its wartime defense of the no-strike pledge seriously eroded
                    Communist support among many rank-and-filers. Keeran argues, 
                    however, that the decline of Communist strength in the UAW came primarily as a result of their
                    inability to resist the anti-Communist onslaught unleashed in the early Cold War years. In a
                    blistering final chapter, "Reuther and Reaction," Keeran indicts the new UAW
                    president as responsible for setting the pattern for the liberal anti-Communist purge that swept
                    major unions in the early Cold War years.
            Keeran's history sometimes reads like a legal brief, relentlessly defending the role played
                    by the Communists in the internal union struggles of the 1930s and 1940s. Though often a good
                    technical defense, his argument does little to put the UAW Communists in a broader intellectual or
                    social context. From his perspective the Communists were the rightful heirs of the American
                    socialist tradition, and their vociferous defense of the Soviet regime in the 1930s and 1940s proved
                    merely the necessary education of the American working class in "socialist
                    internationalism." At the same time Keeran's narrow political defense of the party
                    suffers from the same disabilities that are common to all union histories focused on the relatively
                    narrow world of leadership competition and ideological conflict. The social history of the
                    automobile workers, and that of the thin but important stratum who cast their lot with the
                    Communists, is largely absent from his book. What kind of automobile workers joined the party; what
                    factors explain the variations in Communist support among the local members, regions, and ethnic
                    groups; what meaning did their Communist experience have for those thousands of workers who passed
                    through party ranks? Keeran offers tantalizing references to some of these issues, but his book
                    contains no systematic search for the answers.

            Today's flourishing genealogical market offers hundreds of manuals to assist persons
                    researching family roots. A classic  guidebook is Gilbert H.
                    Doane's Searching for Your Ancestors, originally published in 1937 during
                    another era of intense interest in lineages. Doane, editor emeritus of the New 
                            England
                         Historical and Genealogical Register, is joined in this fifth revision by
                    James B. Bell, director of the New 
                        England
                     Historic Genealogical Society.
            The authors narrate a brisk step-by-step introduction to the genealogical task, punctuated with
                    problem-solving illustrations and, not least, tips on the diplomatic handling of relatives and
                    records clerks. Twelve chapters furnish the basics, from equipment to final product arrangement. Not
                    overlooked in detailing the value of family papers and government documents are clue-bearing
                    samplers, friendship quilts, engraved silver, school censuses, and lawsuits. The
                    investigator's obligation to establish the accuracy of sources is stressed as is the need
                    to go beyond names and dates to portray the public and private dimensions of the subjects.
            A recognition of genealogy's evolving mass appeal underlies the new material on thirty-five
                    ethnic and nationality groups in Part II. Appendixes provide a bibliography and particulars on the
                    state offices of vital statistics, the National Archives and its Record Service Centers, and census
                    data.
            James B. Bell's Family History Record Book is advertised as a companion
                    volume. Essentially a workbook, it contains a brief review of the genealogical process along with
                    instructions for completing eight enclosed charts and forms. The forms, in multiple copies,
                    detachable and punched for binders, cover the group chart, family and individual biographies, and
                    census, military, immigrant, naturalization, and land records.
            Together, the books offer a modern (the chapter in previous editions of Doane's book on
                    gaining admission to the Daughters of the American Revolution is deleted) and affordable reference
                    and record-keeping system. Though addressed to the novice, the experienced genealogist and the
                    historian, who often seek the same sources, should find the reading profitable.

            The American Association for State and Local History has published a number of highly useful guides
                    intended to help small historical museums, historic preservationists, and others with frequently
                    encountered problems. There is surely a need for guides to the preservation and restoration of log
                    structures, for many such buildings are owned by institutions and individuals. This present booklet,
                    unlike most others by the AASLH, is unfortunately not entirely useful and may in some cases be
                    harmful.
            The problems with the book arise from two erroneous assumptions. One is that log construction is
                    essentially the same everywhere in the 
                        United States
                    , and the second is that early log buildings are essentially the same as
                    twentieth-century log vacation homes and rustic retreats. The techniques of preservation and
                    restoration the authors recommend are appropriate to twentieth-century log structures built in the
                    western 
                        United States
                    . They are sometimes inappropriate or misleading for early log structures of the eastern 
                        United States
                    .
            If a log building has stood in good condition for at least 150 years, it is a mistake to believe that
                    modern materials and techniques of construction are better and should be used in repair and
                    restoration. For example, when log houses in Indiana were built in the last century, the builders
                    used roof decking (boards nailed atop the rafters to which the shingles then were nailed) consisting
                    of boards with spaces between them. When the shingles were saturated with rain water, air could get
                    to the underside of the shingles to dry them out. The authors of this book, however, recommend using
                    plywood roof decking, and plywood will keep air from reaching the underside of the shingles. This
                    will hasten decay of the shingles and perhaps result in other damage. If one is working with
                    traditional architecture, one should stick with traditional, time-tested materials and techniques.
                    The old-time craftsmen who built the structures knew what they were doing, and we should try to
                    learn from them today. Harrison Goodall and Renee Friedman have not recommended this approach,
                    probably because they have dealt mostly with modern log buildings.
