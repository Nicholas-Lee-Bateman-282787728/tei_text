                <p><hi>THIS</hi> work is the result of a real experience within the unseen prison
                    world. It contains no element of fiction from beginning to end: it tells, as
                    clearly and accurately as may be, the true histories of some who have lived and
                    suffered and died in that hidden region of remorse and pain. Where the actual
                    words they have used have not been quite distinctly remembered, the substance of
                    their meaning has been given as plainly as possible. Whether the deductions we
                    have drawn from these cases are correct or not, the facts themselves speak with
                    the voice of truth; and we claim for that voice that it has a right to be heard
                    by all who desire to help and benefit their fellowâcreatures. There are many
                    such, happily, in these<pb n="x" xml:id="VAB7158-005"></pb> days; but it may be said
                    that among the seething masses of the poor within our crowded cities, in the
                    workhouses, and hospitals, there is misery and anguish enough to exhaust all
                    philanthropic energies, without seeking an aliment for them in the storehouses
                    of criminals.</p>
                <p>It is in the hope that we may be able to create a different impression by our
                    Scenes from the Silent World, that we have brought them forth from their
                    wellâregulated obscurity.</p>
                <p>If in all the distress and grief we see around us, that which is the most
                    exceptionally bitter and hopeless has the greatest right to our sympathy and
                    assistance, we may well claim it for the mournful wreckage of human life which
                    is cast up on the gloomy prison strand from the ocean of this worldâs boundless
                    suffering. There are elements in the agony of life as it is meted out to the
                    inmates of a prison which have no place in the sorrows, cruel as they often are,
                    of the poor and helpless without its walls. First and direst of the evils that
                    weigh like a curse on the prisonerâs existence, is the brand of crime,<pb n="xi" xml:id="VAB7158-006"></pb> stamped on his inmost soul, no less than on his outer
                    life, and all the more torturing that it is selfâcreated. Is there any
                    misfortune or trial, however heavy, which a man may not bear with serene
                    courage, when he can hold his head erect in selfârespect before his fellowâmen,
                    and with clear conscience look up to the free heavens and trust that they may
                    yet smile on him with the sunshine of the love of God? But the blackness of the
                    shadow which hangs for ever over the convicted criminal is that of a despair
                    which seems to him irremediable both here and hereafter. Never while his mortal
                    life lasts can the dark stain of his iniquity be hidden any more from the open
                    gaze of his fellowâcreatures; and he dares not hope that it can ever be effaced
                    before the eyes of the Eternal Justice, if his mind be capable of imaging a life
                    beyond the grave. Shame and disgrace will follow him when he passes through the
                    prison gates. âJailâbird,â âfelon,â âconvict,ââthese are the epithets he will
                    read in every look that meets him, if even he does not hear them loudly hurled
                    at him. No man<pb n="xii" xml:id="VAB7158-007"></pb> will trust him; none will have
                    any dealings with him; he will be shunned by all: no honest employment will come
                    within his reach; he must starve, or sin again to win a morsel of bread. Would
                    that any words of ours could adequately reveal the depth and extent of a
                    prisonerâs utter hopelessness! Despairing of life, despairing of death, which he
                    believes can lead to no heaven of hope for him,âdoes the world contain a more
                    helplessly forlorn and desolate being than the guiltâconvicted criminal? Does
                    his anguish lack yet one sting?âit is in the thought that his wretchedness is
                    all selfâcaused. Once he too was innocent, and could look up with fearless eyes
                    to the wide pure skies: his own hand has dealt the deathâblow to his honour and
                    peace and freedom, and severed with keen relentless stroke the ties that bound
                    him to his fellowâcreatures. He is friendless for evermore; he has killed also
                    the love and respect of those most dear to him; he is no longer the object of
                    their affection; he is their disgrace;âfor their own sakes he must strive that
                    they shall never look upon his face again. Is this man<pb n="xiii" xml:id="VAB7158-008"></pb> deserving of no pity, no help, no effort to lift him
                    out of the black gulf of his despair and set him upon the delectable hills, from
                    whence he may yet catch a glimpse of the mercy of God and the sympathy of man?
                    Surely of all who writhe in pain upon this lower earth, he most sorely needs the
                    touch of human beneficence! But does he obtain it? Does not the world in general
                    go on its way amid fair sights and engrossing interests, without one thought of
                    those who are lying pent up in the perpetual gloom and silence of the prison
                    walls? Unless some startling crime or exciting trial calls public attention to
                    the Silent World, its denizens are left to pine out their dreary lives unheeded
                    and unaided. We do not for a moment wish to ignore or undervalue such agencies
                    as do exist in the present day for the relief and benefit of
                    convicts,âprisonersâ aid societies, police court missions, and other
                    institutions, admirable so far as they go,âbut these all deal with the criminal
                    only after he is discharged from durance, when many opposing influences stand in
                    the way to mar their efficacy. They cannot touch the man<pb n="xiv" xml:id="VAB7158-009"></pb> condemned to death, or to the harder fate of penal
                    servitude for life, or even to a lengthened sentence. We know of no attempt
                    among these agencies to reach prisoners during their period of incarceration,
                    excepting one solitary effort in the shape of pious letters which are sent to
                    prisoners at Christmasâtide, in order that they may have some little share in
                    the goodwill and brotherly love called forth by that season. It is a kindly
                    plan; but the writers of these wellâmeant epistles are, to the convicts, but
                    nameless strangers,âthey have never known them, and never will. The letters can
                    only appear to them in the same light as a printed tract, and serve mainly to
                    while away a few hours of the great annual festival which the prisoners spend
                    exactly like a Sunday, no alteration even in their ordinary uninviting food
                    being allowed to them.</p>
                <p>Further, these efforts, such as they are, emanate from what may be called a
                    handful of people, in comparison with the large majority we earnestly desire to
                    interest in the Silent World and its inhabitants. It may be asked, through what
                        means<pb n="xv" xml:id="VAB7158-010"></pb> could any active interest be shown to
                    them by the general public, when they are hidden away from their very knowledge
                    behind immovable bolts and bars? This is undoubtedly true at present, but it is
                    for that very reason that we have been anxious to make known the histories
                    contained in this volume; for we cannot doubt that if public opinion were once
                    aroused to the claims of these criminals on the charity and help of their
                    fellowâmortals, the subject would be brought, perforce, under the consideration
                    of those in authority; and we might then reasonably hope that it would have the
                    desired effect of making the prisons in our land, homes of reformation and
                    improvement, no less than of punishment. There are many different ways by which
                    we believe this end might be attained, but the most efficacious would be the
                    appointment of a properly constituted band of visitors, who would make personal
                    acquaintance with every individual prisoner, and study his case in all its
                    bearings, past and future, with a view to his amelioration.</p>
                <p>Such a suggestion will be met by the conviction on the part of most persons who
                    have thought on<pb n="xvi" xml:id="VAB7158-011"></pb> the subject, that it would
                    only tend to create hypocrites and impostors among those of our âjailâbirds,â
                    who are so hopelessly vicious and degraded that they are completely impervious
                    to all good influences. We do not deny that such exist in the shape of
                    professional thieves and villains, whose chief pleasure when at liberty is in
                    cruelty and ruffianism of all kinds; but if only a small percentage of the
                    prisoners were radically or permanently benefited, would not such a result be
                    well worth all the efforts that could be made? And even in the case of those
                    apparently utterly hopelessâwho can say whether, at some stage of their after
                    career, the memory of wise and true words spoken to them within the prison cells
                    might not come back on them, to bear fruit in a tardy repentance?</p>
                <p>There are, of course, many weighty considerations as to the treatment of
                    criminals and the management of our penal establishments on which it would be
                    manifest presumption in us to offer an opinion; but we do desire most earnestly
                    to combat the theory put forward by some writers, that the subject is one which
                    ought to be tabooed<pb n="xvii" xml:id="VAB7158-012"></pb> in polite societyâthat no
                    good can possibly be done by prison revelationsâthat details from the lives of
                    convicts are ânauseousâ and âgruesomeâ (we quote expressions we have seen used),
                    and that the most hopeless and wretched of all Godâs creatures ought to be left
                    in wellâmerited oblivion by their happier brethren of the human race.</p>
                <p>We cannot believe that such narrow and selfish views will long hold a place in
                    this generation, when the best and noblest of its children are fired with the
                    enthusiasm of humanity; and we venture to hope that the days are not far
                    distant, when practical sympathy and earnest effort will follow the words which
                    echo week by week from so many churches in our landââ<q rend="inline">That it
                        may please Thee to show Thy pity upon all prisoners and captives.</q>â</p>

                    <p>âA man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I
                        think he would change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know
                        not which way you shall go.â</p>
                </epigraph>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is well known, of course, that there exists in most of our large
                    cities, behind all their din and traffic and ceaseless energy of human
                    existence, a silent world where life, as vivid and eager as that which teems in
                    the busy streets, is pent up, for ever unheard and unseen. But the full
                    significance of that fact, with its dire import on some of the most complex
                    problems of our time, can only be rightly apprehended by those who are allowed
                        to<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7158-014"></pb> enter there as habitual visitors, and to
                    hold unrestrained intercourse with its inmates. This is a privilege for which
                    permission must be given by the highest authorities, and it is not always easily
                    obtained. It was granted, however, to the present writer, and it has resulted in
                    a ten yearsâ most intimate acquaintance with the very peculiar population which
                    is to be found in those criminal establishments. Persons who pay a mere visit of
                    curiosity to a prison, and are conducted by an official along rows of
                    immaculately clean cells, where orderly prisoners are at work in perfect
                    silence, cannot have the smallest conception of the extraordinary revelations in
                    human nature, and in possibilities of human destiny, which are made known to
                    those who are allowed to penetrate into the unveiled realities of the strange
                    life that writhes within the impervious prison walls. Hidden there are elements
                    of the deepest tragedy: abnormal facts, which raise the most intricate questions
                    in moral responsibility and other psychological problems; true histories,
                    equalling the wildest romance that imagination could picture;<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7158-015"></pb> while on the other hand the daily routine is
                    constantly enlivened by incidents that are irresistibly comic. Volumes might be
                    filled with illustrations from all the various phases of prison life, and we
                    purpose in these pages to give a selection from such as seem to us most striking
                    and suggestive; but we desire especially to bring forward those which, besides
                    their strong human interest, have an important bearing on a question that has
                    always roused much diversity of opinionâthat of the <foreign xml:lang="lat">Lex
                        talionis</foreign>.</p>
                <p>The capital penalty enforced by the existing law of England on all who, under any
                    circumstances short of selfâdefence, destroy the life of a fellowâcreature,
                    stands on a totally different footing from any other legal punishment, inasmuch
                    as it is one of which no human being can gauge the meaning or the extent.
                    Sentences which are to be carried out within the limits of this mortal life can
                    be exactly proportioned to the crime, dealing with a manâs visible existence
                    only, and leaving wholly untouched his possible destiny in other unknown
                    spheres; but once commit him to the great mystery of death, and the living
                    spirit passes from the<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7158-016"></pb> hangmanâs hands into
                    conditions absolutely impenetrable to us, and with which, therefore, it may well
                    be doubted if we have any right to tamper. The usual arguments in favour of
                    capital punishment, which affirm that it is a deterrent from crimeânecessary for
                    the public safety, and the only penalty dreaded by the criminal classesâwere all
                    met in a rather remarkable manner by certain cases which occurred in the prison
                    with which the writer is connected. Three men, at short intervals of time, were
                    brought to that gaol charged with precisely the same crimeâthe murder of their
                    wives; but the individuals were in character and antecedents, and in many other
                    respects, so entirely dissimilar, that the deductions to be drawn from their
                    histories are very different in their nature. The case of the first we shall
                    record, illustrates very strikingly the difficulty of holding the scales of
                    justice evenly in those momentous decisions, where the lives of persons more or
                    less criminal hang in the balance,âas well as some other considerations which
                    will be sufficiently obvious from a simple recital of the facts.</p>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7158-017"></pb>
                <p>Ted Brown, whose real name is not given for necessary reasons, was an elderly
                    man, and when his age came to be questioned, he himself declared that he was
                    upwards of eightyâbut he was generally believed to be in fact about sixty years
                    old. His family, which had originally consisted of fourteen children, had been
                    reduced by accidents and disease to three aloneâa grownâup daughter, and a quite
                    young boy and girl. We have had a good deal of information lately, in various
                    ways, respecting the very low state of civilisation which obtains among the
                    poorer classes in our large towns, but it is scarcely possible to realise a life
                    so completely on a level with that of the beasts of the fieldâif not below itâas
                    was the normal existence of Ted Brown and his family. The man himself was not
                    only absolutely illiterate, but of so low an order of intelligence that he was
                    very happily characterised by one of the prison officials as the missing link
                    which Darwinism seeks to find between our race and the Ascidians. It may really
                    be doubted, however, whether any respectable gorilla would have demeaned himself
                    to Ted Brownâs level.</p>
                <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7158-018"></pb>
                <p>At the time when the event took place which brought him under the grasp of the
                    law, Ted inhabited a mansion of his own construction, on an open common in the
                    vicinity of a large town. It consisted of two or three old blankets suspended
                    over upright sticks, so as to form a species of tent, in which he burrowed with
                    his wife and two younger children. The eldest daughter had long before abandoned
                    this uninviting family home, to get her living in a manner far from conducive to
                    even the lowest standard of morals. The income of the whole party was limited to
                    such small sums as could at irregular intervals be obtained by the manufacture
                    of wooden pegs for clothesâlines, which were sold by Mrs Brown in the streets of
                    the town, to which she was daily sent by her husband for that purpose. Ted
                    himself meantime reclined luxuriously on a heap of straw in his airy abode,
                    smoking the short black pipe which was the one possession in the world that was
                    truly dear to his soul. His wife was therefore eminently useful to him. She did
                    all the work, and procured the means of subsistence for the entire family,
                        toiling<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7158-019"></pb> from morning till night, while the
                    life which her husband was enabled to lead by her labour, might have been
                    compared to that of a Turkish Pasha in reduced circumstances. The woman was a
                    poor simple creature, harmless enough, but with the mildest possible conception
                    of the difference between right and wrong. She had lived with Ted for more than
                    thirty years, and been the mother of his fourteen children, but she had not
                    always been his wife; that dignity had been conferred upon her at a much later
                    period, in the interests of the higher morality, by a benevolent clergyman who
                    had come across them in the course of their wanderings from place to place. The
                    couple had lived more or less harmoniously together till a few years previously,
                    when Ted had been laid aside for a time by an attack of rheumatic feverâa malady
                    which, considering the nature of his abode, might have been expected to fasten
                    permanently on the whole family. During his compulsory retirement from this
                    cause in some pauper hospital, he believed that his wife had acted in a manner
                    to arouse his jealousy. For this offence, real or supposed, he<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7158-020"></pb> never forgave her; and when any circumstance recalled
                    it to his memory, he was in the habit of beating her in a very violent
                    manner.</p>
                <p>On a certain cold winterâs night the family went to bed as usualâthat is, they
                    lay down on the ground of the open common, sheltered only by their blanket
                    tentâthe two children sleeping one on each side of their mother. Ted had
                    bestowed highâsounding appellations on his progeny, which contrasted very oddly
                    with their circumstances. The boy was invested with the titles as well as the
                    name of a royal personage; and the girl was endowed with a designation, probably
                    taken from that of a ship, which was equivalent to the word Britannia. It was
                    from her account that the events of that fatal night became known. She was
                    apparently about ten or eleven years of age, though said to be older, and in her
                    the resemblance to the gorilla tribe was quite as strongly marked as in her
                    father. In all her ways and movements she was exactly like a monkey, with the
                    one exception that she could speak with a human tongue, in the lowest dialect of
                    her native<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7158-021"></pb> county. According to her statement,
                    she awoke on the night in question to find that her âdadââstung probably by some
                    sudden recollection of his grievance against his wifeâwas stretching across her
                    in order to reach her âmammy,â whom he was âhitting,â as she expressed it, with
                    great fierceness. Britannia lay still and watched the proceedings,âit was only
                    what she had witnessed many times before; but on that starlit night Ted went
                    further than he intended or knew. When at last he desisted, and turned round to
                    go to sleep again, his unfortunate wife, who is not said to have uttered a
                    single cry or complaint, â<emph>scrawled</emph>,â to use Britanniaâs peculiar
                    phraseology, out of the tent, apparently with the intention of getting some
                    water to drink from a little streamlet which ran through the common at a few
                    yardsâ distance. She did not return, and presently the child went out to see
                    what had become of her. She found the poor woman lying quite dead, with her feet
                    in the water. Britannia ran back to her father and told him that her mother
                    would not move or speak. Ted rose and<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7158-022"></pb> followed
                    her to the spot she pointed out. There, in the dim starlight, he looked down
                    into the dead womanâs face, and gradually became aware of the result of the
                    discipline to which he had subjected her. Having satisfied himself that life was
                    extinct, he dragged her inanimate form back into the tent with the help of his
                    little daughter. Then the remaining members of the family composedly lay down by
                    the side of the corpse and slept till morning. So soon as the daylight dawned,
                    Ted went out to gather sticks wherewith to kindle his fire, and being apparently
                    somewhat embarrassed by the lifeless burden of which he had become possessed, he
                    told Britannia to go to the cottage of a labouring man who had occasionally
                    passed through the common and spoken a few friendly words to him, and tell him
                    that he wished to see him.</p>
                <p>This neighbour presently arrived, and Ted went cheerfully to meet him, carrying
                    the sticks with which he was about to prepare his breakfast. He at once
                    announced the tragic event of the preceding night in the following terms: âWe
                    have got a dead âun here this morning.â The labourer<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7158-023"></pb> went into the tent, and what he saw there decided him
                    to go for the nearest policeman, without any intimation of his intention to the
                    family. That functionary speedily arrived, and had no doubt whatever as to his
                    duty. On the following night Ted slept within four stone walls, sheltered from
                    the wind and weather, the first time for many a year.</p>
                <p>In due course he was brought to trial. His own little girl was the principal
                    witness against him, and the judge, having heard Britanniaâs account of the
                    tragedy, practically directed the jury to find him guilty of the wilful murder
                    of his wife.</p>
                <p>Now, as a matter of fact, Ted had been guilty of wilful cruelty to an extent
                    which no doubt deserved severe punishment; but of wilful murder he was not
                    either legally or morally guilty. To kill his wife was the very last thing he
                    either wished or intended: not that he had any real love for her,âhis pipe
                    being, as we have said, the sole object of his affections,âbut because the loss
                    of her useful services would have rendered her death, even from natural causes,
                    a most <choice>
                        <orig>disâ<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7158-024"></pb> astrous</orig>
                        <reg>disastrous</reg>
                    </choice> calamity to him. However, the usual grim sentence followed the
                    verdict; and Tedâsuch as we have described him in his mental and moral
                    characteristicsâwas left to face, within little more than a fortnight, what
                    Carlyle was wont to call âthe eternities.â</p>
                <p>The duty of preparing him for this tremendous change necessarily devolved on the
                    prison chaplain, and all that zeal and earnestness could effect, that good man
                    would undoubtedly have brought to bear on the task; but he was met at the very
                    outset by a serious difficulty. Ted, in his cogitations over his terrible
                    position, which was quite inexplicable to himself, had evolved out of his
                    gorillaâlike consciousness a very peculiar explanation of the whole affair. He
                    became convinced that his impending doom, instead of being appointed by the law,
                    was really a commercial transaction harmoniously arranged, for their own
                    pecuniary benefit, between Jack Ketch and the chapelâman, by which names he
                    designated the executioner and the clergyman. He imagined that they would be
                    given an equivalent in money<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7158-025"></pb> for value
                    received, so soon as they could deliver up the strangled body of Ted Brown to
                    the authorities; and as his life was decidedly precious to himself, he fixed in
                    his own mind what he considered to be the very high sum of Â£5, as being the
                    price bargained for by the two partners in the arrangement. When the chaplain,
                    therefore, proceeded to the condemned cell to commence the course of theological
                    training which was to fit Ted in seventeen days for an entrance on the eternal
                    mysteries, he was dismayed by the very unexpected greeting with which he was
                    received. Poor Ted fell prone upon his knees before him, and holding up
                    beseeching hands, implored of him generously to forego the Â£2, 10s., which would
                    be the clerical gentlemanâs share of the price to be paid for himself, when he
                    should have been effectually done to death by the hangmanâs rope. If the
                    chapelâman would thus give up his half of the gratuity, Ted considered it would
                    be of no use for Jack Ketch to try and hold on to his fifty shillings, and he
                    would be ready to make any amount of wooden pegs for them both in the course<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7158-026"></pb> of his future career, so as to liquidate the
                    debt which he would thus incur towards them. The unfortunate chapelâman was left
                    to grapple with the difficulty of raising Ted, in one fortnight, from this level
                    of intelligence respecting his position, to a fitting state of preparation for
                    his departure into the realms unseen.</p>
                <p>Meantime another person connected with the prison was occupied with the fate of
                    the little Britannia.</p>
                <p>It had been this childâs evidence, and hers alone, which had brought her father
                    to the scaffold; and as it had not been by any means to Tedâs mind that the girl
                    who had been his small slave all the days of her life should give a detailed
                    account of his manners and customs in open court, he had glared upon her from
                    the dock with a look of fury which she could not easily forget. In spite of her
                    great affinity in many respects to the monkey tribe, Britannia had one prominent
                    human trait, in her strong power of affection. The manner in which she attached
                    herself with an absolutely blind trust to the prison visitor who took an
                    interest in her<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7158-027"></pb> was very touching; and it was
                    evident, from her references to the scene at the trial, that in after years, if
                    her intelligence were developed by education, the recollection of her own share
                    in her fatherâs fate, and his consequent rage against her, might be to her a
                    source of lasting pain. Her friend was anxious, therefore, to win his
                    forgiveness for her before the end, and arranged to have an interview with him
                    for that purpose within a few hours of his execution. It seemed that the near
                    approach of death was rousing some feelings of natural affection in Tedâs
                    darkened mind, and that it might afford him a gleam of comfort in his sad
                    position, to hear that the child had been placed in a home where she would be
                    kindly treated and provided for. To procure him this consolation, therefore, the
                    arrangements for sending her to an orphanage a long distance from the city where
                    he was waiting his doom were hastily concluded, and her friend went to visit her
                    there, in order to receive from her some kind messages to be conveyed to the
                    rapidly dying man. These plans were, however, instantly overthrown by that<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7158-028"></pb> which is the bane of many of our modern
                    schemes of benevolenceâa species of moral redâtapism that surrounds otherwise
                    useful charities with a number of petty stringent rules, so despotically
                    maintained as often to frustrate entirely the good objects for which the
                    institutions were founded. Instead of being able to receive Britanniaâs last
                    messages to her father, the visitor was ushered into a committeeâroom, where a
                    formidable circle of portentousâlooking females announced that the poor
                    halfâmonkey child had infringed certain small regulations of the establishment,
                    and must be instantly dismissed, to find another home as best she could. The
                    head and front of her offending appeared to be, that she had, with other
                    reckless statements, informed a small companion that her father was about to be
                    hanged, which information she had been ordered not to impart to any one.</p>
                <p>Of course, if she were to be thus summarily expelled, all hope seemed at an end
                    that the poor father, on the brink of death, could have the comfort of hearing
                    she was safe in a permanent home, and this plea for her being retained was
                        anxiously<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7158-029"></pb> pressed on the redoubtable
                    committee. The painful facts were heard with sphinxâlike imperturbability, and
                    the decision was repeated. The ladies wished the child to be removed, and the
                    money which had been paid for a yearâs maintenance would be returned, deducting
                    her board for the few days she had inhabited the house.</p>
                <p>Fortunately a person of more liberal mind than this âcharitableâ committee,
                    volunteered to give the poor child a home under the sad circumstances, and thus
                    afford the unhappy man a last consolation. Having seen her safely housed under
                    the kind care thus secured to her, Britanniaâs friend was therefore allowed to
                    go to the condemned cell very shortly before the execution, to tell Ted that the
                    child was definitely provided for, and to beg him to send her some kindly
                    message of forgiveness, which would be a comfort to her in after years. The
                    ironâbanded door having been unlocked, the warder in charge was told to wait
                    outside by a superior official, and a chair placed for the visitor, who took the
                    dying criminalâs band and said a few words to satisfy<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7158-030"></pb> him, in the first instance, that it was a friend and
                    not an enemy who had come to him; for poor Ted might well have arrived at the
                    conclusion that all the persons who approached him were united in a conspiracy
                    to remove him, as speedily as possible, from this visible sphere. Despite his
                    affinity to the gorilla nature, Ted Brown was not insensible to the touch of
                    human sympathy; and he never relaxed his grasp of the visitorâs hand during the
                    whole interview. It was somewhat like a bad dream to sit beside that strong,
                    stalwart man, full of life and energy, and to know that in a few hours he would
                    be lying stiff and stark under six feet of earth in the prison yardâand his own
                    remarks, which reverted perpetually in a very curious manner to the fate
                    awaiting him, did not tend to lessen this impression. Naturally he was anxious
                    to explain his reasons for the peculiar treatment of his wife, which had
                    terminatedâto him so unexpectedlyâin her death, and in touching on this topic he
                    suddenly displayed a degree of delicacy which seemed strangely at variance with
                    his grosser characteristicsâhe stopped short in his recital<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7158-031"></pb> of her misdeeds, and asked leave to whisper to the
                    officer present, some details which he did not consider fit for the ears of his
                    visitor. It was, however, worse than useless that he should continue to go back
                    over the irrevocable past; his future, of which the minutes might easily have
                    been counted, was all that was left to him.</p>
                <p>When the conversation was forcibly brought round to the subject of Britannia, he
                    indulged at first in a fierce burst of passion against her for having brought
                    him to the gallows; but he soon saw that this was very distasteful to his
                    visitor, and poor Ted evidently thought that, in his critical position, it would
                    be his wisest policy to try and please every one all roundâso he changed his
                    tone, and meekly agreed to do whatever was required of him with regard to the
                    child.</p>
                <p>âYes, Iâll forgive her,â he said. âIâll not think no more of them lies she told,
                    for all I never did nothink worse to my wife nor she deservedâa hussy! Just you
                    think of itâme lying crippled up with the rheumatics, and her agoing flaunting
                    out with that there fellowââ</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7158-032"></pb>
                <p>âBut about Britannia,â interrupted the visitor, stopping these reminiscencesââyou
                    will send your love to her, will you not?â</p>
                <p>âYes, yes; you can tell her I bears no malice, and as how I hopes sheâll grow up
                    a bright woman;â and then he suddenly interpolated his paternal good wishes with
                    the ghastly questionââDo you think, now, it will take them five minutes to kill
                    me?â</p>
                <p>The visitor was not experienced in details of the hanging process, but answered
                    as soothingly as possible, and after a little time led him gently back to his
                    childâs message of love to him. This was at last quite effectual in reconciling
                    him to her, and he even volunteered to âmake up a letter,â as he expressed it,
                    to be given to her on the day of his death. Ted could neither read nor write, so
                    this could only be done by dictation to one of the warders who watched him night
                    and day, to prevent him from forestalling the hangmanâs work by any private
                    proceedings of his own; but as it was likely to be a valuable document to the
                    poor girl in the future, the offer was gladly<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7158-033"></pb>
                    accepted. A most extraordinary letter it proved to be: he had evidently thought
                    it desirable to make it highly ecclesiastical, so that it consisted of the most
                    curiously metamorphosed fragments from the chapelâmanâs teaching, interspersed
                    with amazing reflections of Tedâs own, and scraps of hymns heard in the Sunday
                    services, inverted in such a manner as to become the most ineffable nonsense.
                    The whole sum of Tedâs religious knowledge when he first entered the prison had
                    consisted in the following four lines, which he had quoted triumphantly as
                    containing the entire body of sound doctrine taught by the Christian Church:â <q>
                        <l>âThere are four corners to my bed,</l>
                        <l>And four angels at my headâ</l>
                        <l>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</l>
                        <l>Bless the bed that I lie on.â</l>
                    </q> After a fortnightâs instruction, however, he had got hold of the idea of a
                    lost sheep, and he put that unfortunate quadruped through its paces in his
                    letter in a truly remarkable manner. Nevertheless, poor little Britannia, who is
                    at this date gradually<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7158-034"></pb> being educated into the
                    semblance of a human being, will one day value very highly that strange message
                    from the dead.</p>
                <p>The end of the tragedy for poor gorillaâlike Ted came in the shape of a
                    faintingâfit, complete enough to produce total insensibility, into which he fell
                    on the scaffold, from sheer terror of the death that overtook him before he
                    recoveredâand so terminates the history of the application of human justice to
                    his individual case.</p>
                <p>It is one of the peculiarities of the Silent Worldâwhere men and women have
                    sometimes to expiate their offences by a dreadful death at the hands of their
                    fellowâcreaturesâthat the other criminals located there remain in total
                    ignorance of the tragedy being enacted in their midst. The officers are never
                    allowed to hold any communication with the convicts except such as may be
                    necessary for the enforcement of discipline; and even the appointed visitor who
                    is privileged to talk to them freely of their own concerns, is bound to adhere
                    to the same rule with regard to all other subjects. Thus it is that the only <choice>
                        <orig>prisâ<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7158-035"></pb> oners</orig>
                        <reg>prisoners</reg>
                    </choice> who can have even a suspicion that an execution is going to take place
                    under the very roof which shelters themselves, are the men who are told off to
                    dig the grave of their yet living companion, on the day before his death.</p>
                <p>It chanced, therefore, that the visitor had, during this same period, to pass
                    from the ghastly associations of the condemned cell to the female prison, where
                    the officials were being kept in a state of lively excitement by the proceedings
                    of one of the inmates. While strange aspects of human nature and most pathetic
                    histories are brought to light in intercourse with convicted women, it often
                    happens that strangely eccentric characters appear among them, whose fantastic
                    careers cannot be accounted for on any known principles of human action. Such an
                    individual was No. 26, who was undergoing a long sentence in the same prison
                    with Ted Brown at the time of his compulsory exit from it. She was a tall,
                    handsome woman, with fine features and brilliant black eyes, which were for ever
                    flashing restlessly from side to side. She had been well educated,<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7158-036"></pb> and carried herself with the air of a
                    princessâmaintaining in her quiet days a haughty demeanour, which she seldom
                    relaxed, except in the case of the prison visitor, of whom she was graciously
                    pleased to approve.</p>
                <p>No. 26 shared in one invariable characteristic of female prisoners whose crimes
                    have not been of the gravest type, that she was, according to her own account, a
                    model of all the virtues. Women who are committed on charges of murder,
                    manslaughter, or attempted suicide, are generally in too despairing a frame of
                    mind to attempt any denial of the truth; but where their offences have been
                    theft, assault, or other minor misdeeds, they systematically invent the most
                    plausible explanations of the misadventure which has consigned them, as they
                    affirm, in perfect innocence, to the prison cells. Sometimes, according to their
                    statement, it has simply been the dense stupidity of the benighted judge who
                    sentenced them, which has led to the catastrophe; but more frequently it has
                    been a false friend, who has taken advantage of their confiding docility to
                    shelter all manner<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7158-037"></pb> of crimes behind their own
                    immaculate virtue. The perpetual appearance of this stereotyped false friend,
                    soon taught the visitor to dismiss the phantom on all occasions very summarily;
                    and the imaginary deceiver of No. 26 having been so dealt with, she ceased any
                    attempt to set aside the grim evidence given by the judicial record of her
                    former convictions, and was fain to admit that she had been incarcerated many
                    times before, for offences of various kinds. It soon became known that in every
                    one of these prisons she had made the lives of the officials a burden to them,
                    and some of her freaks were certainly of a very exasperating nature. On one
                    occasion, when she was inhabiting the convict establishment of a large city, she
                    announced that she had a complaint to make respecting the prison authorities,
                    and demanded to be taken before the magistrates for that purpose. This is a
                    request which is never denied to a prisoner who desires to bring forward any
                    serious charge against the governing officialsâand as No. 26 preserved an
                    imperturbable silence on the subject of her grievance, it was concluded<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7158-038"></pb> that it must be of a formidable nature. There
                    was, therefore, quite an array of magistrates assembled to hear her statement,
                    and the governor, chaplain, and other superior officers of the prison were
                    summoned to be present. No. 26 was conducted before them, and solemnly ordered
                    to proffer her accusation against those to whose custody she had been committed.
                    She at once replied, in stately measured tones, that she felt it her duty to
                    bring a charge against the chaplain,âthe reverend gentleman there present,âfor
                    the criminal dulness of the wretched sermons to which he condemned his illâused
                    congregation Sunday after Sunday. They were not only quite worthless, she said,
                    in style and composition, but also extremely illogical, inasmuch as he was
                    perpetually attacking the female prisoners for their slight misdemeanours, while
                    he passed lightly over the offences committed by the persons of his own sex on
                    the male side of the prison. She requested that the magistrates would order an
                    inquiry into his preaching powers, when she believed it would be found that he
                    was possessed of none whatever.<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7158-039"></pb> The countenance
                    of the chaplain was seen to assume various shades of blue and green during this
                    address, delivered much after the fashion of a counsel for the prosecution,
                    until the magistrates could sufficiently overcome their smothered laughter to
                    reprove the critical prisoner with befitting sternness, and order her immediate
                    removal to her cell. A considerable time elapsed before she completed the term
                    of her sentence in that city, and after a very brief period of liberty some
                    fresh misdeeds consigned her to the jail which was the last home of Ted
                    Brown.</p>
                <p>When No. 26 came under the visitorâs notice in her new compulsory retirement, she
                    manifested so strong a desire to listen to advice and reform her ways on all
                    points, that it was resolved to make a great effort to effect a radical change
                    in her mode of disposing of her existence. It was known that her relations were
                    highly respectable people, who had done their utmost for her many times, only to
                    see her fall back into her wild lawless life more recklessly than before, and
                    they had finally given her up in despair, and refused to<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7158-040"></pb> recognise her at all. Plans were made, however, by
                    the visitor for placing her in a position where she could begin a new life, and
                    gain her own livelihood in an honest and suitable manner. She professed herself
                    much pleased with the arrangement, which she knew involved considerable outlay,
                    and the demons of passion and unrest with which she had been formerly possessed
                    appeared to be completely laid. She went on thoroughly well till within a short
                    time of the day when she was to obtain her discharge from prison, and then there
                    was a lamentable change: she had scented the breath of freedom approaching
                    speedily, and became simply intoxicated with it. One morning the visitor was
                    met, on arriving at the jail, with the information that No. 26 had âbroken
                    outââthe prison term for a wild fit of seeming madness which from time to time
                    seizes on the women confined within its walls. What had been the cause of this
                    sudden attack?âthere was literally no cause. The regulation breakfast had been
                    brought as usual to No. 26, being absolutely identical with that provided for
                    all the other women, when she<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7158-041"></pb> had instantly
                    burst into a wild fit of fury, declaring that her bread was less in weight than
                    that destined for her companions. She tore off her cap, always an object of
                    abhorrence, sent her long black hair flying out on the wind, and dashed like a
                    maniac into the courtyard which separated her from the menâs side of the prison,
                    wrenching herself out of the hands of the officers who tried to control her.
                    There she announced her intention of scaling the wall,âa feat that at any other
                    time would have been absolutely impossible, but did not at that moment seem
                    beyond the preternatural strength with which her passion had endowed her; and
                    once on the other side, she declared she would make her way to the kitchen, take
                    violent possession of the cook, a stout man some six feet high, and then and
                    there boil him to a pulp in his own copper. Theseâthe visitor was toldâwere her
                    precise words, shouted out at the top of her voice; and although it had been
                    found possible to prevent her from carrying out this unusual culinary operation,
                    she could not be hindered from spreading ruin and devastation round her in the
                        punishmentâ<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7158-042"></pb> cell, to which she had been
                    conveyed by the united efforts of a considerable number of prison officials. She
                    had not been many minutes securely locked in there, when ominous sounds of a
                    very violent description were heard to proceed from her abode; and a view of her
                    position being taken through the inspection grating, she was seen standing
                    clothed in dilapidated garments, and surrounded not only with everything the
                    place contained smashed to atoms, but with quantities of the plaster and lime
                    from the walls. She must have sprung at them like a wild cat to a considerable
                    height, and she had succeeded in laying the actual stones bare to a very great
                    extent. Enveloped in the clouds of dust she had raised, No. 26 poured forth such
                    a volley of threats and blasphemous invectives against the officer, whose
                    presence she detected behind the grating, that the visitor was strongly
                    recommended not to attempt to have an interview with herâit was thought to be
                    decidedly unsafe. That, however, was not the opinion of the individual in
                    question, whose experience had shown that even the most lawless spirits can be
                    tamed by kindness<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7158-043"></pb> when once their affections
                    have been roused. The idea of leaving the unfortunate No. 26 in the deplorable
                    condition to which she had reduced herself was not to be entertained for a
                    moment. By dint of obstinate insistence on the right of seeing any prisoner in
                    that portion of the jail, however refractory, the visitor had the door of the
                    punishmentâcell opened, and entered it alone, knowing well that the presence of
                    an official would have been fatal to any hope of quieting the woman. Certainly
                    there proved to be no need for the least exercise of courage. The moment No. 26
                    saw her friend, she stopped short in a renewed attack she was making on the
                    walls, let her hands fall by her sides, and opened wide her great black eyes in
                    a look first of amazement, then of distress.</p>
                <p>âYou!â she exclaimed at last,ââis it really you come into this horrible place! I
                    could not have dreamt that you would come here! If I had only known it, I would
                    never have made such a frightful messâI never thought for a moment you would
                    have to stand in the midst of it! Stay;<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7158-044"></pb> you
                    must not set your feet in all that rubbish,ââand quickly tearing off a
                    handkerchief which covered her shoulders, she went down on her knees and spread
                    it on the stone floor of the cellâinsisting that the visitorâs feet should be
                    placed on it, so that they might avoid all contact with the heaps of lime and
                    dust she had accumulated there. It was a touching instance of the good feeling
                    which underlay poor No. 26âs fiendish temper, and which generally does exist
                    more or less, even in the most brutalised prisoners.</p>
                <p>A quiet conversation followed, during which she became perfectly meek, and really
                    remorseful for her conduct. Unfortunately she could not always be under
                    influences of this descriptionâprison rules required the infliction of penalties
                    for her insubordination, and poor No. 26 soon forgot her temporary conversion
                    and went from bad to worse, till the day of her discharge arrived. By that time
                    she had succeeded in inventing serious charges against every one of the prison
                    authorities, from the governor downwards, including even the onceâfavoured
                    visitor; and she announced her <choice>
                        <orig>inâ<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7158-045"></pb> tention</orig>
                        <reg>intention</reg>
                    </choice> of making their various iniquities fully known to the world, by
                    proclaiming them aloud, during her very first moments of freedom, when she would
                    walk for that purpose through the public streets of the city in which the prison
                    was situated.</p>
                <p>As it was decidedly desirable to prevent such a proceeding, if possible, No. 26
                    was told that her railway fare would be paid to a place at a distance, where it
                    was known she really wished to go, and an elderly warder was desired to
                    accompany her to the station and see her safe off. He did not relish his task,
                    but scarcely anticipated the extent of his difficulties. The moment No. 26 found
                    herself outside the door of the prison, she knew that she was a perfectly free
                    woman, and that the authorities had no longer any power over her, whereupon she
                    gave the reins to her capricious temper, and declared that she would not go to
                    the station till she had carried out her purpose of marching through the streets
                    of the town, and there publicly announcing that the once respected officials of
                    the jail were arrant villains, one and all.</p>
                <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7158-046"></pb>
                <p>At that moment the chaplain, most unfortunately for himself, came in at the outer
                    gate, and instantly darting towards him, No. 26 collared him, metaphorically,
                    and violently demanded instant redress for her injuries, while the officers
                    still remaining safely within the walls looked out from the windows, and, it is
                    to be feared, greatly enjoyed the scene. The elderly warder was, however, equal
                    to the occasion. He blandly approached the woman while she was executing a
                    species of fancy dance round the passive form of the dismayed clergyman, and
                    reminded her that if she carried out her plan of a public denunciation of the
                    prison authorities in the open streets, she would thereby reveal the
                    disagreeable fact that she had herself been a denizen of that unsatisfactory
                    abode; whereas, if she accompanied him to the station with all the airs and
                    graces she could so well assume, it would be concluded that she was simply a
                    fascinating lady, being escorted by an admiring gentleman on a journey of
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>These tactics prevailed. No. 26 released the chaplain, whom she, like the Ancient
                    Mariner, had<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7158-047"></pb> been holding with her glittering
                    eye, and departed elegantly for the station. Thither she arrived, after having
                    had one or two renewed outbursts on the way, which the warder afterwards
                    declared had sent a cold tremor through him; but he at last succeeded in getting
                    her into the train, and returned home in an exhausted condition.</p>
                <p>It might seem at first sight as if this system of periodical âbreakings out,â
                    which is largely adopted by the lower class of female prisoners, were a mere
                    unreasoning indulgence in temper; but it is not soâit has a distinct
                        <emph>rationale</emph> of its own, illogical enough, no doubt, but a
                    wellâconsidered method in the apparent madness. The object of it is simply one
                    of deliberate revenge for the pains and penalties to which their imprisonment
                    subjects them. The women are perfectly aware that by these paroxysms of violence
                    they give a great deal of trouble and annoyance to the officers, whose duty it
                    is to carry out all the unpleasant conditions of the sentences they have brought
                    on themselves by their offences against the law. And it is really extraordinary
                    what an amount of extra<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7158-048"></pb> punishment they will
                    willingly undergo in order to have the gratification of thus revenging
                    themselves. We had a curious instance of this on one occasion. A woman who had
                    frequently been imprisoned for small offences was brought before the
                    magistrates, on a charge which would only have involved the detention of a few
                    weeks. She prided herself on her elegance of manner and diction, having in
                    former times been a governess; and nothing could be more meek or graceful than
                    the way in which she pleaded with the magistrates to let her off for once. She
                    assured them that if they abstained from sending her to prison, she would
                    immediately retire into a virtuous seclusion, and enter on a course of the
                    highest morality. They were deaf to her entreaties, however, and felt bound to
                    inflict on her what was really a very lenient sentence. No sooner was it
                    pronounced, and the police were approaching to remove her, than she executed
                    with amazing dexterity the plan which had been in her mind from the first.
                    During the very time when she was mildly pleading for indulgence, she had
                    managed, by a subtle<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7158-049"></pb> unseen movement, to remove
                    one of her shoes, and hide it under her shawl: and the moment the chief
                    magistrate ceased speaking she drew it out, as quick as lightning, from its
                    concealment, and flung it at his head with such precision of aim as effectually
                    to land it in the position she most desired. Of course the result of such an
                    outrage on the judicial dignity was the immediate doubling of her sentence under
                    severe conditions. But that was simply nothing to her, in comparison with the
                    exquisite enjoyment of that moment, when she saw her muddy old shoe flying
                    through the air to lodge on the magisterial cranium. Even when she spoke of it
                    afterwards in the presence of the visitor, to whom she wished to be abnormally
                    respectful, she had difficulty in repressing her shrieks of delight at the
                    recollection of that ineffable moment.</p>
                <p>These are merely the lighter aspects of prison life; but they can only afford a
                    very passing relief to the sadness and pain which must habitually weigh on those
                    who are brought in contact with all the dark and tragic episodes that<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7158-050"></pb> usually mark the records of that strange silent

                <p>Our connection with it has mainly brought before us the more serious conditions
                    of convict existence; and we venture to hope that what has been learned by
                    practical experience as the appointed visitor of a model jail, may prove
                    usefully suggestive to some of those who are concerned in the administration of
                    the law and the general treatment of criminals.</p>

                    mission of the nineteenth century, at least in this country, to make a searching

                    irrevocable.</p>
                <p>In spite of the wellâknown fact that there has always been an influential
                    minority in England who doubt the expediency of the capital penalty, and that
                    the question has been repeatedly raised in Parliament, only to be summarily
                    dismissed with the stock arguments on the subject,âthe prejudice in its favour
                    continues to be so strong amongst us, that we have not even arrived at any
                    consideration of a desirable change in the mode of its enforcement, such as has
                    lately become law in America.</p>
                <p>We venture to think, however, that the simple record of the working of the

                    our prison experience enables us to bring before our readers, may tend to show
                    that the theories on which the capital penalty is founded and maintained do not
                    always hold good when confronted with the stern reality of actual facts.</p>

                    any statements we may make which suggest a doubt as to the righteousness or
                    wisdom of the death penalty<corr>.</corr></p>
                <p>No sooner does any one presume to write or speak in any way against this

                    that they are weakâminded idiots, who give all their pity to bloodthirsty
                    murderers, and are blandly indifferent to the fate of the murdered.</p>
                <p>Prison visitors see too much of crime in its worst aspect to be capable of false
                    benevolence, or to have the smallest desire that assassins should escape the
                    direst penalty which can be awarded to them for their cruel deeds; but we cannot
                    be blind to the facts bearing on the administration of the law in all its
                    phases, which are brought into strong relief by the true histories we have to
                    tell. These facts may be left to speak for <choice>

                        <reg>themselves</reg>
                    </choice>, as the subject is assuredly not one in which there is any room for
                    private fancies, or for the indulgence of an unreasoning sentimentality; but we
                    will briefly enumerate some of the difficulties respecting capital punishment
                    which they seem most forcibly to illustrate. We may instance, first, the
                    inequalities and actual failures of human justice in meting out a penalty that
                    can never be revoked, even if proved to have been mistakenly awarded to the
                    innocent. This argument was very comprehensively stated by Lafayette when he
                    declared that he would oppose the death decree until the
                        <emph>infallibility</emph> of human judgment could be demonstrated to him;
                    and the position was to some extent borne out, we think, by the history, already
                    given in these pages, of a man who was executed for the wilful murder of the
                    woman he most desired, above all others, to preserve in life. Our experience has
                    also brought to our knowledge certain most startling revelations on the subject
                    of the miscarriage of justice, which we shall endeavour in these pages to bring,
                    at least to some extent, to the light of day.</p>
                <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7158-055"></pb>
                <p>For the present, however, the true stories we have to relate will be found to
                    bear mainly on our conviction that capital punishment is not a deterrent of
                    crime, but rather in some strange instances the reverse; that it is not the
                    punishment most dreaded by criminals; and further, that it is not necessary or
                    even conducive to the public safety.</p>
                <p>Within a very short time after Ted Brown,<ref target="#skene-silent01">Â¹</ref>
                    the human gorilla, had passed from our prison to the realms unseen, a man, whom
                    we will call John Butler, was brought to it on a charge of wilful murder. His
                    personal appearance was very unlike that with which an assassin is usually
                    creditedâthere was nothing in the slightest degree cruel or sinister in the
                    expression of his countenance, which was on the contrary remarkably gentle and
                    pleasant. He was a handsome fairâhaired man, tall and strong, in the very prime
                    of life. He gained his living at a lucrative trade, and had always occupied a
                    position of great respectability in his native town, where he was much esteemed
                    and beloved by numerous friends and relations. Butler <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="skene-silent01">Â¹ See p. 22.</note><pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7158-056"></pb> had married at an early age, and with his
                    young wife and four fine children, to whom he was deeply attached, he led a
                    happy, peaceful life for several prosperous years. Then suddenly a dark shadow
                    fell on the brightness of his days, the fiat came to him as to Ezekiel in the
                    ancient timeââ<q rend="inline">Behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine
                        eyes with a stroke</q>ââdeath entered into the midst of the little family in
                    their pleasant cottage home, and took away the tender wife and mother, who was
                    the source and centre of all their happiness. Butler followed her to her grave,
                    half stupefied, and came back to look sorrowfully on his childrenâthe youngest
                    little more than an infantâand wonder what was to become of them while he was
                    absent all day at his work; indeed, even if he had been able to stay at home,
                    which as the breadâwinner of the family was impossible, he would not have known
                    how to care for them properly. A very poor expedient was resorted to for a time
                    in the shape of a visit from his old mother, who reluctantly left her own
                    household gods to come and indulge Johnâs children in the most <choice>

                        <reg>injudicious</reg>
                    </choice> manner possible, and make abortive attempts with her failing eyesight
                    to cook suitable dinners for them.</p>
                <p>She found the little girls comparatively easy to manage, but the two boys, left
                    to run wild, tormented her to the gradual extinction of her small stock of
                    patience, and within a very few months the old woman struck work altogether, and
                    declared she would have no more of it. She gathered up her small personal
                    effects and went back to her own home, leaving John, as the <foreign xml:lang="fre">patois</foreign> of his native place expressed it, to âfendâ
                    for himself as best be could. Now John had an intimate friend, a very
                    respectable man, generally supposed, we believe, to be gifted with great
                    commonâsense. This admirable quality he forthwith exercised on behalf of Butler,
                    in a piece of advice which he was destined to expiate at a later period of his
                    life in the bitterest regret and remorse: he solemnly counselled him to make a
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">mariage de convenance</foreign>âjust such an
                    alliance as in France is contracted between the son of a marquis and the
                    daughter of a countess, from motives of the purest expediency, without<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7158-058"></pb> any pretence of an attachment subsisting between
                    them. John was personally not at all desirous to replace the dear wife he had
                    lost, but he was ready to make any sacrifice on behalf of his children, whom he
                    loved with a very unusual strength of affection. He answered his wise
                    counsellor, therefore, by saying that he supposed it was the best plan he could
                    adopt for the proper care of his little ones, only he did not know of any woman
                    that would suit. His friend intimated that he did;âthere was a certain single
                    woman, robust and capable, living in the place, with apparently no family ties
                    or encumbrances of any kind, who appeared to be very respectable, and likely to
                    prove an excellent manager of a household. Butler might try her for a week or
                    two in that capacity first, and if she proved efficient he had better marry her
                    at once. It seems not to have occurred to this friend, in spite of his
                    remarkable commonâsense, that the fact of the woman living a long way apart from
                    all her relations might indicate some strong peculiarity in her temper or
                    disposition which made her absence from those bound to her, even by the<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7158-059"></pb> ties of blood, an imperative necessity; nor
                    did any such ominous thought pass through the mind of poor John himself. He
                    meekly consented to follow his friendâs advice, and annex this desirable female
                    to his little kingdom if she were willing to become his second wife.</p>
                <p>On that point the lady left no room for a momentâs doubt. She closed with Johnâs
                    offer in so vehement and expeditious a manner as to suggest the probability that
                    she looked upon it as her sole chance of matrimony.</p>
                <p>Mainly by her strongly expressed will, the marriage was hurried on as quickly as
                    possible, and the unfortunate John had literally no knowledge whatever of her
                    character when he was summarily borne to the church, and there bound to her
                    irretrievably till death should them part. On their return to Johnâs house from
                    the due performance of the ceremony,âat about that stage in the wedding
                    festivities when in another rank of life the bridegroom is expected to rise to
                    his feet and declare that it is the proudest and happiest day of his life,âthe
                    newly made Mrs Butler took her<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7158-060"></pb> husband by the
                    sleeve and led him into a corner apart from the guests, in order to make him a
                    confidential communication: it was expressed in the following wordsâ</p>
                <p>âJohn Butler, now I have got you, <emph>Iâll</emph> let you know what I am.â</p>
                <p>And she did let him knowâduring several years of unutterable wretchedness, which,
                    in all that concerned the fate of his miserable children, may be said to have
                    become absolute torture.</p>
                <p>The woman his sensible friend had so obligingly recommended to him proved to have
                    the temper of a fiend, and to be endowed also with certain other qualities which
                    are supposed to be eminently characteristic of the denizens of an unmentionable
                    region. Within ten days from the time of their marriage, she had, according to
                    her promise, imparted to poor John such a remarkable knowledge of what she
                    really was, that he went off in hot haste to the distant village where her
                    parents lived, in order to ascertain, as far as possible, what her character and
                    antecedents had really been. A terrible revelation was made to him there! He<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7158-061"></pb> learned that no human being had ever been able
                    to live with the woman; that she was malicious, cruel, and vindictive; and that
                    her own father and mother had for their very peace and safety been compelled to
                    dismiss her from their home and repudiate her altogether. Nevertheless, John
                    Butler had taken her for better, for worse, and he had no alternative but to
                    return to his own abode, and bear the curse he had brought upon his life as best
                    he could. Then, in that cottage home where he had hitherto reigned as undisputed
                    lord and master, there occurred a phenomenonâone not unknown to history
                    certainly, but still surely a phenomenon! John Butler was, as we have seen, a
                    man of extremely powerful <foreign xml:lang="fre">physique</foreign>, and his
                    wife was a small wiryâlooking woman of very insignificant appearance. Yet she
                    managed in some inscrutable manner to acquire a despotic power and dominion over
                    her husband, which reduced him to a condition of the most abject submission and
                    slavery. How helplessly he writhed under her indomitable tyranny, was soon very
                    sadly proved by his utter inability to shield even his children from her<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7158-062"></pb> cruelty. It seemed incredible weakness on his
                    part; yet he spoke of it to the writer as if he had been under a spell which
                    bound him as in chains of iron. During the years which elapsed before he broke
                    through his terrible bondage by a stroke that brought death to himself as well
                    as to her, he sawâfirst his youngest childâonce a merry rosyâcheeked girlâdone
                    to death by illâusage, and laid, a wasted, pallid little corpse, by the side of
                    its true mother. Then he had to endure the sight of his eldest boy Harry, his
                    especial favourite, and his only remaining daughter, a gentle young girl, being
                    turned out of the house by their stepâmother, and told that they were to darken
                    her doors no more,âthey might find a home and a living for themselves in any way
                    they could. A lady consented to take the poor girl into her service, and the boy
                    went to London, where he succeeded in getting only a very hard illâpaid
                    situation, in which afterâevents proved that he had been exceedingly unhappy.
                    There remained the younger boy, who earned a little money at his fatherâs trade,
                    and the woman therefore allowed him to remain at<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7158-063"></pb> home; but she indemnified herself for this indulgence by systematically
                    starving him. How she intended him to live without food has never been
                    explained: the mode in which he actually received his necessary nourishment was
                    by his father concealing certain portions from his own meals in a secret place
                    known only to the boy, where he went to find them when he could succeed in
                    eluding his stepâmotherâs notice.</p>
                <p>It may be imagined that during these miserable years the unhappy man often felt
                    that he must free himself from his terrible tyrant by any means, right or wrong.
                    He knew too little of legal processes to be aware that he might have sued for a
                    formal separation; and even if he had known it, most probably the expense of
                    such a proceeding would have been beyond his means. Anyhow, he did continue to
                    endure his misery, although his wife gradually became a confirmed drunkard, and
                    also, it is said, added to her other misdeeds by certain sins against her
                    husband, for which, had he been a Turk resident in Constantinople, he might have
                    openly tied her up in a sack and plunged her into the Bosphorus, with<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7158-064"></pb> the entire approval of the public and all judicial
                    authorities. The true gentleness and generosity of his nature were, however,
                    shown on one occasion, when, by merely remaining passive, he might have got rid
                    of his incubus for ever. In a fit of drunkenness the woman suddenly attempted to
                    destroy herself, and Butlerâs little son one day ran to tell him that his
                    stepâmother had hung herself in the cellar. The man instantly rushed to the
                    place, cut the rope which held her, carried her tenderly upâstairs in his arms,
                    and by the most strenuous exertions succeeded in restoring her to the life that
                    was not yet extinct. This was certainly a sufficient proof that no premeditated
                    idea of violence towards her had entered into his mind.</p>
                <p>About a fortnight before the day when John Butler was brought handcuffed between
                    two policemen to the prison, he had one morning received a telegram from London,
                    vaguely stating that his boy Harry had committed suicide, but with no details as
                    to the circumstances under which the tragedy had taken place. Now Harry had only
                    left his fatherâs house the day before, having been allowed<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7158-065"></pb> to go home from his situation for a very short
                    holiday. What might have occurred there to drive him to quench his own young
                    life is not known, but the act was very significant. Butler was almost beside
                    himself with distress at this terrible news respecting his favourite son, and
                    wished to start instantly for London to learn what had really occurred; but his
                    determined tyrant peremptorily stopped him from doing anything of the kind. She
                    intimated that he was to stay at home and attend to his work, while she herself
                    would go to London to investigate the matter, and at the same time pay a visit
                    to her sister who resided there. She coerced the unfortunate man into submitting
                    to this arrangement, and departed. Of course he expected to hear from her
                    immediately; but for three days she left him in his cruel suspense without any
                    tidings from her whatever. At last she sent merely a vague telegram saying that
                    the inquest on his son was over, with the usual verdict; and then, half maddened
                    by his continued uncertainty as to the cause and manner of his poor boyâs death,
                    Butler took the next train to London, and went first to the house<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7158-066"></pb> of his sisterâinâlaw, where he believed his wife to
                    be. She was not there, nor had she slept in the house at all. Where was she,
                    then? The woman was compelled to admit that her sister had spent the time, when
                    she was supposed to be inquiring into the death of her stepâson, in a
                    disreputable house, drinking and otherwise indulging her peculiar tastes.</p>
                <p>For ten days after that date Butler remained in his cottage, to which both he and
                    his wife had returned, maintaining an imperturbable silence,âwhile he struggled
                    fiercely with the storm of resentment and intolerable misery that raged within
                    him. A touch must have opened the floodâgates of his almost uncontrollable wrath
                    at any time; and at length the fatal moment came.</p>
                <p>He returned home from his work one day, tired and wretched, and fell asleep
                    before the fire. He had that morning sold some of his possessions, probably
                    requiring in that way to meet the unusual expenses his poor boyâs death had
                    brought upon him; and when he woke, he found that his wife had rifled his
                    pockets of the money thus acquired. and had gone out to spend it in the
                        publicâhouse.<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7158-067"></pb> After he had ascertained this
                    he returned to his place, and sat there silent and immovable. There seems to
                    have fallen on his spirit in that terrible hour a darkness that might be feltâan
                    utter hopelessnessâa conviction that his lifeâagony had become unendurable,âwho
                    could gauge the intense bitterness of the pain that held him as in a vice? His
                    daughter came in to see him just then for a few minutes, and to her he spoke
                    quietly and kindly. She was soon followed by her stepâmother, who instantly
                    began to taunt him about the suicide of his beloved son, in terms so cruel and
                    revolting that the young girl told the writer afterwards, she felt as if she
                    could herself at that moment have killed the woman who was casting such vile
                    aspersions on her dead brother. Childâlike she thought only of escaping from the
                    sound of those horrible words, and she went away, leaving her father alone with
                    the deadly enemy of his children. What passed during the next fateful moments
                    can never be fully known, though it is a significant fact that when Butler was
                    next seen he had a fresh wound on his face as if some assault had<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7158-068"></pb> been made upon him; but it is certain in any case,
                    that the pentâup exasperation and misery of all the past years culminated then
                    and there in one instant of blind unreasoning passion, which drove him to snatch
                    up a knife from the table and put an end to the womanâs life and his own agony
                    with one swift stroke.</p>
                <p>Where, in the sudden madness of that white heat of ungovernable rage, was there
                    any room for the supposed deterring influence of the death penalty on murder? If
                    the hangman and his rope had been facing him at the moment, it would have made
                    no difference to the frantic impulse which goaded him to avenge the wrongs of
                    his children and himself with a single fierce blow. When John Butler came to his
                    right mind and saw what he had done, he went and called for his nextâdoor
                    neighbour to be a witness against him, and then calmly gave himself up to
                    justice so soon as the police could be brought on the scene.</p>
                <p>The popular sympathy on behalf of this man was widespread and deep; even his
                    wifeâs own sister and other relations declared to the writer,<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7158-069"></pb> that all their compassion was for him, and not for
                    the unprincipled woman who had driven him to madness. In prison his demeanour
                    was uniformly gentle and humble, and he manifested unbounded gratitude for the
                    simple fact that no one molested him or spoke any harsh or cruel words, which
                    seemed to him, in comparison with his home life, to be extraordinary
                    kindness.</p>
                <p>Moreover, his repentance, as in the sight of God, for his one moment of fatal
                    anger, was profound and genuine. He told the writer, with tears streaming from
                    his eyes, that he repented of his crime with all his heart and soul, and was
                    prepared to expiate it to the uttermost. He had not the smallest wish to live,
                    he saidâonly he felt for his children!âworse than motherless so long, and now
                    fatherless! Sobs choked his utterance. He wrung his visitorâs hand in a
                    passionate grasp, and tried to stammer out words of blessing on any who would
                    care for his children.</p>
                <p>The day of Butlerâs trial came, and he took his place in the dock. The counsel
                    engaged to defend the prisoner devoted himself to the case with the<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7158-070"></pb> utmost earnestness, and with much skill and talent
                    but on account of some legal technicality, rather incomprehensible to ordinary
                    mortals not learned in Blackstone and other authorities, it was considered
                    undesirable to bring forward any witnesses as to the provocation the man had
                    received. Practically, therefore, the evidence simply went to prove the
                    selfâevident fact of the murder, and the attempt to reduce it to manslaughter
                    failed. The judgeâs charge said nothing of extenuating circumstances; and the
                    jury were, with extreme reluctance, compelled to pronounce the man guilty. They
                    accompanied their verdict with a strong recommendation to mercy, of which the
                    judge took no notice whatever.</p>
                <p>The dramatic effect of the scene at the moment when the sentence was pronounced
                    was very striking. His lordship was a small elderly gentleman, whose appearance,
                    so far from being imposing, was somewhat ludicrously feminine in his red gown
                    and grey wig. Sitting in his chair, he leant forward on his cushioned desk, and
                    facing the powerful, fineâlooking man who stood before him, and who<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7158-071"></pb> could easily have flung him aside with a movement of
                    his strong hand, he composedly doomed him to be hanged by the neck till he was
                    dead; and further informed him that his body was to be buried in the precincts
                    of the prison.</p>
                <p>John Butler heard his sentence standing motionless, with head erect. Only once
                    during the whole course of the trial had his selfâcommand given way, and that
                    was when allusion was made to the suicide of his son: then tears burst from his
                    eyes, and his broad chest heaved with smothered sobs; but it was only for a
                    moment. He speedily regained his composure; and as he turned to leave the dock,
                    he calmly waved his hand in token of farewell to some of his friends in the
                    crowded court, who on hearing his sentence had given vent to their feelings in
                    piteous cries and exclamations.</p>
                <p>It so happened that very soon after the capital penalty had been adjudged to John
                    Butler for the murder of his wife, a man was tried in London for precisely the
                    same crime, and we copy from the official report of the case the sentence
                    pronounced on him. In this instance, although the<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7158-072"></pb> woman was effectually killed, it had been permitted that the deed should be
                    entitled manslaughter. The judge described the provocation the man had received
                    from his wife, and then said that â<q rend="inline">the prisoner seemed, in a
                        paroxysm of rage, to have inflicted injuries upon her which caused her
                        immediate death. He had indeed been guilty of manslaughter; but he could not
                        bring himself to pass a longer sentence upon the prisoner than that of a
                        term of imprisonment, the result of which was that he would be
                        discharged.</q>â The term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced being,
                    we believe, less than the time he had spent in jail awaiting his trial, the
                    practical result of the punishment awarded to him was, that he left the court at
                    once a free man, entirely exempt from any legal consequences of his crime.</p>
                <p>We do not for a moment doubt that the judges who tried these two cases were both
                    men of the highest principle and integrity, conscientiously desirous of
                    performing their onerous duties to the very best of their power; but they
                    differed in opinion and disposition, as units of the human<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7158-073"></pb> race are wont to differ, and the consequence was,
                    that to the one criminal was awarded life and honourable liberty, while to the
                    other was given death, with irremediable disgrace on the children who survived
                    him. We would venture merely to ask whether it is well that the lives of our
                    fellowâcreatures should be dependent on peculiarities of temperament in her
                    Majestyâs judges?</p>
                <p>The lawâor rather the Stateâhad not yet done its worst for John Butler: a further
                    penance was decreed for him, which according to the legal code in America would
                    there have been wholly impossible. The man had been recommended to mercy; and as
                    the circumstances which had led to his crime were well knownâ(some not very
                    scrupulous persons even affirming that he had done right in ridding the world of
                    such a being)âit was confidently expected that the sentence would not be carried
                    into effect. Nevertheless strenuous efforts were made to ensure this result. A
                    petition was sent to the Home Office from Butlerâs native town, which was signed
                    literally by almost the whole population; another went<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7158-074"></pb> from the city where the trial had taken place,
                    endorsed by the most distinguished names belonging to it, including one very
                    eminent legal authority; and lastly, the jury forwarded an appeal of their own,
                    signed by every one of the twelve men, good and true, who had been unwillingly
                    compelled by the machinery of the law to pronounce the word âguilty;ââand no one
                    doubted that such an array of petitioners united in opposition to the execution
                    of the sentence would prevail.</p>
                <p>It had been impossible to conceal these efforts from the prisoner himself. His
                    children and other near relations were allowed to visit him, and they naturally
                    told him what had been done, and gave him the further information that a
                    preliminary answer had been received from the Home Office, which stated that the
                    prisonerâs case, with the appeals made on his behalf, were under consideration.
                    After that, no doubt was felt by most that Butler would be reprieved; and this
                    opinion received strong confirmation from the fact, that nearly the whole of the
                    short period alloted to criminals<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7158-075"></pb> between their
                    trial and execution had passed away, before the decision of the State authority
                    as to his life or death was made known. Then the answer cameâthe law was to take
                    its course; he was to die,âearly on the second morning after the letter reached
                    the prison. Little more than forty hours was granted to this man to prepare for
                    his dreadful doom.</p>
                <p>This is no unusual circumstance in connection with the infliction of the capital
                    penalty. Whenever a criminal has been recommended to mercy, and there is a
                    further appeal for his life in consideration of extenuating circumstances, the
                    decision of the Home Secretary is almost invariably delayed till within a day of
                    the execution, and the inadequate space of time thus allotted to a preparation
                    for the dread mystery of death, has been repeatedly brought into notice in the
                    public papers by prison chaplains and others.</p>
                <p>A law has recently been passed in America which deals with the whole subject of
                    capital punishment, and a good deal of interest attaches<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7158-076"></pb> to some of its more important enactments as compared
                    with our English customs; but we may here transcribe the clause which defines
                    the due interval of preparation to which every criminal has a right, in face of
                    his irreversible doom:â</p>
                <p>From section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of New York.</p>
                <p>âWhen a defendant is sentenced to the punishment of death, the judges holding the
                    court at which the conviction takes place must make out . . a warrant . . .
                    appointing a week within which sentence must be executed.â</p>
                <p>(Section 492.) âThe week so appointed must <emph>begin not less than four
                        weeks</emph>, and not more than eight weeks, after the sentence.â</p>
                <p>The rule in England, even in cases where there is no doubt that the sentence will
                    be carried out, allows three Sundays only to intervene between the trial and the
                    executionâso that if a<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7158-077"></pb> man is tried on a
                    Saturday, he has very little more than a fortnight allowed him to prepare; but
                    where there is hope of a reprieve, the delay of the announcement that the man is
                    to die, till within a few hours of his execution, not only adds a torturing
                    element to his punishment which he has not legally incurred, but it limits the
                    time of his real preparation to the one last agitating day when his friends come
                    to take a final leave of him. The matter is not one of minor importance, as was
                    keenly felt, we believe, by the saintly AbbÃ© Croze, the chaplain of La Roquette
                    in Paris, who ministered to all the culprits who during a period of twentyâfive
                    years expiated their crimes on the guillotine. The French system of leaving a
                    man in complete ignorance of the time when his execution is to take place until
                    the fatal hour actually arrives, told very heavily against that good priestâs
                    efforts to bring such criminals as Tropman, Avignoin, and Billoir to a fit state
                    of preparation for their entrance on the dread eternity. The strange laxity of
                    French prison discipline allowed some<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7158-078"></pb> of these
                    men to be engaged in playing cards with their jailers till within a few hours of
                    their death; but it may be doubted whether the more decent provisions of our
                    English custom, which dedicates a condemned manâs last day to farewell
                    interviews with his friends, can avail to render that brief space of time
                    sufficient for the heavy responsibilities with which it is weighted.</p>
                <p>In the case of poor John Butler, who was passionately beloved by his children and
                    brothers, it was spent in all the agony of mind which the sight of their
                    uncontrollable distress could not fail to awaken in him. One of his brothers was
                    an invalid helplessly crippled, and as he looked up at the tall powerful man
                    glowing with health and vigour, who was some years younger than himself, he
                    exclaimed impetuouslyâ</p>
                <p>âJohn, John! I wish to heaven they would let me die instead of you! You might
                    have a long life before you stillâstrong and hearty as you are, and fit for good
                    work wherever you might be; and here am I but a useless burden on my family,â<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7158-079"></pb> Iâd go to the gallows for you willingly if
                    theyâd only let me!â</p>
                <p>âNo, Richard, no! I would never consent to that,â said the doomed man, pressing
                    his brotherâs hand; âit is I alone must suffer, for it is true that I did the
                    deed, and it was very wrong and cruelâit was done in a moment of madness, when I
                    was quite beside myself, and no one on earth knows what I had suffered till I
                    was fairly driven out of my senses. They made no account of that at my trial;
                    but I can tell you this, my life at home was rendered such a hell upon earth,
                    that I have felt quite happy and peaceful since I have been here away from it
                    all, though the time has been spent in a jail, with the sentence of death
                    hanging over me.â</p>
                <p>John Butlerâs singularly affectionate disposition became strongly manifest in the
                    few last hours allowed him by the State after his deathâwarrant arrived. It was
                    with difficulty that his children were torn from his arms, and he could scarcely
                    bear to lose sight even for a moment of the chaplain, to whom he had become
                    strongly attached.<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7158-080"></pb> His last messages on his way
                    to the scaffold next morning were for those who had shown him sympathy and
                    kindness. Thus every instant of his brief interval <foreign xml:lang="lat">in
                        articulo mortis</foreign> was saturated with the influence of his strong
                    earthly affections; and it must have been wellnigh impossible for him to turn
                    his dying eyes from the beloved faces he should see no more, in order to look
                    into the mysterious darkness of the unknown state that awaited him beyond these
                    farewell hours.</p>
                <p>Since it is no part of the law that a criminal should be kept in ignorance as to
                    his doom till within a few hours of its accomplishment, and the matter is
                    entirely dependent on the will of one State official, it is to be hoped that the
                    strong representations already made on the subject may produce a change, at
                    least in this particular, as regards the treatment of prisoners.</p>
                <p>The story of John Butler is a very clear illustration of the truth which, as we
                    have already said, has been forcibly demonstrated to us in our visits to the
                    Silent Worldâthat the capital penalty is not a deterrent of crime. We shall give
                    in a future<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7158-081"></pb> chapter the history of a very
                    singular case, in which the prospect of death following at once on a murder,
                    seemed to have been one of the motives for its commission by a most unhappy man;
                    but for the moment we are only concerned to show that this portion of the penal
                    code in our country has no real effect in the prevention of deeds of
                    violence.</p>
                <p>There is one factor in the inducements to crimes of this description, as regards
                    the weaker sex, which has a force that dominates their whole being, to the
                    exclusion of any other influence whateverâand that is the uncontrollable passion
                    which often takes possession of a woman for the man who is her lover.</p>
                <p>Where there is no moral or religious principle to produce selfârestraint, as is
                    generally the case among the uneducated classes, the hopeless abandonment of a
                    woman with all her natural affections and impulses to this one overpowering
                    sentiment, is often a very remarkable spectacle. Some time previous to the death
                    of John Butler, that same prison held within its silent walls a young woman who
                    had been condemned to death for the<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7158-082"></pb> murder of
                    her only child. At the time when she was seen by the writer, there was no reason
                    to doubt that the sentence would be carried out; though ultimately it was found
                    that her condition of health formed a legal obstacle to her execution, and her
                    sentence was commuted to that of penal servitude for life. A visit was paid to
                    her when only a short interval remained before the day which, according to the
                    law, was to be her last.</p>
                <p>When the door of the condemned cell was opened, and she was first seen, she had
                    no idea that any hope of reprieve could existâthere had been no recommendation
                    to mercy in her case, and she believed herself irrevocably doomed to suffer the
                    extreme penalty. All that she said, therefore, was uttered with the black shadow
                    of death shrouding her from any participation in the living world, and thus
                    giving a strange significance to the burning words in which she told her
                    history.</p>
                <p>Judging by her appearance, it would have seemed impossible that she could be
                    capable of any act of violence whatever. She was young and fair, with delicate
                    features and large blue eyesâher flaxen<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7158-083"></pb> hair
                    drawn round her head, and leaving exposed a face of waxen whiteness, set in the
                    patient calm of despair. She was placed on the one seat which the cell afforded,
                    quite unoccupied, with her hands folded in her lap. She looked like a meek and
                    harmless young girl, and she spoke in a soft low tone, with no emotion apparent
                    in her voice.</p>
                <p>âYes, I have got to die,â she said, when some gentle allusion was made to her sad
                    position. âI know that quite well, but it is not a matter of any consequence
                        <emph>now</emph>.â</p>
                <p>She appeared to lay great stress on that last word, and then remained silent, but
                    gradually the expression of her visitorâs compassion and desire to serve her
                    broke through the cold apathy in which she seemed plunged, and she manifested at
                    last an eager desire to tell her whole story to her hearer. It was evident that
                    it would be the greatest relief to her to do so, for she had already passed many
                    days in the regulation silence of prison discipline, and she had found no vent
                    for the memories and thoughts that were for ever curdling round her heart in its
                    sleepless agony.</p>
                <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7158-084"></pb>
                <p>âLet me tell you how it has all been with me,â she said, flinging out her hands
                    as in a despairing appeal; and while she spoke with rapid eager utterance, her
                    whole appearance became transformed by the passionate excitement of feeling
                    which caused her to live again in the days that were past. The pale,
                    halfâinsensible statue she had looked when first seen, appeared to spring into
                    vivid burning life, that flamed in the sudden brightening of her great blue
                    eyes, and sent a crimson flush to her white cheeks.</p>
                <p>âListen!â she criedââI will tell you all. I was a poor wretched creature, with no
                    one to care for me or wish me any good. I had been betrayed and left with an
                    infant on my hands when I was little more than a child myself, in ignorance and
                    helplessness. Then in all my misery I met <emph>him</emph>, the one who is all
                    the world to me, and he said he loved meâdo you hear?âhe loved me! and he
                    offered me to come and live with him always, and he would take care of me and
                    make me happy, and give me all my heartâs desire; but oh! my heartâs desire was
                    for him and him alone! he was so kind,<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7158-085"></pb> so good,
                    and grand to look upon, there was no one like him in the world for goodness and
                    beauty, and I just adored and worshipped him. I canât find words to tell you how
                    I loved himâthere are no words that could tell it: he was my treasure, my joy,
                    my king. Iâd have laid down my life for him a thousand times over if he had
                    asked it. A look, a whisper from him was enough to make me do anything he
                    pleased; and I was happyâoh, how happy!â</p>
                <p>She stopped for a moment to dash away the passionate tears which the remembrance
                    of her past happiness had evoked, and then went on in a lower tone. âThere was
                    just one troubleâthe child. It had grown to be some years old, and he hated
                    itâhe always did from the very first. I hid it away from him as much as I could,
                    and it was easy while it was still a baby; but when it could run about and call
                    me mother, he saw it and heard it, and he grew to detest it so, that he said he
                    could not endure it in the house any longer. He had threatened me many times
                    that if I did not get rid of it heâd leave me; but I could not believe at first
                        he<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7158-086"></pb> really meant it. I was willing enough to
                    be quit of the child; for I could not think of it at all when I had him. I had
                    given all my love and heart and soul to him, and he filled my whole life. There
                    was no room for any otherânot even the child I had borne. There came a day when
                    it had angered him more than ever before, I donât know why. He was going away
                    for a night to a town at a distance, and when he was ready to start he came to
                    me. He put his two hands on my shoulders, and fixed his eyes on mine, and looked
                    stern and fierce as I had never seen him. âNow, understand,â he said, âIâll have
                    no more delay. You must take that cursed child away while I am gone, and leave
                    it where I can never set eyes on it again, or else all will be at an end between
                    you and me. I tell you plainly, if I find that child here when I come back
                    toâmorrow, I will leave you then and there, as sure as thereâs a sun in heaven,
                    and Iâll never look on your face again, or have anything more to do with you as
                    long as you live.â He pushed me away from him and went out, but I rushed after
                    him and flung<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7158-087"></pb> my arms round his neck and cried
                    out, âDonâtâdonât say youâll leave meâI canât bear it; Ill do what you wishâIâll
                    find a place for the childâIâll take it away,âonly donât leave meânever, never!â
                    âSee you do it, then,â he said; âtake the brat to the workus and have done with
                    it.â He went away, and I had no thought but to make sure that heâd not leave me,
                    whatever it might cost me to keep him with me. I knew it was no use to take the
                    child to the workus,<ref target="#skene-silent02">Â¹</ref> for I had tried that
                    before; but they would not take it unless Iâd go in too and stay in the house
                    myself altogether. That would have been worse than death to me, as it would have
                    parted me from him. I never gave the workus another thought. That evening after
                    he was gone, and I knew heâd be back next morning, and would leave me for ever
                    if he found the child still there, I do not think I rightly knew what I was
                    going to do; only I took it in my arms and walked with it as quickly as I could
                    towards the river. When I got to it, there was <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="skene-silent02">Â¹ According to the English poorâlaw, the
                        workhouse could not have taken the child without the mother.</note><pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7158-088"></pb> not a creature to be seen far or near, and it
                    was nearly dark. All the way as I went I had seemed to hear his voice saying
                    over and over that heâd never see my face again, and it goaded me on, and left
                    me no power to choose. The sound of his words came so loud, just when I got to
                    the river, that I rushed down to the edge as if I had been driven by some one at
                    my back; and then,âoh, to think of it!â</p>
                <p>Suddenly a spasm of pain passed across the womanâs face, and she put her hands
                    over her ears as if to shut out some torturing echo from the past, to which yet
                    her blanched, quivering lips were constrained to give utterance.
                        âThen,<corr>â</corr> she whispered hoarsely, âthe child said to me, âOh,
                    mother! donât put me in the dark water.â Yes, he didâhe didââand her voice rose
                    to a shriek. It was evident that this dreadful remembrance scorched her very
                    heart, and drove her to put into audible words the piteous cry that haunted her
                    night and day. âYes, he said thatâmy child did; but I only cried outââI canât
                    part with my love for ever,â and I let the<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7158-089"></pb>
                    little one drop out of my arms into the deep rushing river. The moment it was
                    done, I would have snatched it out if I could, but the stream carried it away,
                    and I saw it no more.â She let her head fall down to her very knees, and
                    crouched there in the grasp of an intolerable agony.</p>
                <p>Presently she lifted up her convulsed face, and said with a bitter withering
                    smile, âDo you know what was the end of it? As I walked home I met a woman who
                    had seen me go out with the child in my arms, and she was one who knew well how
                    he hated it. She asked me where it was, and what I had done with it. I said I
                    had left it with a friend; and she answered, âYes, a fine sort of a friend, I
                    expect;â and she went straight away to the police. That was a kind neighbour,
                    was it not? They took me that same night, and locked me up,ââthen she broke into
                    a wild despairing cry, as she exclaimedââIâve never seen him since. His words
                    came true, for all I gave up my child so cruelly, only to keep him with meâto be
                    near himâmy only love. We are parted nowâparted for ever. I canât<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7158-090"></pb> break down these walls to go to him. Oh, I hope
                    theyâll kill me soon! I canât live without him; let me dieâlet me die!â</p>
                <p>What deterring power had the thought of any ulterior consequences on this womanâs
                    crime? If this passion of loveââstrong as death, and cruel as the grave,ââcould
                    overcome the laws of nature and the divine instincts of motherhood, it would
                    certainly make no account of the worst that human laws could do, to avenge the
                    guilt of its unbridled indulgence.</p>
                <p>We had another instance once, in a very different case, of the extraordinary
                    power which such indomitable affection has over the life and soul of a woman.
                    There came into the prison on a trifling charge which did not involve a long
                    detention, one of the most pitiableâlooking beings it was possible to see,âa
                    woman young in years, but haggard and wasted to the last degree, and with a
                    great gaping wound, still open, on her forehead, which seemed to have been
                    caused by a blow from a hatchet. She made no difficulty in explaining how she
                    had received this serious injury; it had<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7158-091"></pb> been
                    done by her lover, with whom she had lived some years, though he was not her
                    husband.</p>
                <p>âHe has a terrible temper,â she said; âthe least thing puts him in a fury, and
                    then itâs always on me he takes revenge. He has brought me nigh to deathâsâdoor
                    many a time; and I know very well that heâll kill me in the end. I know he
                    will.â</p>
                <p>She went on to give further details of the utter misery in which she lived. The
                    man spent all his earnings in drink, and starved her. She toiled beyond her
                    strength to gain a little money for food, and when she came home after a hard
                    dayâs work, he snatched her wages from her, and went off to the publicâhouse.
                    Then when he came back, he beat her because she had not got a supper provided
                    for him. There seemed no possible element of attraction in the life she led with
                    him, even apart from the certainty which was ever present in her mind, that he
                    would compass her death at lastâsome destined day. Yet when the visitor, anxious
                    to rescue her from the sin and wretchedness of such an existence, offered to
                    provide for her entirely if she would leave the miscreant to<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7158-092"></pb> whom she was not bound by any righteous tie, she only
                    lifted up her hollow mournful eyes, and said, âI will never leave
                    himânever!â</p>
                <p>Finally, in answer to the strong remonstrances made to her on the ground at once
                    of the guilt and the misery of her life, she answered that she knew it was all
                    true. She suffered night and day, she owned, from hunger and pain and illâusage,
                    and she could not even pray to God to help her, because of her sin. She knew she
                    would be murdered in the end, and she supposed her soul would be lost, but
                    stillââI cannot leave himâI will notânever, neverâthough you offered me to live
                    in the Queenâs palace: Iâll go back to him the moment I am free, and Iâll stay
                    with him to the last hour of my life, however it may end,ââand she did. The
                    utmost efforts to shake her resolution availed nothingâno human power could cope
                    with the might of her passion for her destroyer; and she went back to him,
                    saying that she would rather die by his hands than live without him.</p>
                <p>The conviction that no case is absolutely hopeless, no criminal, however guilty,
                    altogether <choice>

                    work among the inmates of a prison; but the instance we have just recorded was
                    undoubtedly an exception to the ruleâit was literally impossible to help the
                    woman in any way. She would not abandon the fascination which held her as in
                    bonds of iron, even to save her own life; and it is certain that no dread of
                    legal penalties would have deterred her from any crime her tyrant had willed her
                    to commit.</p>
                <p>The instances we have as yet recorded of the working of the <foreign xml:lang="lat">lex talionis</foreign> in individual cases, apply only to
                    those arguments in its favour which concern the policy and expediency of its
                    enforcement in relation to the practical results; but there are other and far
                    deeper principles involved in its theoretic position as a righteous enactment of
                    the law, which must sooner or later be thoroughly investigated in the light of a
                    more advanced civilisation than that of the days when the death penalty was left
                    to be the punishment of one especial crime, even while happily banished from the
                    code of lighter offences. On those weightier<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7158-094"></pb>
                    matters we have yet to speak; but meanwhile, we earnestly trust that the readers
                    of these pages may share our convictionâthat the whole subject we have so far
                    endeavoured to elucidate by the painful histories we have given is of far more
                    serious importance than appears on the surface. Many wise persons among our
                    legislators, and others, are of opinion, judging by the signs of the times, that
                    the lower stratum of society, from which the criminal classes are recruited, may
                    at some future period, more or less distant, become a great, perhaps a dominant,
                    power in the kingdom. Surely, therefore, it would be well, while there is yet
                    time, that a careful consideration should be given to such portions of the
                    existing legal code as may seem to them to savour of injustice or oppression. An
                    eminent counsel speaking recently in defence of a prisoner, stated openly that
                    various important changes in the administration of justice were already in
                    contemplation by the authorities. We trust, therefore, that such light as these
                    scenes from prison life can cast on the subject will prove to be not
                    illâtimed.</p>

                    <l>âThen though our foul and limitless transgression</l>

                </epigraph>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is to be hoped, judging by the present state of feeling on all that
                    concerns the welfare of the people, that the best and wisest modes of dealing
                    with the criminal classes will really become one of the great questions of the
                    day. Such a result is much to be desired, especially if the attention of those
                    who are in a position to influence the Legislature can be drawn to the subject
                    in detail. A conviction has been growing up of late in the minds of many persons
                    who take an interest in the outcasts of the population, that our prisons
                        ought<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7158-096"></pb> to be made more productive of moral
                    benefit to their inmates than is the case at present. The impression, indeed, is
                    very general, that prisonersâmale and female alikeâoften come out of jail worse
                    than they were when they went in,âthat they encounter there an actively
                    deteriorating influence, and acquireâat least the younger criminalsâa greater
                    knowledge of evil than they had attained in their previous career. Those who
                    form their opinion only outside the prison walls, or after a brief official
                    visit, are not, however, in a position to judge rightly on these points; it
                    requires a long and intimate acquaintance, both with the criminals themselves
                    and with the machinery which surrounds them, to gauge adequately the nature and
                    extent of the problems involved in the legal administration of punishment.</p>
                <p>So far as a ten yearsâ experience with these advantages may be trusted, we are
                    decidedly of opinion that the risk of evil influences to a prisoner within the
                    jail has been greatly overrated.</p>
                <p>It is a rigid rule in all penal establishments<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7158-097"></pb>
                    that the inmates are not to be allowed the smallest intercourse among
                    themselves. Such communication, therefore, as they do succeed in holding with
                    each other, is obtained surreptitiously by means of much ingenious trickery, and
                    it is too circumscribed and dangerous to admit of any elaborate tutoring of the
                    younger prisoners in crime. It frequently happens, also, that some sparks of
                    latent good feeling in the minds of the older and more hardened criminals, lead
                    them to look with a certain sorrowful pity on the immature aspirants to their
                    craft; and they are more inclined to warn them of its miserable results than to
                    guide them into its lower depths.</p>
                <p>While, however, we are disposed to deny, generally speaking, the existence of any
                    active agencies for evil within the jail, we freely admit that unless strong
                    measures are taken for the improvement and moral education of the prisoners, it
                    is likely that they will undergo a passive deterioration, during the long
                    solitary hours spent in sullen brooding in their cells over the crimes of the
                    past and the possibilities of the future. As<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7158-098"></pb>
                    the prison system is at present constituted, we do not hesitate to say that the
                    remedial means provided are inadequate for the purpose. These consist for the
                    most part solely of the duties devolving on the prison chaplains. We cannot
                    speak too highly of that admirable body of men. Those whom we have been
                    fortunate enough to know intimately, have been absolutely devoted to their
                    onerous duties, and have done all that human beings can do under the
                    circumstances. But if a single solitary man is set in face of a large number of
                    criminals, succeeding each other more or less rapidly, as their sentences are
                    long or short, and is told that it is his business to bring them one and all
                    from darkness into light, it is physically impossible that, even with the
                    sacrifice of his whole life, he can really accomplish what he is supposed to
                    undertake. In the case of the female prisoners he has a special difficulty of a
                    most formidable kind. According to a stringent rule which obtains in all convict
                    establishments of every description, the chaplain is not allowed to see the
                    women aloneâa female warder has to be present during all his<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7158-099"></pb> interviews with them, even when they are sick or
                    dying in the jail infirmary. This rule is not only right, but rigorously
                    necessary for the protection of the clergyman himself from the false statements
                    which would infallibly be made respecting him by the lawless and utterly
                    reckless beings with whom he has to deal, were no witnesses present at his
                    interviews with them; but we need scarcely say that it renders his ministrations
                    among them almost entirely fruitless. He can never gain their confidence, or
                    hear the truth from their lips, while they are conscious of being watched by a
                    prison official.</p>
                <p>Admitting, then, that the measures at present adopted for the moral and religious
                    improvement of the prisoners are out of all proportion to the object it is
                    desired to attain, there seems to be only one remedy that could meet the
                    necessities of the caseâand that is a regular system of visitation by volunteers
                    from without, who, under the direction of the governor and chaplain, should
                    coâoperate with them in efforts for the reformation of the criminal.</p>
                <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7158-100"></pb>
                <p>That such extraneous help is a distinct necessity in the case of the female
                    prisoners, for the reason we have given above, seems to have been to some extent
                    recognised by the Prison Commissioners, as lady visitors have now been appointed
                    for the women in a few of the principal jails of the kingdom. The number is as
                    yet, however, very small where such additional help is afforded, and we are not
                    aware that it has been extended in any instance to the male prisoners.</p>
                <p>There would be one advantage in the admission of supernumerary workers to
                    prisons, which might not occur to the minds of those interested in the subject,
                    but which is none the less a very cogent reason for their employment,âit lies in
                    the fact that they would be <emph>unpaid</emph> volunteers, known by the
                    prisoners not to be in receipt of an official salary as an equivalent for their
                    labours among them. We can best prove the truth of this statement by giving a
                    brief account of a prisoner, whose history was also in other respects somewhat
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>This man had been in prison for a considerable<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7158-101"></pb>
                    time, and only two months of the term to which he had been sentenced remained to
                    be gone through, when he became very ill with what was pronounced to be
                    pulmonary consumption. He was passed into the infirmary ward, and there he came
                    under the notice of the visitor attached to that jail. The account given of him,
                    previous to his failure in health, was extremely unsatisfactory. When he first
                    entered the prison to await his trial, he had not only refused to give his name,
                    but said in the most determined manner that none should ever know who he was or
                    where he came from, or anything whatever concerning him. If they must have a
                    name whereby to designate him in the prison records, they might take Jack
                    Smithâit would do as well as any other. During the whole time of his
                    imprisonment after conviction, he maintained the same obstinate silence as to
                    his antecedents,âin fact, his demeanour was characterised by an unvarying
                    sullenness, and he never opened his lips to any one unless he were compelled.
                    The chaplain did his best with him, but he certainly could never have had a more
                        hopeless<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7158-102"></pb> subject for his ministrations. The
                    man was not openly rude or insolent, as he knew that such conduct could only
                    bring down condign punishment upon himself; but he took care to make it
                    distinctly evident that when the clergyman tried to instruct or admonish him, he
                    deliberately fixed his mind on some thoughts of his own, so as to avoid even
                    hearing the words which were addressed to him; and he never made the slightest
                    response of any kind. In chapel, it is the defiant custom of prisoners who, like
                    himself, have no desire to share in the services, to stand like soldiers on
                    parade, the arms hanging straight by the side, the eyes fixed on the wall, and
                    the lips firmly closed, as if the singing of the hymns and chants were as
                    meaningless to them as the moaning of the wind outside the narrow windows. It
                    seemed plain that the chaplainâs visits served only to confirm him in his dogged
                    reserve and silence. Several other convictions were recorded against him, and
                    the opinion held of him by the authorities was clearly expressed in one brief
                    sentence addressed by the governor to the visitor who asked to see himâ</p>
                <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7158-103"></pb>
                <p>âYou can go to him, of course, if you like, but you had better understand at once
                    that he is a thoroughly bad fellow in every way, without a redeeming point about
                    him.â</p>
                <p>He received his visitor in perfect silence, and his aspect at first sight was
                    certainly not encouragingâa gaunt, haggardâlooking man lying motionless in bed,
                    with his eyes dark and keen as those of a hawk, fixed on the one narrow window
                    high up in the wall, through which a strip of blue sky could be seenâhis
                    breathing hurried and feverish, and his large wasted hands, where the bones
                    stood out like those of a skeleton, clenched every now and then as if some
                    secret thought moved him to sudden anger.</p>
                <p>On this first occasion the visitor turned the conversation entirely to the state
                    of his health, promising to obtain from him, with the doctorâs permission, the
                    means of alleviating the thirst which consumed him,<ref target="#skene-silent03">Â¹</ref> and showing all possible <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="skene-silent03">Â¹ No addition can be made to the diet of a prisoner, even
                        when he is ill enough to be in the jail infirmary, unless it is distinctly
                        ordered for him by the medical officer.</note><pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7158-104"></pb> sympathy with his physical sufferings. The prisoner
                    answered very briefly; but towards the close of the interview he suddenly turned
                    his eyes on his visitor with a long scrutinising gaze, which seemed to have some
                    peculiar meaning. What that had been was explained next day, when the chief
                    warder informed the visitor of a brief conversation he had held with the sick
                    man the evening before. The prisoner had begged leave to ask a question: he
                    wished to know whether the individual who had visited him that day was a paid
                    official like the chaplain, so that any attention shown by that visitor to the
                    convicts was simply the accomplishment of a routine duty necessarily performed
                    as an equivalent for value received. The warder was somewhat indignant, and
                    responded angrily that it was like his insolence to ask any such question: he
                    might have been sure that the attendance at the prison of a person of that
                    description was entirely voluntary, and that no payment ever could or would be
                    made for it. The prisoner answered that he meant no offence; but he thought the
                    officer might <choice>

                    </choice> that it made all the difference in the world to himself and to every
                    other prisoner, if they had to listen to a chaplain who was hired to preach to
                    them, or to a person who came to them out of pure goodwill. Subsequent inquiries
                    proved that this is a universal feeling on the part of criminals, who would
                    scarcely have been expected to indulge in so refined a sentiment; but it
                    certainly affords a strong reason for the employment of voluntary workers in
                    addition to the regular officials.</p>
                <p>The information given on the subject to this especial prisoner produced a
                    remarkable change in his demeanour. When he next saw his visitor, though he was
                    still a man of few words, he showed himself decidedly grateful and pleased at
                    the attention paid to him; and towards the close of the interview he suddenly
                    raised himself on his elbow, turned round and faced his visitor with a keen
                    eager look, while he saidâ</p>
                <p>âI want to know thisâhave you the least idea how bad I have been, and am? I wonât
                    have you deceived in me. I tell you I have been just as bad as a man can be, and
                    I delighted in all my<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7158-106"></pb> wickedness, and never
                    wished to leave it off. I have done every wrong thing you could think of,
                    excepting murder. I never got let in for that, or Iâd have swung for it long
                    ago; but it was a chance I didnât, for I never stopped at any crime that came in
                    my way. You ought to know the truth if you are coming often to see me.â</p>
                <p>âI do know it,â was the answer; âbut it makes me only the more anxious to be a
                    true friend to you.â</p>
                <p>âA friend!â he exclaimedââa friend!â He remained silent for a few minutes with
                    his piercing eyes staring into the face of his visitor, then he suddenly flung
                    himself back on his pillows, muttering, âWell, when I came into this hateful
                    place, ay, and long before, I thought I had done with friends for ever and ever!
                    It goes very hard with me to believe Iâve got one now.â</p>
                <p>Nevertheless he did come to believe, not only in the sympathy of his visitor, but
                    in the existence also of a Friend perfect in love and power, to whom he turned
                    in all sincerity for pardon and peace before the termination of his life on
                    earth.</p>
                <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7158-107"></pb>
                <p>The end came for him in a very singular manner. Far above all his remorse for the
                    past, and the maddening recollection of certain dark episodes in his secret
                    history, there was one dominant passion which had entire possession of his whole
                    being, and that was the burning desire of libertyâthe almost frantic craving to
                    be free,âto escape from these stone walls which held him captive, from that
                    closely barred window where the light of day was only granted in such niggard
                    fashion to his longing eyes; from the resistless authority of his jailers, and
                    from the very sound of those clanking keys which always pervades the atmosphere
                    of a prison as unceasingly as the air of the seaâshore is filled with the
                    perpetual moan of its waves;âif onlyâhe used to sigh outâthe long days and
                    nights would pass more quickly, till that blissful hour should come when by law
                    he must be liberated, when the iron gates would open wide and he would go forth!
                    He counted the very moments he had yet to pass in durance, over and over again.
                    âOne day less, one night less, twelve hours less,â he would exclaim triumphantly
                    when his visitor<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7158-108"></pb> came in, and soon only a week
                    or so of the time remained. Nevertheless the doctor had grave doubts whether the
                    man would live to go out. His malady was increasing with alarming rapidity, his
                    strength ebbing away, and the symptoms of approaching dissolution becoming
                    plainly visible,âyet it never seemed to occur to him that he could fail to
                    obtain his release at the destined hour. He listened eagerly to the arrangements
                    which, by his own wish, had been made for his removal, on the day when the term
                    of his sentence was to expire. It came at lastâa beautiful morning, so bright
                    that even the high narrow window admitted a little ray of sunshine, which fell
                    on the wan face of the prisoner as the visitor came to stand by his bedside. One
                    glance was enough to show that the shades of death had already gathered there.
                    He was silent and almost motionless, exhausted by the convulsive struggle for
                    breath in which he had passed the night. If he still remembered that the day of
                    his release had dawned, he knew also that he was about to obtain a more perfect
                    liberty than ever he had dreamt of in all his longingsâthat the<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7158-109"></pb> hour waited for with such passionate desire would
                    render him, in the highest senseâfree indeed! and so it was. The ceaseless
                    prayer he had so long unconsciously made in the words of the Psalmist, âBring my
                    soul out of prison,â was granted at last, and before the sun set on that
                    appointed day, he had passed to the pure airs and boundless expanse of regions
                    far beyond the confines of this mortal world. The dreary cell of his slow
                    painful penance retained only the lifeless form that could suffer no more.</p>
                <p>For the reasons illustrated by the above narrative, and many others, we are
                    disposed, as we have said, to advocate strongly the employment of voluntary
                    workers among the inmates of our prisons; but at the same time we are perfectly
                    aware of the serious difficulties which stand in the way of such a scheme.</p>
                <p>At present the rules against the admission of outsiders within the walls are most
                    stringent, and it might seem as if any infringement of these enactments would be
                    subversive of all proper discipline.</p>
                <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7158-110"></pb>
                <p>Apart from those few prisons where, of late years, lady visitors have been
                    allowed to penetrate to the womenâs cells, no unofficial persons are ever
                    allowed to pass the gates, except the relations of the prisoners themselves.
                    These are permitted to have an interview with them once in three months. It is
                    limited to twenty minutes, and takes place in the presence of a warder, the
                    visitor standing outside the cell door, where a grating admits an imperfect view
                    of the captive within, and allows his carefully guarded words to be heard by his
                    friend and the officer in charge. No doubt it would be a great innovation on
                    this disciplinary system to open the doors to unofficial persons, and allow them
                    such free access to the prisoners as would be necessary to render their
                    ministrations of real use. It must be owned, also, that there would be
                    considerable difficulty in obtaining workers properly qualified for so peculiar
                    a position; in fact, some among the lady visitors recently chosen have had to be
                    summarily withdrawn, in consequence of injudicious proceedings. A sound
                    judgment, and a high sense of honour as regards the<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7158-111"></pb> slightest infraction of rule, with various other less
                    conspicuous qualities, are imperatively required to form an efficient worker;
                    and unhappily these are not often found in combination. For this reason,
                    probably, the governors of prisons, generally speaking, so greatly dislike the
                    idea of an invasion of unofficial visitors, that it is to be doubted if they
                    would even welcome a select band of sensible angels, if such could be sent them,
                    from the celestial hierarchy. Of course the office is one which involves many
                    strange and unexpected perplexities: amongst others, we may mention that the
                    visitor is apt to become the recipient of dangerous secrets. We can give an
                    instance of this kind in a history, which is valuable also as illustrating the
                    fallibility and uncertainty of human justice, to which we have alluded in some
                    former records from the Silent World,</p>
                <p>A man and his wife were sent to the prison with which the writer is connected,
                    having been committed to take their trial for the alleged murder of a child. It
                    had been the womanâs own offspring, but was only stepâson to the male
                        prisoner.<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7158-112"></pb> The facts brought out in
                    evidence at the inquest were simply these: The man had been alone in an
                    upâstairs room with the child when its death took place. The only other person
                    in the house was his wife, the little oneâs own mother. She remained in the
                    kitchen below, and did not go near the child till she was told by her husband
                    that it was dead. A doctor was then sent for, although, of course, it was
                    evident that his services could be of no avail. He stated at the inquest that
                    all the indications, from the state of the childâs head, pointed to murderous
                    violence having been used against it; but he admitted that it was within the
                    range of possibility that the fatal injuries it had sustained might have been
                    caused by an accidental fall out of its little chair, which the stepâfather
                    affirmed to have been the origin of the disaster. The coroner was of opinion
                    that the case was one which ought to be brought under the searching
                    investigation of a court of justice, and he therefore sent both the persons
                    implicated to await their trial in prison. They had a younger infant, the
                    legitimate child of the man, for which it seemed<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7158-113"></pb> both had always shown a marked preference: it was left in the care of a
                    neighbour.</p>
                <p>The woman, who was young, timid, and weak, was in a state of nervous excitement
                    which rendered her unceasingly restless, and she welcomed the visitorâs
                    interviews with her eagerly, as a relief from the monotonous solitude of her
                    cell. She maintained at first a cautious reserve on the subject of the supposed
                    crime, and of course her silence was respected. After a time, however, she
                    ascertained that any statement made to the person who alone was allowed to
                    converse with her, was always received in strict confidenceâcertain not to be
                    reported to either prison authorities or magistrates; and further, that the
                    visitor was not there to intervene in any way respecting either the crime or the
                    punishment of prisoners, but only to offer them advice and consolation in the
                    present, and such help as might be possible in the future. Being at last fully
                    satisfied on this point, her reserve gave way, and one day, when she was more
                    than usually depressed, she burst out with the whole truth as to the death of
                    the child, giving<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7158-114"></pb> every particular with a
                    vehemence which the visitor had no power to check.</p>
                <p>She began by explaining that the unfortunate little boy had been a source of
                    discord and contention between herself and her husband ever since the birth of
                    the infant which was legally his own; then without the least attempt to palliate
                    the enormity of the act, she stated in so many words the terrible truth that he
                    had indeed deliberately murdered him. She knew that he went to the room where
                    the boy was for the purpose, and it seems almost incredible that she should have
                    been so unnatural a mother as not to have even tried to protect her own child;
                    but it is to be feared that she had no desire to do so. The only trace of
                    feeling she showed while minutely describing the harrowing details we gladly
                    withhold from our readers, was in the admission that she could not, as she
                    expressed it, follow her husband upâstairs âto see it done!â By her passive
                    connivance at the crime, she was of course virtually as guilty as the man
                    himself. The full revelation of the murder thus made remained of <choice>

                        <reg>necessity</reg>
                    </choice> a secret, known to no single individual except the writer, who was
                    present a little later at the trial of the accused persons.</p>
                <p>It took place at the next assizes, and the first proceeding of the grand jury was
                    to throw out the bill against the woman altogether. She was instantly
                    discharged, and the man alone appeared in the dock.</p>
                <p>The witnesses against him were few in number. His wife, of course, could not be
                    examined, and the evidence was limited to that of the medical man who had been
                    called in, and one or two neighbours, who could only testify generally as to
                    unkind treatment towards the child on the part of the prisoner at the bar. The
                    doctorâs evidence was decidedly the most damaging, and it was plain that the
                    accused man was painfully conscious of its weight and significance, for his face
                    became ghastly with fear as he listened,âin his guilty consciousness he clearly
                    believed himself doomed, and at least in that moment he did by anticipation
                    taste the bitterness of death. It was easy to see what the doctorâs private
                        opinion<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7158-116"></pb> was, and that he had not the
                    smallest doubt a cruel murder had been committed, but he was bound only to speak
                    as to facts; and under a severe crossâexamination from the prisonerâs counsel,
                    he was compelled to admit that the circumstances were consistent with a possible
                    accident, such as the man had from the first declared to have been the cause of
                    the childâs death.</p>
                <p>After the evidence had been taken, and the counsel on both sides had made their
                    speeches, the judge proceeded to sum up and deliver his charge to the jury. In
                    the most eloquent and convincing manner possible, he proved to them that the man
                    was, in the eye of the law, perfectly innocent of the crime which had been laid
                    to his charge. There was no reliable evidence against himâno human eye had
                    beheld the events which had resulted in the death of the childânot one person
                    could testify that they had seen the stepâfather inflict any injury upon him on
                    that occasion; they must dismiss from their minds what had been stated as to his
                    harshness at other timesâthey were concerned only to inquire into the<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7158-117"></pb> circumstances which had occurred on the one fatal
                    day. It was a point strongly in the prisonerâs favour, that he had himself gone
                    instantly to bring a doctor to the scene (the child being safely dead, be it
                    remembered). The medical gentleman had admitted that the accident described by
                    the prisoner would account for the death, and in short the man must be
                    pronounced innocent. In the words of the hymnâ <q>
                        <l>âAll his converse was sincere,</l>
                        <l>His conscience as the noonday clear.â</l>
                    </q> The jury, without even retiring from their box, brought in a verdict of
                    âNot guilty.â The accused man was honourably acquittedâdischarged forthwith from
                    the custody of the police, and in another moment he had hurried out of the court
                    and disappeared.</p>
                <p>One person who listened to the judgeâs âadmirable summing up,â as the newspapers
                    termed it, and to the unanimous verdict, knew certainly that the man thus
                    pronounced to be innocent had in truth been guilty of a most brutal premeditated
                    murder; and it was impossible to escape the <choice>

                        <reg>inference</reg>
                    </choice>, that if the fallible human justice could thus dismiss an unmitigated
                    villain with an honourable acquittal, it must be equally liable to an error of
                    judgment in the opposite direction,âand an innocent man pronounced guilty of
                    murder passes to a punishment which can never in this life be revoked.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have happened in the past, the risk of so painful a mistake
                    occurring in these days certainly lies in the possibility of perjury on the part
                    of hostile witnesses. We believe that the danger of false evidence being
                    tendered on oath in our courts of justice by persons of a certain class, is far
                    from being sufficiently estimated by those in authority. It is part of the
                    experience gained in the Silent World to gauge the depths of that utter
                    disregard of truth in which children of the lowest class are nurtured from
                    infancy upward, till, when they reach maturity, it has become a second nature.
                    Where any vindictive feeling happens to be cherished against a prisoner, there
                    is not the smallest scruple among such persons in swearing to the grossest
                        falsehoods<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7158-119"></pb> concerning him; and we have
                    known instances where the love of notoriety alone, in the case of female
                    witnesses, has produced the same result. The newspapers have quite lately been
                    expatiating on the release of two innocent men from penal servitude in
                    consequence of its having become known that the evidence given against them some
                    years ago was false, and there has been commendable speed in sending them a free
                    pardon for the crime they never committed. Fortunately for these poor men, their
                    sentence was not of that irrevocable nature which would have rendered any such
                    restitution impossible.</p>
                <p>Prison visitors can often be of great use to criminals awaiting trial by inducing
                    them to deal truthfully with their Counsels, and to act in all respects
                    righteously as regards their offences against the law. It is one of the many
                    channels open to them for the moral improvement of the unlucky denizens of the
                    Silent World. As we desire strongly to advocate an organisation of voluntary
                    workers for these purposes, it is only just that we should give some little
                    insight into<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7158-120"></pb> the difficult nature of the work
                    in its various branches. The story we have just told shows that they are very
                    likely to be made the recipients of dangerous secrets within the jail itself,
                    but the possession of information from without involves an equally heavy
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>One of the most rigid rules which officially appointed visitors have to obey, is
                    that which prohibits them from conveying to the prisoners the smallest fraction
                    of intelligence as to anything which may be taking place in the world outside
                    the walls. They are thereby often landed in very perplexing positions. One of
                    the most romantic histories revealed in our prison is connected with an instance
                    of this kind. A very beautiful woman had, for some unknown reason, been
                    transferred from London to the jail of which we have been writing. The offence
                    which had brought her a yearâs imprisonment was one of which it was quite
                    possible that she might have been as guiltless as she declared she really was.
                    She affirmed that it was a case of mistaken identity. She was comparatively
                    young, and even<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7158-121"></pb> the unsightly convict dress
                    could not hide the symmetry of her features or the grace of her movements. She
                    had received a superior education, and was possessed of great musical talent.
                    She had, we believe, been the <foreign xml:lang="ita">prima donna</foreign> of a
                    London musicâhall, and had been in the habit of singing there nightly to a
                    charmed audience, with whom she was a favourite, and who often greeted her on
                    her appearance with showers of bouquets. It was a dangerous position, especially
                    for an attractive young woman, without either father or mother to protect her,
                    and poor No. 19 bad not been proof against the allurements that beset her.</p>
                <p>For a long time nothing whatever was known of her antecedents within the jail.
                    She maintained as many prisoners do, an absolute reserve towards the officials,
                    holding as little intercourse with them as was possible. Her conduct was
                    exemplary so far as the regular routine of work and discipline was concerned,
                    but it was believed that when she was shut into her cell for the night in
                    solitude and silence, she often gave way to paroxysms of passionate weeping,
                    beating herself against<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7158-122"></pb> the stone walls that
                    held her in such rigid bondage.</p>
                <p>It happened that the visitor had been absent for a little time after No. 19 came
                    to the prison, and therefore inquired, before a first interview with her, into
                    the facts known respecting her; but the records of this case, when examined,
                    contained no account whatever of the womanâs previous history, so determinedly
                    had she concealed it from all around her, and at first she maintained the same
                    silence with her visitor. When a few interviews had taken place between them,
                    however, she made the discovery that whatever confidence she gave to this person
                    would be held inviolate; and then the pentâup longing to relieve the aching
                    burden of unshared thought, and feel the touch of human sympathy which generally
                    takes possession of prisoners during a lengthened incarceration, drove her to a
                    full revelation of her lifeâhistory in the past and her hopes for the future.
                    Hers had been an experience only too sadly common among women of her ardent and
                    undisciplined nature; but there were certain circumstances connected with her
                    position at the<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7158-123"></pb> time which gave it an unusual
                    interest. She had been educated more or less as a lady, but being left
                    friendless at an age when her beauty and attractions were at their height, she
                    was glad to turn her musical talents to account as a means of living, and
                    became, as we have said, a public singer. The life of excitement, the gay and
                    brilliant scenes in which she figured nightly, the applause with which she was
                    always greeted, were full of fascination to her, and she was very happy in her
                    somewhat dangerous career. Then she attracted the notice of a man whose name she
                    would not at first reveal, even to the visitor whom she trusted, because she
                    knew that it was familiar to every one as that of a person in a very high
                    position, both socially and politically. After a time, during which he lavished
                    upon her every proof of real affection he could bestow,âloaded her with precious
                    gifts, and gave rise to no suspicion of evil intentions,âthe usual miserable
                    result followed: he persuaded her to go abroad with him under a promise of
                    marriage, when certain obstacles which stood in the way should have been
                    removed. She knew the error of such a course, and<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7158-124"></pb> hated the consciousness of wrongâdoing in herself,
                    even if it were to be only temporary; but she could not resist the entreaties of
                    the voice she loved, or the specious promises that accompanied them. It was
                    simply another case of that blind unreasoning passion of a woman for her idol,
                    which fills the prison books with some of the darkest crimes they have to
                    record.</p>
                <p>Her life had thus become one of luxury and splendour, spent as much as possible
                    on the Continent, during which time the hope of marriage was probably ever
                    before her, lending a very false colouring to her position. There were frequent
                    intervals, however, when public affairs required that her companion should leave
                    her; and it was during one of those periods of solitude that she was suddenly
                    charged with the offence which ultimately brought her within the prison walls.
                    According to her own account, not only was it a mere case of mistaken identity,
                    but she was actually abroad at the time when she was supposed to have been
                    committing a fraud in London: and this fact she declared to her visitor she
                    could have proved instantly at her trial<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7158-125"></pb> had
                    she chosen to call as witness the gentleman who had been travelling with her
                    there. But she knew that to do this would be to bring his wellâknown name into
                    the papers, coupled with her own, in a disgraceful manner; and she preferred
                    rather to endure the term of imprisonment which the undefended accusation
                    brought upon her, than to injure fatally the reputation of the man she
                    loved.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to believe that a woman who had gone so far wrong as she had
                    done, and was of so passionate and impulsive a nature, could have been capable
                    of an act of generosity which was to bring a most galling punishment upon
                    herself; but the writer saw a letter from her to the man in question, which
                    undoubtedly bore out the truth of her statement. Perhaps such a generous act may
                    have been rendered more easy for her by the hope it engendered, that her lover
                    would reward her for it by accomplishing the longâdesired marriage, all
                    obstacles to which had, as it happened, been removed. She no longer withheld his
                    name from the visitor, and it was evident that she brooded on the thought of him
                    and of her possible<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7158-126"></pb> future night and day. At
                    the same time, she appeared to be strongly moved by the efforts of those who
                    sought to influence her for good, and she promised to abide by their earnest
                    advice, and to see this man no more unless he did in truth make her his wife.
                    She gave some evidence of sincerity in her intentions by agreeing to remain
                    under the visitorâs care, after her release from jail, until it could be seen
                    what her fate was likely to be, and the course which it would be right for her
                    to adopt in accordance with it. Matters were in this position, and a
                    considerable portion of her term of imprisonment still remained to be undergone,
                    when the visitor one morning found a whole column of a London paper filled with
                    an account of the magnificent wedding of the man in whom poor No. 19 had trusted
                    so devotedly. Troops of aristocratic friends had surrounded him and the lady who
                    held herself to be supremely fortunate in becoming his wife. An ecclesiastical
                    dignitary had tied the knot, and crowds had waited outside the church to greet
                    with acclamations the highly placed bridegroom who was supposed<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7158-127"></pb> to have the interests of the people especially at
                    heart.</p>
                <p>We have told this story mainly to illustrate some of the perplexities which are
                    apt to beset prison visitors in the discharge of their duties, and here was
                    certainly a notable instance. The rule, binding persons appointed to that office
                    never to bring tidings from the outside world to the knowledge of the prisoners
                    under any circumstances whatever, rendered it impossible for the writer to give
                    No. 19 the faintest hint of an event which must inevitably alter the whole
                    course of her future life, and at once dispel the fervent hopes she had
                    cherished so fondly. Naturally it became thenceforth extremely difficult to know
                    how to counsel and support a woman who had to be kept in ignorance of that which
                    was in fact the keyânote of her destiny, and who must be left in her delusion to
                    make plans which could never be realised.</p>
                <p>There was no help for it, however. It might have been easy enough for the visitor
                    to evade the rule in that particular instance without its ever becoming known to
                    the authorities, but of<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7158-128"></pb> course such a
                    proceeding would have been simply dishonourable; and therefore nothing could be
                    done except to speak to poor No. 19 on the vanity of human hopes in general, and
                    more especially of such as were founded on the possibility of righteous dealing
                    by a man who had already cruelly wronged her. As may be supposed, these vague
                    sentiments had little weight with the highâspirited, impassioned woman. She
                    thought only of the long period of dreary imprisonment which she had suffered
                    for this manâs sake, and could not, would not doubt that he had a great
                    recompense in store for her. At length the day of her release cameâso long
                    looked forward to as the golden dawn of a life that would be like a summer day
                    in brightest happiness. The visitor went to take the poor woman from the prison,
                    and place her in safety in the home provided for her. Once outside the gates of
                    the jail, she was of course entirely exempt from prison rule, and the truth
                    could be told to her without any breach of duty,âa sufficiently painful task!
                    but delay was for every reason undesirable, and it had to<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7158-129"></pb> be done at once. The fact of her loverâs recent
                    marriage was disclosed. There was silence for a moment. At last, with a wild
                    fierceness in her eyes like that of a hunted animal driven to bay, she muttered
                    hoarsely, âHe promised to marry me,â and then closed her lips resolutely over
                    the tempest of indignation that raged within her. After that all went wrong with
                    her. She became embittered and hopeless. She seemed to have lost faith in human
                    nature, and with it went also the first faint stirrings of belief in a Love
                    Divine which had been evoked in her during her prison experience. She was
                    speedily again in communication with the outer world, and temptation came from
                    various quarters to draw her back into the vortex of London life. She was found
                    one day surrounded by a quantity of new music which had been sent to her, and
                    letters followed respecting property said to have been bequeathed to her for
                    which her presence was required. Within a fortnight of her discharge from jail
                    she had drifted back into London, nominally only for a little time, but in fact
                    to disappear altogether from the <choice>
                        <orig>knowâ<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7158-130"></pb> ledge</orig>
                        <reg>knowledge</reg>
                    </choice> of those who had taken so much interest in her, with ominous
                    indications that she was likely to take a downward path. There remained only the
                    hope that in the dark days which were certain to overtake her in her perilous
                    career, the remembrance of noble aims and pure desires which had been aroused
                    within her while a prisoner, might yet return to bless and brighten her later
                    years of life.</p>
                <p>The restrictions surrounding a prison visitor which are illustrated by this
                    history are, however, as nothing in comparison to the one great difficulty which
                    in many different shapes presents itself to all who have to work among the
                    inmates of a jail. This simply consists in the complete reversal of all
                    preconceived ideas as to the clearly defined limits of right and wrong, when
                    these are brought into connection with a certain impracticable class of
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>To such as they are and have been from in fancy, it seems impossible to apply any
                    laws, human or divine. They have been a law unto themselves all their days, as
                    their parents were<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7158-131"></pb> before them, and have
                    literally known no other. Absolutely ignorant of so much as the existence of any
                    Power which could enforce a moral obligation,âthe name of God never heard by
                    them except in the form of an oath,âthe enactments of the Legislature are only
                    recognised as that which must be deftly cheated and defied with all possible
                    cunning. For instance, how could guilt in the ordinary sense of the word be held
                    to attach to a young woman who breaks the commandment âThou shalt not steal,â
                    when not only she never heard of the prohibition, nor of the Being from whom it
                    emanated, but, on the contrary, had been taught from childhood that nothing
                    could be so righteous and so clever as to accomplish a successful theft, and
                    bring the proceeds home to receive a just rewardâwhile the extreme iniquity of
                    failing in a clumsy attempt at the noble art would be rightly visited by the
                    heaviest punishment? In giving this illustration we are drawing no fancy
                    picture. Persons answering to that description are frequently received in our
                    penal establishments; but we will give the details of one<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7158-132"></pb> typical case, which certainly sounds strangely
                    enough, as the record of a true existence in the midst of our boasted
                    civilisation and enlightenment.</p>
                <p>A women was transferred to our prison from one of the overflowing convict
                    institutions, under a long sentence. She was aged thirtyâfour years, and, as
                    usual, the list of her previous convictions was sent in along with her. From
                    this official document we learned that she had already been imprisoned
                    sixtyâfour times. It was a curious coincidence that the number of her terms of
                    incarceration almost exactly doubled her years of life, but such was undoubtedly
                    the fact. She looked even younger than her actual age. She was a small,
                    darkâeyed woman, whose countenance when she was brought into the jail bore a
                    somewhat evil expression; it was at least characterised by abiding sullenness
                    and illâtemper, and at first her conduct seemed to correspond with it. She was
                    refractory so far as she dared, and gave a good deal of trouble to the officers
                    set over her; but after a time of intercourse with her unofficial visitor, she
                    became a totally changed beingâgentle, <choice>

                        <reg>obedient</reg>
                    </choice>, and deeply grateful to those whom she found, to her utter amazement,
                    were really anxious to help and comfort her. Never before, in all the years of
                    her miserable life, had this poor forlorn outcast known what it was to meet with
                    pity or kindness from her fellowâcreatures, and the first touch of human
                    sympathy fell on the hard defiance of her despairing darkened spirit like a ray
                    of warm sunshine on ice that binds imprisoned waters. Very soon she yielded to
                    the yearning that, as we have said, arises in hours of solitary confinement, to
                    pour out to some friendly listener the mournful secrets of the past: and the
                    whole black record of a most hopeless existence was revealed in her own simple
                    uncouth language.</p>
                <p>âI never had no home,â she began, âno, nor yet a friendânever, never. Iâve been
                    full of trouble and misery all my days, and there was never any oneâman or
                    woman, rich or poorâto hold out a hand to me, and help me struggle out of it.
                    They wouldnât even let me alone, but they used to knock me about and force me to
                    thieve and fight for them, and then they made off and<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7158-134"></pb> left me to be caught by the police and locked up. The
                    first kind words as any one ever spoke to me have been in this here prison.â
                    Then she went on and told all her history, which we retail in fewer words. It
                    was true to the letter that she had never had a home. Her father had been a
                    street musician, and her mother spent all her time wandering from place to place
                    hawking anything she could find to sell. âHawkingâ in that class is very well
                    known to be a scarcely concealed pretence for begging or stealing whenever the
                    opportunity presents itself. At night the family retired to any one of the low
                    lodgingâhouses in the East End of London which had room for them; and when the
                    few necessary pence failed for even that uninviting shelter, they slept in a
                    railway arch or under some empty truck in a siding where they escaped notice.
                    Never, in her earlier years, did hapless No. 12 know what it was to lay her head
                    in any more decent sleepingâplace than the common room of one of those terrible
                    dens, where men and women of the most degraded class are herded together. Even
                    such semblance<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7158-135"></pb> of care and protection as a
                    father and mother so circumstanced could give her, was not long retained by the
                    unfortunate girl. Her father was an inveterate drunkard: he started on his
                    street round one day in his usual health, and before night fell he was found
                    dead from suffocation after a drinkingâfit, in which some illâbestowed shilling
                    had enabled him to indulge. His wife, if such she was, did not protract the
                    period of mourning for him. Very speedily she annexed another protector; and she
                    seems after that to have abandoned all care for her child, so that it made very
                    little difference to No. 12 when the close of her motherâs career came as
                    suddenly as that of her father. After a cold winterâs night, when the woman and
                    her soâcalled husband had not the means of paying even for leave to sit up in
                    the lodgingâhouse kitchen, which is sometimes granted to those who cannot afford
                    a bed, she was discovered lying across his feet stone dead from exposure in the
                    street. Thenceforward there existed no one on earth from whom No. 12 could claim
                    support or protection. Her first <choice>

                        <reg>imprisonment</reg>
                    </choice> took place at the age of ten yearsâthe punishment of a theft from a
                    shop, not by any means her earliest. The result of this sentence was, however,
                    to give her the best chance of rescue from evil that her sad destiny had ever
                    afforded her. She was sent to a reformatory. It must to some extent have been an
                    advantage to her, as she there learned to read, though imperfectly enough. It
                    does not seem, however, as if any effective moral influence had been brought to
                    bear upon her, for it is certain that she came out from that <foreign xml:lang="lat">quasi</foreign> prison, after a not very long detention, with
                    her ideas of right and wrong as entirely distorted as they had always been. She
                    was placed by the managers of the institution in a farmhouse to act as âgeneral
                    servantâ (<term>slavey</term>, she would have termed it) to the farmerâs wife.
                    Her tenure of this respectable employment came quickly to an abrupt conclusion.
                    She had been sent out one fine day into the fields, and being struck with
                    surprise and enthusiasm at the sight of wild flowers actually growing, so unlike
                    the faded noseâgays she had seen in the London streets, she<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7158-137"></pb> remained there gathering them long past the time when
                    she had been ordered by her mistress to return. It was probably the first
                    innocent employment on which she had ever voluntarily been engaged, and the
                    farmerâs wife punished her for it by instant dismissal. No. 12 was sent back
                    alone into the London streets with the very few shillings in her pocket which
                    constituted the wages she had earned. With these she proudly engaged a room for
                    herself, child as she still was; and having made a passing acquaintance with a
                    woman who lived opposite, she inquired of her whether she knew of any situation
                    vacant for a âslavey.â After various tentative experiences she drifted into a
                    house of very bad character. Happily a standâup fight with one of the inmates
                    caused her to be ignominiously cast out of it, and from thence she went to serve
                    in a publicâhouse.</p>
                <p>That was the end of all dim efforts at honest living. She was by that time about
                    sixteen years of age, and she very speedily took the last fatal step in ruin and
                    degradation, not even prompted thereto by any personal affection. No one
                        tried<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7158-138"></pb> to protect or save her; no one told
                    her that there were sin and misery in a shameless life on the streets, and to
                    that she passed hardly knowing what she did. In that terrible existence she
                    remained. It was varied only by perpetual imprisonments, sometimes for
                    assaultâshe had a fierce temper, which she never dreamt of controlling; very
                    often for theft; occasionally for breaking the plateâglass windows of a
                    ginâpalace. So she went on from one condition of wretchedness to another, tossed
                    like a hapless piece of driftwood on the waves of this troublesome
                    world;âbeaten, bruised in body and mind; illâtreated, knocked down by drunken
                    men;âdragged, resisting and halfâintoxicated, to prison by the police,âfeeling
                    that every one with whom she came in contact was her enemy; suffering continual
                    pain and privation, from which she knew no way of escape, save by that which
                    betterâinstructed persons held to be error and wickedness. Worn with the
                    struggle against her bitter fate, at length she found herself flung inside the
                    walls of our prison. It certainly seemed as if hers was as desperate a case for
                    the possibility of moral improvement<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7158-139"></pb> as had
                    ever come under the notice of chaplain or visitor, yet they could not feel that
                    it was by any means hopeless. It was perfectly evident that after she left the
                    reformatory this poor woman never had the ghost of a chance, in all her
                    trampledâdown existence, of rising to higher and purer hopes than those involved
                    in the passion of the moment, or of learning any other distinction between right
                    and wrong than that which brought greater or less misery to herself. The
                    extraordinary change which took place in her demeanour and conduct when she
                    realised that she was indeed no longer to be left friendless and unpitied,
                    justified the hopes which were soon entertained that she would do well in the
                    new position of honest and honourable living which was prepared for her
                    acceptance on her discharge from jail. It remains to be seen whether these hopes
                    will be realised in the future.<ref target="#skene-silent04">Â¹</ref></p>

                    of our preceding pages by a brief account of one of the strangest, as well as
                    the most comical, little personages who ever came under the grave, quiet
                    authority of the prison warders, and whose case was, above all others, difficult
                    to deal with, so far as the moral law was concerned. She was a diminutive
                    elderly woman, with a countenance full of vivacity and cleverness, and the
                    keenest of black eyes, which sparkled with malicious amusement whenever she
                    succeeded in perplexing the officers by some odd proceeding. She had a certain
                    air of refinement piercing through even the coarse convict garb, and was
                    undoubtedly a person of considerable education. She was always extremely
                    cheerful, and talked volubly and freely with the prison visitor, who alone was
                    allowed to converse privately with her. It was plain that she had known society
                    of a very different grade from most of her fellowâprisoners, and it might even
                    have been inferred from her manner that she had been in some capacity at Court,
                    or at least had managed to become acquainted with the traditions of that
                    exclusive sphere, for she would<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7158-141"></pb> insist, most
                    inappropriately, on treating her visitor to royal honours. Never did she
                    approach that individual without making three profound curtsies at different
                    stages of the advance, and invariably retired backward from the august presence
                    with the same elaborate ceremony. Apparently she had travelled much; and on one
                    occasion when she was getting the worst of an ethical argument with her visitor,
                    and she was desirous of changing the subject of conversation, she burst into a
                    torrent of French on a totally different theme, and spoke it faultlessly with an
                    admirable Parisian accent.</p>
                <p>Who she was, whence she came, and whither she went, when, refusing almost all
                    help in the most independent manner, she disappeared outside the prison gates on
                    her discharge, could never be elicited from her by any means whatever. She was,
                    however, open as the day respecting the offence which had brought her within the
                    grasp of the law. She described it minutelyâfirst emphasising the fact that she
                    considered it a most proper and virtuous proceeding. She had broken into a
                    house, she said, when the family were at<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7158-142"></pb>
                    church, and had taken therefrom some valuable property, with which she was
                    comfortably departing when, unfortunately, a contemptible spy had not only
                    watched her clever proceedings, but was actually base enough to give information
                    to the police. The cool selfâsatisfaction with which she related this daring
                    theft is quite indescribable.</p>
                <p>As it was the duty of the prison visitor to try and bring her to a better mind,
                    some allusion was naturally made to the Eighth Commandment; upon which she said,
                    with a slightly supercilious smile, that she was perfectly cognisant of that
                    injudicious enactment, and entirely disapproved of it. It was, she affirmed,
                    illogical, improper, unjust, and no sensible person would pay the smallest
                    attention to it. She then proceeded to prove the moral obligation she had been
                    under to commit this burglary. Her mode of reasoning showed that she must have
                    been consorting with Socialists and Communists, probably in France as well as in
                    England.</p>
                <p>âThe matter is perfectly simple,â she said; âthose people whose house I
                    enteredâthrough the window<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7158-143"></pb> âand from whom I
                        <emph>took</emph> (stealing is a very vulgar word) some trumpery articles,
                    were extremely wealthy; they had everything they could desire in the world, and
                    more a great deal than they required, while I had nothingânot even on that
                    particular day the means of providing myself with comfortable meals: it was
                    perfectly right and proper, therefore, that I should avail myself of their
                    superfluity. Why should they have more than they needed and I nothing? It would
                    have been more suitable, indeed, if I could have remained long enough to make a
                    just division of the whole property between myself and them; my only blunder was
                    in not being a little more sharp and careful, so as to evade those infamous
                    policemen, who will occupy themselves pertinaciously with the affairs of other
                    people.â</p>
                <p>When the old woman arrived at this point in her discourse, an attempt was made by
                    her listener to take a somewhat different view of the transaction, but it was
                    only received by her with a patronising smile and a wave of the hand, with which
                    she dismissed the argument.</p>
                <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7158-144"></pb>
                <p>âYes,â she said, âI perceive that these are your principles, and no doubt they
                    are shared by a few persons who hold to the old traditions; but I have been
                    assured by those who have the interests of the people really at heart that they
                    are obsolete, quite obsolete. There is a good time coming when there will be a
                    very different distribution of property, and the right adjustment of the matter
                    will not be only in this world,ââthen she nodded her head significantly, and
                    hinted that so wellâinformed a person as the visitor must doubtless be quite
                    aware of the probable unpleasant destination of the rich in a future state.</p>
                <p>This provoking old personage was certainly a most peculiar specimen of a
                    prisoner. She took all the pains and penalties of her position, even the
                    uninviting diet which is usually much deplored, in the most airy and cheerful
                    manner imaginable. She effectually baffled any attempt at the improvement of her
                    mind and morals. Some steps were taken at the time of her release to give her
                    facilities for gaining an honest living, but there was not much reason to hope
                    that she would really <pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7158-145"></pb> avail herself of them.
                    It was evident that she intended to continue her system of profiting by other
                    peopleâs superfluities; and as she was far advanced in life, it seemed probable
                    that she would end her days during some long term of penal servitude.</p>
                <p>We need scarcely say that the few instances we have now given do not represent
                    the gravest perplexities with which the appointed visitor to a prison has to
                    contend: there are others much more serious, as well as more sorrowful, on which
                    we have not yet touched. But whatever may be the difficulties of the work, we
                    must repeat our conviction that the employment of efficient voluntary workers is
                    the only means whereby our prisons couldâin addition to their present use as
                    mere places of punishmentâbecome also active agencies for the amelioration of
                    the criminal classes. The policeâcourt missions and prisonersâ aid societies,
                    which are established in most large towns, deserve all credit for the amount of
                    good work they succeed in accomplishing; but they can only reach the criminal
                    after his release, when the first <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7158-146"></pb> breath of
                    recovered freedom acts like a sort of intoxication on his senses, and renders
                    him too often impervious to all but the wild desire to rush away into the old
                    lawless life, with the boon companions who are generally waiting at the prison
                    gate to welcome him back to their ranks. These agencies meet him at a great
                    disadvantage; but it is very different when he is under the sobering influence
                    of a long imprisonment, when the advice and instruction given to him are matured
                    by reflection in the solitude of his cell, and when definite arrangements can be
                    made beforehand for starting him on a better way of life immediately on his
                    discharge. We have been the more anxious to ventilate this question of prison
                    reform because there seems reason to hope, as we have said, that the necessity
                    for an organisation of free volunteer workers is making itself felt at
                    headquarters, and that the dread naturally existing in the minds of the jail
                    authorities respecting so great an innovation of established rule, may gradually
                    be overcome by a clearer comprehension of the great interests involved in the
                    question.</p>

                <epigraph>
                    <l>âA little struggle at first, of course,</l>
                    <l>A little gasping for one more breath,</l>
                    <l>A little agony, nothing worse,</l>
                    <l>And then the long sweet sleep of death.â</l>
                </epigraph>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> many singular phases of human life with which the visitor to a
                    prison is naturally made acquainted, do not constitute by any means the
                    strangest spectacle to be witnessed within those silent walls. A much more
                    remarkable phenomenon may be studied there, in the peculiar aspect which death
                    assumes in that region of sin and sorrow and remorse. In the outside world, as
                    we all know only too well, not even the brightness of immortal hopes can
                    altogether dispel the gloom and sadness which surround that <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7158-148"></pb> inexorable mystery. Should the tyranny of life strip
                    it of all terrors for ourselves, still nothing can assuage the anguish of
                    surrendering the objects of our helpless love to its stern demand; and
                    habituated as we thus are, to see it ever hanging like a menacing shadow over
                    the fairest joys existence has to offer us, it strikes on the consciousness with
                    a weird sense of wonder and awe to meet it in the attractive guise it wears
                    within the prisonerâs cell. Not for themselves, or for any whom they love, do
                    these erring wayâworn men and women dread the last mysterious change; its
                    poetical nameâthe âangel of deathââis to them a blest reality. It has for them
                    no gloom, no repulsion; it is their hope, their desireâalways their best, often
                    their only friend. What must life have been to them when the thought of escape
                    from it is so dear and sweet that death is most eagerly sought, and ever
                    welcome! They look forward to it as the gracious termination of the longâborne
                    pain of existenceâthe cessation of consciousness, which in their experience is
                    mainly sufferingâthe triumphant <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7158-149"></pb> release from
                    bonds and punishment and the iron power of the law, against which, living, they
                    must ever struggle in vain. It must not be supposed, however, that they are
                    influenced in this respect by the vague impression that their last hour on earth
                    may possibly usher them into a brighter and moreâenduring existence,âit is the
                    mere fact of death in its freedom and rest, wholly unconnected with any idea of
                    a future state, which shines like a star of hope before their eager eyes. Seldom
                    indeed does it occur to them to look in any sense beyond it. âTo die, to
                    sleep,ââthus far they go with Hamlet; but they never follow him to the deeper
                    issueââIn that sleep of death, what dreams may come!â If the teaching and
                    efforts of others force upon their knowledge some possibility of a conscious
                    life beyond the grave which lures them with its untroubled rest, the visions
                    thus evoked are all too dim and shadowy to carry their gaze past that reality of
                    death itself which seems to them so blissful. They know its outward aspect,âthey
                    have beheld it often; they have seen a fellowâprisoner carried out from those
                        <pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7158-150"></pb> impregnable walls, âfree among the deadâ;
                    they have looked on the once tormented, stormâtossed frame sunk in profound
                    reposeâeyes that were wont to weep scalding tears, closed in tranquil
                    slumberâhands that toiled in vain to win the bread which at last they snatched
                    by crime, folded in calm inaction on the quiet breast. This is enough; it is
                    real, it is tangible; and to that haven of peace, when the fever and struggle of
                    life are over, they look with inexpressible desire, that often cannot wait the
                    legitimate hour for its gratification.</p>
                <p>Certain true histories which have come within the range of our experience will
                    sufficiently show that we are not trusting to any vague theories, in thus
                    describing the beneficent and alluring aspect which death wears within the
                    Silent World, and these are not by any means confined to cases of actual
                    suicide. The passionate belief in the last dread change, as the greatest boon
                    life can offer, has been seen by us to take action in forms much more singular
                    than mere selfâdestruction. One of the strangest instances of a man enamoured of
                        <pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7158-151"></pb> death that ever came under our notice was
                    that of an old agricultural labourer, whom we will call Richard Hodson. He was
                    about sixty years of age, absolutely illiterate, of sound mind so far as his
                    intelligence went, but without an idea beyond his daily work and the
                    circumstances of his domestic life. He had apparently no religious belief. If
                    any dim recollections remained with him of the Sundayâschool teaching of his
                    childish days, it never seemed to occur to him that they could have any personal
                    reference to his own destiny here or hereafter. There was a church in his native
                    village, but he never entered it; and the only mode of âsaying his prayers,â of
                    which his wife sometimes spoke, was simply by his use of language more
                    undesirably forcible than usual. Hodsonâs life had been singularly devoid of any
                    element of pleasure or happiness. It had been spent in ceaseless grinding toil
                    to procure the bare means of subsistence, and the home to which he returned
                    after his dayâs labour was rendered distasteful to him by the sullen temperament
                    of his wife, his only companion. He had but one childâa daughterâand she lived
                    at a <choice>
                        <orig>disâ<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7158-152"></pb> tance</orig>
                        <reg>distance</reg>
                    </choice>, entirely separated from him by her marriage with a man who had
                    treated her wrongly, and with whom, therefore, Hodson had a deadly quarrel. It
                    would have been hard to say whether he or his wife was the most thoroughly
                    illâtempered. They often passed days and even weeks together in their small
                    cottage without addressing a single syllable to each other. It was not a
                    cheerful abode under the circumstances; and certainly Richard Hodsonâs existence
                    was altogether so hopelessly unattractive, that he might be forgiven for not
                    caring particularly to prolong it.</p>
                <p>One beautiful evening in the month of May the man came home after having been
                    hard at work from early daylight. There was a small kitchenâgarden attached to
                    his cottage, on which he and his wife depended entirely for a supply of
                    vegetables with which to eke out their scanty meals. Some piece of work within
                    its narrow limits required to be finished at once, if they were not to lose the
                    benefit of the uncertain fine weather; but the man was tired, and he felt that
                    he must have efficient help if he was to get the necessary task <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7158-153"></pb> done that night. He asked his wife if she would go
                    with him to the garden and give him her assistance for an hour, so that they
                    might provide against the chance of rain on the morrow. She answered that she
                    would see him far enough before she lifted a finger to help him in that or in
                    anything else. Thereafter a fit of desperation seemed to take possession of the
                    man. A frantic desire seized him to make an end of the weary intolerable
                    business of existence altogether, both for himself and the woman who so
                    ingeniously managed to intensify its bitterness. He felt that if he obeyed this
                    strong impulse without delay, the proceeding would have the additional advantage
                    of enabling him to taste the sweets of revenge, which at that moment appeared to
                    him peculiarly delectable; and, in short, the whole transaction assumed so
                    bewitching an aspect to his mind, that he did not hesitate in accomplishing it
                    fully then and there. Within an hour from the time when his wife refused to work
                    with him in their little garden, he had most effectually made an end of her, and
                    was himself in the safe custody of the police on his way to the county <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7158-154"></pb> jail. He surrendered himself to them with the
                    utmost cheerfulness when they approached with the handcuffs, and made but this
                    one remarkââNow Iâll go to the gallows like a prince.â</p>
                <p>These words, or others to the same effect, he repeated at intervals during the
                    few weeks which elapsed before he took his trial; and there can be no question
                    that they embodied the feeling which was uppermost in his mind.</p>
                <p>Hodson could neither read nor write, and the time hung somewhat heavy on his
                    hands, while waiting till his fate should be settled at the Assizes. He
                    therefore welcomed the present writer eagerly to his cell, as the visit afforded
                    him an opportunity for a little conversation; but it was all on one themeâhow
                    ready and anxious he was to die. Nothing could be said to give him the least
                    idea that his wish in this respect would not be ratified. The cruel deed he had
                    so strangely committed seemed to have been completely motiveless and
                    inexcusable, and it was plain that no available steps could be taken by any one
                    to avert the consequences. In fact, when the day of his trial <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7158-155"></pb> arrived, the manâs absolute determination to die
                    frustrated the humane and anxious efforts of his judge to give him any chance of
                    escape that might be justified by the law. Nothing could exceed the kindness and
                    consideration shown by Sir â to this unhappy criminal, in marked contrast to
                    what occurred with regard to a case we have already had an opportunity of
                    describing in these pages. Had there been the slightest possible ground on which
                    his crime could have been reduced to manslaughter, the highâminded judge would
                    gladly have availed himself of it; but Richard Hodson rendered any idea of the
                    kind abortive, by insisting, in defiance of all the advice given him, on
                    pleading guilty to wilful murder.</p>
                <p>It is extremely rare in the annals of our courts of justice that such a plea
                    should be recordedânot more than once, we believe, in a century; and of course,
                    if accepted, it could only, according to the existing law, be followed by an
                    immediate sentence of death.</p>
                <p>The manâs words, firm and decided, âI am guilty,â were heard with dismay by all
                    in the court; but the <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7158-156"></pb> judge was resolved, if
                    possible, not to allow his selfâcondemnation to be received as final, and the
                    conversation which ensued between him and the prisoner was so singular, that we
                    give it verbatim as it was taken down by the shorthand writer at the time,
                    omitting only some irrelevant remarks.</p>
                <p>âBefore I accept that plea,â said the judge, âI wish you thoroughly to understand
                    that you are charged with wilful murderâthat is to say, causing the death of
                    your wife, meaning to murder her. If that is what you mean to say, you plead
                    guilty to an offence for which you will be sentenced to be changed by the neck
                    till you be dead, within a fortnight of the present time. Do you mean that you
                    desire to plead guilty to that, and undergo the consequencesâdo you mean
                    that?â</p>
                <p>â I done the deed, sir; I killed her dead.â</p>
                <p>âThat is not murder,â replied the judge, âThe offence you are charged with, is
                    that of killing her intending to kill her dead. That is murder; the other would
                    be manslaughter. Do you wish to plead guilty to the offence of murder, for which
                    you will have to be hanged in about a fortnight, <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7158-157"></pb> or do you wish to be tried? Prisoner, do you wish to
                    be tried, or do you wish to be hanged? â</p>
                <p>âI wish to be hanged, sirâout of itâyes!â</p>
                <p>âWhether you are guilty or not?â asked the judge.</p>
                <p>âI am guilty, sir.â</p>
                <p>âI think it a little doubtful whether you really do understand the law which is
                    applicable in this caseâand if there is any doubt, it is better that the offence
                    should be investigated by a jury, so that the exact truth may be knownâ</p>
                <p>âI have nothing more to say,â said the prisoner; âI done the deed, and must put
                    up with the consequences.â</p>
                <p>Some discussion ensued between the judge, the counsel, and others as to whether
                    the man understood the difference between murder and manâslaughter.</p>
                <p>The judge then again addressed the prisoner: âI think this is really a case in
                    which one ought to have the matter investigated. I must enter a plea of not
                    guilty, that you may be tried.â The necessary formality was gone through, and
                    then <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7158-158"></pb> the judge continued: âYou will have to
                    be tried, because I have entered a plea of not guilty. Do you wish to conduct
                    you own case, or would you like some Counsel to appear for you and make the best
                    case he can for you?â</p>
                <p>âI would sooner have it now, and done with it,â answered the prisoner. âI donât
                    want anybody to plead anything for me, sirânothing at all.â</p>
                <p>âYou do not wish me to assign Counsel for you?â</p>
                <p>âNo, sir.â</p>
                <p>âAs you are going to be tried, I offer that there should be some Counsel to see
                    that you have fairâplayâdo you wish that?â</p>
                <p>âI would sooner have it settled, and done away withâover and done with.â</p>
                <p>âIt cannot be settled now,â replied the judge; âyou will have to be tried
                    toâmorrow: all I ask is, whether on your trial you wish to conduct your own
                    case, or whether you would like some Counsel to speak for you?â</p>
                <p>âI donât want anybody to talk for meâI will take it in my own hands.â</p>
                <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7158-159"></pb>
                <p>There was nothing more to be said, and the prisoner was removed, but the judge
                    did not desist from his efforts to induce the man to allow a Counsel to be
                    assigned to him next day, and finally this was done. Hodson was fairly driven
                    into giving a most unwilling consent. The Counsel did his best: he made a very
                    eloquent speech, in which he attempted to set up a plea of insanity, but, as
                    might have been expected, it failed completely. Not only did all the persons
                    called to give evidence bear witness to the prisonerâs previous soundness of
                    mind, but it was impossible for any one to look at the quiet selfâcontrolled
                    man, who listened with imperturbable composure to the history of his own deed of
                    violence, without feeling satisfied that he was in perfect possession of his
                    faculties and reason. The trial ended with the inevitable result, and Richard
                    Hodson heard his sentence of death with as calm and cheerful a countenance as if
                    it had been the announcement of some rare piece of good fortune. He maintained
                    the same unmoved contented demeanour during the interval which elapsed between
                    his <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7158-160"></pb> trial and execution. He was very willing
                    to listen to the chaplainâs instructions, if only <foreign xml:lang="fre">pour
                        passer le temps</foreign>; and it seemed quite an agreeable surprise to him
                    to discover that when he had got rid of this extremely unsatisfactory existence,
                    it was possible that a different form of life, somewhat better and happier,
                    might then open out before him. He was quite docile in accomplishing all that he
                    was told to do in the way of religious preparation with a view to that
                    contingency, but it is doubtful whether the pleasant certainty that he was about
                    âto be hanged, and out of itâyes!â did not loom so large in his mind as the sum
                    of his desires, that little space was left for any less tangible hope. Yet there
                    were various indications that this strange complacency, in prospect of a
                    dreadful doom, was not the mere brutish indifference of a low order of
                    intelligence. Hodson showed feeling in many ways, as well as a strong sense of
                    gratitude, tinctured with astonishment, for the sympathy and kindness manifested
                    towards him in the jail. This was shown in a touching little incident on the
                    Sunday before his death.<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7158-161"></pb> The chaplain was
                    wont, on these sad occasions, to let the condemned man choose the hymns himself
                    for the last service in which he would join with his fellowâprisoners, and
                    naturally those selected were always such as were suitable to the dying.</p>
                <p>It is one of the experiences of a prison visitor, which is certainly not
                    enviable, to have to meet the wistful gaze of a man standing up, strong and
                    healthful in full vigour of life, while he sings such words as these, â<q rend="inline">Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,</q>â knowing that
                    his own undimmed eyes would be closed in death within a few hours. Under these
                    circumstances, during the last service which Richard Hodson attended, the
                    writer, who was accompanying the hymn on the harmonium, involuntarily looked up
                    at him, and was surprised to see him suddenly turn his head away and burst into
                    tears. He had always been so cheerful, that it could only be supposed the full
                    horror of his position had suddenly revealed itself to him; and under that
                    impression the chaplain, on being told after service of the manâs unusual
                    agitation, went at once to his cell to offer such consolation as <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7158-162"></pb> might be possible. He found, however, to his
                    surprise, that the condemned criminalâs emotion had not been in the least on his
                    own account. He had observed, he said, that when the visitor glanced at him
                    during the singing of the mournful hymn, it had been with a look of pain and
                    distress; and the idea that he had thus caused a person wholly unconnected with
                    his crime to suffer grief for his sake, as well as several others who were, he
                    knew, greatly troubled at his fate, had shown him that a manâs evil deeds go far
                    beyond himself in their malevolent influence, and he felt suddenly overcome with
                    a sort of remorseâit had gone to his heart, he said, and forced from his eyes
                    the tears he would not have shed for himself.</p>
                <p>Hodsonâs indomitable cheerfulness on the fateful morning was such as the prison
                    officials had never before witnessed in any case. He was to die at eight
                    oâclock. At seven he went through a private religious service in the chapel. At
                    halfâpast seven his breakfast was brought to him in his cell: he drew a chair to
                    the table and sat down to it with an excellent appetite; he proceeded to go
                    through <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7158-163"></pb> all the little processes necessary
                    for making the best of the food set before him, in the most leisurely manner
                    possible. He was still engaged upon it when the ominous knock came to the door
                    which announced the executioner; then he quietly laid down the last mouthful of
                    bread he had been about to eat, and yielded himself up to the hands that in five
                    minutes more had finished their work upon him.</p>
                <p>It seems right, in the interests of other criminals who may have to meet the same
                    doom, to state what occurred at the execution of Richard Hodson, though we will
                    touch on the painful facts as briefly as we can. The unfortunate man suffered a
                    death to which he had not been condemned by lawâhe was, in fact, violently
                    decapitated. In the opinion of the bystanders, this frightful catastrophe
                    occurred entirely through the mismanagement of the official most concerned. The
                    manner in which that individual treated the matter at the inquest, was not
                    calculated to allay the universal indignation aroused by the event: he spoke of
                    it with careless unconcern, as a little accident which was quite likely to
                    happen often <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7158-164"></pb> on these occasions, and which
                    simply could not be helped. This opinion was endorsed, only in more gentlemanly
                    terms, by an answer given to a question asked in Parliament respecting the case
                    of Hodson. It was then again affirmed that such occurrences might be expected
                    when the physical characteristics of the criminals were of a nature to produce
                    them.</p>
                <p>If there must be a death penalty in England, it would surely be well that it
                    should be accomplished in such a way as to render similar cruelties impossible.
                    Since the first day of the present year, it has been the law in America that
                    executions should be carried out by electricity. Whether or not this may be a
                    desirable mode of operation, it would at all events prevent such terrible
                    occurrences as that which took place at the death of Richard Hodson.</p>
                <p>Persons comforted themselves on that occasion, as they are wont to do under other
                    aspects of the final mystery, by the assumption that at least death had been
                    instantaneous. This is not a subject which ought to be discussed in these <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7158-165"></pb> pages, but we cannot leave it without the
                    simple statement, founded on recent experiments in France and elsewhere which
                    have conclusively proved the fact,âthat it is not possible to assign to any
                    fixed time the cessation of consciousness. So far as the investigation has gone
                    at present, there is ample evidence that it endures to a later period after the
                    breath ceases, than has been supposed to be the case hitherto.</p>
                <p>The ethics of suicide, as they may be studied within the Silent World, offer many
                    problems for serious consideration. It is an indictable offence, and we have
                    therefore the opportunity of seeing it under very varied aspects, some of which
                    we shall exemplify by giving an account of a few typical cases. In one respect,
                    however, they are all absolutely identical, and that is in the immutable
                    conviction, on the part of the persons concerned, that they have a perfect right
                    to destroy their own lives if it pleases them to do so, and that the act does
                    not render them guilty of any sin in the sight of God, although it has been
                    decreed that it should be reckoned an infringement of human <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7158-166"></pb> laws. So far as the experience of the present writer
                    extends, it has been found completely impossible to convince men and women who
                    are desirous of ridding themselves of the burden of existence, that they will
                    commit even a venial error by accomplishing their own release. It is simply
                    useless, in discussing the question with them, to call it the crime of
                    selfâmurder, or to talk of the sanctity of human life which God alone can give,
                    and therefore He alone has a right to recall. Nothing can shake their immovable
                    conviction that their life is given them as a prey to make of it what they will.
                    In the case of prisoners who are suffering punishment for the attempt to put an
                    end to their existence, there is sometimes a diplomatic endeavour, from mere
                    policy, to give an assent to the moral reflections pressed upon them; but when
                    driven to speak their minds honestly, they invariably repeat that they see no
                    reason why they should not get quit as they please of an embarrassing
                    possession, with which no one but themselves has any concern whatever.</p>
                <p>This mode of dealing with the subject is <choice>
                        <orig>perâ<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7158-167"></pb> haps</orig>
                        <reg>perhaps</reg>
                    </choice> natural enough on the part of persons who have never taken any serious
                    view of their moral responsibilities, but it is less easy to account for the
                    extraordinary lightâheartedness with which, for the most part, they are ready to
                    plunge into the unknown darkness of the last mysterious change. As we have
                    already said, no thought of what may lie beyond disturbs their mind; but it
                    might have been imagined that the ghastly associations of the grave, and its
                    slow decay, would at least have moved them to some shrinking from the physical
                    results of dissolution. It is not so: they take the fatal step as easily and
                    carelessly as they would lay themselves down to sleep in their bed.</p>
                <p>âIf you had succeeded in your attempt to kill yourself,â the writer said to a
                    young prisoner who had been rescued almost lifeless from the river where she had
                    flung herself, âyou would have been lying now cold and stiff under the
                    coffinâlid, unable to see the light of day or to hear the voice of a friend, and
                    with no time left for repentance, or even so much as a prayer to the God whose
                    commandment you were breaking. Are you not <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7158-168"></pb>
                    thankful to be restored to life and the opportunity of amendment?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â she said, lightly; âfor if they had let me alone, I should have been done
                    with it all, and had no more trouble or worry, and that was just what I wanted.
                    I wish they had left me at the bottom of the river.â</p>
                <p>Sometimes the immediate causes which lead to suicide seem strangely
                    disproportioned to the gravity of the step. One girl, who was ready to fling
                    maledictions at her rescuers, had three several times done her best to put an
                    end to her existence. On two of these occasions she had, so far as her own will
                    was concerned, practically succeededâonce by poison, and once by strangulation.
                    She was to all appearance dead, after one desperate attempt, and would very soon
                    have been so in reality, but for the care and toil bestowed on her by a kindly
                    physician who was sent for on the discovery of her condition, and who spent a
                    whole night in unceasing efforts to restore animation. He succeeded at last, and
                    she did not thank him! She was given up to what <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7158-169"></pb> she and her companions of the same unhappy class term with unconscious irony
                    âa gay life,â and she did find a fitful hollow enjoyment in the excitement of
                    evenings spent in theatres and dancingâbooths, and in the extravagant dresses
                    and jewellery with which she adorned herself; but there came to her sudden
                    moments, when the whole brilliant phantasmagoria of her existence would seem to
                    roll away from her, and the reality of her position appear in its true colours,
                    and straightway, without an instantâs hesitation, she would take the best means
                    in her power to divest herself of it altogether. She exemplified the truism that
                    extremes meet. For the manner in which the subject is regarded by these, the
                    lowest outcasts of the people, is exactly similar to the view taken of it by the
                    highâclass leaders of society in modern France, where it is the fashion now to
                    say, âOn vit parceque Ã  moins de se tuerâon ne peut pas faire autrement.â The
                    hapless inmates of our prisons, however, consider the alternative of killing
                    themselves preferable to an unwilling endurance of the primary evil.</p>
                <pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7158-170"></pb>
                <p>While the recklessness and indifference with which suicide is resorted to is
                    almost universal in the lower stratum of society, the causes which lead to the
                    impulse are of course very varied, and often most pathetic. A poor old woman,
                    who had nearly reached the Scriptural threescore years and ten, was sentenced
                    lately to a short term of imprisonment for attempting selfâdestruction. It had
                    very nearly been successful, and in fact was so in the end, as the shock to her
                    system from immersion in iceâcold water proved fatal, and she only lived one
                    week after her release from jail. She related her simple history with the utmost
                    composure. She had lived happily and respectably with her husband from the time
                    of her early marriage in youth. He had a pension as a retired soldier, which
                    supported them in comparative comfort when he was too old to work. Their home
                    for twentyâeight years had been the little cottage in which he died at the
                    commencement of an unusually severe winter. âHe had been an angel,â the poor
                    woman saidââso good and steady, and so kind to her;â and when he was gone, she
                    clung <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7158-171"></pb> with passionate attachment to the
                    little house in which she had spent so many happy years with himâbut she could
                    not pay the rent. His pension had of course expired with him, and she was, in
                    fact, without the means of living at all. She began by selling her little
                    possessions one after another in order to obtain food, and in this way she
                    managed to live for a few weeks. When everything was gone except the scanty
                    furniture of one room, the landlord appeared and claimed it for his unpaid rent.
                    It was all carted away, including even the chest containing her clothing: then
                    he turned her into the street and locked the door. There was but one refuge open
                    to her on earthâthe workâhouse; but that last abode of wretchedness seems to
                    hold a place in the minds of the poorâundeservedly we thinkâequivalent in horror
                    to one of the circles of Danteâs Inferno. The idea of going to the âUnion,â as
                    she would have called it, does not seem to have occurred to the forlorn widow.
                    She looked back for a moment at the closed door of her little earthly paradise,
                    and then took her way shivering through a public park to the river. <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7158-172"></pb> There, without apparently the slightest shrinking or
                    dread, she flung herself into the water under a cold wintry sky. Two men
                    happened to be going past in a boat. They rescued her just as she was sinking;
                    and after consciousness had been restored, she was brought to the prison. She
                    passed the time of her sojourn there in a strange dreamy state, talking only of
                    her husband, and her hope of seeing him perhaps again if she could succeed in
                    âgetting out of this weary world.â The hope of reunion had successfully been
                    suggested to her mind by the religious consolations afforded to her in the
                    prison, but it proved completely impossible to persuade her that she had not
                    been perfectly justified in trying to die. She would have been quite willing to
                    have repeated the experiment the moment she was free to do so, if death had not
                    mercifully come to her uncalled, and thus at last her desire was granted.</p>
                <p>A young man was once committed to jail on the same charge, who had acted
                    apparently with as little thought of all that death might mean, as had been
                    manifested by the simple old widow; <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7158-173"></pb> but his
                    case was otherwise in marked contrast to hers.</p>
                <p>He had been fairly well educated, the son of a respectable tradesman who lived
                    with his family in London, and the young man was extremely pleasing both in
                    appearance and manners. It happened that the writer saw him for the first time
                    when he was being conveyed to the jail by the police, immediately after he had
                    been taken out of the river in which he had tried to drown himself. It was
                    rather a piteous spectacle: his hat had been lost, and his fair hair, dripping
                    wet, hung over his eyes, that were glancing vaguely from side to side. He walked
                    feebly, leaning heavily on his grim supporters, and had altogether a bewildered
                    look, as if he could not understand how he happened to be still alive. Under the
                    circumstances the visitor was very glad to be left alone with him in the prison
                    cell next day, in order to hear from him what had led to his abhorrence of life
                    at an age when it is wont to wear its brightest hues before the unclouded eyes
                    of youth. He was quite willing to tell his story without reserve; but the <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7158-174"></pb> sum and substance of his explanation was
                    simply this: âI could not face my mother.â</p>
                <p>He had been expected home for a holiday on the evening of the day when he had
                    flung his young life to the river depths. He had preferred to lie âuncoffined
                    and unannealedâ rather than meet his motherâs reproachful eyes. He had been the
                    best loved of her childrenâapparently, as is often the case, just because he had
                    been the wildest and most unmanageable. His brothers and sisters were all doing
                    well in good situationsâsteady and respectableâhelping their parents out of
                    their earnings; but he had never been successful in anything, simply because his
                    roving disposition had led him to abandon every employment he had tried, after a
                    short time, and go off in quest of something new. He had been unstable and
                    thoughtless, fond of amusement, and, above all, of his liberty; but he did not
                    seem to have been addicted to vice of any kind. A spendthrift, however, he had
                    been most emphatically, and his mother had again and again struggled to pay his
                    debts and give him a fresh start in some new career. This she had done a <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7158-175"></pb> very few months previously, and a good
                    opening had been found for him in a provincial city. She had furnished him with
                    the means of establishing him in it, and had made a heartfelt appeal to him to
                    give up his careless, unsatisfactory ways, and set himself to work hard for his
                    living in an honest, respectable manner. She told him that if he failed again,
                    she did not think it would be possible for her to help him out of any further
                    difficulty. She had come to an end of her resources, and this was really his
                    last chance and hers; if he again came back to her penniless and in debt, it
                    would break her heart. Thus far the young man had gone quickly through his
                    history, but when he came to that point he turned his head away, shamefaced and
                    crimson to the temples, with tears in his eyes. Then he owned that the love of
                    pleasure and freedom had again been too much for him. The weather had been
                    beautiful and sunny; the duties of his post kept him at grinding toil amid dust
                    and gloom. Without a thought of the future, or of the consequences one way or
                    another, he had broken away from it all, following the first shining temptation
                        <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7158-176"></pb> that had lured him out to a summer dayâs
                    enjoyment. Then, ashamed to go back to his employers, yet more ashamed to face
                    his mother, to whom alone he could turn even for food and shelter, he had obeyed
                    a sudden wayward impulse, and flung himself to the embrace of death, with no
                    other thought but that it was a means of escaping his immediate difficulties. It
                    appeared that he had not for a single moment reflected on the dread import of
                    the act, whereby he not only destroyed all the fair promise of a life in this
                    world which had scarce reached maturity, but imperilled also the fairer hopes
                    that might have shone for him in the eternal future.</p>
                <p>The term of imprisonment which this young man went through proved to be of
                    incalculable value to him. His advisers within the jail saw that it was a case
                    which required very plain speaking as to the errors of his past, if his future
                    was to be conducted on better principles and more creditable motives. He was not
                    spared any of the stern truths which his unjustifiable conduct demanded; and he
                    had ample time to ponder <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7158-177"></pb> them in the solitude
                    of his cell. The result was that a really remarkable change took place in him:
                    his eyes were opened to the serious misdeeds of which he had been guilty; and
                    although, in his case as in all others, it was impossible to make him believe
                    that suicide was in itself a crime, he yet did perceive most strongly, how
                    utterly unfit and unprepared he had been for an entrance on the unseen
                    eternity.</p>
                <p>When the time came for his release from prison, he found that those who had not
                    hesitated to deal severely with him, so far as his moral turpitude was
                    concerned, were ready to be his true friends in helping him to make a new
                    beginning. Some necessary assistance was given to him; he was reconciled to his
                    parents, and amply fulfilled his promises of amendment. Most satisfactory
                    accounts have been received of him, and of the steadiness and selfâdenial with
                    which he laboured to support himself in an honest and independent manner. It was
                    one of those cases in which the advantages of the system of prisonâworkers was
                    strikingly manifest. If this young man had left the jail as reckless <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7158-178"></pb> and hopeless as when he entered it, the probabilities
                    are that he would at once have taken means to accomplish more effectually than
                    before his final disappearance out of this visible world.</p>
                <p>We had another equally successful instance of complete reformation, in the case
                    of a woman, who was, without exception, the most lawless and daring young person
                    whom we ever found trying conclusions with the authority of the prison
                    officials. She was a handsome blackâeyed girl, lithe and active, possessed of an
                    inexhaustible fund of energy and vigour, of which she made use in every reckless
                    freak she could think ofânot excepting a rush into the realms of death whenever
                    the fancy took her to invade his unseen dominion. The beginning of her troubles
                    in this life had been a stepmother. That especial relation is a fruitful source
                    of evil and misery, to the uncontrolled and undisciplined class which swells the
                    population of our prisons.</p>
                <p>No. 14, after a few pitched battles with the functionary who occupied that
                    position in her fatherâs house, had departed one dark night from<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7158-179"></pb> her home, and was seen of her natural protectors no
                    more. In all the various phases of the wild career on which she entered, she
                    adhered steadfastly to the resolution she had taken that they should never hear
                    of her again, or so much as know whether she were alive or dead. She changed her
                    name, and, delighting in the entire liberty she had achieved, gave all
                    considerations of morals or propriety to the winds, abandoning herself, in fact,
                    to an extremely undesirable mode of existence. She succeeded in committing
                    nearly every offence that could be thought of against the majesty of the law,
                    excepting murder. She was not at all an illâtempered or covetous woman, and had
                    no animosity against any one, when once safe out of reach of the detested
                    stepmother. Her thefts seemed to be committed rather from a spirit of daring and
                    bravado than from any wish to become possessed of other peopleâs property. Of
                    course she made acquaintance with the interior of a good many prisons. In one of
                    those, situated at some distance from the jail with which the writer is
                    connected, she perpetrated an escapade of a <choice>
                        <orig>suffiâ <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7158-180"></pb> ciently</orig>
                        <reg>sufficiently</reg>
                    </choice> original nature to be published in the newspapers. She had been
                    summoned to the room of the chief female warder to be reprimanded for some of
                    her customary infractions of rule, and when the officerâs back was turned for a
                    moment, she sprang like a cat at the window, shivered the glass, forced herself
                    through the bars, and, at the imminent risk of breaking her neck, dropped from a
                    considerable height to the ground. Just at first she lay stunned; but quickly
                    recovering consciousness, she managed in some unaccountable manner to scale the
                    walls which still intervened between herself and liberty, and the night being
                    pitchâdark, she got clear away before the officers sent in pursuit could succeed
                    in capturing her. She was dressed in the tellâtale convict clothes, and
                    therefore hurried under cover of the darkness to the house of an acquaintance in
                    one of the lowest parts of the town. There, by fair means or foul, she obtained
                    possession of a suit of menâs attire, arrayed herself in it, cut off her long
                    hair, and thus disguised, went out into the world in search of fresh adventures.
                    She roamed about at her <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7158-181"></pb> leisure, having
                    assumed a gruff tone of voice and a swaggering gait, and for a long time no one
                    doubted that she had a right to a place among the lords of the creation; but a
                    misdemeanour of some kind brought her once more into the hands of the police,
                    and then not only was her sex discovered, but her identity also with the
                    prisoner whose daring escape from prison had been heard of in all directions.
                    Finally her career of independence terminated in her being brought under a long
                    sentence to our prison. There unceasing efforts were made to influence the poor
                    girl for good, and to save her from herself,âfor she was, in the fullest sense
                    of the word, her own worst enemy; her reckless disposition and untamed passions
                    were the true source of all that she had endured of misery and peril. When the
                    time of her release arrived, she was placed in a safe shelter, and she at once
                    commenced a regular correspondence with the visitor of the jail she had
                    left.</p>
                <p>Will it be believed, after the history we have given of her exploits, that when
                    we last received a letter from No. 14, she wrote out of the <choice>
                        <orig>cloisâ <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7158-182"></pb> tered</orig>
                        <reg>cloistered</reg>
                    </choice> Home of an English Sisterhood,âbeing herself a professed member of
                    their community, and having, after a severe novitiate, passed to the regular and
                    austere life of a nun, bound by perpetual vows? Yet such is the literal fact;
                    and to those who have had a long experience of the vagaries of human nature in
                    her rank of life, it does not appear so very extraordinary.</p>
                <p>No. 14 was really possessed of some very fine qualities underlying her wild
                    impulses, and amongst these was a passionate strength of affection, which had
                    never known any legitimate outlet till she found a friend within the walls of
                    our prison, to whom she attached herself vehemently, and through whom she learnt
                    to know the Supreme Object of an adoration that could alone satisfy and subdue
                    her ardent nature. She had received very little religious teaching of any kind
                    in her young days, but she had always had dim instinctive longings for something
                    better and purer than the life she was leading. When the fair vision was shown
                    to her of a Love that for her sake had been stronger than death, she gave
                    herself up to it with a depth <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7158-183"></pb> of repentance
                    and a fervour of worship that could not stop short of the utmost limits of
                    selfârenunciation. She writes that she has not the smallest desire ever again to
                    leave the silence and monotony of the convent life, and there, it may be
                    concluded, she will remain till her strange career terminates altogether.</p>
                <p>Some of the aspects under which death is sought by prisoners for themselves, and
                    even, under certain mournful conditions, for those they love best, are almost
                    too sad to be described in these pages. What, for instance, can be more
                    hopelessly dreary than the idea of a man destroying himself in the absolute
                    solitude and darkness of his prison cell by night? Yet such cases are by no
                    means uncommon. In spite of the sedulous care exercised by the officers to
                    deprive the prisoners of everything which could be used as an instrument of
                    selfâdestruction, it has been found impossible to prevent the occasional
                    perpetration of the deed. Not long since in the prison of which we write, a man
                    was locked up as usual one evening after cheerfully bidding goodânight to the
                    warders in <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7158-184"></pb> charge. Next morning when his door
                    was opened he was found stone dead, having possessed no other means for
                    accomplishing his purpose than the pocketâhandkerchief with which he suspended
                    himself from the gasâpipe, and the extraordinary determination which enabled him
                    to keep his knees bent until he expired. If he had risen to his feet even for a
                    moment, he could not have died.</p>
                <p>By many strange expedients is death sought by prisoners, not only for their own
                    release but for that of children too young to seek or desire it. The records of
                    infanticide as they are known within our prisons are very painful, and they
                    would be utterly unaccountable but for the explanation given by Dante, in the
                    celebrated line with which he closes the account of Ugolino and his sons in the
                    Torre della Fameâ <q>
                        <l>âPosciÃ  piu che il dolor, potÃ¨ il digiunio.â</l>
                    </q> There is a passive form of suicide very frequent among the mysterious race
                    of tramps, which is singular enough to be worthy of a few momentsâ
                    attention.</p>
                <pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7158-185"></pb>
                <p>The tramps who pervade our country from end to end, and often find their way into
                    jail, are emphatically a most mysterious race, as we have just termed them. They
                    lead a life, by their own indomitable will and determination, which is more
                    hideously miserable than anything which could be imagined. How it can possibly
                    be the voluntary choice of numberless men and women of all ages is simply
                    inexplicable. With the one exception that it is a life of freedom, it seems to
                    lack every element of attraction that could exist for a human being. Their only
                    home is the open highway, along which, summer and winter alike, they tramp
                    aimlessly hour after hour, never knowing from one day to another where they are
                    to lay their head at night. Indeed they often are unable to obtain any shelter
                    at all, and sleep by the roadside or in some open shed, such as was described by
                    a hapless woman in our prison, who found her infant frozen to death in her arms
                    after a night spent in that receptacle. To have begged or stolen a few pence,
                    which enables them to get a bed at a publicâhouse or in some low lodging, is the
                    height of <pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7158-186"></pb> felicity for them; and they
                    consider themselves very unfortunate when bad weather obliges them to take their
                    nightâs rest in the workhouse, with the understanding that they must pay for it
                    by an hourâs hard labour at stoneâbreaking in the morning; but it is only in the
                    depths of winter that they dream of exposing themselves to so great an
                    inconvenience. In the summer an open field or a dry ditch is thought infinitely
                    preferable.</p>
                <p>These tramps have no affinity with the gipsy race, which might perhaps have
                    explained their wandering propensities. They are stolid British men and women,
                    with nothing in the least picturesque or romantic about them. Many of them have
                    been born while their parents were leading this life âon the road,â which seems
                    to them so delectable, and the force of habit may to some extent account, in
                    their case, for so strange a mode of existence; but numbers of them deliberately
                    choose it for themselves, often breaking up a settled home, and going off with
                    wife and children to walk miles upon miles every day with their tired swollen
                    feet, not caring apparently what particular place <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7158-187"></pb> they may happen to reach, only fully decided never
                    again to sleep under a roof of their own.</p>
                <p>The more aristocratic members of this roving community provide themselves with a
                    hawkerâs licence, and, according to their own account, they are enabled to get a
                    sufficient livelihood by the sale of the goods they affect. The women deal
                    largely in nightcaps, which seems to be a favourite article of luxury in country
                    villages; and the men in bootâlaces, combs, and tracts of a very fierce and
                    alarming nature. But the truth is, that the hawking business only veils less
                    creditable modes of obtaining moneyâthe most innocent of which is systematic
                    begging; and tramps who pride themselves on not being thieves, will generally
                    admit freely enough that they depend for their subsistence on charity alone. No
                    doubt a love of idleness, as well as of freedom, lies at the root of their
                    adoption of so trying a life; but even with that powerful attraction, it is hard
                    to understand how they can voluntarily endure all the suffering it entails. It
                    might be comprehended if they lived in a southern clime, where frost and snow
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7158-188"></pb> are unknown, and the peasants dine on a
                    handful of olives with a lump of bread; but in this country, where the winter
                    can bring such terrible forces to bear on their homeless condition, it is
                    marvellous that they should persist in adhering to their life of hardship. The
                    Emperor Nicholas of Russia is said to have trusted to â<q rend="inline">General
                        January</q>â to rout the British troops in the Crimea, but our tramps do not
                    hesitate to set that power at defiance. Great efforts are made in our prison to
                    find regular employment for them on their release, and so enable them to abandon
                    their vagabond habits, but they invariably refuse to avail themselves of the
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>We had a singular instance of this in the case of a woman eightyâfour years of
                    age, who was imprisoned on a short sentence in the late autumn for some slight
                    misdemeanour. When the time for her release came, she prepared deliberately to
                    encounter an English winter on the road, and it seemed evident from her age and
                    infirmity that if she did, she would simply be found dead in a ditch some day
                    from cold and exposure. The <pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7158-189"></pb> strongest efforts
                    were therefore made to induce her to abandon her intention. A home was secured
                    for her in a charitable institution, where she would have had every comfort, and
                    she was told in the plainest terms that she would not live the winter out if she
                    persisted in braving its inclemency. Her only answer was that which we hear
                    again and again from tramps of all agesââI prefer the road; I mean to go on the
                    road, and do as I have always done.â We could not tie the old woman hand and
                    foot, which would have been the only means of preventing her from taking her own
                    way, and so on a cold morning in early winter she passed through the jail gates
                    and disappeared. She has never been heard of since, and it is probable she met
                    the fate predicted for her.</p>
                <p>A similar obstinacy was manifested by another lady of mature years, who afforded
                    at the same time a remarkable instance of the mysterious attraction which some
                    persons seem to possess for their fellowâcreatures, under the most unfavourable
                    circumstances. She was, without doubt, one of the <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7158-190"></pb> most hideously ugly women it was possible to see. She
                    had only one eye, and a wooden leg, and her grey hair and wrinkles testified to
                    a very long acquaintance with the vicissitudes of life. Yet she was the beloved
                    of a Frenchman with whom she travelled, and who was supposed, for her sake, to
                    have abandoned his native country and his natural ties. Nothing could induce
                    either the one or the other to separate, though they were in no way legitimately
                    united; or to give up their chosen mode of existenceâwhich consisted in
                    wandering from one publicâhouse to another, where they gained a precarious
                    existence by making most discordant music with their cracked voices, for the
                    amusement of the persons drinking there.</p>
                <p>The mystery of the trampâs strange taste for a homeless life is rendered deeper
                    by the fact that it does become, as we have said, a passive form of suicide. It
                    is only the very strongest who can long brave with impunity the constant
                    privation and exposure of their existence,âmany of them die quickly from
                    phthisis and bronchitis, or other maladies incidental to their circumstances.
                    When <pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7158-191"></pb> they succumb to a lengthened illness
                    they generally drift into some workhouse, but there are innumerable cases of
                    death by the roadside. Only lately a man was found unconscious near a brickâkiln
                    to which he had crept for warmth, and was taken to a hospital, where he lived
                    for two days, but he was never able to speak. No one knew his name, or anything
                    about him, and his pockets were perfectly empty; so he died an unknown stranger,
                    and was buried in a nameless grave: if he had kith or kin on earth, they can
                    never have known his fate in any way.</p>
                <p>Suicide is not too strong a word to apply to the deliberate courting of death
                    which characterises the trampâs career, because they are perfectly well aware
                    that their lives must sooner or later be destroyed by the severity of the strain
                    to which they are subjected. They share to the full the lightâhearted
                    willingness to pass out of this world which, as we have shown, is almost
                    invariably felt by prisoners and the class generally from which they are
                    recruited.</p>
                <p>Such a state of feeling at first sight appears very <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7158-192"></pb> unnatural and deplorable, but those who have had
                    opportunities of gauging the unutterable sadness of most of their lives, can
                    hardly regret that these poor people are able to look forward to death as their
                    sure consoler and their truest friend. Their mental condition, and that, indeed,
                    of most of the forlorn beings who drift into the Silent World, renders the
                    problem of their possible permanent improvement, while within its limits, one of
                    the deepest import; and we cannot but hope that the simple recital of their
                    strange and sorrowful histories in these pages may have some influence in
                    drawing attention to the subject.</p>

                    drawn forth various expressions of opinion on the subject, which we are anxious
                    to refute in so far as we hold them to be mistaken.</p>
                <p>The first strong impression conveyed by the recital of scenes from a Silent World

                    depressing and distasteful, and even to some extent demoralising. There is truth
                    in this idea only as regards the pain which must always be felt in witnessing
                    the sufferings and errors of our fellowâcreatures, whatever may be their
                    position in the social scale; but there is another aspect of the case which
                    gives to labour among the tenants in our prisons an indescribable charm, such as
                    could hardly be found in any other form of altruism that may be open to us.</p>
                <p>The realism and energetic truthâseeking of this nineteenth century have, as we
                    are all well aware, caused a widespread awakening to the inscrutable problems in
                    the condition of humanity which surrounds us on every side. The complicated
                    evils that beset our race are patent enough to all observers, but the difference
                    of opinion among thoughtful persons as to the remedies which might be attempted
                    for them, simply offers to us contrasts of a truly bewildering description. The
                    most beneficent schemes are represented as doing more harm than goodâwhile even
                    the oldâ<choice>

                        <reg>fashioned</reg>
                    </choice> virtues of charity and almsgiving are denounced as mischievous to the
                    recipients, and fatal to the good of the community. There is no doubt that this
                    particular view is to a great extent borne out by recent experiences,âsuch as
                    the disastrous results of the distribution, some time since, of the Lord Mayorâs
                    fund for the unemployed in London. The sixty thousand pounds generously
                    contributed for the relief of starving families is said to have drawn to the
                    capital hordes of the most vicious and worthless of those who live in idleness,
                    abjuring honest work, and to have been for the most part absorbed by them, in
                    spite of strenuous efforts to use the fund judiciously.</p>
                <p>The discord of opinion to which we allude, however, obtains in respect to many
                    burning questions: the higher education strongly advocated by some, is supposed
                    by others to engender socialism and infidelity;âthe rescue of the fallen is said
                    to have the result of drawing numbers yet innocent into the ranks of the
                    lost;âthe strife of parties, the conflicts of Churches and sects, and many other
                    opposing elements, combine to render the <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7158-196"></pb> work
                    of those who would serve their fellowâcreatures in the outside world, a most
                    discouraging and ungrateful task,âyet the enthusiasm of humanity has entered too
                    strongly into the spirit of the age for these efforts to be abandoned, whatever
                    may be the difficulties attendant upon their execution, and herein lies the
                    charm of service done within the walls of a prison to the most utterly hopeless
                    and depraved of human beings. There can be no question of their sore need of
                    help and pity: they have reached the lowest depths of misery and degradation;
                    they are without God, and without hope; they look upon all men as their enemies;
                    they can fall no lower; they can endure nothing worse. Whatever, therefore, is
                    done for their benefit, even mistakenly, must have a true value in
                    contradistinction to their moral and physical destitution, which it probably
                    could not have in more favourable circumstances. The faint gleam of light which
                    would be wholly lost in the blaze of the noonday sun, is as a radiant messenger
                    when it enters on impenetrable darkness. Prison visitors have the comfort of
                    feeling that, as they alone <pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7158-197"></pb> have access to
                    the criminals, what they attempt would be left entirely undone without their
                    aid, and that their efforts, however feeble and unsatisfactory, must be better
                    than nothing. Thus it is that tasks performed within the mournful jail, have a
                    sweetness and attraction they could never have elsewhere. While the world
                    without is ever steeped in mysterious evils, fettered and burdened by problems
                    that may well make the most energetic philanthropist despair of accomplishing
                    any good in his generation; it can, we think, be understood, that there is rest
                    and consolation in spending an hour in the condemned cell with a man just about
                    to suffer a terrible and ignominious death, so that he may feelâsince even in
                    that deepest abyss of misery he is not bereft of human sympathyâthere may surely
                    yet be hope for him, that mercy and pardon will not fail him at the feet of
                    God.</p>
                <p>If we can thus disprove the idea that prison work must necessarily be distasteful
                    and depressing, we can still more strongly repudiate the theory which has been
                    forcibly enunciated, that <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7158-198"></pb> it engenders a
                    sentimental âtenderness to crime.â Some persons, it would seem, object even to
                    any revelations being made from the Silent World on the ground that they are
                    âgruesome,â and that details of the lives of criminals can only be unpleasant
                    and never profitable. Are we then to enjoy our brighter, happier lives, under
                    the free airs and limitless light of the open heavens, and ignore the very
                    existence of those who are lying bound in darkness and the shadow of death?
                    Because they are a prey to the sin and iniquity which are the worst of
                    misfortunesâbecause they are vile, their âsouls cleaving to the dust,ââare we to
                    make no effort to penetrate into the conditions of their hapless degraded
                    existence, and seek such amelioration of it as can only be possible through an
                    unreserved ventilation of the subject? Tenderness towards crime is the last
                    feeling likely to be engendered in those who, within the walls of a prison, are
                    brought into connection with it in all its unredeemed heinousness. But, in
                    truth, the persons who make these objections are not really in a position to
                    estimate the greater or less moral <choice>

                    safe untrammelled lives can have no point of contact with those who, from
                    infancy upward, have been in bondage to every possible evil influence. What, for
                    instance, but an unreasoning, almost unconscious, abandonment to a career of
                    crime, could possibly be expected for the offspring of one of our prisoners who
                    had been sent to jail, in the course of a not very long life, some thirty or
                    forty times? She had been steeped in sin from earliest girlhood, and the sole
                    mode of escape from it with which she was acquainted, was the drastic remedy of
                    suicide. She knew the name of God only as an oath; she had never said a prayer
                    in the whole course of her life, and absolutely refused to be taught one, lest
                    it should act as a kind of charm in compelling her to give up some of her
                    iniquities. This woman had a child,âan intelligent little girl of four years
                    old,âand she deliberately sold it for a small sum to a companion of like trade
                    and position with herself, in order that it might be trained to gain money for
                    its purchaser in the following manner: It was carefully <pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7158-200"></pb> taught to swear, and to lisp all the most horrible
                    and disgraceful utterances it is possible to conceive, and then it was taken
                    every night to one or other of the many publicâhouses with which the
                    neighbourhood teemed, in order that it might be set upon a table and desired to
                    amuse the men who sat drinking round it, by pouring out from its infant lips
                    volleys of oaths and blasphemies. Was no tenderness to be shown to the
                    criminality with which this unfortunate child was likely to be branded?âand the
                    education of many of the inmates of our prisons has been of a similar

                    cases as these. They would find, indeed, that while it would naturally convey to
                    them an almost appalling knowledge of the depths of infamy to which it is
                    possible for human nature to fall, it would arouse in them at the same time a
                    passionate desire to extend some species of aid to those of like flesh and blood
                    with ourselves, who seem to have been forsaken of God and man from infancy, and
                    could never, without a helping hand, struggle out of the mire in which they lie
                    grovelling at our feet. By what means it may be possible to raise them from
                    their degradation and misery is the one absorbing thought which must fill the
                    mind of all prison visitors, to the exclusion either of disgust and depression,
                    or of a sentimental sympathy with the <pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7158-202"></pb>
                    perpetrators of crime. That is the problem they have to face, and it is one
                    which extends in widening circles far beyond the prison walls; for it is evident
                    that, if any moral or religious impression of substantial value is to be made on
                    criminals, it must be of a nature to influence them through their whole future
                    career, amid the temptations of the world on which they will ultimately be
                    loosed once more.</p>
                <p>In order to estimate the possibilities of this work, we have to grapple at once
                    with a portentous obstacle, which can only be fully understood by those actually
                    engaged in it: it is the difficulty of forming a right judgment as to the real
                    nature and extent of the guilt which attaches to each individual prisoner. There
                    is no more momentous lesson to be derived from a close intercourse with the
                    criminal classes, than the discovery of the almost hopeless incapacity of human
                    beings so to penetrate into the depths of their fellowâcreaturesâ inner lives,
                    and of the influences which have moulded them from infancy, as to be able to
                    pronounce justly on their errors or innocence in the sight of <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7158-203"></pb> the only infallible Judge of men. We may well doubt
                    our power of judging one another, when, in the mystery of the complex human
                    nature, it is perfectly possible for a man to live and die in absolute
                    uncertainty as to whether he himself was, or was not, guilty of a deadly crime
                    attributed to him. If this appears a questionable assertion, we can prove its
                    undoubted truth by giving the history of a prisoner, whose singular case was
                    made known to us in minute detail by the chief authority of the jail where he
                    suffered for an offence of which he was from first to last entirely unconscious.
                    It was, in our opinion, a <emph>dream crime</emph>âthat is, a deed of violence
                    committed under the false impression of a dream when the man was buried in
                    profound slumber, not the smallest recollection of it remaining on his mind when
                    he awoke. The facts are as follows:â</p>
                <p>The man, whom we may call James Wheeler, had at one time been in good
                    circumstances, but he and his wife both unfortunately became addicted to
                    drinking, and their descent in the social scale was of course very rapid. He
                    then became <choice>

                    </choice> to a butcher, in the intervals of other occupations, and at the time
                    when the event occurred which brought the lives of both to an end, they were
                    living in so humble a domicile that they had only one sleepingâroom for the
                    whole family, the children lying on the floor near the bed occupied by their
                    parents.</p>
                <p>One winterâs evening Wheeler and his wife were both more or less intoxicated; but
                    there had been no quarrel of any kind between them, when they went to bed with
                    their children in the one room at seven oâclock. Wheeler immediately fell into a
                    deep heavy slumber, from which, as his son afterwards distinctly stated, he
                    never once awoke till three hours later. His wife meantime had chosen to take
                    her supper in bed; and she carried there with her the knife which her husband
                    used in his occupation as butcher, in order to cut pieces of bread from the
                    small loaf which constituted her meal. While thus employing it, she put it down
                    for a few minutes beside her, in such a position that it is supposed to have
                    rested against the hand of the sleeping man. It is presumed <pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7158-205"></pb> that the touch of the instrument which he constantly
                    used in the slaughter of animals, had engendered in his brain the dream that he
                    was engaged in his usual duties. He grasped it unconsciously, and with one vague
                    movement gave, what was afterwards emphatically described as âa butcherâs
                    stroke,â to the living creature beside him, without awaking for a single moment
                    from his drunken slumber. The eldest child, a boy of sixteen years of age, was
                    aroused by hearing his mother moaning. He got up from the floor and leant over
                    her. She was leaning back upon the knife, as if she had fallen against it, and
                    was evidently dying. He drew it away from under her shoulder, where it was in
                    fact embedded, without, however, it seems, apprehending that it was the cause of
                    her serious condition. In another moment she had expired, still holding in her
                    hand the last piece of bread she had cut from the loaf. The boy, greatly
                    terrified, roughly awoke his father, who was lying unconscious in heavy sleep.
                    Wheeler opened his eyes, bewildered and amazed, scarce able to take in the sense
                    of his <pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7158-206"></pb> sonâs statement that the mother was
                    dead. He sprang out of bed, and hurried round to the other side to look at her.
                    When he saw that she had, in fact, ceased to breathe, he fell on his knees
                    beside her, and burst into a passionate flood of tears. After a time his
                    attention was drawn to the hemorrhage from her lips, and he exclaimed that she
                    must have broken a bloodâvessel. The cries of the children soon attracted
                    neighbours to the room, and one of them, seeing the knife lying on the bed,
                    asked Wheeler if he had stabbed his wife.</p>
                <p>âMy God, no!â he exclaimed; âI never did it!â All seemed then to acquiesce in the
                    idea that the death had resulted from the natural rupture of a vessel; but next
                    day, when preparations were made for the burial, it was found that a deep wound
                    in the back was the undoubted cause of the fatal result.</p>
                <p>Wheeler was at once arrested on a charge of wilful murder.</p>
                <p>There was the strongest possible conviction of his innocence on the part of a
                    very large number <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7158-207"></pb> of persons; and this
                    opinion was unanimously held by his fellowâworkmen, who united in bearing
                    testimony to the humane and gentle nature of the unhappy man. His children
                    positively affirmed that there had been no struggle or quarrel between their
                    parents, and that silenceâbroken only by the heavy breathing of the sleeping
                    manâhad reigned in the little bedroom from the time they all lay down till the
                    sad discovery was made. That period, Wheeler solemnly declared, was to him a
                    complete blank; he had not the faintest remembrance of anything that had
                    occurred, excepting that he had gone to sleep at seven oâclock drunk, and awoke
                    at ten, to find his wife dead.</p>
                <p>The day of the trial came. He was defended by an able counsel, but apparently the
                    prisoner, with the difficulty of expressing himself clearly which is common to
                    persons of his class, had failed to explain that his absolute unconsciousness of
                    the event pointed to the death stroke having been given under the influence of a
                    dream, as the only solution of the mystery. A totally different theory <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7158-208"></pb> was therefore set up for the defence, which
                    simply suggested that the woman had fallen back upon the knife and been
                    accidentally killed. Such an explanation of her death could not be sustained
                    even by all the eloquence of a very clever barrister. Poor Wheelerâs case was
                    also seriously damaged by the ignorant folly of one of his neighbours, who,
                    being bent on proving his innocence, persisted in maintaining that the woman had
                    died, as was first supposed, from the rupture of a bloodâvessel, after she knew
                    perfectly well it was not the truth; for which benevolent lie she was adjudged
                    five years penal servitude. We must be allowed to regret also that the
                    unfortunate man did not fall into the hands of the careful nobleâminded judge
                    who tried Richard Hodson in a case we have previously described<ref target="#skene-silent06">Â¹</ref> in these pages. The learned gentleman, who
                    became the arbiter of Wheelerâs destiny, took what he would have called a
                    commonâsense view of the affair. The woman died from a wound by a butcherâs
                    knife. There was no one in the room <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="skene-silent06">Â¹ See <ref target="#p143">p. 143</ref>.</note><pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7158-209"></pb> likely to have inflicted it except her husband:
                    therefore he was guilty, and he must die. On these lines, the judge so
                    vigorously charged the jury that they had no alternative but to bring in a
                    verdict of guilty. They coupled it, however, with such an extremely strong
                    recommendation to mercy, that they never for a moment doubted it would take
                    effect in the reprieve of the prisoner. To their complete dismay, they found
                    themselves mistaken; and the discovery that their verdict had condemned a man to
                    execution, whom they believed to be virtually innocent, nearly drove one of
                    their number out of his senses.</p>
                <p>When the deathâpenalty was awarded to him, Wheeler stood forward in the dock,
                    lifted his hands above his head, and said, âI am innocent!âask the LordâI am as
                    innocent as a child. I am innocentâI am!âLord, Lord! look down upon meâI am as
                    innocent as a child just born.â</p>
                <p>Of course it is a very common occurrence that a prisoner vehemently proclaims his
                    innocence on hearing himself condemned, and no <pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7158-210"></pb> notice is usually taken of such asseverations; but there was that in the tone
                    and aspect of Wheeler as he uttered the words we have quoted, which carried
                    conviction of their truth to the minds, we believe, of many who heard them, with
                    the exception, it would seem, of the judge. He held to his preconceived opinion,
                    and did so with unyielding determination till the tragedy was consummated.</p>
                <p>The strange case aroused an extraordinary amount of public interest. The complete
                    absence of any appearance of premeditation or of motive for the murder, rendered
                    the theory that it had been committed under the influence of a dream the only
                    reasonable explanation of the sad event. The popular excitement became so great,
                    that the authorities felt it a duty to do their utmost to wring a confession
                    from the man, if indeed he were guilty of the crime for which he was to suffer,
                    and during the whole interval between his trial and execution, unceasing efforts
                    were made to this end; but he never varied for a single instant from his
                    deliberate statement, that he <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7158-211"></pb> had not the
                    faintest recollection of the period which had elapsed between the time that he
                    fell asleep on first going to bed, and the moment when he was awakened by his
                    sonâs exclamation that his mother was dead.</p>
                <p>âI pray to the Lord day and night to bring back to my remembrance what took place
                    from seven to ten that evening,â he said again and again to the governor and
                    chaplain of the jail; âbut my memory is a complete blank.â Wheeler was a
                    religiously minded man, although he had given way to intemperance, and he did
                    undoubtedly spend most of his time in prayer and in attending to the
                    instructions of those who ministered to him. He was generally calm and resigned,
                    but be broke down helplessly during his last interview with his children, when
                    his youngest little girl produced her greatest treasure, a penny which had been
                    bestowed upon her, and said she had brought it to âgive to father,â and she
                    wished him to go out to the shops and buy whatever he liked with it. His brother
                    went to see him a day or two before his execution, anxious like every one else
                    that he should admit <pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7158-212"></pb> the crime; but Wheeler
                    held out his hand to him saying, âIt is as clear from it as it ever wasâit had
                    not a finger to do with it; it is hard to die like this.â It was, however, in
                    the very last moments of his life that he gave the strongest proof of his
                    complete ignorance of the deed for which he was to suffer. The religious faith
                    which he held sincerely was one of terrorâhe believed in an awful judgment to
                    come and in a God who would infallibly cast an impenitent sinner into hell, and
                    who was therefore more to be feared than those who could only kill the body. The
                    morning of his execution had dawnedâhe was told that his hour was come. The
                    hangman entered and pinioned him; then knowing what a widespread belief in his
                    innocence existed outside the prison, and what a dangerous excitement it was
                    causing, he made a last attempt to extort a confession from him, and said to
                    him, âHave you anything to say? say these five words and nothing more!â The five
                    words he meant him to speak were of course âI did commit the murder,â but
                    instead of uttering them Wheeler answered that he had said all he had to say to
                    the <pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7158-213"></pb> chaplain, which simply was that the fatal
                    evening had been from first to last completely blotted from his mind, and that
                    he knew nothing whatever of the deed for which he was condemned. He was
                    perfectly aware when he pronounced these words that he was in the very jaws of
                    deathâhe could have nothing to gain or to lose in this world any more; and it is
                    beyond credence that a man of his convictions could, for no possible reason,
                    have been bold enough to plunge with a lie upon his lips into that dread
                    eternity where he believed that an endless punishment awaited crime. The man
                    only lived four minutes after making this last declaration,âand so departed. It
                    is to be hoped that he woke from the painful dream of life to a brighter
                    reality.</p>
                <p>This singular history seems to us to illustrate forcibly the uncertainty which
                    must always attend the attempts of workers in a prison, to estimate justly the
                    guilt of its inmates with a view to their permanent reform; and the primary
                    difficulty of forming a correct judgment of their moral and spiritual condition
                    is enhanced by the fact that <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7158-214"></pb> so many of them
                    are systematic hypocrites, wonderfully skilful in rendering their countenances
                    absolute masks to their real characters.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless the work is not hopeless: even when it has to be carried on in
                    connection with the most aggravated guilt, there are many cases which are
                    singularly receptive of good influences.</p>
                <p>It is necessary for the elucidation of the subject that we should distinguish
                    between two distinct classes of delinquents, who come all alike under the
                    heading of prisoners. There are, first, those who appear to be criminals of
                    deepest dyeâcharged with murder, manslaughter, and other deeds of violence, or
                    of living in continual villany and fraud; and secondly, those, for the most part
                    simple country people, who are sent in under short sentences for very venial
                    offences. Some of these latter cases are often most pitiable, and would rouse a
                    strong feeling of exasperation against the âJusticesâ justiceâ which is so often
                    denounced in the newspapers, were it not that the period of incarceration can
                    generally be made morally beneficial to them.</p>
                <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7158-215"></pb>
                <p>We will deal first with the work which may be done among these comparatively
                    harmless offenders, as it is undoubtedly the most pleasant and hopeful, and
                    becomes often a lasting power for good to those it would benefit. It is
                    generally foundâeven in the case of a first offenceâthat persons do not soil
                    their hands with theft, or other malpractices, unless they have been living in
                    much carelessness and indifference to the claims of religion and morals upon
                    them. In their compulsory exile from all the interests and occupations of their
                    home lives, they can often be led to consider seriously their position in the
                    sight of God and man. They can be brought to feel that their first offence
                    against the law has placed them on the threshold of a career of crime, from
                    which it is but too likely that they may be drawn down step by step to graver
                    deeds, till they sink in depths of evil hither undreamt of and unknown. If in
                    that crisis of their lives they can be awakened to the claims of the great
                    unerring Judge upon them, they are often induced to turn back of their own will
                    from the fatal brink, and resolutely climb the steep ascent to the <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7158-216"></pb> higher righteousness, whereby a lasting regeneration
                    of their whole moral being is practically effected.</p>
                <p>We can recall several instances where this was emphatically the case. One was a
                    poor woman whose existence from her marriage in early girlhood had been a
                    continual struggle to obtain the means of living for herself and her children,
                    of which her husbandâs intemperate habits perpetually deprived them. Her life
                    during all these years, though in no sense actively guilty, had been absolutely
                    godless. She had acknowledged no higher law than the animal instinct of
                    providing for her daily wants. She had never raised her eyes from the earth, to
                    seek in heavenly regions for a better and a purer hope than it could ever afford
                    her, and no true words of prayer passed her lips, either for herself or for
                    those she loved. At length, on one occasion, when her husband had been longer
                    than usual lost to her, in a low publicâhouse where he spent every penny that
                    should have provided food for his family, the woman was driven by actual
                    starvation to her first offence against the <pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7158-217"></pb>
                    law. She stole a small piece of meat from a shop, wherewith to feed her hungry
                    children. She bad never been dishonest before; but from the moment when she
                    committed this first theft, and passed the boundaryâline between innocence and
                    guilt, she became entirely reckless. She told the prison visitor afterwards,
                    that had she not been checked at the very outset of a potential course of crime,
                    she was prepared to fling all considerations of equity to the winds, and seek a
                    living for her family by any nefarious means that might be within her reach.
                    Fortunately for herself, the theft was at once discovered, and she was sent to
                    prison for a sufficiently long period to allow of a strong religious impression
                    being made on her mind.</p>
                <p>The punishment was to a person of her loving sensitive temperament exceptionally
                    severe, as she was parted not only from her elder children, but also from a
                    young infant, whom it pierced her motherâs heart to leave. Nevertheless, before
                    she passed out from the prison walls, she was filled with the deepest gratitude
                    for the blessings which her residence within them had brought to her.</p>
                <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7158-218"></pb>
                <p>She had known little of care or kindness in the outside world, and the knowledge
                    which gradually dawned upon her of an unseen undying Love that was not only ever
                    round her, but would have its fullest revelation in an eternal future, seemed to
                    flood her whole being with a new and rapturous life. She hung on the words that
                    were spoken to her on this subject with eager delight. She spent her whole time
                    when her labour tasks were done in reading the Gospels, and in fervent
                    supplications. Finally, as a result, no doubt, of her intense preoccupation with
                    her newâfound hopes, she had a vision one night as she lay asleep on her hard
                    bed, which illuminated her whole being with a light that never more faded from
                    it. She related this strange experience next day to her visitor, with a
                    trembling awe and ecstasy that were too real to be mistaken. She had seen the
                    Divine Redeemer, she said, clad in robes of dazzling whitenessâglorious in
                    majesty, yet looking down on her with compassion and tenderness. She had heard
                    Him speaking to her in words of consolation as to Jerusalem of old, telling her
                    that her <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7158-219"></pb> iniquity was pardoned, and her sins
                    for ever washed away, and henceforth she was to follow Him in paths of
                    righteousness, treading in His shining footsteps wheresoever they led her,
                    through the dust and mire of this worldâs tortuous ways. That mystic command,
                    however much it might have been the effect of pure imagination, she obeyed with
                    indomitable perseverance. She went out from the prison a totally changed woman.
                    We heard of her afterwards leading a most consistent and almost saintly life,
                    striving to induce her husband to reform, and resolutely bringing up her
                    children in the fear of God.</p>
                <p>In the case of prisoners convicted like this poor woman of first offences,
                    involving no great criminality, it is almost always possible not only to
                    influence them for good but also to benefit them materially by placing them in a
                    position to gain an honest living for themselves. We had a pleasant instance of
                    this once in the case of two lads, sons of country labourers, who, in
                    consequence of the agricultural depression, could no longer obtain even a scanty
                    subsistence at home. In a fit of <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7158-220"></pb> desperation
                    they started one winterâs day to walk to a farâdistant town in search of work.
                    After toiling on for many hours without food or shelter, sleeping, we believe,
                    half frozen under a hedge all night, they rose to pursue their way next morning
                    in spite of the weather, which, if we remember right, had culminated in a heavy
                    snowstorm. They plodded on wearily through that day, while the gnawing hunger
                    which had taken possession of them, alone prevented them from letting themselves
                    fall down on some snowâheap and yield to the drowsiness that would have ended in
                    the sleep of death. Darkness had closed in upon them, and they were almost in
                    despair when they saw a light in the distance, and made for it eagerly, in the
                    hope that it might be shining from a house where it would be possible for them
                    to obtain a little food. It proved to proceed from a candle placed in the window
                    of a farmhouse, to which they could approach very near in the snow without being
                    overheard. They looked through the panes of glass into a room quite untenanted,
                    and on a table close to them reposed a Christmas plumâpudding <pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7158-221"></pb> of most fascinating appearance and proportions. They
                    had never been dishonest boys before, but this sight was too much for them. They
                    found it quite easy to raise the window, gently seize the seductive pudding, and
                    scud away through the snow without being seen. They were too ravenously hungry
                    to go very far before they proceeded to devour their prize, which they did
                    crouching down in the first sheltered spot they could find. There, however,
                    vengeance was speedily upon them,âthe empty dish, which had once contained the
                    special Christmas dainty, was quickly perceived by the inmates of the farmhouse;
                    the open window, and the footprints in the snow, led to the swift detection of
                    the thieves; and before they had almost finished the delectable pudding, they
                    found themselves on their way to the lockâup for the night.</p>
                <p>As soon as possible they were brought before the nearest justice of the peace,âa
                    country gentleman not, it is to be presumed, very learned in the law as it
                    affects gradations in crime,âand by him they were summarily sent to prison for
                    six monthsâa very severe sentence under the circumstances,<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7158-222"></pb> but one that the two lads are now most thankful to
                    have undergone. During the whole period of their detention they were
                    systematically instructed in good principles, and at the close of it they were
                    provided with an outfit and an introduction to an employer of labour in Canada,
                    to which their passage was paid; and when we last heard of them they were doing
                    extremely well, with excellent prospects before them.</p>
                <p>Most of the simple people who come to prison under short sentences can generally
                    be led, as we have said, to make use of their brief retirement from the world as
                    a time of quiet reflection, which is very advantageous to them; but the form
                    which their newly developed piety takes is sometimes rather embarrassing to
                    their instructors.</p>
                <p>A good homely woman, who was prospering as the keeper of a small shop in a
                    country town, was sent to our jail once under circumstances, certainly, of
                    considerable hardship. Her sole offence consisted in having received from her
                    son some pieces of timber, which he had taken from the river where they were
                    floating, and used them as fuel <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7158-223"></pb> for her fire.
                    They proved to be the property of a man who was utilising the stream as a means
                    of transit for his wood, and poor Mrs Merry was indicted for receiving and
                    appropriating stolen goods, her son having left the town.</p>
                <p>The name we have given her best expresses her real designation, which had a most
                    hilarious sound. Nothing could exceed her unreasoning horror and fear when she
                    found herself actually within the prison walls. What secret tortures she
                    expected to be inflicted on her cannot be guessed; but she seemed to look on all
                    connected with the place as terrible agents of justice, whom it was necessary to
                    propitiate by every possible means. When she was for the first time brought
                    before the prison visitor according to custom, she suddenly, to the great dismay
                    of that individual, dropped prone on her knees in the middle of the floor, and
                    joined her hands in mute supplication to be spared the unknown agonies she
                    expected to undergo. It was in vain that the visitor implored her to rise: she
                    persisted in remaining in the attitude of a victim prepared for the sacrifice,
                    and when an attempt <pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7158-224"></pb> was made to lift her
                    bodily from the ground, it was found that the enormous weight of her portly
                    person rendered the effort quite abortive. At length, however, by dint of strong
                    insistence, she was induced to creep up from the ground and sit on the edge of a
                    chair in presence of the formidable being with whom she had been left alone.
                    After this concession it did not take long to win her simple confidence, and the
                    floodâgates of her speech being unloosed, she poured out a complete history of
                    all her delinquencies from infancy upwards. From that day Mrs Merry became the
                    absolutely devoted slave of the person she had so much dreaded, and she devised
                    every means she could think of to win favour in the eyes of her new friend. Some
                    of her expedients were decidedly appalling. On one occasion she appeared with a
                    beaming countenance, and triumphantly announced that she had learned by heart
                    the whole of the first seven chapters of the Book of Genesis, and intended to
                    recite them aloud then and there. Without leaving time for any remonstrance, she
                    proceeded to declaim them in a highâpitched tone <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7158-225"></pb> of voice with wonderfully glib utterance, and
                    marginal readings of her own which slightly impaired the solemnity of the
                        proceeding,ââ<q rend="inline">Now the serpent was the most suitable of the
                        beasts of the field</q>,â and so on. However, poor Mrs Merry did really,
                    during the period of her incarceration, acquire a great deal of knowledge in
                    religion and morals, which was likely to be of more use to her than the mere
                    letter of the Pentateuchâthe sense of which she never dreamt of investigating.
                    Finally, she departed from the prison a muchâsobered woman, and has led an
                    exemplary life, we believe, ever since.</p>
                <p>With these comparatively harmless prisoners the work is easy enough; but it is,
                    of course, far otherwise in the case of men and women stained with the deepest
                    guilt. Yet even with such criminals there are often remarkable instances of
                    reform, which ought effectually to dispel any doubt as to the value of prison
                    visitation, and the possibility of a permanent good work being accomplished
                    amongst the more hardened prisoners. We will give two typical instances, the one
                    of success <pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7158-226"></pb> and the other of failure, which
                    are genuine illustrations of our position.</p>
                <p>It has been truly said that when a woman is thoroughly bad and unscrupulous, she
                    is radically worse than any man can succeed in being with his best endeavour;
                    and we shall therefore select our cases from that which can scarce, in prison
                    latitudes, be termed the gentler sex.</p>
                <p>There came to the jail one day a middleâaged woman, well known to the officials,
                    for those iron doors had closed upon her many a time before. She was considered
                    to be an absolutely hopeless caseâa coarse depraved woman, repulsive in
                    appearance, blasphemous in language. She was brought to the visitor, as all the
                    prisoners were in rotation, and as a matter of duty some words of counsel were
                    spoken, without the least idea that they would make any impression upon her; but
                    she seemed in a strange state of mental excitement, and suddenly plunged into a
                    long account of her life since she had last been within those walls. It was
                    plain, as she related it, that her thoughts were engrossed with one tragic <choice>
                        <orig>inciâ <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7158-227"></pb> dent</orig>
                        <reg>incident</reg>
                    </choice>, which stood out dark and terrible from all minor events. The manânot
                    her husbandâwith whom she had lived for many years, finished his dark career in
                    a terrible manner, for he had hung himself in the one room where they had dwelt
                    together, in the practice of all manner of evil deeds.</p>
                <p>âYes,â she seemed ready to say, âhe put an end to it all for himself: he had been
                    a cruel man to meâhe has knocked me down and trampled on me scores of timesâbut
                    when I came and saw him hanging stone dead I forgot it all, and nowââ The
                    expression of her uncouth features seemed to indicate a terrible thought in her
                    mindââNow I suppose he is in hellâin hell!â She looked up, as if to put her dark
                    doubt in the form of a question; but it was one to which no answer could be
                    returned, only after a few minutes the visitor began to speak to her on that
                    theme which rings for ever sweet and true within the prison walls. â<q rend="inline">The quality of mercy is not strained</q>,ââmercy, to which all
                    must be left who have passed to the secrets of eternityâmercy, still full of
                        wondrous<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7158-228"></pb> possibilities for her living
                    self. Then she burst into a wild appeal for help to save her own sinâstained
                    soul. She wanted to give up her past iniquities, to change her life, to do
                    better, lest she should herself come to that place of tormentâhelp!âshe only
                    wanted help that a way out of the mire and clay might be opened to her, an
                    upward path to pure air and the sunshine of Godâs countenance.</p>
                <p>The help was given, the way was made for her to leave the city, which had been
                    the scene of all her guilt and misery, and to enter elsewhere on an honest and
                    respectable calling. It must be owned, however, that this was done without
                    almost any hope of a good result: the inveterate habit of intemperance, which
                    had always held her in possession, seemed to prohibit the least chance of
                    amendment.</p>
                <p>About two years later, the visitor was called one day to see a very
                    respectableâlooking person who was anxious for an interview. It was a woman with
                    a pleasant countenance, very well dressed in dark suitable clothing, who looked
                    up <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7158-229"></pb> with a smile, and yet almost with tears in
                    her eyes, when she saw that she was not recognised. It was indeed the depraved
                    criminal of the prison, who had never swerved from the path of rectitude on
                    which she had entered when she left its doors. She was earning a good livelihood
                    for herself by her industry and consistent conduct, and her superfluous earnings
                    had enabled her to take a few daysâ holiday, in order to come and show her
                    friend that she had been true to her word, and was trying to do right at last,
                    with an honest and true heartâfaithfully.</p>
                <p>The second case, given in connection with that just recorded, seems almost to
                    reproduce the story of the two women grinding in the mill, the one being taken
                    and the other left.</p>
                <p>A strong muscularâlooking matron was committed to our jail for the manslaughter
                    of her infant. There was no doubt that she had compassed the death of the child,
                    for which iniquity she had justly received a heavy sentence; but it seemed to
                    have been done rather through complete neglect and carelessness than from an
                    actual <choice>
                        <orig>murâ <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7158-230"></pb> derous</orig>
                        <reg>murderous</reg>
                    </choice> intention. She was, however, absolutely indifferent to the fatal
                    result: unlike all other female prisoners we have known, she appeared to be
                    entirely destitute of that pure instinct of motherâs love, which usually burns
                    as an unquenchable flame even in the most sinâdarkened souls. Apparently she was
                    rather relieved to know that by the disappearance of the poor infant she had a
                    child the less to require attention from her; but in fact she had no room in her
                    thoughts for the matter at all. The one absorbing topic of interest in her mind
                    was her intense detestation of her sisterâinâlaw, who had been the principal
                    witness against her at her trial. According to her own account, these two
                    ladies, mutually abhorring one another, had been in the habit of having
                    periodical combats in the open streets of the town where they dwelt. The
                    prisoner insisted on describing with the greatest gusto how they had been wont
                    to challenge each other to a standâup fight, and then retired for a few minutes
                    to their homes to put on suitable garments for the fray, returning to the place
                    where a ring was formed <pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7158-231"></pb> round them by an
                    expectant throng: they would then have, as she expressed it, a certain ânumber
                    of rounds,â and would only cease when there seemed a risk of one or the other
                    being incapacitated for renewing the fierce battle another day.</p>
                <p>As may be supposed, the prisoner was summarily checked in these agreeable
                    reminiscences, but there was no other subject which had the smallest interest
                    for her. She evidently considered herself a champion fighter, and probably
                    thought it fortunate that she possessed in her brotherâs wife a detested object
                    on whom she could exercise her prowess. Metaphorically speaking, it was like
                    trying to pierce the hide of a hippopotamus, to attempt to make any impression
                    on the hard nature of this woman. She was compelled, as a matter of discipline,
                    to listen respectfully to the admonitions addressed to her; but it was perfectly
                    plain that she did not trouble herself to take in the sense of a single word.
                    Her thoughts were far away, picturing, no doubt, the delights of another
                    pugilistic encounter with her near relation, to take place as soon as possible
                    after her release from prison,âand to that ineffable <pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7158-232"></pb> enjoyment she was in due time allowed to depart, when
                    her period of detention expired. The conviction left on the minds of those who
                    had tried to benefit her, was simply that in her they had one of the most
                    striking instances of failure they had ever known in their experience.</p>
                <p>Happily the failures are much more rare than the successes, and many pleasant
                    instances of the latter might be given from the histories of a great variety of
                    prisoners. The ceremonials of the Church which we are wont to associate with
                    seasons of special rejoicing or solemnity were often called into requisition,
                    shorn of all outward attractions. We will not sadden our pages with the annals
                    of prison funerals, although they are often the means of strongly impressing the
                    survivors, whether it be that ghastly burial within the precincts of the jail of
                    men or women done to death by the law, or the gentler laying to rest of some
                    forlorn criminal who has closed his eyes for ever on the dreary surroundings of
                    the official sick ward. Scarcely less pathetic are the baptisms performed within
                    the walls, of infants who will have to bear all their lives <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7158-233"></pb> the stigma of having been born in a prison. Only one
                    somewhat happier function is sometimes allowed us. In the case of young girls
                    led into illegal practices by some unwedded lover, in conjunction with whom they
                    were sent to jail, we had often the satisfaction of accomplishing a prison
                    wedding, which placed them in a position to begin a new and better life with
                    every inducement to a radical reform. The arrangements for these alliances had
                    to be conducted somewhat after the fashion of princely individuals whose
                    marriages are State affairs. As the bridegroom was incarcerated in the male side
                    of the prison, and the bride on that reserved for the women, no intercourse of
                    any sort was permitted to them. The negotiations between the high contracting
                    parties had therefore to be diplomatically undertaken by grave official
                    personages, passing from the one to the other, so that the weddingâday was fixed
                    without a word having been exchanged on the subject by the two persons most
                    concerned. When the day of their release came, which was also to be that of
                    their union, they were met at the gate by the chaplain who was to perform the
                    ceremony and <pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7158-234"></pb> the visitor who was to act as
                    witness. The small procession then solemnly proceeded to the parish church,
                    where the discharged convicts were duly united, and allowed to depart to a
                    breakfast which, for the first time during many months, was not to consist of
                    gruel.</p>
                <p>We cannot close here without touching very briefly on a subject deserving of the
                    fullest consideration, and which it is to be hoped may at no distant time occupy
                    the attention of the Government, and be efficiently dealt with by adequate
                    legislation. We refer to the condition of the children of prisoners, as the
                    system which obtains with regard to them at present is eminently unsatisfactory.
                    It is in truth one of masterly inactivity: the State simply ignores them
                    altogether. Even when a manâs life has been taken by the law for a crime which
                    deprived his children of their mother also, these hapless orphans receive no
                    official recognition of any kind. The workhouse is the only refuge to which they
                    have a legal right; but they are not compelled to enter it, and the criminal
                    associates of their unhappy parents generally take summary possession <pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7158-235"></pb> of them for begging or thieving purposes, and
                    bring them up in all manner of vice. Private charity may at times step in; but
                    it can only deal with individual cases here and there, and can in no sense cope
                    with that vast contingent of the men and women of the future, who are left at
                    the prison doors by their natural protectors, either to drift into the pauperâs
                    last home, or to be hidden in dens of infamy where a far worse fate awaits
                    them.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely possible for any one to traverse our country roads without being
                    struck by the dismal appearance of the tramp children, who drag along their
                    weary feet in the wake of their careless parents. The great majority of these
                    poor waifs would benefit by any legislation that might deal with the offspring
                    of convicts, as the race of tramps are at all times very prone to qualify
                    themselves in various ways for a temporary residence within the prison
                    walls.</p>
                <p>This is a vast subject, of which the importance can only be indicated in the most
                    cursory manner here; but we trust that the treatment of prisoners generally,
                    especially with regard to their moral <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7158-236"></pb>
                    improvement and permanent reform, may soon seriously engage the attention of
                    those in authority, and that some special provision may then also be made for
                    the rescue of the unfortunate children of crime.</p>

                    <l>âIf consciousness be aught, of all it seems to be,</l>
                    <l>Souls are something more than lights that gleam and flee.â</l>

                <p><hi>ONE</hi> of the most striking results of the scientific progress which has
                    marked this present century has been a new revelation of the truth, that life
                    and death alike are to us inscrutable mysteries, of which, it may be, the true
                    meaning is as yet altogether hid from us. Side by side with this conviction,
                    which impresses itself mainly on the cultured classes, there has been a
                    remarkable awakening of the great mass of the people to all questions affecting
                    their own rights and the administration of the justice meted out to them. In
                    view of both these characteristics of our own <pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7158-238"></pb>
                    time, it is perfectly certain that sooner or later the question of the
                    continuance of the death penalty as the law of the land will be brought to the
                    bar of public opinion, and forced with irresistible power on the consideration
                    of those in authority.</p>
                <p>The days have vanished into the past when the people of this country were
                    submissively content to see the perpetrators of small offences driven in shoals
                    to the gallows week by week, like sheep to the slaughter; and the time is now
                    not far distant, when they will rise up and demand by what right judicial
                    murders are to be committed in retaliation for those which have been the result
                    of crime. To us who have been face to face with the death penalty, as it may be
                    known and studied within the walls of the condemned cell, the question of its
                    righteousness as between man and man can only be decided by a reference to those
                    higher mysteries in the conditions of the human race of which we have spoken;
                    but we will leave such considerations to the last, while we touch on the more
                    practical <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7158-239"></pb> bearings of the <foreign xml:lang="lat">lex talionis</foreign>, and the arguments by which it is
                    generally upheld. The fact is admitted on all sides, that the advance of
                    enlightenment and civilisation has surrounded the enforcement of capital
                    punishment with rapidly increasing difficulties. The probability that in a short
                    time we shall witness the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal,
                    sufficiently proves that this is the case. It is felt to be a great anomaly that
                    the mercy of the Crown should be lodged in the person of one State official, who
                    has practically to try over again any doubtful case, while for those of clearer
                    evidence he simply refers to the judge who presided at the trial, and who
                    naturally reaffirms his former decision.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that this system is eminently unsatisfactory, and it seems to
                    be extremely likely that the new court will be so also, in a still higher
                    degree. Indeed, in the opinion of men of great legal experience, it will be
                    found almost impossible to work it in accordance with the existing law as
                    regards trial by jury. We may judge of the difficulties involved in its <choice>
                        <orig>constituâ<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7158-240"></pb> tion</orig>
                        <reg>constitution</reg>
                    </choice> from the following words of the Master of the Rolls, who, in dealing
                    with the subject, insists on five primary conditions. âThe first condition, in
                    my opinion,â he writes, âis that the court should be the strongest which can be
                    invented. To ensure this, it should, as to its members, not be a varying court,
                    but should consist of judges nominated by the Crown once for all for life or
                    until resignation. The number of the judges should be seven, with a quorum of
                    five. The judges should be bound, in case of a conviction and sentence of death,
                    at any inconvenience to other business, unless absolutely prevented, to attend
                    in London within seven days after any such sentence, and in other cases at any
                    time fixed by the president of the court. The second condition, in my opinion,
                    is that the appeal should be as large as possible, on law, facts, and sentence,
                    with the largest discretionary power as to any means by which, in the opinion of
                    the court, it could be assisted to arrive at a right, just, and merciful
                    conclusion. Thirdly, it should be declared in the Act that the decision in each
                    case <pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7158-241"></pb> must be made to depend on the
                    circumstances of the particular case. Fourthly, in my opinion, the consideration
                    of mercy arising from particular circumstancesâas, for instance, youth, extreme
                    sickness, intolerable though not legal exasperation, despairâshould not be
                    excluded from the power of the court. Fifthly, the decision in any case should
                    not necessarily be final, if after it new facts should arise or could be brought
                    forward. Although I would allow the consideration of mercy to be given to the
                    court, I would not take away the prerogative of mercy in the Crown to be
                    exercised beyond and above the power of the court.â</p>
                <p>There is one obvious difficulty with regard to the proposed court which it
                    requires no legal acumen to foresee. It is quite certain that when once it is
                    known to exist, the right of appeal to it will be exercised on every occasion
                    when a death sentence has been pronounced under any circumstances whatever. The
                    remark of a woman who saw a notorious criminal being led to the scaffold, âAh!
                    but he was somebodyâs bairn,â embodies a <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7158-242"></pb>
                    sentiment which holds good for all time. There is no living being, however
                    brutal and depraved, who has fallen so completely out of the range of our common
                    humanity, that there remains no one on earth who has an interest in his fate.
                    How far soever he has made himself a curse, and outraged all natural affection,
                    he will still to this extent be in touch with his fellowâcreatures, that there
                    will always be a mother or wife, a friend or brother, sometimes even a victim of
                    his cruel propensities, who will seek to save him from that hanging by the neck
                    till he is dead, against which there is so strong a sense of revolt among the
                    lower orders.</p>
                <p>It is clear that if there is to be an appeal and a new trial by a differently
                    constituted body, in every case where the capital penalty has been awarded by
                    the verdict of a jury and the sentence of a judge, the possibility of its
                    retention as a legal punishment will become a very great problem. Nevertheless
                    there can be no doubt that any proposal for its total abolition will meet with
                    violent opposition from a very influential majority in the <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7158-243"></pb> country. It is true that the extraordinary
                    callousness and indifference to human life of former times no longer exists
                    amongst us, as a rule. We have made a gradually progressive advance from the
                    days, in Henry VIII.âs reign, when a thousand vagrants were hanged in one year
                    for the crime of poverty; or from those of that eminently fatherly monarch
                    George III. when, as an old chronicle expresses it, âa score or so of villains
                    were turned off at Tyburn every Monday morning,â and when Mary Jones, a young
                    married woman with a newâborn infant in her arms, was hanged for taking a small
                    piece of cloth from the counter of a shop, which she restored on the instant
                    when her attempt was detected. Even in the course of the present century before
                    the change in the law, public feeling had not been much aroused on the subject.
                    The writer can remember being told by a very benevolent old clergyman, that in
                    his youth a man had been hanged for setting fire to one of his hayâricks. Being
                    asked whether he could not have obtained a reprieve for him as the prosecutor in
                    the case, he answered quietly that he had not triedâit had never occurred<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7158-244"></pb> to him to think of saving the poor culprit
                    from a punishment in such general use.</p>
                <p>In spite of the enthusiasm of humanity which is supposed to be rife among us now,
                    we have not perhaps passed even yet very far beyond the spirit of these
                    timesâsince a few months ago an astute politician, in conversation with the
                    writer, strongly advocated capital punishment on the ground that it was the
                    cheapest mode of disposing of criminals. It is to be hoped that there are not
                    many who would share the views of this very economical gentleman; and we are
                    quite prepared to admit that most of those who desire the retention of the death
                    penalty are influenced by highly conscientious motives,âonly we are satisfied
                    that they are founded on absolute fallacies. That which undoubtedly weighs the
                    most powerfully with all such persons is the conviction that capital punishment
                    is a deterrent of crime. This idea is so deeply implanted in the sense of the
                    community, that it seems almost in vain to hope that it may ever be rooted out.
                    It is repeated from one to another by persons who have no possible means of
                    knowing <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7158-245"></pb> whether the assertion is true or not;
                    it is reâechoed with parrotâlike precision whenever the subject of the extreme
                    penalty of the law is mooted anywhere. It sounds very plausible, and it is a
                    truly comfortable theory on which conservative minds can rest their complacent
                    acquiescence in the existing state of matters; but we desire to state in the
                    strongest words we can use, that this argument in favour of the death penalty is
                    absolutely and radically false. We do not make this assertion without warrant;
                    our practical experience has been very extensive. Even the few histories we have
                    given in the preceding pages illustrate, so far as they go, the undoubted fact
                    that crimes of violence are for the most part committed in the blind heat of
                    passion by persons who are not in the habit of reasoning logically on any of
                    their actions, and who never give a thought to the penal consequences of the
                    deeds to which they are driven by the frenzy of the moment. Apart, however, from
                    this practical obstacle to the deterring power of the legal murder, there
                    remains the fact which we cannot assert too emphatically, that death is not <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7158-246"></pb> the punishment which lawless men dread the
                    most. Generally speaking, as some of the cases cited in our former chapters have
                    shown, they do not dread it at all. Is there no significance in the truth that
                    death is constantly being sought by suicide, and that frequently the means used
                    to obtain the shelter of the grave is the very process by which the law inflicts
                    its supreme punishment on the guilty?</p>
                <p>In this age, especially when pessimism has invaded all classes, men not only do
                    not dread death, but they often fiercely desire it. They seek it, they look
                    forward to it as the cure of all mortal illsâthe sure and painless refuge from
                    the agony of life. Would that our legislators could be brought to realise the
                    fact that, whatever may have been the case in former generations, the fear of
                    death will deter neither man nor woman from crime in the present day.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a punishment which is unspeakably dreaded by the class from
                    which most of our criminals are recruitedâand that is flogging. We believe that
                    if the infliction of the lash, <pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7158-247"></pb> joined to
                    penal servitude, which they also hold in horror, were to be the penalty for
                    murder, it would have at least such a deterrent effect as any punishment can
                    have which is pitted against the passions of menâand it certainly would operate
                    far more effectually than the prospect of being relegated to the unconsciousness
                    of the grave.</p>
                <p>Independent of our fundamental principle that no dread of the capital penalty
                    diminishes crime, the manner in which it is now inflicted is not calculated to
                    make an impression of any kind on the people. It was undoubtedly a meritorious
                    act of legislation when public executions were put an end to, with all the
                    scandal of the disgraceful scenes which occurred on such occasions; but it is
                    certain that any effect to be produced on the people by the fact that hanging is
                    to avenge murder, could only be realised if the actual infliction of it were an
                    open spectacle visible to the eyes of all. The private strangling or
                    unintentional beheading of convicts in some disused cell of the prison or other
                    hidden receptacle for the gallows, and in the presence of only halfâaâdozen
                    officials, is not a <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7158-248"></pb> ceremony which has any
                    impressiveness for the outside public, or, we may add, any appearance of
                    justice. They are apt to term it in their phraseology a âholeâandâcorner
                    proceedingââand so it literally is. While our legislators are calmly engaged
                    with their breakfast on some fair morning, a handful of men, concealed behind
                    impervious walls, solemnly conduct a fellowâcreature a few steps from the bed
                    where he has lain by night, and in some dark corner suspend him over a hole dug
                    through the flooring, into which they let him drop with a violent shock and
                    break his neck, or wrench his head off as occasionally happens.<ref target="#skene-silent07">Â¹</ref> The <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="skene-silent07">Â¹ Those who, while wishing to retain the death
                        penalty, are yet desirous of seeing it more mercifully carried out, would
                        not gain much by the new American plan of execution by electricity. In a
                        lecture given by a distinguished person on what he termed âmurder by law,â
                        he said that the electric deathâchair was the most mercilessly cruel
                        invention that ever emanated from the human brain, and certainly his
                        assertion is borne out by the description given of the manner in which it is
                        to operate. After mature deliberation, the following plan has been devised
                        for this new form of execution: A stout table, covered with rubberâcloth,
                        and having holes along its border for binding, or a strong chair, should be
                        procured. The prisoner, lying on his back or sitting, should be firmly bound
                        upon this table or in the chair. One electrode should be so inserted in the
                        table or into the back of<milestone unit="section"></milestone> the chair, that it
                        would impinge upon the spine between the shoulders. The head should be
                        secured by means of a sort of helmet fastened to the table or back of the
                        chair, and to this helmet the other pole should be joined, so as to press
                        firmly with its end upon the top of the head. The chair is recommended in
                        preference to the table. The rheophores can be led off to a dynamo through
                        the floor or to another room, and the instrument for closing the circuit can
                        be attached to the wall. The electrodes should be of metal, not over one
                        inch in diameter, somewhat oval in shape, and covered with a thick layer of
                        ponge or chamoisâskin. The poles and the skin and the hair at the points of
                        contact should be thoroughly wet with warm water. The hair should be cut
                        short. A dynamoâgenerating and electromotive force of at least 3000 volts
                        should be employed. Either a continuous or alternating current may be used,
                        but preferably the latter. The current should be allowed to pass for thirty
                        seconds.</note>
                    <pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7158-249"></pb> waving of a black flag in the air for a short
                    time as the outward token of this secret proceeding, is not a powerful means of
                    arousing attention except in the most transitory manner. Thus it is that, unless
                    some peculiarity in the case has created a special interest in the criminal, his
                    death at the hands of the common hangman passes by with very little notice
                    indeed, from those it is supposed to influence.</p>
                <p>The idea strongly supported by some writers, that through the infliction of death
                    for the crime <pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7158-250"></pb> of murder the public mind is to
                    be educated into a sense of the enormity of the act, is an absolutely baseless
                    theory which has no standpoint in reality. Even if such a result were possible
                    in the old times, when a legislation of terror was supposed to be the only means
                    of controlling the brutish masses of untaught, unreasoning people, it is a
                    manifest truism that we have now to deal with totally different forces, in the
                    intelligence and mental independence of our existing populations. They are much
                    more concerned to criticise the acts of the legislature than to be morally
                    influenced by them. In the course of the last few years, before it was decreed
                    that executions should no longer be public, it happened that several of these
                    ghastly tragedies followed each other quickly; and it is, we believe, a known
                    fact that several of the men who then expiated their guilt on the scaffold had
                    been present as spectators at the execution preceding their own, and had closely
                    watched all the appalling details. Their own violent actions, in the course of a
                    very short time afterwards, sufficiently proved that their education in <choice>

                        <reg>tenderness</reg>
                    </choice> or morality had not been advanced by the painful sight. And here we
                    arrive at a point of the highest importance in the question we are discussing;
                    for we feel bound to affirm on the most substantial grounds that so far from the
                    death penalty being a deterrent to murder, it operates, in fact, as an actual
                    encouragement to it. It has the effect of destroying the intuitive sense of the
                    sanctity of human life among the people. They no longer, as of old, look upon
                    their legislators as infallible, and are in the habit of subjecting their
                    enactments to a certain rough logic which cannot easily be gainsaid. They are
                    disposed to take rather an ironical view of the singular arrangement which
                    punishes the crime of murder by the perpetration of another murder in cold blood
                    under the Ã¦gis of the law. Our working men, who now think and reason for
                    themselves, are wont to say that if it is lawful and right in the authorities to
                    kill a man deliberately because he has taken the life of another, it must be
                    equally justifiable on their part to knock on the head any scoundrel who has
                    done them or theirs some deadly <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7158-252"></pb> injury, of
                    perhaps a much more diabolical character. The fact that they do maintain this
                    argument, and exemplify it by their actions, ought to weigh heavily in the scale
                    against the continuance of the capital penalty. This element in the question was
                    strongly felt by the late Mr Bright, whose hope was not realised that he might,
                    as he expressed it, see the gallowsâtree cut down before his death. Speaking on
                    the subject, he said âthat whenever the shocking punishment of hanging was
                    inflicted, we weakened by so much that security to society resulting from the
                    reverence with which human life is regarded.â</p>
                <p>Many of those who uphold the <foreign xml:lang="lat">lex talionis</foreign> do so
                    on the high ground that it is a Divine command. A dignitary of the Church, who
                    was most vehemently in favour of it, admitted to the writer lately, that unless
                    it were the distinct ordinance of God we had no right to take, even judicially,
                    the life of a fellowâcreature. He seemed to have no doubt whatever that it was a
                    decree of the Eternal Justice; but where, we may ask, is there <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7158-253"></pb> any real warrant for such a belief? In these critical
                    days, when every line of the sacred text is submitted to a searching
                    examination, it is surely no longer possible to found this sanguinary law on one
                    obscure verse in the earlier portion of the Pentateuch, of which the translation
                    is so doubtful that it is quite open to question whether it does not imply a
                    prophecy instead of a command. In those rude times, when the avenger of blood
                    followed swiftly on the track of slaughter, it might well be predicted that
                    whosoever shed manâs blood, by man would his blood be shed. Is it not a very
                    significant fact, in opposition to the construction generally put on that verse,
                    that according to the same Record, the first murderer, Cain, was divinely
                    sentenced to life and not to death? Supposing even, however, that it did suggest
                    a command at that period, are we in our widely different days to hold ourselves
                    bound by a single isolated enactment of a primeval Theocracy whose elaborate
                    rules on other subjects we systematically ignore? It is simply part of the old
                    Hebrew law, âan eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,â <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7158-254"></pb> which the Divine Founder of Christianity distinctly
                    repudiated.</p>
                <p>Another theory of the supporters of capital punishment is undoubtedly entitled to
                    respect, inasmuch as it does breathe a certain spirit of charity, though arising
                    from a merely imaginary hypothesis. This is the favourite idea that a man who
                    suffers death on the scaffold escapes a future retribution, receiving his
                    punishment in this life and passing to the Divine Judgment with an assurance, or
                    at least a reasonable hope, of pardon which he could not otherwise possess. If
                    we had any reliable ground for this belief, it might certainly go far to
                    reconcile us to a law which cannot in other respects be defended; but the theory
                    is a pure assumption, for which not a shadow of proof can be brought forward.
                    Taking a commonâsense view of the matter, it amounts to an attempt on our part
                    to arrange the affairs of Providence according to our own ideasâand that is a
                    proceeding which can hardly be justified even by the highest benevolence. Were
                    it possible, however, for the advocates of this <choice>

                    </choice> argument to prove that it rested on a substantial basis, we should
                    still hold that the powerful reasons which preponderate against the death
                    penalty, outweigh a thousandfold everything which can be suggested in its
                    favour.</p>
                <p>We are at present looking at the subject merely in its practical bearing on the
                    interests of the community, leaving aside the higher principles on which the
                    most unanswerable objections to the law are founded; and dealing only with this
                    lower ground, it is at once evident that the strongest argument against the
                        <foreign xml:lang="lat">lex talionis</foreign> rests on the fallibility of
                    human judgment. It is a fact which cannot be disputed, that innocent persons
                    have repeatedly suffered an unjust death on the scaffold. In an article which
                    lately appeared in the âFortnightly Review,â entitled âThe Case against Capital
                    Punishment,â we find the following statistics: âSir James Mackintosh, a most
                    cool and dispassionate observer, declared that, taking a long period of time,
                    one innocent man was hanged in every three yearsâ; while the late ChiefâBaron
                    Kelly stated as the result of his experience, that in a <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7158-256"></pb> period of thirtyâeight years no less than twentyâtwo
                    innocent persons had been sentenced to death, of whom seven were actually
                    executed; and other cases are instanced where condemned men were only saved by
                    the confession of the actual culprit.</p>
                <p>It is not, however, only in cruel mistakes of this nature that the imperfection
                    of human judgment operates most forcibly: there are gradations in the guilt
                    which consists in taking the life of a fellowâcreature, and there ought to be
                    gradations in the punishment assigned to it. But no distinction is made between
                    the heinous wickedness of a murder elaborately planned and deliberately carried
                    out, and that which has resulted from a sudden stroke given in a moment of wild
                    exasperation by a man driven almost mad through unendurable provocation. If the
                    act comes technically under the head of murder and not of manslaughter, the
                    penalty is the same. Recent scientific researches into the law of heredity have
                    gone far to prove that propensities to crime may be the result of physical
                    causes, even where they<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7158-257"></pb> cannot be classed with
                    cases of actual insanity; and how is any fallible human judge to discriminate as
                    to the greater or less guilt of individuals so constituted? A punishment not
                    irrevocable would leave time for the development of the truth. Apart from these
                    more subtle difficulties, the inequalities of the justice meted out to our
                    fellowâmortals under the law we are considering, may be seen and estimated in
                    cases that are continually recurring. We will instance two that might be cited,
                    out of numbers within our own knowledge.</p>
                <p>Some years ago an elderly gentleman holding an office which entitled him to
                    special respect was proved to have been guilty of the murder of his wife, under
                    circumstances of especial barbarity. He had deliberately planned it for a long
                    time previously: he had prepared a box in which he was to place her dismembered
                    body, when he had with his own hands reduced it to the dimensions necessary for
                    its concealment in that receptacle. During the days that he was making these
                    coldâblooded arrangements, he was living in his usual daily <choice>
                        <orig>interâ<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7158-258"></pb> course</orig>
                        <reg>intercourse</reg>
                    </choice> with the doomed woman, sharing his meals with her, and passing his
                    evenings quietly by her side. When the moment fixed in his long premeditation
                    arrived, he fell upon her and slew her, afterwards disposing of her remains in
                    the manner we have indicated. All these facts were conclusively proved, but the
                    murderer was acquitted on the ground of insanityâa plea which later was known to
                    have been much more than doubtful. About the same time a fine young man of
                    excellent character, residing in a country village near the home of the writer,
                    was brought to trial on the capital charge. He had attached himself with all the
                    strength of a first love to a girl he hoped to marry. They were engaged, when a
                    rival came on the scene, and the young woman, giddy and careless, with strong
                    tendencies to the coarse coquetry of her class, openly manifested her preference
                    for the newâcomer. Day after day she found means to rouse the jealousy of her
                    true lover to an almost ungovernable pitch. Still he had been forbearing and
                    gentle with her through it all, till one evening when he was seated by the
                    kitchenâfire in the <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7158-259"></pb> house where they
                    generally met, she came in, and after displaying her fondness for her new
                    admirer, hurled every taunting and scornful epithet she could think of at her
                    betrothed. Stung almost to madness, in one moment of fierce exasperation he
                    snatched up the poker lying close to him and dealt her a single blow with it on
                    the back of the head. It did not kill her, nor was it in the first instance in
                    any sense a mortal wound, but he was taken into custody for the assault, full of
                    grief and remorse for his momentary violence. The girl lived for a month, during
                    the whole of which period her complete recovery was perfectly possible; but at
                    last inflammation of the brain set in, and she died. The young man, who had not
                    probably retained a spark of animosity against her after his one passionate blow
                    had been given, was duly executed; while the wifeâmurderer, in full possession
                    of his senses it is believed, enjoyed a country retirement at Broadwood,
                    surrounded by every comfort.</p>
                <p>We have very recently seen a death sentence commuted to penal servitude in a case
                    which <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7158-260"></pb> caused great popular excitementâmainly,
                    it would seem, because the criminal was a person of culture and good looks. In
                    grim contrast to her escape, only a few months previously a poor woman was
                    hanged for a crime infinitely less heinous than that of which the lady was
                    accused. Moreover, it became known at the time of her execution that she had
                    been instigated to the act for which she suffered by a person who had unbounded
                    influence over her, and who had indeed assisted her in the crime, though keeping
                    himself well out of the way while the inquiry was going on. Yet not a hope of
                    reprieve ever came to the unhappy pauper, born and bred in an obscure slum,
                    where no light of knowledge touching anything in heaven or earth ever gleamed on
                    her darkened soul, and where the struggle to get bread for herself and the
                    little starvelings who had crossed her path without being allied to her, bounded
                    the range of her ideas from day to day.</p>
                <p>It will doubtless be affirmed that these inequalities in the administration of
                    justice are quite unavoidable. It may be so; but in view of the <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7158-261"></pb> fallibility and circumscribed potentialities of the
                    human nature, have we any right ever to inflict a punishment which is
                    irrevocable? Is it not enough that we are ourselves but blind creatures of a
                    day, groping amid bewildering mysteries on the brink of that impenetrable gulf
                    of death which awaits us one and all; and shall we precipitate others of our
                    race into its unknown depths, because of the evil deeds they have done in that
                    portion of their existence which alone is visible? Within the limits of this
                    tangible life their crime was committed,âwithin these limits let it be expiated.
                    And here we touch the grand fundamental reason which seems to prohibit human
                    beings absolutely from the judicial destruction of life that goes by the name of
                    the capital penalty. When we look this matter in the face, stripped of all its
                    legal claims and the associations with which custom and prejudice have
                    surrounded it, we see that in dealing death to a fellowâmortal we are inflicting
                    a punishment of which we know neither the meaning, nor the issue, nor the
                    extent. The pains and penalties which a man may be <pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7158-262"></pb> made to suffer during his tenure of earthly
                    existence, can be meted out to him in precise proportion to the crimes committed
                    within the same limits. We know exactly what we are doing in the retribution
                    with which we visit his sins on earth. The whole transaction in all its bearings
                    is open before us, and can be weighed and measured according to the most rigid
                    lines of justice; but we are in absolute ignorance of the very nature as well as
                    the ultimate results of the punishment of death, and there can, therefore, be no
                    moral justification for its infliction by human beings on their
                    fellowâcreatures. Of the mystery of life we know nothing, save that we have not
                    the power to create it or to bestow it on others, and consequently can have no
                    right to destroy it; and of death we only know that it is irrevocable as well as
                    impenetrableâthat the day fixed by men for its consummation on one of their race
                    is not that which would have brought his existence to a natural termination. He
                    would have lived for an indefinite period longer, with what results to <pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7158-263"></pb> his immortal being in this world or the next
                    we cannot guess. At our bidding, subject to the convenience of the hangman, he
                    goesâwhere we know not, under conditions wholly hidden from us. Not knowing in
                    the faintest degree what we are doing with him, we fling him out of our
                    sightâout of our knowledge; we dismiss him from our responsibilities,âand with
                    blind eyes and hands unguided, we hurl him into the mysteries of an inscrutable
                    eternity.</p>
                <p>It will be said that in what we have written against the existing law of capital
                    punishment, we have been actuated by a sentimental tenderness towards crimeâa
                    weak desire to spare the murderer the tortures he has inflicted on his victim.
                    It is not so. All who have the welfare of the community at heart, must strongly
                    desire that evilâdoers should receive the just reward of their deeds with all
                    due severity. We have already specified certain punishments which criminals
                    dread infinitely more than death, and that are in truth terrible in a far higher
                    degree. Let their crimes <pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7158-264"></pb> be visited by these,
                    and the sternest legislators may rest assured that justice will be fully
                    satisfied; but let not a human touch, even by the impersonal hand of the law, be
                    laid on the sacred, mysterious life which God alone can give, and God alone may
                    righteously take away.</p>
