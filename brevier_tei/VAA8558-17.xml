          <p>The senatorial oath was then administered by Hon. JAMES R. SLACK, of Huntington County,

          <p> Mr. REEVE offered the following resolution:</p>
          <floatingText>
            <body>
              <div type="resolution">
                <p>"Resolved. That for the purpose of effecting a speedy and complete
                  organization of the Senate, Daniel D. Dale, of White County, be and is hereby
                  chosen Principal Secretary; Charles W. Ward. of Vermillion County, Assistant
                  Secretary,and Richard Huncheon of Laporte County, Doorkeeper of the Senate for the
                  present term."</p>

            </body>
          </floatingText>
          <p>And demanded the previous Question on it's adoption.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS rose to a point of order. Under the Constitution these officers can not be
            elected by resolution.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The point of order is not well taken. The question is on
            seconding the demand for the previous question,</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS appealed from the decision of the Chair [Mr. Grubbs joining him], and
            demanded that his appeal be decided at once.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair thinks there is no point of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS desired the Secretary to note that appeal from the decision of the
            Chair.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Chair again decided that their is no point of order.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS. We desire to be on the record.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The question is on seconding the demand for the previous
            question, made by the Senator from Marshall, [Mr. Reeve.]</p>
          <!--Unreocrded Vote-->
          <p>Messrs. HARRIS and OLDS demanded the yeas and nays. They were ordered, and being taken,
            resulted--yeas 25, nays 25.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR was called upon, and voting "aye," announced
            the result as follows - ayes 26, nays 25.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS raised a point of order that the Lieutenant Governor can not vote on a
            proposition to second a demand for the previous question.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR - The Chair is clearly of the opinion that upon every question,
            except the passage of a bill, the Lieutenant Governor has as good a right to vote; as
            any other member on the floor and he does not intend to surrender his constitutional
            privileges. The demand for the previous question has been seconded. The question now is
            "Shall the main question be now put?"</p>
          <p> Messrs HARRIS and. OLDS again demanded the yeas and nays. They were ordered, and being
            taken resulted as the vote just taken - the Lieutenant Governor giving the casting vote
            - so the main question was ordered.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS called for a division of the resolution so the vote shall be taken first on
            the election of the principal secretary, second on the election of the assistant
            secretary, and third on the election of the doorkeeper,</p>
          <p>The vote on the first clause of the resolution resulted, in a tie, as before, the
            Lieutenant Governor giving the casting vote in the affirmative.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS made the point of order that the President of the Senate, in the election of
            officers of the Senate, only performs the duty of the Auditor of State. If the
            Lieutenant Governor were absent, the Auditor would have no right to vote, and the
            President, of the Senate has not.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the point of order not well taken.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS desired to take an appeal from the decision of the chair.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided there was nothing to appeal from.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS - I am a Senator upon this floor - </p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (interposing) The Senator will take his seat.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS. I desire that my appeal may be entered on the record.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR - The Senator can have his appeal entered after the vote is
            taken. We are operating under the previous question.</p>
          <p>The second and third clauses, and the resolution as a whole were severally adopted by
            the same vote as heretofore, which is as follows:</p>
          <floatingText>
            <body>
              <div type="vote">
                <p>Those voting aye were Messrs. Benz, Briscoe, Burnell, Coffey, Donham, Foster.
                  Fowler, Hart, Hefron, Kent, Kramer, Leeper, Major, Menzies, Peterson, Reeves,
                  Riley, Sarninghausen, Tarlton, Traylor, Urrston, Viehe, Wood, Woollen,
                  Winterbotham and Mr. President - 26.</p>
                <p>Those voting nay were Messrs. Cadwallader, Comstock, Davenport, Davis, Dice,
                  Gamigus, Grubbs, Harris, Heilman, Kahlo, Langdon, Mercer, Moore, Olds, Poindexter,
                  Ragan, Shaffer, Shirk, Smith, Streight, Taylor, Treat, Trusler, Weir and Wilson -
                  25.</p>
              </div>
            </body>
          </floatingText>
          <p>Pending the announcement of the final vote</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said: I desire to file my protest. The point of order I make is that the
            Auditor of State be present to organize the Senate, the President of the Senate has no
            right under the Constitution to vote.</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Journal will not show that the Auditor of State is
            organizing the Senate. I think I am doing that myself. [Laughter.]</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT. The Chair decides that there is no point of order and refuses to put the
            question</p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (interposing). The Chair is announcing a vote.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT asked the Chair to settle this question now.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR The Chair will not do it now. The Senator knows it is not
            proper to interrupt the Chair when announcing a vote. The vote is yeas, 26; nays, 25; so
            the resolution is adopted, and the Chair declares Daniel D. Bale duly elected Principal
            Secretary of the Senate, Charles W Ward duly elected Assistant Secretary of the Senate,
            and Richard Huncheon Doorkeeper thereof</p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM moved that the vote by which the resolution was adopted be
            reconsidered, and to lay the latter motion on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS demanded a division of the question.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR - It is not susceptible of division. The motion to lay the
            motion to reconsider on the table was agreed to by yeas, 26; nays, 25.</p>
          <p>Then came a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p>On motion of Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the rules of the last session were adopted for the
              government of the Senate pro tempore.</p>
            <p>Resolutions were adopted providing stationers' supplies; for
              committees' to wait upon the Governor and the House of Representatives, and
              on mileage and accounts, etc.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT - GOVERNOR laid before <pb n="3" xml:id="VAA8558-17-005"/> the Senate
              papers in the contested election case from the district composed of the counties of

            <p>Mr. REEVE moved their reference to a special committee of five, to be appointed by
              the Chair--himself not to be of the number.</p>

            <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to make this subject the special order for to-morrow at 2
              o'clock p. m., which was agreed to after Mr. Reeve had made an ineffectual

            of the Fifty-first General Assembly of the State of Indiana, the oath of office being
            administered by Judge NIBLACK.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER said:</p>
          <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- I return yon my heartfelt thanks for the
            distinguished honor you have conferred upon me in electing me to the honorable and
            responsible position of presiding over your deliberations during the present session At
            the very threshold of entering upon the official duties thus confided to me I promise
            you that no effort shall be spared on my part to discharge them in a manner alike
            satisfactory to you and honorable to myself, I shall summon to my aid all that there is
            in me of ability, energy and untiring devotion.</p>
          <p>It was the remark of a Roman consul, in an early period of that celebrated Republic,
            that a most striking difference was observed in the contrast of candidates for offices
            of power and trust <hi rend="i">before</hi> and <hi rend="i">after</hi> obtaining them.
            But I promise you that it shall be my constant endeavor to conduct myself whilst I
            occupy the chair and hold the symbol of official authority in this House as to fulfill
            the just, expectations you entertained in thus honoring me, or which I may have held out
            as inducements to determine your action. Standing, as I now do, in the presence and in
            hearing of the electors whose generous suffrages have placed me in this position, I can,
            without fear and consistently with truth, look them in the face and declare, without a
            blush, that I have resorted to no methods to secure it inconsistent with honor and
            integrity. In an effort to gratify an ambition flattering to the mind of every man above
            a groveling disposition, I have said or done nothing which I now have any just cause to
            regret, which I would be prompted by any worthy motive to conceal, or which is in the
            least inconsistent with the most strict and rigid rules of honorable and fair
            dealing.</p>
          <p>I freely confess to you that it is with fear and trembling that I approach the
            discharge of the duties devolved upon me as your presiding officer. I feel this moment
            in my heart that I am wanting in the necessary elements to enable me to discharge them
            properly and efficiently. I can only assure you, gentlemen that I shall do my best to
            please you and discharge my duty, and shall rely in a great measure upon your generous
            forbearance, and respectfully request your co-operation and advice in enabling me to
            forward and execute your will and pleasure. I am conscious, and am not backward in
            confessing that there art upon the floor of the House those whose knowledge and
            experience are far superior to any acquirements of my own, whose advice is confidently
            expected and will always be heeded. I flatter myself that I am not among the number of
            those who lay claim to perfection or object to criticism, but on the contrary, ever hold
            myself open to correction,and covet it when administered in a proper spirit. I wish you
            gentlemen to distinctly understand that I do not imagine or claim that I am the master
            of this House, but freely acknowledge I am only its servant. To use the language of Mr.
            Leuthal, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, "I have neither eyes to see,
            nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose
            servant I am here."</p>
          <p>I desire to say further in this connection that upon taking this chair and assuming the
            duties of the presiding officer of the House of Representatives, I lay aside all
            partisan feeling, and shall only be guided and controlled by the rules and usages of
            parliamentary law as I understand them, I now claim to be and shall endeavor to act as
            the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and not of any particular part or parcel
            thereof. It will be my duty and my pleasure to give all the members of this House an
            impartial and attentive hearing. I shall make it my special duty to observe attentively
            all the proceedings that transpire in this hall, and shall endeavor to hear every word
            that is uttered by any member on this floor, for the purpose of maintaining and
            preserving order and decorum, and of promptly checking in its incipiency any infraction
            of them.</p>
          <p>In the eye of the law every member of this House is the peer of his fellow, and all
            stand on a perfect level and equality. Whatever difference may exist in the
            acquirements, knowledge, natural gifts or social standing of one member as compared with
            another, as the representatives of free and equal constituencies you all are entitled to
            the same privileges and are all equal the one with the other. I an aware that in this
            Assembly to-day there an many members who come here for the first time, to perform the
            highest and most honorable civil duty,that of representing free and enlightened
            constituency, and which may on that account be restrained by a natural diffidence to
            enter upon the discharge of new and untried performances. But I desire to say to all
            such that it will be my especial care and effort to deal with you in such a manner as to
            inspire confidence and give courage and self possession, and to lay the foundation for
            this treatment I desire to assure you that you can not, on your part, in any duty you
            will have to perform, suffer greater embarrassment than your humble servant now feels in
            entering upon the discharge of his own.</p>
          <p>I also desire to have it understood that in the appointment of all committees of the
            House it will be my aim and purpose to so frame them as to make them efficient, and the
            work to be accomplished by <pb n="5" xml:id="VAA8558-17-007"/> by them pleasant and
            agreeable to the members composing them, being conscious the same will be properly
            performed and discharged only when it, conforms to their wishes and tastes. In the
            committee room all the work of legislation is planned and carved out, and the success of
            the session depends in a great measure upon their being constituted to the satisfaction
            of their members. I shall endeavor to form these committees of members conversant and
            friendly to the different, subjects with which they shall have to deal. In order to do
            this, I shall expect, and now request, the co-operation and advice of the members of
            this House. All parties represented on the floor shall have a full and fair
            representation according to their strength, and I now here publicly request information
            from all such sources as to their wants and desires in the premises.</p>
          <p>We are, gentlemen, gathered together from all parts of the State, and for the most part
            we come together as strangers to each other, But it is my desire and I hope I shall have
            the pleasure of forming the personal acquaintance of every member of the House, I hope
            that at every member will feel disposed to reciprocate my feeling in this regard, and
            will have no hesitancy in approaching me for this purpose. I may to some appear
            reserved, but I assure you, gentlemen, it arises from a natural diffidence, which clings
            to roe notwithstanding the fact, from professional and official employments, I have had
            frequent occasion to appear on public occasions.</p>
          <p>We have met gentlemen to discharge a sacred trust reposed in us by our constituents,
            and it behooves us on every principle that can stimulate human action to do all in our
            power to discharge if in a proper manner. You represent a civilized, energetic and
            progressive population, rapidly advancing in all the avenues of material wealth and
            development, which has given an increased impetus to the arts. Ingenuity is written on
            every object that greets the eye around us. No object is too low and none too lofty for
            the comprehension of our people. Its impress is written, on the humble spinster wheel
            with its single flyer, and on the lofty factory of 10,000 spindles. It improves the
            wheat fan; it constructs the cotton gin and reforms the plow; it gives power to the loom
            and force to the iron mill; it stalks up the current of the waters in a steam car; it
            mounts the lofty billow of the ocean against wind and tide in the steam ship; its magic
            power imprints a volume in an hour on the steam press; it flies a thousand miles a
            second on the telegraph. These are the evidences of the thrift and contrivances of the
            people whose continued material, social and moral prosperity and advance depends largely
            upon the prudence and wisdom of the legislation that will be originated and matured in
            this General Assembly.</p>
          <p>And, gentlemen, will you bear with me a moment whilst I call your attention to the
            character and capabilities of the great State, whose best interests are committed to
            your care and keeping. Everything in our great and growing State tends to dilate the
            heart, to send it upward in gratitude to a fatherly God; to send it outward in kindness
            to the brotherhood of man. The sky itself takes dimensions of grandeur tilted to the
            glorious scope of empire which it overhangs. Nowhere is the calm more divinely fair:
            nowhere is the storm more awfully sublime; nowhere does the sun shine forth with a more
            fearless beauty. Health lives in the breeze, and plenty comes teeming from the soil.
            Broad dominions, to be measured in leagues only by a scale of hundreds, snatch
            imagination from every belittling influence. There are ocean lakes in which, kingdoms
            might be buried and leave on the surface no ripple of their graves; rivers that sweep
            over half a world; cataracts eternal and resistless, that hymn forever the omnipotence
            which they resemble; mountains that stretch into the upper light and mock from their
            snow-crowned pinnacles the clouds and the thunders that crash below." Of such a
            country we form an integral part, and the very heart and center thereof. Indiana has a
            school fund the most princely of any State in the Union, and a system of common schools
            which brings within the reach of every child the possibility of an education sufficient
            for all the wants and purposes or social and business life. Indiana has a net work of
            railroads unsurpassed by any State in the Union, which consolidates and binds together
            with ties of iron the people of the State in one grand and united whole. Indiana is rich
            in all the elements of material wealth, which only needs development to advance and
            elevate her position among the sister States of the Union. All these great and ;
            diverified interests are committed to your fostering care, and by judicious and proper
            legislation may be greatly advanced and benefit, as oy a contrary course they may be
            retarded and defrauded. The people of the State expect of you that all the interests of
            the State will be properly cared for, and will sustain you in all needed legislation to
            accomplish this purpose, It is true you assemble in a time of great prostration of
            business and financial and commercial distress; and while it is right and proper that
            strict and rigid economy should be manifested and preserved in all appropriations, yet
            your constituents will expect and sustain you in all appropriations for educational,
            executive and judicial purposes sufficient for a healthy and proper administration of
            these varied interests. And while economy, retrenchmenty and reform should be your aim,
            I beg leave to remind you, in the language of a former distinguished seaker of this
            House, that parsimony is neither wise, good economy nor substantial reform.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I beg leave to assure you, gentlemen, that I shall do all in my power to
            make the present session of this House pleasant and agreeable to each member thereof, so
            that a recollection of it will be ever cherished by one and all, and fondly hope that
            your deliberations may culminate in such legislation as shall satisfy and gratify your
            constituents and that your work may be so approved and indorsed by them as to give a
            just cause to be proud that we were members of it.</p>
          <p>It is not my province or the line of my duty, gentlemen, to make any suggestions or
            recommendations as to the needs of the various matters of State care and concern, or the
            necessary appropriations that will be required at your hands for these various purposes.
            Upon these matters his Excellency, the Governor, will, in due time, convey to you in his
            biennial message the proper and necessary information.</p>

                  <p>I cordially welcome you to the capital for the discharge of the important
                    duties entrusted to you by the people. It will be my pleasure to aid you in
                    learning the transactions of the executive department of our State government
                    during the past two years, and in providing for the needs of our community
                    during the ensuing two years, for which we are together responsible.</p>
                  <p>The last General Assembly, having been convened in special session for the
                    completion of important matters, which had been inexcusably delayed until a late
                    day of the regular session, adjourned March 15, 1877. The acts of the two
                    session, in one volume with the "accurate statement of the receipts and
                    expenditures of the public money" required by the constitution, were so
                    "published and circulated in the several counties of the State by
                    authority," that by the receipt and filing of the same in Pike county,
                    they took effect July 2, 1877, as evidenced by my proclamation of July 5,
                    1877.</p>
                  <p>Joint resolutions proposing nine important amendments to the constitution were
                    passed, and the proposed amendments, having been agreed to by a majority of the
                    members elected to each of the two Houses, were entered upon their journals and
                    referred to the body now constituted of yourselves. It is desired that you take
                    early action upon this pending business, that the proposed amendments, if agreed
                    to by a majority of all the members elected to each House, may be at once
                    submitted to the electors of the State, and, if ratified by them, which you may
                    proceed to enact a series of wholesome laws now urgently demanded by the
                    interests of our people.</p>
                  <p>I congratulate you that the instruction to our Senators and Representatives,
                    conveyed by a joint resolution, requesting them "to use all lawful
                    means to procure the speedy enactment of a law of Congress restoring the legal
                    tender quality of the silver dollar of coinage of 1792, and making the same a
                    legal tender for the payment of all debts, public and private, except as
                    otherwise provided by law," has aided in the restoration of our
                    original unit of value, by an act of Congress to which they gave their support.
                    Sustained by its original double metallic standard, our financial system gives
                    promise of greater stability than when deprived of its support.</p>
                  <p>The mandates of other resolutions addressed to ministerial officers have been
                    obeyed, and you will be advised of the conclusions reached by them.</p>
                  <p>The act of March 7, 1877, providing judges to preside at adjourned terms, and
                    to try cases on change of venue from the judge of a circuit, has been of
                    advantage to litigants in securing a speedy trial, but the provision for
                    compensation, made in section 5, has been embarrassed in their efforts to comply
                    with an appropriations so unusual and irregular. Gentlemen who have performed
                    services await further legislation providing for their compensation.</p>
                  <p>The additional courts constituted for the counties of Marion, Allen, Cass,
                    Vanderburg, Jackson, Washington, and Wayne, have been organized by the
                    appointment and qualification and subsequent election of judges.</p>
                  <p>The acts providing for the election of township officers who were found to
                    contain conflicting provisions, which must be harmonized by you.</p>
                  <p>The modification of the act defining larceny, and prescribing a punishment more
                    within the discretion of the court than before, has served a good purpose. It
                    may be well to revise other sections of the criminal code in the light of this
                    experience.</p>
                  <p>The "act authorizing the acquisition of the Green River Island, or to
                    locate the true boundary line at said island." has been so far executed
                    as to learn from the Governor of Kentucky that the action of the commissioner
                    appointed by that State to make the survey had been ratified and confirmed by
                    the Legislature.</p>
                  <p>The attempted amendment of section 22 of the act for the incorporation of
                    towns, conferring enlarged powers upon the Board of Trustees, has been held to
                    be void, because violating as well settled rule for the amendment of
                    statutes.</p>
                  <p>I appointed Messrs. Frank Emerson, John B. Hannah and Robert P. Haynes, three
                    discreet persons, to settle and adjust the claims made against the State Prison
                    South, payable out of the appropriation of $130,000 made by the act of March 10,
                    1877. Their work was so discreetly and carefully done, as shown by their <pb n="10" xml:id="VAA8558-17-012"/> records and papers filed with the Auditor of
                    State, that a highly satisfactory adjustment and settlement was made of that
                    very troublesome floating indebtedness.</p>

                  <head rend="center">EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES,</head>
                  <p>The constitution, in dividing the powers of the government, has vested
                    "the legislative authority of the State" in yourselves, the
                    judicial power" in the courts, and the residue, "the
                    executive, <hi rend="i">including the administrative,"</hi>
                    "in a governor." The duties of the respective offices
                    denominated "administrative' are 'directed by
                    law." The officers are the ministerial agents of the people upon whom
                    duties are 'enjoined by law'' which must be literally
                    and exactly performed. The governor is charged with the duty "to
                    execute the laws," "to suppress Insurrection" and
                    "to repel invasion," and is given ample military power. It is
                    provided that "be shall from time to time give to the General Assembly
                    in information touching the condition of the State and recommend such measures
                    as he shall judge to be expedient." To do this, it is provided further
                    that "the Governor shall transact all necessary business with the
                    officers of government and may require information in writing from the officers
                    of the administrative department upon any subject relating to the duties of
                    their respective offices," and it is enjoined that <hi rend="i">"he shall take care that the laws be faithfully
                      executed."</hi> He is given power in his discretion to control the
                    execution of process upon criminal judgments and modify fines and judgments
                    rendered upon forfeited bonds. To avoid the consequences of vacancies in certain
                    ministerial offices and in the General Assembly itself he is authorized to
                    appoint to the one and "issue writs of election to fill" the
                    other. He may convene the General Assembly at a place remote from the seat of
                    government, and "may at any time by proclamation call a special
                    session." His part in the business of legislation is such that he may
                    return to the General Assembly for its reconsideration any bill for an act
                    presented to him for approval and execution. It thus appears that the Governor
                    is not a ministerial officer, but rather a supervisor of the transactions of
                    others and possessed of discretionary powers peculiarly his own, and entitled to
                    a respect equal to that accorded to each of the other departments. If so, much
                    legislation heretofore enacted imposing laborious and responsible duties of a
                    ministerial character upon the office has been justifiable simply because of the
                    acquiescence of the incumbent in the will of the law-making body, and is not a
                    good precedent to be followed. The duties incident to the establishment and
                    management of Purdue University, the House of Refuge, the Orphans'
                    Home, the Female Prison, the Insane Hospital, the State House, the valuation of
                    property for taxation and sundry other boards of an administrative character,
                    may be mentioned as examples of that disposition. With a few exceptions, the
                    office which I have the honor to hold has been treated with marked respect by
                    the administrative officers amenable to it under the constitution. The retiring
                    State officers are entitled to great credit for the zeal, Integrity and ability
                    which they have displayed in the discharge of the duties of their several
                    offices during their four years' occupancy thereof, and for the reforms
                    which they have effected therein. Each has my grateful acknowledgments for his
                    co-operation with me. One who will enter upon a further and unusual term of
                    service has in his election thereto received a rare commendation from our
                    appreciative people.</p>

                  <head rend="center">ANNUAL REPORTS, 1877.</head>
                  <p>An act approved February 3, 1853, provides for annual reports of State officers
                    and benevolent institutions, the same to be made to the Governor. Officers since
                    created have by executive requirement and implied legislative direction reported
                    in like manner. These reports for the year ending October 31, 1877, fifteen in
                    all, have been published in a volume of convenient form, entitled
                    "Annual Reports of Indiana, 1877," and are laid before you for
                    your information. The Secretary of State communicates a condensed report of the
                    business of his office for the year including a report of the proceedings of the
                    administrative boards of which he is Secretary <hi rend="i">ex officio</hi>, a
                    register of State and county officers, commissioners of deeds, notaries public
                    and justices of the peace, and others to whom commissions have issued, a list of
                    corporations and associations organized, and other matters pertaining to the
                    office The reports of the Auditor and Treasurer together constitute a complete
                    showing of the transactions of the Treasury department. Upon the enactment of
                    the appropriation laws of March 10, 1877, the fiscal business was made to
                    conform strictly to their requirements. The general fund had and received during
                    the year $2,12S.242 83, and disbursed $1,859,005 36, leaving October 31, 1877,
                    $269,237 47. The receipts included $200,000 of the temporary loan, being the
                    proceeds of a renewal at a less rate of interest of the part falling due
                    December 1, 1876, which appears to have been paid. Each disbursement account has
                    its authority in those acts, so much as precedes April 1, being legalized by the
                    third section of the first act, and the others limited by the express terms of
                    its sections one and two. As the accounts of each institution were verifiable by
                    the Auditor of State, they constitute exhibits in detail of the sums charged to
                    them. They will be carefully examined by your appropriate committees.</p>
                  <p>The report from the Department of Public Instruction is brief. Its contents
                    relate mostly to the enumeration and school attendance, and the school funds and
                    revenues for the year, and will reach you in a revised and more comprehensive
                    form in the biennial report.</p>

                    of fines and forfeitures have been made and the several amounts remitted during
                    the years 1877 and 1878, by my predecessor in office and myself, as required by
                    the constitution. Accompanying it are some tables approximating accuracy, and
                    showing the growth of crime and punishment of criminals since the reception of
                    the first convict in the State prison. Imperfect as our criminal statistics are,
                    they may afford valuable aid in legislating upon an important and troublesome
                    matter. The constitution provides "that the General Assembly may by law
                    constitute a council, to be composed of officers of State without whose advice
                    and consent the Governor shall not have power to grant pardons in any case
                    except such as may by law be left to his sole power," In order to
                    relieve the executive of a great responsibility, I recommend a law in accordance
                    with this proviso.</p>
                  <p>For your information as to the transactions of the government, during the year
                    ending October 31, 1878, I lay before you reports made to me by officers named
                    as follows:</p>

                    than the act of 1853, providing for annual reports from the subordinate officers
                    to the head of the executive service, and have made their report directly to
                    you. It was received at my office December 7, and, appearing not to be made to
                    it, was delivered to the Secretary of State, that upon his organization of the
                    House of Representatives he might deliver it to the Speaker.</p>

                  <head rend="center">MILITIA</head>
                  <p>The act approved May 11, 1861, for the organization and regulation of the
                    Indiana militia had so far become a forgotten relic of our civil war as to be
                    omitted entirely from the last revision of the statutes. The constitution
                    (article XII) provides who shall be subject to military service and that
                    "the General Assembly shall determine the method of dividing the
                    militia into divisions, brigades, regiments, battallions and companies and fix
                    the rank of all staff officers" and divide it into classes of sedentary
                    and active militia. These requirements are met by the act of 1861. It prescribes
                    the manner of organizing and mustering a company into the active militia
                    denominated "The Indiana Legion" and for the supply of arms
                    and equipments, councils of administration and courts martial; calls into active
                    service and resignations, dismissals and discharges. Until quite recently the
                    last-named have been the most popular features of the law. Of the system a
                    general officer, who observed its workings while protecting the southern border
                    of the state from invasion in 1862, wrote to his superior in command:
                    "Much may be done to increase the efficiency of The Legion by proper
                    amendments of the law. There must be some inducements to go into the companies,
                    either by way of exemption from other burdens, or by bounty, or by both.
                    Whatever the inducement may be, it must be a continuing one, so that it will
                    have the effect not only to impel men to join the companies, but to continue in
                    them and discharge the duties which result from membership. It can not be
                    expected that men will long give up their other employments and spend their
                    money to get up and maintain military organizations without some inducement. The
                    law should provide a short and efficient means of compelling attendance of
                    members at drill, etc. Its provisions on this subject are circuitous and
                    inefficient. The law provides for swearing and the members of the companies
                    after the election and it is said, in many instances, that those who have signed
                    the articles of association, not getting an office, have refused to take the
                    oath. It is suggested to me that the oath should be administered first and the
                    election held afterward. Other amendments might be suggested in regard to the
                    organization of companies. The proves ought to be greatly
                    simplified."</p>
                  <p>The present adjutant general has succeeded in securing the organization of
                    twenty-one companies, those forming the associations, having been led to assume
                    the burdens imposed by the law because of a generous rivalry between the lovers
                    of military tactics and display in our leading cities and towns. You will be
                    asked to add needed amendments to the existing statute, or to enact a new law
                    affording as much encouragement to military organizations as do the laws of
                    other states of equal rank.</p>
                  <p>Occasion for the use by civil authority of a well drilled and well disciplined
                    body of troops may arise at any time in our populous localities, or even in
                    remote districts where men congregate who have little knowledge of our laws and
                    no respect for the peace and dignity of our state.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th of July, 1877, I was officially informed by the sheriff of Marion
                    county that certain railway employes, because of a disagreement with their
                    employers, had ceased from service, and by their inactivity had occasioned an
                    interruption and delay of transportation across his county; that, with the
                    exception of the detention of railway trains, there had been now forcible
                    violation of the peace; and that no injury to person or property had been
                    committed. He advised the issuance by me of a proclamation ordering all unlawful
                    assemblages to disperse, cease their violence, and yield to the authority of
                    law, expressing the opinion such an order would command that respect which an
                    officer occupying his position could not secure. In conclusion, he said:
                    "Such a proclamation from you as I suggest might accomplish the desired
                    result; but in my judgement persuasion will not avail anything. I have no
                    organized force at my command of any description, but am utterly powerless in
                    the event of a serious disturbance, unless you will at once furnish me an
                    adequate force to maintain the law." I at once issued and caused to be
                    published my proclamation of that date. The organized companies in this county
                    were ordered into camp at the United States arsenal grounds, and the Adjutant
                    General, assisted by prominent citizens of Indianapolis constituting a
                    "committee of safety," rapidly organized, mustered, officered
                    and equipped other companies and caused them to encamp on the same grounds. I
                    requested General Ben Harrison to assume command of the forces so organized. He
                    replied, saying: "I am very much obliged for this expression of your
                    confidence, but the committee of safety has recommended General Dan Macauley for
                    the place, and I would therefore ask you to commission him." He,
                    however, took command of a company. General Macauley was commissioned, and
                    immediately took command and organized a staff, which was also commissioned and
                    entered upon duty with him. By advice of the committee of safety, and especially
                    of a member thereof, who is an experienced officer, and the commandant himself,
                    to avoid the possible danger of a delay in transmitting formal requisitions to
                    the ordnance department for ordnance stores due the State, I telegraphed the
                    President, saying: "In view of threatened domestic violence growing out
                    of the railroad strike, I request that authority be at once given to the
                    commandant of the arsenal to render all the aid possible in preserving the
                    public peace." Receiving at the same time and complying with
                    requisitions for troops much less formal from the Governors of other States, and
                    unaware <pb n="12" xml:id="VAA8558-17-014"/>of the fact that our militia was
                    encamped under the shadow of the arsenal buildings and had good reasons to draw
                    from their stores, the Secretary of War replied (July 27th, p. m.,)as follows:
                    "I am directed by the President to say that, in the absence of a call
                    upon him under the constitution and statute, for military aid in suppressing
                    domestic violence, the Federal troops at Indianapolis can only be used in
                    protecting property of the United States and enforcing process of federal
                    courts." It seems not to have occurred to the honorable secretary that
                    the arsenal was understood to be a depot of military stores, and not a garrison
                    of men. Late in the night of that day, a Lieutenant Colonel of the United States
                    army called upon me saying: "I have been ordered to this city with two
                    hundred men to assist the civil authorities in preserving the peace and
                    protecting property. I have the honor to report to you my arrival, and to ask if
                    you have any instructions for me." Having made no requisition for
                    troops, and having even been advised that my requisition for ordnance stores
                    would not be complied with, I could then only reply to that effect. On the 28th,
                    I was enabled to inform the sheriff of Marion county that an adequate force had
                    been organized in his county, and would be placed at his disposal upon his
                    making formal requisition to the Adjutant General. Disturbances of a similar
                    character arose in other localities, notably in Allen county. and like
                    preparations was made. These preparations in aid of local authorities and the
                    counsel of prudent citizens, made the use of the force unnecessary, and it was
                    disbandoned. The expenditures were so carefully managed that, while the outlay
                    of other States reached many thousands of dollars, our own were easily met by
                    the limited appropriation for "military contingent expenses."
                    Details will be communicated as required by law. I take occasion again to
                    express my obligations to the citizens again to express my obligations to the
                    citizens who promptly took up arms in support of the civil authorities and
                    especially to those wise counselors who were able by their coolness and reason,
                    to dissuade an extensive organization of determined men from rash purposes and
                    overcome the clamor of passionate men for vindictive measures. It is a source of
                    great satisfaction to our citizens that we passed through an ordeal involving to
                    other communities and threatening to us the most serious consequences, without
                    the loss of life, and with a small expenditure of the public funds. I am moved
                    to so particular a statement of these occurrences, now long past, first, because
                    prominent gentlemen on the floor of Congress and in carefully prepared addresses
                    to our people, have manifested a disposition to distort their simple truth; and
                    second, in order that you may provide in advance for such a possible emergency
                    hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Other disturbances growing out of our unsettled labor question occurred in the
                    mining region of Fountain county, with deplorable results. A want of due
                    carefulness in the local authorities resulted in the issuance and charge to that
                    county of arms, which were received from it upon approved bond by persons
                    unworthy of membership in a company of the militia. It became the duty of the
                    State authorities to review these proceedings and secure a return of the arms to
                    the State and a disbandment of the company. This delicate duty was
                    satisfactorily discharged by the Adjutant General, whose report will more fully
                    disclose its nature. At the request of the Judge of the Fountain Circuit Court,
                    troops were send to and maintained in the county for some weeks to protect the
                    lives and property of citizens, insure peace, and secure a prompt administration
                    of justice to offenders. The expenses of this call were met as before.</p>
                  <p>The Quartermaster General accounts for the military stores received, issued,
                    and now held by him. The State yet has a credit of $7,295.08 upon her account
                    with the General Government under the act for a distribution of arms to the
                    States.</p>
                  <p>By my order, an experienced officer was detailed by the Adjutant General to
                    inspect the arms belonging to the State. As this duty had not been performed for
                    many years, it will be of interest to learn the exact quantity and condition of
                    our munitions of war as disclosed by his report.</p>
                  <p>It is proper that I should say to you that companies have been called out and
                    kept in camp several days and many of the members who were laboring men thereby
                    lost their situations. Under section 33 of the law, they could receive only the
                    small pay allowed to soldiers of the United States army, and the fund at my
                    disposal would not admit of an additional allowance as bounty. I recommend an
                    appropriation to pay them a reasonable compensation for their services.</p>

                  <head rend="center">THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS</head>
                  <p>The constitution makes it the duty of the General Assembly to provide by law
                    for the support of institutions for the education of the deaf and dumb and of
                    the blind and also for the treatment of the insane. At the date of tis adoption,
                    an institution had been provided for each of these classes, all having been
                    founded about thirty years ago.</p>
                  <p>From an attendance in 1848 of 92 and an annual expenditure of $11,765.83, the
                    attendance of the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb has increased to 328 and the
                    expenditure to $62,994.99. Twelve hundred and seven pupils have received
                    instruction. The course of study has been enlarged and improved to correspond to
                    the progress in the common school education guaranteed to our children who have
                    the use of their faculties. A table showing the comparative attendance and
                    expenses of the institution since 1853 is given by the trustees in their report.
                    More than one hundred children having claim to an education can not be received
                    because of a lack of accommodations for them. You will be asked to provide for
                    the construction of an addition to the present building.</p>
                  <p>The average attendance of pupils in the Institute for the Education of the
                    Blond during the year was 108. Five hundred and ninety-eight pupils have
                    received instruction since the opening of the institute in 1847. The
                    expenditures for the fiscal year were in the sum of $31,404.96, being $259.20
                    per annum for each pupil. The estimate for the ensuing two years is made upon an
                    anticipated attendance of 120 pupils at $230.00 each per annum. Additional
                    accommodations are asked.</p>
                  <p>Since November 1, 1848, the Hospital for the Insane has received and treated
                    7,648 patients. During the past year 470 were admitted, and the same number
                    discharged, leaving 614 remaining at the close of the year as at the beginning.
                    The expenditure was in the sum of $132,129.67. To provide for the large number
                    of insane who need treatment, and several hundred who have been pronounced
                    incurable, and in need of the care and protection afforded by a State
                    institution planned and constructed for the purpose, a new building, to be
                    called the Department for Women, was authorized by an act approved March 11,
                    1875. Six hundred thousand dollars has been appropriated and nearly all of that
                    amount expended. You will be asked to inspect the work done, and provide means
                    for completing and furnishing the building for immediate use.</p>

                  <p>Since the transfer of the soldiers from the Soldiers' Home at Dayton,
                    the institution has been devoted to the orphans of deceased soldiers and seamen.
                    The building was destroyed by fire on the night of September 9, 1877. The
                    trustees used the money received upon policies of insurance for the construction
                    of a building much more suitable for the purpose than was the former, and
                    applied an un-expended balance of the year's appropriation towards the
                    payment of the additional expense, making $41,238.32 in all. You will be asked
                    to reimburse the officers and teachers and other inmates for their losses of
                    clothing and other effects by fire.</p>

                    should receive much less salaries than those who board and lodge themselves; and
                    the superintendent or officer who has a family boarding in the institution
                    should be required to pay board for any and all except himself and wife, unless

                  <head rend="center">EDUCATION</head>
                  <p>Our educational interests have been under the careful supervision of an officer
                    possessing the confidence of the people. His biennial report will give you in a
                    comprehensive form a history of the recent progress and present condition of our
                    common school system and also of the institutions of a higher grade which have
                    been the outgrowths of it. The reports of the Trustees of Indiana University,
                    Purdue University and the State Normal School will disclose the fact that the
                    higher education afforded by the State is given at an expense far beyond that of
                    other institutions sustained by private contributions, and in excess of a just
                    economy. The pupils who attend the Normal School do so to qualify themselves as
                    teachers, the better to make a living thereafter. I am unable to see any good
                    reason why they should not pay a reasonable tuition fee, thereby making the
                    support of the school much less burdensome to the tax-payers, many of whom
                    receive not direct benefit from it. The same rule could properly be applied to
                    the two universities.</p>
                  <p>The law authorizing each county to send two students free of charge to each of
                    the universities should be repealed, and all students should be required alike
                    to pay a reasonable tuition fee.</p>
                  <p>Our school fund is now reported in the sum of nine million dollars, which
                    perhaps equals that of any other State in the Union. It is constituted of the
                    State's indebtedness (nearly four millions), the common school fund
                    held by the counties (about two and one half millions.) and the congressional
                    township school fund (also about two and one-half millions), each part requiring
                    peculiar care in its management. I trust that it will be your pleasure as to
                    produce the larges results in the interest of the rising generation.</p>

                  <p>Your attention is called to the financial report of the officers of the State
                    Board of Agriculture. The Board owns thirty-six acres of land upon which their
                    improvements are situated, and two acres east of the grounds in all thirty-eight
                    acres, upon which there is a mortgage of sixty thousand dollars drawing eight
                    percent interest. Fifteen thousand three hundred dollars is due the guarantors
                    of the exposition fund. The State advanced twenty-five thousand dollars two
                    years ago. It is for you to consider whether the State should pay seventy-five
                    thousand dollars more and take the property or lose the amount so advanced.
                    Although the last was a very successful fair, the net earnings would not pay the
                    interest on the indebtedness. I trust you will give this subject a careful
                    consideration.</p>

                    hundred dollars appropriated for the encouragement of its work. You will be
                    interested in the proceedings of its annual meetings as reported by the
                    secretary and published by the State.</p>

                  <head rend="center">CRIME AND ITS PUNISHMENT</head>
                  <p>Crime has risen steadily and rapidly increased. Our old prison for male
                    convicts is greatly overcrowded and the new has had use for the additional
                    accommodations provided by the last Legislature.</p>
                  <p>The Female Prison has held ore than three times the number (17) transferred to
                    it, when it was opened in 1873. As required by the act of March 3, 1877, the
                    board of managers was reorganized as thereby constituted, Mrs. Emily A. Roache,
                    Mrs. Rhoda M. Coffin and Mrs. Eliza C. Hendricks receiving commissions for their
                    respective terms and assuming the duties imposed upon them by law. Assisted by
                    Mrs. Smith, the superintendent, and others, they have, as shown by their two
                    reports, trained the inmates of the institution to habits of industry, practiced
                    a rigid economy in every department and kept their expenditures within the
                    appropriations. Some indebtedness for the enclosure of the grounds should be
                    provided for. The managers have had much trouble and annoyance because of bad
                    sewerage. I recommend an appropriation of four thousand dollars to secure a
                    permanent and reliable system in its stead, that being the amount of the
                    estimate prepared.</p>
                  <p>The Prison North had at the beginning of the last year 646 and at its close 605
                    convicts, 295 having been received, 340 released, and the average being 619. The
                    disbursements were $75,295.73, being $868.06 in excess of the earnings. This
                    excess is explained by the additional accommodations provided for an expected
                    increase in the number committed to the prison. The new cell house and workshop
                    authorized by the last Legislature were completed and a main sewer also built,
                    leaving a balance of $19,666.03 of the $80,000 appropriated. This amount the
                    directors think could well be devoted to the construction of a new dwelling
                    house for the warden, some cells for disciplinary purposes. Additional shop room
                    is asked. It is urged that the district of the prison be enlarge by the addition
                    of one tier of counties next south of the line of demarcation and that the good
                    time of convicts be increased to twice that now allowed. In the education of the
                    convicts required by law the moral instructor finds great necessity for proper
                    text books and asks that they and books for general reading that will inculcate
                    correct sentiments be provided. The salary of the physician is regarded by the
                    officers as quite too small for the services expected, and they ask that is be
                    increased to the proper amount.</p>
                  <p>The Prison South had at the beginning of the last year 590 convicts, received
                    335, making 925 in all, and released 299, leaving 626 remaining at the close.
                    The daily average during the year was 626. Since its establishment in 1822, it
                    has received 6,526 convicts and released 5,900. More than two-thirds of those
                    remaining are unmarried men. Less than one-third are over thirty years of age.
                    Forty-four are sentenced for life. The expense of maintenance per man was
                    $29.03, which was the lowest in ten years, being less than one-half the
                    expenditure five <pb n="14" xml:id="VAA8558-17-016"/> years before. The total
                    cost for the year was $72,733 19, being $28,539.53 in excess of the earnings.
                    The report of the directors is a careful review of the condition of the prison
                    and the present needs of the inmates. But a little over one-half the convicts
                    have been leased, The State receives forty-five cents per man. It is supposed
                    that the employment of four-fifths of the convicts would make the institution
                    self-sustaining. The diverse but well-expressed views of the directors and
                    warden as to the best means of discipline will demand your careful study. A
                    better "good time" law is recommended by the directors.
                    Because of the great increase in his labors, they are of opinion that the
                    physician should receive a salary sufficient to justify him in giving his whole
                    attention to the prison sick. Better provision for the mental and moral
                    instruction of the prisoners is asked. It is especially urged that opportunity
                    be given for evening reading and study by the supply of a light in each cell.
                    The directors think the deprivation of light is an inhabitable hardship which
                    the General Assembly can not afford to longer disregard. Provision is asked for
                    the insane, numbering about fourteen. The prison has but one-half enough cells.
                    More than three hundred have had to be kept in the chapel and other rooms, at
                    greatly increased expense. A new cell house must be provided, or the surplus
                    convicts transfered to the Prison North. It will be for you to determine what
                    course will best provide for this great increase of convicts, and impose the
                    least burden upon good citizens who must meet thy expense of their safekeeping
                    within prison walls.</p>
                  <p>It is enjoined on the constitution "that the General Assembly shall
                    provide houses of refuge for the Correction and reformation of juvenile
                    offenders." An institution for boys was established at Plainfield in
                    1867, and has been in operation eleven years. One thousand one hundred and
                    twenty-eight boys have been admitted during that time. All can not be classed as
                    offenders. Many have been committed for a reform of their character that they
                    may be from violating the laws. At the close of the last year 145 had been
                    admitted and 383 remained, that being the greatest number in the institution at
                    any one time. The Board of Commissioners have reduced the expenditures greatly
                    below the amount appropriated, leaving the surplus in the treasury. Their
                    estimates for subsequent years appear in a reduced form. They have added to the
                    accommodations and reformatory influences of the institution and report it in
                    good condition.</p>
                  <p>Like provision for controlling the criminal inclinations of girls has been made
                    in the reformatory department, connected with the Female Prison. Two hundred and
                    ninety-six have been received since 1873.</p>

                    and purchases, received the usual additions to its shelves. The librarian and
                    his lady assistant have filled with credit their respective positions, as their
                    careful preparations for your meeting will convince you. Hon. Horace P. Biddle,
                    of our Supreme Court, who has devoted his life to general literature, as well as
                    to that of his profession, has expressed to me a "desire to dispose
                    of" his "library to the State of Indiana, to be kept as a part
                    of the State library, it contains about six thousand volumes, collected at a
                    cost of over $10,000, and is the gradual accumulation of fifty years."
                    He proposes "to sell the entire library to the state for a nominal
                    sum," retaining its possession and use during his life and providing
                    for its delivery "by contract upon a consideration reaching each volume
                    rather than by donation, that" he "may know the books will
                    ultimately reach their destination." Recognizing the necessity for
                    legislative action authorizing the Librarian to make such a contract, he holds
                    himself in readiness at any convenient time to adjust the details.</p>

                  <head rend="center">NEW STATE HOUSE.</head>
                  <p>The last General Assembly, by an act approved March 14,1877, authorized and
                    provided for the erection of a new State House, and for matters incident,
                    thereto. I appointed General Thomas A. Morris and General John Love of Marion
                    county, W. R. McKeene, Esq. of Vigo county, and Hon. I. D. G. Nelson, of Allen
                    county, as prominent representatives of "the two leading political
                    parties of the State," who should, together with myself,
                    "constitute the Board of State House Commissioners." They at
                    once qualified and each gave the required bond and entered upon the discharge of
                    his duties. Mr. McKeene, on account of private business found it necessary, in
                    January last, to tender his resignation, which was reluctantly accepted. I
                    immediately appointed Hon. John Collett, of Vermillion County, as his successor.
                    He accepted the office, qualified and gave bond, and still serves as a member of
                    the board, which is otherwise unchanged. The commissioners have pushed forward
                    the work as fast as the means at their command would warrant. In addition to the
                    quarterly reports made as required "for the use of the public"
                    and containing "a synopsis of their proceedings and an account of their
                    expenditures" I requested that they make their report, for the last
                    quarter so comprehensive as to include the documents and proceedings which are,
                    in their opinion, important for your information. Such a detailed statement has
                    been prepared and is here with submitted for your careful examination. The tax
                    levy was for the year 1877, one cent, and for 1878, two cents on the one hundred
                    dollars. At the close of the year ending October 31, 1878, the proceeds of the
                    tax had reached $42,023.56, most of which has been expended upon orders of the
                    board. The proceeds of the current levy will perhaps not greatly exceeding
                    $150,000, which is not as much as ought to be and could be profitably expended
                    during the year.</p>
                  <p>The constitution provides that "no law shall authorize any debt to be
                    contracted on behalf of the State debt; to repel invasion, suppress
                    insurrection, or if hostilities be threatened, provide for the public
                    defense." Our heaviest interest charge, exceeding one-fourth of a
                    million dollars per annum, is upon an indebtedness to the common school fund
                    caused by the use of money for general expenses. In the absence of any provision
                    for its payment, we may assume it to be the settled policy of the State to make
                    the loan perpetual. If so, you can safely provide for a special annual levy of
                    say five cents on the one hundred dollars to pay the interest upon our
                    indebtedness and to gradually discharge the other claims growing out of a
                    negligent administration of the school revenues in former years. The temporary
                    loan largely represents the old indebtedness incurred by our system of internal
                    improvements before the adoption of our present constitution, and reasonably
                    included with our 'State debt" referred to therein. Having
                    made special provision for these extraordinary demands, by authorized loans and
                    separate taxation, the revenues of the general fund at a greatly reduced rate,
                    say seven cents, <pb n="15" xml:id="VAA8558-17-017"/> will be found adequate to
                    meet the ordinary expenses of an economical administration of the State
                    government, and increase the means for the rapid prosecution of this work. The
                    appropration of a sum sufficient for the immediate completion and furnishing of
                    the structure, while the times are so favorable to cheapness would, perhaps,
                    create such "a casual deficit" as would justify a loan. In my
                    opinion, the advantages resulting from a speedy completion of the enterprise
                    which we have begun would greatly overbalance the interest to be paid until our
                    tax-payers shall have gained relief from their present heavy burden of local
                    taxes.</p>
                  <p>I recommend that you do, at least continue the present levy "of two
                    cents upon each on hundred dollars worth of taxable property in the
                    State" for the "New State House Fund," in addition to
                    any appropriations you may see cause to make from the "General
                    Fund."</p>

                    city, November 1, 1877, worn out by a life of unusual activity in the public
                    service. Thousands of our fellow citizens and many visitors from other states
                    followed each other in solemn procession through the corridor of the building in
                    which you are now met, viewing for the last time his familiar face as he lay in
                    state, and afterwards accompanying his mortal remains to their resting place in
                    Crown Hill Cemetery, near where he made his last public address to the people.
                    Having filled a prominent place in the affairs of our state and country, his
                    public life is familiar to the present generation and his acts have become a
                    part of our history for the study of these who will come after us. </p>
                  <p>I appointed Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees to fill the office made vacant by his
                    death. It will be your duty to elect a successor.</p>

                  <head rend="center">REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS AND IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.</head>
                  <p>My views upon the question, of a reapportionment of the state for congressional
                    and legislative purposes have been frequently expressed and were communicated at
                    length to the last General Assembly. The districts for the election of members
                    of congress are manifestly irregular in form and their population is out of due
                    proportion to each other. The requirement that a senatorial or representative
                    district, where constituted of more than one county, shall be composed of
                    contiguous counties was literally fulfilled but, its spirit was grievously
                    violated in essential features. Some of you have been elected by a voting
                    population much less than the average while other have a constituency greatly in
                    excess. I recommend the enactment of a just law in each case and such I will
                    gladly approve. The auditor of state reports the enumeration necessary for your
                    information in making the Apportionments.</p>

                  <head rend="center">OUR COUNTY SYSTEM.</head>
                  <p>While many of the older States were established upon "the town
                    system," our own has grown up on the basis of "the county
                    system," more suitable to the habits of our western people. The
                    enabling act of April 19, 1816, recognized the thirteen existing counties, and
                    they were represented in the convention forming our constitution. Ninety-two
                    such subdivisions of our territory now exist, each for itself administering;
                    important local affairs at great expense to the people. Our board of county
                    commissioners is in legal contemplation the county, and as such is declared to
                    be a body corporate and politic, and entrusted with large powers of a local
                    administrative character. Prohibited from passing local or special laws
                    regulating county and township business, the election of county and township
                    officers and their compensation, the General Assembly has for many years tried
                    in vain to reduce the county business to a simple, economical and uniform
                    system. I wish you better success. Recently a commission of experienced
                    gentlemen appointed by Marion county has given the subject careful study and
                    reduced the results to a form suitable for your consideration.</p>
                  <p>Our laws fixing the compensation of officers were enacted when times were
                    flush, when the necessaries of the were high and when labor received better
                    compensation and was in greater demand than now. Therefore, I recommend a
                    reduction of all fees and salaries in accordance with the times.</p>
                  <p>Our cities and towns should be reduced to a proper subordination to the
                    counties of which they severally constitute parts. They are now almost
                    independent of State supervision, and involve their citizens in needless
                    expenses. The assessment and collection of their revenues alone, by one set of
                    officers in a county would result in a great saving, and is recommended.</p>

                <div>
                  <head rend="center">EXPERT EVIDENCE.</head>
                  <p>The statutes say that witnesses subpoenaed to testify in the county where they
                    reside, shall not be entitled to demand and receive their fees m advance. I see
                    that some gentlemen who had been subpoenaed to testify as expert witnesses in an
                    important criminal trial in progress in this county recently, refused to testify
                    unless fee were paid in advance. I can not see any good reason why one class of
                    citizens shall be compelled to attend and testify under a penalty of fine and
                    imprisonment, and another class embarrass the proceedings of a court because the
                    party wanting their evidence is unable to pay them fees in advance. I recommend
                    that you remedy this growing evil; for, if you have the right to pay or excuse
                    one class, you have the right to pay or excuse all others in the same
                    manner.</p>

                  <p>needs your careful consideration and wise legislation. Too much of the time or
                    our Circuit Court is occupied with suits brought for small sums, especially by
                    administrators, the costs of which equal the amount recovered. I recommend that
                    you remedy this evil, and suggest the propriety of enlarging the jurisdiction of
                    Justices of the peace so as to relieve the Circuit Courts of a great, deal of
                    business of a frivolous nature involving no unsettled questions of law or
                    practice. At the same time, you could perhaps relieve the Supreme Court in a
                    great measure by a further limitation of its jurisdiction, and making judgments
                    of certain cases final, without appeal therefrom. A speedy and economical
                    administration of justice is demanded by the times.</p>

                    laws and thereby putting them in force, and in printing and distributing the
                    journals. I respectfully suggest that you provide for the printing of the
                    journals at the close of each day's proceedings that they may be
                    carefully inspected and corrected the next morning by the members, thus securing
                    accuracy promptness and a great saving in the work and expense, and keeping
                    yourselves and the people advised of the progress of your business. The acts
                    should be printed in the order of their enactment, and the financial statements
                    being ready and appended, they could be given to the people at an early day

                  <p>The reports of the treasury department are full and complete. The last
                    Legislature reduced the state tax from thirteen to twelve cents on the one
                    hundred dollars. The proceeds of that levy with delinquent taxes, docket fees
                    and taxes otherwise collected and amounts reimbursed by counties and received to
                    defray the expenses of the several departments and institutions in whose favor
                    appropriations were made. I trust the same amount will be sufficient to pay the
                    expenses for the next two years. It is not the State taxes but the county and
                    township taxes and fees of officers that oppress the people. They are double and
                    in many instances three times that of the state.</p>

              opinion that the whole subject of free trade is involved in this measure. He doubted
              if any senator was prepared to say whether Peruvian hark, which is the basis of
              quinine, is imported free. If it is, and the importation of quinine is made free, the
              manufacture of quinine in this country is rendered almost impossible. He thought the
              resolution should be ferred to the committee indicated in the pending motion.</p>
            <p>Mr. REEVE trusted senators would recognize the fact that this measure is for the
              benefit of the whole country--a measure to relieve the suffering of this country from
              an overwhelming burden which is of no earthly use, except to enrich one single
              individual or firm who possess the secret for the crystalization of Peruvian bark.
              Quinine enters more largely into the absolute necessities for the relief of the
              sufferings of the people than any other article manufactured, except alcohol.</p>
            <p>The motion to refer was rejected, and the question recurring on the adoption of the
              joint resolution--</p>
            <p>Mr. RAGAN made the point of order that joint resolutions should be read by sections
              on three several days in each house as in the case of bills.</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR was not very clear that the point of order is well taken. He
              thought it best to rule that way on the passage of the joint resolutions proposing
              amendments to the constitution, but never knew and never saw a man who did know
              whether the constitution requires joint resolutions to be read three times or not.</p>
            <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
            <p>The joint resolution was then passed the Senate by--yeas 41, nays 4.</p>
            <p>Mr. RAGAN offered a resolution declaring that the Senate will vote no extra
              compensation to any person or persons for any service, except upon a majority vote of
              yeas and nays.</p>

            <p>Mr. TRUSLER moved to strike out all after the word "service."</p>
            <p>Mr. FOWLER offered a substitute requiring such allowances to be made by bill or
              concurrent resolution.</p>
            <p>On motion the whole subject was laid on the table.</p>
            <p>Mr. STREIGHT offered a concurrent resolution instructing our senators and requesting
              our representatives in Congress to favor the bill now pending in the Federal
              Legislature relating to inter-State commerce.</p>
            <p>On his motion it was made a special order for Friday at 2 o'clock p. m.</p>

            <p>Mr. VIEHE, from the special committee to procure rooms for the use of the committees
              of the Senate, reported a contract with the proprietor of the Grand Hotel for rooms
              numbered 3, 22; 26, 93 and l0l--the five rooms for $200. The report was accepted, and
              the committee discharged.</p>
            <p>Mr. DAVENPORT, from the special committee thereon, submitted the following:</p>

              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Resolved, That the Senate contemplates the death of Hon. Charles Beardsley,
                    late senator from the county of Elkhart, with profound sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Resolved, That in his death the State has lost a worthy citizen and a faithful
                    and able senator, whose public and private virtues have endeared his memory to
                    all.</p>

                  <p>Resolved, That the senators, whoso pleasure it was to serve with him in this
                    body during the last session, cherish the memory of their late brother as one
                    who guided only by his love of justice and right, won the esteem and confidence
                    of every one.</p>

                  <p>Resolved, That as a testimony of our respect to the memory of our brother, the
                    Senate do now adjourn.</p>

                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Eulogies on the character of the late senator [Mr. BBARDSLEY] were pronounced by
              Messrs. TREAT, HARRIS, HEFRON and REEVE.</p>
            <p>Mr TREAT said: Mr. President--I was intimately acquainted with Senator Beardsley, It
              was my good fortune to secure his companionship during the session of 1877. He was a
              quiet and unobtrusive man: but a man of great firmness and moral courage. As a friend;
              he was kind and courteous; as a senator, he was conscientious, clear-headed, fearless
              and faithful. While he seldom addressed the chair, yet he was always at his desk, and
              took an intelligent survey of all business before the Senate. He was a member, during
              the session of 1877, of the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, <pb n="27" xml:id="VAA8558-17-029"/> and, I think, never failed to respond to a call for
              committee work. The records will show that he was always ready to lead off with a firm
              and Independent vote. And when it is remembered that, after the absence of Senator
              Bearss, of Miami, on account of protracted indisposition, Senator Beardsley's
              name was first on the roll call of the Republican side of the Senate, it will be seen
              that this was a delicate responsibility for a man of limited legislative experience.
              He frequently attended the Swedenborgian Church in this city, being a great admirer of
              its teachings. His life was pure and unsullied. His habits were a model worthy of
              imitation. As an intimate, friend of Senator Beardsley, and an admirer of his many
              excellent qualities of head and heart, I desire to join in the resolutions of respect
              to the memory of our departed fellow laborer.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.</p>
            <p>In accordance with the terms of the last resolution--</p>
            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p> After prayer by Rev. W. A. BARTLETT, of the Presbyterian Church, the minutes were being
          read when, on motion by Mr. HARRIS, their further reading was dispensed with.</p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order, being the nine proposed amendments
          to the State Constitution, as adopted by the last general assembly. The joint resolution
          embracing proposition No. 1 prescribing qualification of voters, being read--</p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL thought this joint resolution should not prevail. It adds another wheel to
          the machinery of government. There is a difference of opinion among lawyers as to Whether
          this would be a complete law, or Whether it would require additional legislation. If those
          amendments are submitted to the people for acceptance or rejection It will cost about
          $50,000. The simpler we can get a system of government that will protect the people in the
          enjoyment of life, liberty and property, the better. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD read from manuscript a reply to an objection that this proposed amendment would
          be without force or effect unless the General Assembly enacts a registry law. He thought a
          good registry law should be enacted, and should vote for this amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS said the action of the Legislature two years ago was taken without any
          reference to political complexion, and he hoped the matter of politics will not be taken
          Into consideration now. It is a matter very much to be desired that when an election Is
          held every citizen of the State shall be satisfied that the result shall be a fair, full
          and honest expression of the will of the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER thought if we needed anything under our system, it was a good, fair election
          law, and for that reason he favored this proposed amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON having given this subject some thought and consideration, felt compelled to
          cast his vote against this amendment. Our present election law is good enough and strong
          enough and fair enough, if properly en forced. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS answered objections raised against this amendment--giving it as his opinion
          that without the third proposed amendment, if ratified by the people, this one would not
          make it an imperative duty of the General Assembly to pass a registry law. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN could not favor this proposed amendment to the constitution. Some of its
          features are objectionable, especially the provision requiring a residence of 60 days in a
          town ship before a man is entitled to vote which would work a hardship to every man who is
          compelled to change his residence frequently in order to obtain employment. </p>
        <p>Mr. REILEY two years ago voted against this amendment, and stood opposed to it still,
          simply from the fact that it requires every voter to reside in his voting precinct 60 days
          prior to the election, which provision would disfranchise hundreds and thousands of
          laboring men who are tenants. Had this amendment read 20 or 30 days, it would have
          received his support. </p>
        <p>Mr. COFFEY opposed this proposed constitutional amendment, for the reason that many
          voters in this State are poor men who have no permanent abiding place, but are traveling
          from township to township and from county to county, and if this proposed amendment should
          become part of the organic law of the State it would result in the disfranchisement of
          numbers of this class of our voters. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER supposing there is not a senator upon this floor but what has made up his
          mind as to how he will vote, demanded the previous question. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE hoped no senator would vote to second the demand for the previous question on
          the adoption of a fundamental law. It is a thing unheard of.</p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER would withdraw his demand if there are any who think they can convince us of
          our errors.</p>
        <p> Mr. STREIGHT: This proposed constitutional provision seems so perfectly fair and o
          necessary, in the face of the history of our State elections, it would seem there could
          hardly be any opposition raised to it. It is an <pb n="30" xml:id="VAA8558-17-032"/>
          unfortunate thing in a republican form of Government for the people to become distrustful
          about the honesty of elections. Let us not magnify the difficulties that might arise under
          the operations of this amendment. He hoped it would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: This is a deliberative body. It is not a caucus nor a political convention. It
          exercises the highest powers and occupies the most responsible position that it is
          possible to confer upon man. It is one of the results of a great, experiment that was
          began upon this continent over a century ago, under circumstances that astonished the
          civilized world. We sit here to day as a great inquest upon the very fundamental elements,
          which, carried into practice, give us government. We have no government in this country,
          except the law. We have no law, except that made under prescribed forms. The first
          prescribed form is the constitution. That constitution is the result of the deliberative
          judgment of the representatives of the people assembled in convention. </p>
        <p>The right of suffrage in this country is too cheap--the rights of citizenship are not
          valued at their worth--dignity is taken from them, and it has become a mere
          gambler's trick to take into the dirty pool room of politics as a matter of
          speculation for power. American citizens dare not deny it, and they are too cowardly to
          meet and counteract its evil influences. [Applause.] It is not a question of
          Republicanism; it is not a question of Democracy; it is not a question of Nationalism, but
          it is a question of the maintenance of the right to civil liberty in this country. Mr. R.
          spoke at length in favor of the passage of the amendment under consideration as adopted,
          by the last General Assembly, expressing the opinion that the clause referring to a
          registry law was not mandatory, but simply left it discretionary with the General Assembly
          whether a registry law should be enacted or not. </p>

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The joint resolution No. 2, proposing an amendment to the State constitution, as
            adopted by the last General Assembly, to strike from section 5, article 41, the words
            "no negro or mulatto shall have the right of suffrage," being read the
            third time it was passed the Senate by--yeas 43, nays 0. </p>
          <p>The joint resolution proposing amendment No. 3 to the constitution, providing that
            general elections shall be held in November, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
            and that judges may have a separate election day under a registration law, being read
            the third time--</p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL objected to this amendment because, instead of having our Judges go into
            office, as is now the case, without any expense or any obligation to the party which
            elects them, it would bring about such a state of tilings as would make it necessary
            that the candidates for the bench should defray all the expenses of the election held
            specially to make I a selection of judges. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES would vote for this proposed amendment but for the proviso referring to
            registration of voters. Experience has shown that registry laws do not prevent frauds in
            elections. Under our present law elections substantially reflect the will of a majority
            of the people. Every man is guided and impelled by 99 honest impulses where he is moved
            by one dishonest one. If this proposition left it discretionery with the Legislature to
            enact a registry law or not, it would be a different matter, but this thing of
            compelling the people to live under a registry law is the same as saying the people can
            not be trusted without a registry law. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON understood the latter clause of this provision to mean that if the
            Legislature does appoint a different time for the election of judges, then it shall
            provide a registry law suitable for that time. The people are I suffering from
            inexperienced and incompetent politicians on the bench of this State, and certainly the
            election of judges should be disassociated from politics as much as possible. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE declared one of the strongest arguments that could be made in favor of a
            registry law is found in the objection that it will interfere with a class of men who
            now vote, but who, under a registry law, would be so utterly indifferent to the rights
            of citizenship and the great power and dignity and force of the elective franchise, that
            they are not willing to walk into a register's office and record their names as
            among those possessing that right. There may a time come when a man would give half his
            fortune for such a privilege. There may be a time and there has been a time when all the
            bones cemented by all the blood in this land could not buy it. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON said as a general rule judges are not known in an election campaign now when
            other candidates are targets for vituperation and abuse, but if you make the Judge alone
            a standard bearer in the fight you drive him into politics. Nobody will carry his tight
            forward for him, and he will be compelled to it. Mr. H. also opposed the registration
            clause. The greatest objection is the expensive machinery attaching to it. It would
            probably cost the people of Indiana $100,000, and they would not be benefitted one cant
            by the outlay. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS considered the rejection by the Senate of this proposition would be in effect
            saying the voters of Indiana are incapable of passing upon this question. It does not
            follow if it is ratified by the people that there shall be a registry law passed. It yet
            remains for the Legislature to decide whether there shall be a registry law or not to
            govern the election of judges. There is nothing in it imperatively demanding either a
            separate election for judges or a general registration of voters. </p>
          <p>Mr. HART did not believe it right to require men who work at daily labor and have to
            move from place to place to live in a township 60 days before acquiring the right to
            vote, and for that reason voted against the first amendment, but should vote for this
            one, believing it very desirable that our general elections should be held in November. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The third proposed amendment to the constitution, as adopted by the last General As <pb n="31" xml:id="VAA8558-17-033"/>[As]sembly, was finally passed by the Senate, as
            printed on pages 160 and 161 of the acts of the regular session of 1877--yeas 34, nays,
            14.</p>

          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The proposed amendment to the constitution striking the word 'white'
            from secs. 4 and 5 of art. IV was read the third time, and passed the Senate by--yeas
            47, nays, 1. </p>

          <p>The proposed amendment No. 5, making it possible for the General Assembly to grade the
            fees and salaries of county and other officers, was read the third time. </p>


          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN: Under our present system we can not pass a fee and salary bill giving
            satisfaction to the people and doing justice to the officers. That has been tried time
            and again. We had a fee and salary bill in 1871, which was repealed in 73 and a new one
            passed. Then that was repealed in 1875 and a new one passed; and amendments and changes
            were made to this one in 1877. So long as you takes small counties for standard counties
            and give their officers a comfortable salary, you make the county officers in large
            counties to get rich; and if you take such counties as standard counties, the officers
            in small counties 'will' starve. If you look into the statute books, before the adoption
            of our present constitution you will find that almost each township had a special law
            for fees and salaries. He favored the passage of the pending proposition, so as to
            enable the Legislature to pass laws classifying the counties into several groups, and
            making fees and salaries equitable. </p>







          <p>Mr. BURRELL considered it better to leave the law as it is. It is nothing more than
            right that a man should be paid according to the labor to be performed and the
            responsibility resting upon him. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT was also decidedly opposed to the adoption of the pending amendment, because
            if it should become a part of the organic law, there may be passed a local act for every
            county in the State. It is true it provides for dividing the counties into groups, but
            the Legislature is to determine how many groups there shall be, and it may decide to
            have 92 groups. It would open the door to frauds. He opposed local legislation, and
            thought the adoption of this amendment would be pernicious. </p>



          <p>Mr. STREIGHT referred to the fact that a number of offices in his [Marion] county were
            worth fifteen,twenty, twenty-five and even $30,000; and numbers of men in trying to
            obtain some one or more of these offices had sunk fortunes. It is customary when a man
            is nominated for one of these offices to expect an assessment of a sum of money that
            would astonish gentlemen were they to know the amount. If you want a fair, and honest
            expression of the people at the poles you must remove this great corrupting motive.</p>
          <p>Mr. Fowler. If there is any question the people all over the State feel an interest in,
            it is this very question. This amendment will afford relief, Let us pass it, then grade
            the counties, and give each office a reasonable compensation. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER also favored this amendment. It will make it possible for the General
            Assembly to grade the counties as to make a just and equitable compensation to all
            officers--just to the officers and just to the people. </p>

        </dateline>
        <p>After prayer by Rev. Dr. BARTLETT, the secretary's minutes of
          yesterday's proceedings were read and approved.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS presented a protest, which, at his suggestion, was ordered placed upon the
          journal without reading. [It is a protest signed by Republican senators against the
          rulings of the lieutenant governor on the organization of the Senate.]</p>
        <p> The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> returned bills [S. 44--Mr.
          Comstock's] to abolish the Superior Court of Wayne County; also, [S. 50--Mr.
          Viehe's] amending section 80 of the justice's act, with favorable
          reports, which were placed on the calendar, to be considered when the bills shall come up
          for the second reading. </p>
        <p>The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> also returned the bill [S. 29--Mr Shirk
          's] authorizing school moneys to be loaned at six per cent, with a recommendation
          that it be indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE moved to concur in the report of the committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK, from the number of bills introduced here to reduce the legal rate of interest,
          was convinced that a reduction will be made at this session of the General Assembly,
          whether to six or eight per cent. is yet a question ; but it is evident there will be a
          reduction. It has been the policy of the Legislature to place the rate of interest on
          moneys belonging to the School fund a little below the legal rate of interest, because it
          is absolutely necessary to the welfare of the common school system that all moneys
          belonging to the school fund should be kept, out at interest continually. Our county
          auditors can not succeed in keeping the school fund out at interest as it ought to be
          unless they can loan it at a less rate of Interest than the legal rate. For these reasons
          he had introduced the bill, and hoped the bill would not be indefinitely postponed, but
          passed through the several readings and become a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE could not remember the time when the rate of interest on the school fund was
          less than seven per cent, A loan from the school fund amounts to a perpetual loan as long
          as the borrower pays interest promptly, and where else can a man go and obtain a perpetual
          loan at six per cent.? At eight per cent. there are far more applicants than can be
          accommodated The legal rate of interest in this State is 6 per cent., and the General
          Assembly, in its wisdom and generosity, has given every man the privilege to exercise his
          own discretion as to his own wants and necessities in emergencies, and in the exercise of
          that discretion, if he thinks his interests, necessities or wants are such that by making
          a special contract in writing to pay a rate of interest not exceeding 10 per cent., he
          shall have that privilege; and any one who would deprive a business man or a poor man of
          the exercise of that discretion, carrying out the same principle, would deprive him of the
          discretion as to whether he shall own two horses or one, or two pups or one, or wear boots
          or shoes, or go barefoot. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p> Mr. DICE: While the legal rate of interest is 6 per cent., and while the State has funds
          to loan to her people, it is inconsistent for her to charge 8 per cent., and it is wrong.
          This bill ought to pass in justice to the people. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. LANGDON the motion to concur in the committee report was laid on the
          table.</p>
        <p> The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> also returned bills [S. 30--Mr.
          Weir's] authorizing guardians to settle the estate of deceased wards; also [S.
          52--Mr. Coffey's] to abolish struck juries; also [S. 73--Mr. Moore's] to
          declare that aliens may inherit property the same as natives; also [S. 76--Mr.
          Foster's] to increase the number of juror challengers, with recommendations for
          indefinite postponement. On motion by Mr. REEVE the last report on bill S. 76 was
          concurred in. The other reports were placed on the calendar to be considered when the
          bills shall severally come up for the second reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing the clerks of the Senate
          committees not to employ a janitor. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing the <orgName>Judiciary
            Commit-[tee] <pb n="35" xml:id="VAA8558-17-037"/> [Committee]-tee</orgName> to inquire
          and report whether there is any law fixing the pay of officers and employes of the Senate.
          Mr. W. said the title of the statute referring to such compesation does not express the
          subject embraced in the act. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN it was adored that 1,000 copies of the governor's
          message, together with the accompanying communications on sanitary purposes, be printed in
          English and 500 copies in German, for the use of the Senate. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. DAVENPORT, by request, offered a joint resolution [S. 3] instructing our senators and
          requesting our representatives in Congress to favor the passage of the arrears of pensions
          bill and the bill for the equalization of bounties to soldiers in the late war, which was
          adopted-- by yeas 47, nays 0. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM offered a joint resolution [S. 4] for instruction and request to Indiana
          senators and representatives in Congress to use their influence to procure a modification
          of the patent laws. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM introduces this resolution to prevent the people from being imposed upon
          by many men who claim and obtain patents where no real principle is involved and levy
          blackmail upon the people. The driven well principle has been known for centuries, and yet
          men get a patent on it and proceed to levy blackmail by claiming from five to ten dollars
          from persons not capable or willing to defend a patent law suit. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS: The injury arises where a patent right owner permits some one to manufacture
          and sell an infringement and then the law allows him to recover damages from the farmer or
          other persons using such a machine, not knowing it to bean infringement. The law should be
          that if the patentee allows an infringement to go upon the market innocent purchasers
          should not suffer. </p>
        <p>The joint resolution, together with a substitute offered by Mr. REEVE, was referred to a
          select committee of three, which the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made to consist of Messrs,
          Winterbotham, Smith and Grubbs. </p>

            requesting our representatives in congress to favor the passage of the bill now pending
            in that body to regulate traffic on railroads. </p>
          <p>MR. STREIGHT had no interest in mis matter other than the interest of our common fellow
            citizens. When each of the transportation lines stood free and untrammeled, propared,
            each and every one, to bid on carrying freight independent of each other, then there
            could be little complaint, but, sir, they have thought it wise to pool their business so
            as to form one grand combination, and to-day a combination exists so powerful and
            overbearing, that if there was but one single transportation line from here to the sea
            shore it would be far better for the people. The people have created and encouraged
            these lines; some of them have received grants in lands and bonds to twice the cost of
            their construction; some of them have received territories of laud greater in extent
            than the whole State of Indiana, and now we find these corporations joining with each
            other in one grand combination, which will enable them to arbitrarily fix the price for
            transportation of every bushel of wheat, every bushel of corn, and every beef, as well
            as every article we produce for export, at every railroad station throughout the length
            and breadth of the land. Now that this state of things exists it is time for the people
            to speak out through their representatives and say to these railroad monopolists,
            "Thus far shalt then go, and no farther." A bill looking to the
            correction of this evil has passed the lower House of Congress, and is now before the
            senate. It may be said that our congressmen understand their business best, but it must
            be remembered that the people have no active paid lobby to work up their interests in
            Congress, and that can not be said of the railroad interests. Millions of dollars have
            been spent every year in the lobbies and about the halls of Congress, and millions will
            be spent this year, and for that reason there should be an expression from the Indiana
            Legislature on that subject. Hundreds of millions of dollars are practically managed
            to-day by a little board of five men who can get together and make figures that will
            break the fortunes of men here in the West It is the duty of the State to protect its
            citizens from extortion. The National Government has made it possible for this great
            combination to be formed, and as this is a subject which interests deeply every branch
            of industry throughout the length and breadth of our land it is a wise thing to stop it,
            as the bill now pending in Congress proposes to do, and commence protecting the people
            who have suffered so largely from this state of things. It may be said that the best way
            is to permit competition, but the very men who control these pools have made <pb n="36" xml:id="VAA8558-17-038"/> competition impossible. They are not willing to let
            competition come in.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. REEVE the pending resolution was referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, from the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>, returned the bill, [H.
            R. 1] appropriating $125,000 for expenses of this session of the General Assembly, with
            a recommendation that it do pass. On his motion the constitutional restriction was
            dispensed with, and the bill ordered pressed to its final passage. When it had been read
            the second time by title--</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT offered the following amendment:</p>
          <p>Provided, that no money be appropriated to pay mileage to members who have received and
            used railroad passes going to and returning from the capital. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT--If there has been no expense to members in traveling to the State
            capitol, the State ought not pay them mileage. It is taken for granted that no member is
            willing to draw more pay for his services here than every other member. This whole
            principle is wrong. Look back in the history of State Legislation and show where
            railroads have ever asked for anything they have not obtained; and it is equally true
            that nearly every measure the people have asked for to protect themselves from
            oppression by the railroads have been denied.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE stood with the senator heart and soul, but saw no way to enforce the
            amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES paid his way on the railroads. There had been a pass over the Vincennes
            Road put on his desk, but inside of sixty minutes thereafter he had mailed it back to
            the president of that company. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. REEVE demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
            its operation the amendment was rejected by--yeas 11, nays 33. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT explaining: He did not believe any measure we could pass would prevent the
            payment of mileage to members, according to the statute. He had no passes.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE did not believe this amendment ought to pass; it was a kind of insinuation
            against members, and might bring about a kind of inquisition to find out who had passes.
            He had paid his way here, and should probably do the same thing when he goes home. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, in explanation, had no pass, and should hot have during the session; and
            was opposed, to members using passes, but, believing this amendment should not be put in
            a bill coming from the House, would vote "no." </p>
          <p>So the amendment was rejected. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill was then read the third time and finally passed, by--yeas 45, nays 2. </p>

        <p> The House met at 9 o'clock a. m., the speaker in the chair.</p>
        <p>The order of prayer was conducted by Rev. Mr. LYNCH, presiding elder of the Methodist
          Episcopal Church for this district. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER announced the first thing in the order of business to be the call for reports
          from committees. He commenced calling the list of committees, but no reports being
          submitted, he called for reports from select committees, whereupon--</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN of Elkhart, from the select committee appointed yesterday to secure better
          ventilation in the hall, reported an interview with the superintendent of the building and
          the obtaining from that officer a promise that a man experienced with the workings of the

        <p>So the resolution was adopted, and hereafter the House of Representatives will meet for

            use of each member during the session. </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER ruled the resolution out of order because the House of Representatives
            heretofore refused to adopt a similar resolution. </p>
          <p>By Mr. OWEN, [H. R. 225] to amend section lot the act to prevent the spread of Canada
            thistles. Railroad authorities shall cause their section hands to destroy and prevent
            the spread of Canada thistles along the track and on all railroad lands. </p>

          <p>By Mr. TULLEY, a resolution, which was adopted, directing the chairman of the several
            house committees, whenever they shall consider bills originating in the House of
            Representatives, to notify the authors thereof, <pb n="41" xml:id="VAA8558-17-043"/>so

          <p>By Mr. DAILEY, [H. R. 228] authorizing the correction of the school account of Adams
            County.</p>
          <p> The bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_032">[S. 32]</ref> to authorize the appointment
            of a clerk to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee of the Senate</orgName>, and a clerk to
            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives</orgName>, coming up in
            regular order, it was read the second time </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD: An amendment to section 1 providing that there be allowed a clerk to the
              <orgName>Senate Judiciary Committee</orgName>, to the groups of committees now
            provided by law, a separate clerk for said committee to be appointed by the chairman of
            said committee, and that there be allowed to the standing committees of the House on the
            judiciary, organization of courts, banks, fees and salaries, corporations and insurance
            companies, in addition to the clerks now provided by law for said committees, a separate
            clerk to be appointed by the chairmen of said committees, and that said clerks shall
            receive the same per diem as other clerks. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart insisted if the <orgName>Senate Judiciary Committee</orgName>
            was allowed a clerk, the House? <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> should also be
            allowed a separate clerk. As chairman of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> of
            the House, he would do all the committee work he could, with or without a clerk to his
            committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON favored the passage of the bill. He thought the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> of each branch of the General Assembly should accorded a separate
            clerk. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD was willing the two committees should each have a clerk if they could keep
            him busy. His amendment was intended to so operate that when the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> had no work for its clerk, he might be employed by other
            committees. </p>
          <p>On motion by MR. LEHMAN the bill and pending amendment were referred to the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee. </orgName>

          <p> The motion was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. HANDY, from the <orgName>Committee on Mileage and Accounts</orgName>, asked and

          <p>Mr. GAROUTTE moved that the House adjourn. </p>

            Assembly, have been transmitted from the Senate to this House without any accompanying
            resolution, he would suggest the following form as a proper manner in which to get the
            question before the House--</p>
          <p> Senate joint resolution No. 1, to amend section 11 of article 2 of the constitution
            and prescribing the qualifications of voters proposed and agreed to by a majority of the

            the General Assembly chosen at the next General Assembly after the same was so proposed
            and agreed to by the Fiftieth General Assembly, in the following words, to-wit: * * *
            Having been read the third time, the question is, will the House of Representatives
            agree to and ratify and adopt the said joint resolution as adopted by the Fiftieth
            General Assembly of the State of Indiana, proposing an amendment to the constitution,
            and by said General Assembly referred to the present General Assembly, as set forth in
            the joint resolution as aforesaid. Those of you in favor thereof, will, as your names
            are called, say "aye," and those of a contrary opinion will, as your
            names are called, say "no," </p>
          <p>Mr. Garoutte's motion was then agreed to, </p>
          <p>And so the House stands adjourned till Monday at 2 o'clock p. m. </p>

        <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the resolution unnecessary, as the federal statute requires the action
          contemplated in the resolution. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR did not suppose there was anything improper in the resolution,
          and would hold it to be in order, as advisory merely. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: The resolution proposes to elect a man in the place of Mr. Voorhees, and I

            "and except also that in suits by the husband for the seduction of the
            wife." </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE offered a concurrent resolution that inasmuch as important public works have
            been commenced by towns and cities for the supplying of public necessities, the
            suspension of which for want of funds or of ability to issue bonds would result in loss
            and injury, and the Immediate approval of the proposed constitutional amendment No. 9,
            limiting taxation to 2 per cent., may work such injury, therefore, if said amendment
            shall be submitted to a vote of the people it shall not be till the general election in
            1880, without regard to the time when any other proposed amendments shall be submitted. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE thought the resolution ought not to be adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: The improvements referred to are going on now, and the only object of the
            resolution is to get some kind of intimation of what the sense of the Legislature is
            upon the subject. If any of these works have to be suspended they had better be
            suspended at once. The House of Representatives may be dilatory in the passage of the
            amendments, and a large sum of money may be expended on these works in the meantime,
            which would be unfortunate if the adoption of the constitutional amendments should force
            suspension. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON, thinking this matter ought to receive considerable consideration, and that
            this resolution ought not to be voted on now, as the judgment of the Senate might be
            forestalled, moved to lay the resolution on the table. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>
          <p>The bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_004">[S. 4--Mr. Comstock's]</ref> to
            abolish the superior court of Wayne county coming up, with a favorable committee report
            thereon, the report was concurred in, the bill read the second time and ordered
            engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 29--Mr. Shirk's] to loan school funds at six per cent. coming up,
            with a committee report recommending indefinite postponement, the report was concurred
            in, and so the bill was indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 50--Mr. Viehe's] to amend section 30 of the justices'
            act coming up, with a com-[mittee] <pb n="44" xml:id="VAA8558-17-046"/> [comm]-ittee
            amendment, the amendment was concurred in, the bill read the second time and massed to
            the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 52--Mr. Coffey's] for abolishing struck juries, coming up on the
            second reading with a committee report recommending indefinite posponement, the report
            was concurred in. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 73--Mr. Moore's] that aliens may take property by device or
            descent, the same as natives, coming up with a committee report recommending indefinite
            postponement, the report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 76--Mr. Foster's] increasing the number of peremptory challenge
            of jurors coming up with a committee report recommending indefinite postponement, it was
            concurred in.</p>
          <p> The protest presented by Mr. Harris on Friday last and ordered spread upon the Senate
            journal of that day without reading at his instance, but which was expunged therefrom on
            Saturday morning in order that the lieutenant governor might have an opportunity to
            examine It and be satisfied that it states the truth, was submitted for record on the
            Senate Journal of to day. Mr. Harris' protest sets out the proceedings in the
            organization of the Senate to which he objects, and closes in the following words:</p>

        <p>The SPEAKER called the House to order and said that the order of prayer would be
          conducted by the representative from Wayne--Mr. Thornburg.</p>
        <p> The reading of the journal of Saturday was proceed with until--</p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. GORDON, the further reading was suspended. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY demanded a call of the House--which was taken, showing 85 members in their
          places. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. LEHMAN, further proceedings under the call were dispensed with. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS asked and obtained consent of the House to offer a concurrent resolution,
          which was adopted, providing for the meeting in Joint convention, to compare the vote for
          United States Senator, on next Wednesday at 12 o'clock, noon. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH called up the special order for this hour, being the consideration of the
          joint resolutions for amending the constitution of the State of Indiana, which passed the
          last General Assembly, and have also passed the Senate of the present General Assembly,
          and read the first time in the House of Representatives January 14, 1879; and printed on
          pages 159, 60,161,163, 163 and 164 of the acts passed at the regular session of the last
          General Assembly, and on page 85 of the acts passed at the special session of 1877. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays being demanded--upon the motion to take up the special order-- by two
          members, and being ordered and taken, resulted--yeas 35, nays 54. </p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, said: that inasmuch as we have now but two hours and a half for
          the disposition of these constitutional amendments, and that the proceedings would be
          interrupted to-morrow, and perhaps the next day, with the election of United States
          Senator, and many members being desirous that the debate shall continue uninterrupted, he
          hoped the question would not be pressed this afternoon. </p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above set forth, and so the House of Representatives refused to
          take up the special order. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER then moved that the proposed amendments to the constitution be considered
          at 3 o'clock this afternoon. He said the amendments having heretofore been made
          the special order for 2 o'clock this afternoon, the House should proceed to their
          consideration, or take up some more important business and postpone the special order to
          some other time. He made the motion for 3 o'clock this afternoon to see whether
          these amendments could not be taken up and disposed of. The interruption spoken of by the
          gentleman from Elkhart, [Mr. Osborne], he did not think would be an interruption worth
          mentioning. There was but one vote to be taken for United States Senator to-morrow, and he
          did not think that would occupy more than 15 minutes, and then the House had until noon of
          the next day, before another vote. He was of opinion the subject should be determined
          to-day, if we believed it just and right to pass them and send them to the people. He was
          decidedly in favor of taking them up this afternoon. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS said he was not afraid to meet the issue, but when we come to amend the
          constitution of the State it should be approached with great care and not put through in a
          hurry. He did not think members were prepared now to vote upon so important a question. We
          ought to consider well our votes upon such vital questions. He therefore moved an
          amendment, fixing the time for one week from to-day at 2 o'clock in the
          afternoon. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. OVERMAYER made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the table--yeas 36,;
          nays,56. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend by making the time Thursday next at 2 o'clock. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>

        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The yeas and nays being demanded, and taken, resulted--yeas, 41; nays, 48. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS then accepted the amendment of Mr. Gordon. The motion was agreed to, and
          Thursday next at 2 o'clock p. m fixed for the consideration of the constitutional
          amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY presented a report from the <orgName>Committee on Mileage and
            Accounts</orgName>, which was read, corrected and concurred in. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER then proceeded with the call by counties for the introduction of bills,
          resolutions, etc.</p>

            <body>
              <div type="resolution">
                <p> Whereas, There have been grave charges made that the plan of the new State House
                  was decided upon unjustly, and that the contract for the construction of the said
                  building was let against the interests of the State; and, </p>
                <p>Whereas, Thousands of people in this State are of the opinion that these charges

                <p>Whereas, The people of this State of all political parties are interested in
                  ascertaining the real truth in reference to the adoption of the plan and the
                  letting of the contract for said building; and, </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, This Legislature will be called upon to make appropriations for
                  continuing the work upon the said building, and should be fully informed in regard
                  to all matters appertaining thereunto; therefore </p>

                <p>Resolved, That a select committee of seven, composed of all political parties, be
                  appointed by the Speaker,which shall be charged with the duty of inquiring into
                  the said charges in reference to the adoption of the plans for the new State
                  House, and the letting of the contract for the same, and into the responsibility
                  of the contractors who have undertaken to build said State House, and the
                  sufficiency or their bonds, and to ascertain whether under said contract said new

            County. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON offered the following resolution: That the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> be instructed to prepare a bill to amend section 3 of an act
            entitled an act to authorize and provide for the erection of a new State House, and for
            matters incident thereto, approved March 14, 1877, by striking out of the first section
            the words immediately following "the State House Commissioners "who
            shall be selected in equal numbers from the two leading political parties of the
            State;" and report the same to this House at as early a day as practical. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart moved to strike from the resolution the words "prepare
            a bill to amend" and insert in lien the words "inquire into the
            expediency of amending." </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON regarded the law as it now stands as being in violation of the plainest
            principles of legislation. The curtailment of the power of the governor to make his
            selection from men qualified for the position and force him to make his selection from
            two leading parties was, in his opinion, entirely wrong. The governor should be
            permitted to make selection from the very best men in the State qualified for the
            position without distinction to party. We should do all we can to return to first
            principles, and until we can legislate for the people and remain free to selectmen the
            best qualified to fill official positions we never shall be safe. He stood for the
            elimina-[tion] <pb n="46" xml:id="VAA8558-17-048"/> [elimina]-tion of these words. He
            accepted the modification proposed by the gentleman from Elkhart [Mr. Osborne]. </p>
          <p>The resolution was adopted. </p>
          <p>By Mr. HUTHSTEINER, [H. R. 256] to reduce the rates of interest upon county orders or
            warrants on the treasurer when not paid for want or funds. </p>
          <p>Mr. BLOCKLEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the <orgName>Committee on
              Education</orgName> be instructed to inquire into the expediency of abolishing the
            office of county superintendent and to make provision of a school examiner instead. </p>
          <p>By Mr. BLOCKLY, [H. R. 257] to regulate work on roads, </p>
          <p>By Mr. SLEETH, [H. R. 258] to repeal section 16 and amend section 1 of an act
            concerning voluntary assignments.</p>
          <p> By Mr. SAINT, [H. R. 259] to punish elective and other officers for accepting free
            passes over railroad, steamboat or other lines. </p>

        <p>Mr. REEVES, in explanation of his vote, <pb n="48" xml:id="VAA8558-17-050"/> his vote,
          said: Believing the resumption of specie payment a fixed fact accomplished without regard
          to legislative act, and opposing any further disturbance of the finances of the country by
          legislative act, I vote "aye.".</p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, when his name was called, said he had in his hand a copy of the
          national Democratic platform, adopted in St. Louis in 1876. [He read thorefrom.] I
          can't go back on the national Democratic platform, therefore I vote
          "aye". [Tremendous applause from Republican benches.] </p>
        <p>Mr. WOODS, in explanation, said: Believing that the Indiana State Senate is not the St.
          Louis Convention, and that this is a mere electioneering dodge got up by Senator Streight,
          and believing that no electioneering dodge should be brought into the Senate, and to
          discourage all such electioneering jobs, I vote " aye ". </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, when his name was called, said: Knowing that resumption is an
          accomplished fact, and believing we are on the high road to prosperity, and wishing that
          financial differences may be taken out of politics, and believing they ought to be, I vote
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: Believing it not in
          order for the Senate to adopt any resolution that shall bind the action of any member in
          his vote for United States senator, I vote "no."</p>
        <p> The roll-call having been completed, a senator moved that Mr. Major's name be
          called. The lieutenant governor so directed, but the senator not responding, the chair
          asked if the senator heard the resolution read? </p>
        <p>Mr. MAJOR--No, sir. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then directed the reading of the resolution again. </p>
        <p>Mr. MAJOR: "I was called out by a friend before the resolution was offered. I
          don't know the history of this motion. I know what my sentiments are and what I
          want to do. I don't want to be involved in any vote I don't understand.
          I don't know the motive that prompted this motion, nor do I know its effect.
          Therefore I don't want to vote. I know what I want, and can vote intelligently,
          if I know the intention and design of this vote, but without some further light I
          don't want to be picked up. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL: I move that he be excused from voting.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays on agreeing to this motion were demanded by Messrs. Harris and Langdon,
          and being taken resulted yeas 24, nays 22.</p>
        <p> So the Senator [Mr. Major] was excused from voting.</p>
        <p> Mr. MAJOR--I am now prepared to vote. [Applause.] I vote "no."
          [Renewed applause.] </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

                called the salary grab, as no such man is entitled to the vote of the members of
                this Senate for the high and honorable position of senator of the United States.

            </div>

        <p>Mr. STREIGHT demanded the previous question but the Senate refused to second the
          demand--yeas, 21; nays, 26. </p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said: The Senate of the State of Indiana is no
          political caucus in which should be discussed the merits claims and rights of candidates
          for office. I vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, in explanation of his vote, said: I vote "no" for the
          same reason as given by the senator from Marshall [Mr. Reeve].</p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: Believing the
          Senate has no right to determine how individual members shall vote on that or any other
          proposition, I vote "no." </p>
        <p>The vote was announced as above, so the Senate refused to second the demand for the
          previous question. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE the resolution was laid on the table by--yeas 26, nays 21. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES offered the following:</p>

          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p> Resolved, That no one shall be voted for for United States Senator who has been
                engaged in Venezuela bond speculations. </p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT (Mr. Menzies holding the floor), I second the resolution. I hope that the
          resolution will pass.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Mr. MENZIES demanded the previous question, which being seconded by the Senate, under
          its operation the resolution was adopted--yeas,36; nays, 10.</p>
        <p> Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called., said: Inasmuch as the only Venezuela bond
          speculator I know of is one of the regular candidates of the Republican party, and
          inasmuch as it is their privilege to vote for an infernal scoundrel if they want to, and
          inasmuch-- </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS (Interrupting)--I rise to a point of order. The words are unparliamentary. I
          demand that they be taken down. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE--Yes sir: take them down. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR--The chair does not remember the words. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE--I will repeat them. I said that inasmuch as the only Venezuela speculator I
          remember is one of the regular candidates of the Republican party now, and inasmuch as the
          Republican party has the right to vote for any Republican scoundrel it wants to--I do not
          impugn the motives of any man nor refer to any particular member, but to the only
          speculator in Venezuela bonds I know of and inasmuch as the resolution reflects on the
          action of the Republican party which made that gentleman its nominee, I believe in their
          exercising the rights of American citizens and be left free and untrammelled to vote for
          whom they please. I vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT: I ask the senator from Marshall [Mr. Reeve] if he knows such to be the
          case? If so, I would never vote for such a candidate for the United States Senate. I ask
          the senator to state whether he knows from personal knowledge or evidence that would be
          sufficient to condemn him, of the fact that any candidate for the United States Senate has
          been a speculator in Venezuela bond? </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER rose to a point of order, that we are acting under the previous question, and
          this debate across the House is unparliamentary.</p>
        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR so decided. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: For the same
          reason I voted "no" on the other resolution, I vote
          "no" on this. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, in explanation of his vote, said: For the same reason I assigned for voting
          "no" on the other proposition, I vote "no" on this. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE, when his name was called, said: Believing the Senate ought not to influence
          the vote of any senator, I vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WOODS, when his name was called, said: I believe this resolution is an attempt to
          influence the vote of some senator upon this floor, and, like the other resolution about
          the salary grab, it is an improper one to be introduced in this body. I don't
          think such a <pb n="49" xml:id="VAA8558-17-051"/> resolution ought to come up before the
          Senate, and I vote "no".</p>
        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above, and so the resolution was
          adopted.</p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock p.m.</p>

          <p>The Senate was not called to order till about 2:30 o'clock, when--</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. Kent, it was ordered that the Senate proceed first to the election of

          <p>The lieutenant governor announced that nominations were in order. </p>
          <p>Mr. Reeve: In obedience to the behests of the Democratic party of Indiana, through her
            Representatives, without a dissenting voice, and on behalf of that Democracy, I desire
            to present for the suffrages of this General Assembly the name of a man who to-day
            perhaps occupies a more prominent position, for the time being, than any other man in
            our nation; a man whose eloquence has been heard throughout the length and breadth of
            the land, and who has not only a state but a national reputation; a man who to-day
            stands upon the floor of the United State Senate--as dignified, intelligent and
            independent a body as exists in any deliberate organization in the world--a peer of any
            other member. But remarks are unneccessary--any eulogy is not needed in his case--I
            nominate Daniel W. Voorhees as a candidate for the office now to be filled by the

            term ending the 4th of March next, no eulogy is necessary, and I now place him in

          <p>By Mr. GINZ [H. R. 264] for the security of laboring men,[mechanical and other labor,
            in cases of assignment--preferred claims.]</p>
          <p>Mr. GAROUTTE offered the following resolution, which was adopted: </p>
          <p>That the <orgName>committee on judiciary</orgName> be instructed to inquire into the
            constitutionality of exempting disabled soldiers from the payment of poll tax in cases
            where the real and personal property of said soldier, listed for taxation, does not
            exceed $1,000, and report by bill or otherwise.</p>
          <p>By Mr. KESTER [H. R. 265] for a revision of the road law.</p>
          <p>By Mr. TAYLOR of Warrick [H. R. 266] to prevent mortgaged property from being run off.
            He also offered a resolution authorizing the clerk of the House of Representatives to
            procure the revised statutes for the use of the member of this House, and that the same
            be returned to the librarian at the close of the session, unless the members are
            disposed to pay the wholesale price.</p>

          <p>Mr. TULLEY hoped the resolution would not prevail. It had been intimated that the
            statutes would cost the State nothing. He thought they would cost the State near $2,000.
            Former General Assemblies had passed similar resolutions, yet now there were but very
            few copies of the statutes belonging to the State that could be used by members of this
            House. He insisted that members should purchase the statutes for themselves. </p>
          <p>Mr. COPELAND said that the House had given a decided expression upon this subject a few
            days ago, and that subsequently a like resolution was ruled out of order. He submitted
            figures showing that the door-keeper of the last Legislature had purchased 100 set at a
            cost to the State of $1,200, and that 59 set returned was sold at $5 per set. He thought
            this way of voting to themselves statutes was not treating their constituents right. He
            hoped the resolution would not prevail.</p>

          <p> Mr. ALLEN thought workmen should be furnished with tools. The time used upon the
            discussion of this subject would have paid for these articles over and over again. He
            insisted that members were entitled to the statutes, and ought to have them, and if
            members did not want to purchase them at the close of the session, they could return
            them to the librarian. </p>
          <p>Mr. CALDWELL said it was customary to furnish member with these statutes, and he
            regarded them as necessary to intelligent legislation, especially to those members who
            were not of the legal profession. He thought it strange, therefore, that the lawyers of
            this House should try to keep them out of the hands of those who need them. The receipts
            of members of previous Legislatures who had failed to return the statutes, as provided
            were in the hands of the proper officials , and should be placed in the hands of the
            attorney general, with instructions to collect the money for them. If members here agree
            to return them, he was sure they would do so. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN was opposed to the resolution , and insisted if members wanted the statutes
            they should buy them. </p>
          <p>Mr. COPELAND made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The yeas and nays being demanded and taken upon the adoption of the resolution,
            resulted--yeas 40, nays 35--so the resolution was rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the doorkeeper prepare seats
            on the right of the speaker's chair for senators up on the occasion of the
            canvass of the votes for the United States senator, fixed for to-morrow. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess, [H. R. 267] to repeal an act authorizing towns and townships to
            aid in the construction of railroads, approved March 12, 1867; also [H. R. 268] defining
            libel.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER announced that he had signed enrolled bill [H. R. 1] appropriating $120,000
            for Legislative expenses, and asked that bills [H. R. 100 and 101] relating to insane
            persons be put upon their second reading. They were read the second time, and referred
            to the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent Institutions</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. EDWIN offered a resolution, which was adopted, declaring six per cent interest.</p>
          <p>A communication from the auditor of State was read, showing the amount of money drawn
            from the State treasury on account of the Normal School for the past four years,
            $98,291.75; for the State University, $121,738; for the Purdue University,
            $33,235.42.</p>
          <p>On motion, 150 copies was ordered printed.</p>
          <p>The SPEAKER then announced House bills on their second reading.</p>
          <p>The following were read the second time and referred to appropriate committees.</p>
          <p>Mr. Carey's bill [H. R. 65] to create a State board of health. Also his bill
            [H. R. 66] for a board of medical examiners.</p>
          <p>Mr. Arnold's bill defining body-snatching [H. R. 67].</p>
          <p>Mr. Lindley's bill [H. R. 68], deducting bona fide indebtedness from tax
            assessment.</p>
          <p>Mr. Handy's amendment of the divorce law [H. R. 69].</p>

            [H. R. 73] for an asylum for feeble minded children.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. Taylor of Daviess, the House then went into an election of United
            States senator, for the short term--to expire the 3d of March, 1879.</p>

          <p>Pending the vote Mr. CARTER, when his name was called, said while he was reckoned with
            the National party he owed his election to the Democrats of his county, and he therefore
            voted for Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWIN, when his name was called, said it was with pride that he cast all the
            Democratic votes of Madison County for Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, </p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER, when his name was called, said he had worked hard and long for this hour.
            But for Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees he would not have left his farm-home for a seat in this
            General Assembly, He felt repaid for all the labor of the canvass in the privilege of
            casting his vote for Daniel W. Voorhees. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON, when his name was called, said between the candidates he had not yet made
            up his mind which one to vote for. He would therefore cast his vote for James M.
            Shackelford, of Vanderburg County. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT, when his name was called, said that while he was a member of the Democrat
            party, he also represented a large portion of tho Nationals of Madison County. He was
            glad of an opportunity to vote for the man who was bold enough to stand up and tell who
            were the real enemies of his country. He voted for Daniel W. Voorhees. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER, when his name was called, said he had been accuse of bolting the Republican
            nomination. He voted for Hon. Godlove S. Orth. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIMMER, when his name way called, said he was a member of the National party, but
            inasmuch as there was no chance for that party, and as he could not get his choice, he
            thought it right, to do the next best thing. He voted for Daniel W Voorhees. </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER announced the ballot as above, and said it would be spread on the
            Journal.</p>
          <p> Upon the motion of Mr. WILLARD, the House then proceeded to the election of United
            States Senator for term of six years, from 4th of March, 1879.</p>
          <p> Nominations being in order--</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD: Mr. Speaker, I rise to nominate the next Senator from this State. As the
            representatives of the people of Indiana, it is our duty to reflect their desires and
            demands in the election of a citizen to this high official position. The people of
            Indiana demand that their next Senator shall be a parliamentarian--the peer and superior
            of his adversaries on the floor of the Senate. They ask for a champion of the rights of
            the West, who is amply able to meet and defeat the representatives of the gigantic money
            power of Wall street. They want a financier whose heart is as cold as the eternal
            glaciers on the summit of Mount Blanc to the seductive flatteries of capital. They
            desire a leader ("Sans peur et sans reproche') fearless in defence,
            resistless hi attack, and whose name shall carry terror into the ranks of our
            opponents--the party of wrong. They wish a statesman whose character is the apothesis of
            political honesty, and whose integrity is as immaculate as the plummage of the dove that
            descended from the bosom of the Father at the baptism of the Jordan. The people of
            Indiana demand that we shall elect as our Senator a man who shall recall our great
            leaders of the past, one who is a supporter of the grandest political principles ever
            enunciated by mortal lips, "Equal and exact justice toward all men; exclusive
            privileges to none." That principle forms the basis of our institutions, the
            impelling force of our progress, the crowning glory of our nation, and its supporters in
            the past are associated with all that is noble in our history. Beneath the encircling
            elms of Montecello rests in peace the great author of that principle, Thomas Jefferson.
            Where roll in endless summer the bright blue waves of the Chesapeake, in their own loved
            Virginia, lie buried its great defenders, Madison and Monroe. The plumed palmetto nods
            in tropical beauty above the tomb of Carolina's gifted orator, John C. Calhoun.
            The birds that carol in the groves of the Hermitage sing their songs above the mortal
            remains of the lion hearted Tennessean, Andrew Jackson. "By the now of inland
            river" Missouri's greatest statesman, Thomas Hart Benton,
            "Sleeps the sleep that knows no waking," That river of poetry and
            romance, the Susquehanna, as it laps the banks of Lancaster, lulls with its murmur the
            ashes of Pennsylvania's great diplomist, James Buchanan. By the shore of the
            mighty lakes, a magnificent mausoleum and a marble cenotaph pointing heaven word record
            the virtues of the greatest political leader of them all--the little giant, Stephen A.
            Douglass. Though these great supporters of tin's principle have passed into the
            illuminations of history, though political contests have shaken the country, though wars
            and revolutions have convulsed our Government, the principle, "Equal and exact
            justice toward all men exclusive privileges to none," fresh as on its natal
            morn, still remains an eternal bulwark to a nation's liberties, grounded into
            the hearts of the people, and to-day finds its grandest cham[pion]- <pb n="52" xml:id="VAA8558-17-054"/>[cham] pion and defender in the idol of Indiana, the next
            senator from this State. There is only one citizen of Indiana who, in his high character
            and lofty talents and abilities, fulfills the wants, desires, requirements and demands
            of this people in their choice for senator--that great leader who is inspired with all
            the fiery energy of the young Democracy, and imbued with the sage counsel of the old;
            that champion of the rights of the people who, on the floor of the Senate, dared to
            strike one powerful blow to wrest the rights of labor from the iron grasp of financial
            despotism; that statesman who has not only the ability to appreciate the wants of the
            people, but the manhood and fearless courage to right their wrongs; that clearest headed
            financier the West has ever produced, for he has never been deceived by the financial
            sophistries of Wall street: that noblest son of Indiana, who belongs not only to this
            State, not only to our own loved West, not to the Democratic party alone, but it is the
            representative of all the oppressed tolling millions of America; that guide to whom an
            impoverished people are looking as their political Moses to lead them out of the Egypt
            of financial bondage over to the glorious promised land of better times. </p>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, in behalf not of the Democracy on this floor, but in the name of the
            people of Indiana by fifty thousand majority, I place in nomination as the next senator
            from this State the grandest parliamentarian of the latter half of the nineteenth
            century, the truest friend of the people in this whole broad land, the brilliant orator
            who has thrilled a continent with his eloquence, Daniel W. Voorhees. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON intimated that he was not always in the minority. Party devotion with him
            had long since been dead. He arose to nominate a man on whose character there was not
            the slightest stain, a man who was in a lucrative office when the country was imperiled
            and needed soldiers, and who left that office for a lieutenant's commission and
            served his country during that imperiled period , and was one of the members with
            General Sherman on that memorable march to the sea. He nominated General Benjamin
            Harrison. </p>
          <p>Mr. MAJOR nominated the Hon. James Buchanan. </p>
          <p>The ballot resulted as in the previous vote except that Mr. Gordon voted for Gen. Benj.
            Harrison. </p>
          <p>The speaker announced the result,stating that the same would be spread upon the
            journal. </p>
          <p>The House then adjourned.</p>

          <time>10 o'clock a. m.</time>
        </dateline>
        <p>After the order of prayer by the senator from Monroe and Lawrence [Rev.W. B. F.
          Treat].</p>
        <p>This being Wednesday, under the rules the first order of business is the consideration of
          bills on the third reading. There being none on the calendar, the next thing in order is
          bills on the second reading. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 16--Mr. Dice's] in relation to change of venue in preliminary cases
          before justices of the peace, coming up with a committee report, recommending its
          indefinite postponement--</p>
        <p>Mr. DICE thought the report was incorrect in stating that the provisions of this bill are
          embraced in the bill S. 50. This bill provides against a change of venue in preliminary
          examinations, while the bill S. 50 does not. He favored the passage of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: The object of the committee was to prevent accumulative legislation. To enable
          the senator to have a fair chance, he was willing this one should be laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT was also of opinion that the object in this bill sought was not embraced in the
          bill S. 50, which contemplates two actions. A preliminary examination is not a trial. He
          moved the bill be recommitted for further examination. There ought to be some legislation
          on this question. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE favored the motion to recommit. In many cases it is important a partial trial
          should be had on preliminary examination. </p>
        <p>The motion to recommit was agreed to. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 63--Mr. Davenport's] supplementary to the act to exempt property
          from sale in certain cases, with a committee report recommending indefinite postponement,
          was then taken up. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE said there were some matters of importance embraced in this bill, and he moved
          its recommitment for further examination. </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>
        <p>The bill [S.110--Mr. Cadwallader's] to amend the act declaring agreements to pay
          attorneys' fees on any evidence of indebtedness illegal, with a report from a
          majority of the <orgName>Judiciary committee</orgName> recommending its reference to the
            <orgName>committee on Rights and Privileges of the Inhabitants of the State</orgName>,
          and a minority report recommending the passage of the bill,. coming up--</p>
        <p>Mr. KENT thought the time has come to abolish all such agreements to pay
          attorneys' fees. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES hoped the majority report would not be concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE--The <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> being composed largely of lawyers,
          thought it best to recommend the, change of reference to the <orgName>committee on rights
            and privileges</orgName>. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE--The <orgName>Judiciary committee</orgName> are more properly organized to
          settle questions of law. Here is a proposition nude, which the senator from Clinton [Mr.
          Kent] says is to repeal a law that enables the rich to rob the poor. The intelligence of
          the State should be left free to manage its domestic affairs in its own way. The people
          should have any kind of law they want. Otherwise it would be an unfortunate movement that
          ultimately would overturn the representative form of government. These little things, like
          eternal drippings, will wear away the rock. </p>
        <p>Mr. WEIR, moved the recommitment of the bill to the <orgName>judiciary
            committee</orgName>. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD favored the majority report. There should be no law preventing the citizen from
          making any contract he thinks fit. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE was always opposed to the attorney fee clause. It is compulsion. It drives
          the borrower to make an agreement to pay attorney fees. He favored the minority report. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL opposed recommitment. The Senate is us well prepared now to vote upon tins
          question as it will be a week or two hence, and it should be settled now. The system that
          compels a man to pay usury in the shape of attorney's fees, has and will work
          hardships. It makes the creditor less able to pay the whole amount, and prudence and
          justice alike demand the adoption of the minority report </p>

        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN hoped the report of the min-[ority] <pb n="54" xml:id="VAA8558-17-056"/>
          [min]-ority would be adopted. When a man must have money he will go to almost any length
          to obtain it, and the law should step in to protect him in his extremity. Usury has always
          by all civilized nations been held to be wrong. The people demand the repeal of the
          onerous clause by which a debtor is always being invited to a suit that the creditor may
          be benefitted. </p>
        <p>Mr HART'S constituents are demanding the repeal of these attorneys'
          fees, and he should do every thing to advance that end. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER, desired a vote on the minority report. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT: History will show that as often as the country is involved in financial
          difficulties the people resort to legislative aid to fix the value of money. There is no
          greater folly than to support the debtor class will be benefitted by restricting them as
          to what they shall pay for money. One of the chief benefits of government is to enforce
          honest contracts. Would you cut off the privilege of the borrower on the best terms he
          could? A measure so intimately connected with our best interests should be considered from
          a business standpoint. You can not make a provision that will compel the lender to put out
          his money on less terms than are satisfactory to him. Senators may say their
          constituencies are clamoring for the passage of this bill, but his constituencies are
          demanding that collections laws shall be made short, safe and sure, and are against
          hampering conditions on which money may be loaned. With our loose collection laws and the
          Government offering a bond at four percent., without taxes, who is going to loan money at
          six per cent.? When you fix it so any one controlling idle capital can better afford to
          buy government bonds than loan to a neighbor, the borrowing class will find there is no
          money to loan. If you pass no laws to drive capital out of the State, there may be found
          men who will loan at a rate that a needy borrower can get relief on reasonable terms </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN: If the lender has to pay attorney's fees on short loans he
          cannot get his money back. Is that just and fair? </p>
        <p>Mr. COFFEY favored the minority report All such contracts should be declared null and
          void. Such stipulations now are indefinite and uncertain, and unjust to the borrower. For
          this reason he opposed the present law. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS: Shall we attempt to protect everybody against the consequences of their own
          contracts? The next measure proposed by advocates of this will probably be to do away with
          the valuation and appraisement law, which is a very benificent measure. That would
          naturally follow, and there is more reason in this than in the measure proposed by the
          minority report. The question should be: What will benefit the people? The people are
          almost all in the hands of creditors who hold iron-clad notes. Reduce interest to six per
          cent., strike out the right to pay attorney's fees, and where will the money go?
          You will make nugatory the declaration that we want more money. It only will go where it
          can command better rates. As a friend to the people of his native State, he would not aid
          in driving capitalists and capital away. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER opposed adoption of the minority report, and for fear it has not been properly
          investigated by the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> he favored concurrence in the
          majority report. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS: The bill ought not to pass, for it takes away the right of parties to contract
          as they please for the loan of money. If there is any necessity for legislating in favor
          of parties who can not take care of themselves guardians should be appointed to make
          contracts to borrow money for such. It is saying the people shall make only such contracts
          for money as we shall dictate. The same right should prevail in the making of contracts
          for the use of money as for any other contract the citizen is capable of entering into. He
          favored the motion to recommit. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK: The <orgName>Judiciary Committee </orgName>is well qualified to judge of the
          merits of the bill, and without entering into a discussion thereof he favored the pending
          motion. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE believed this bill embodies a fundamental principle which demands carefu1
          consideration. It is a measure embodying class legislation, which is seldom recognized
          when it presents itself. Now is the time for senators to decide this question. An absurd
          idea is maintained by some that there can a conflict between capital and labor. Such
          conflict is precipitated by class legislation, and when that comes labor is starved to
          submission and capital is reduced to a position where it is comparatively useless. </p>
        <p>Law is made for the preservation of public order. Every law that takes away the rights of
          the private citizen is tyranny. </p>
        <p>Here the speaker was interrupted by the appearance at the bar of the Senate of a
          committee from the House of Representatives, commissioned to escort, the Senate to the
          hall of the House for the purposes of a joint convention to canvass the votes cast
          yesterday in each body separately for United States Senator. The Senate thereupon left the
          chamber. When senators had returned, Mr. Reeve gave way for the recess till 2 o'
          clock p. m. </p>


        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>Mr REEVE, resuming the floor, continued his remarks at considerable length. This class
            of legislation he desired to meet at the threshold, and plead with Senators to take no
            step in that direction, directly or indirectly, for therein lies danger. We should pause
            even on this little bill, for it is an entering wedge to class legislation, and that is
            the thunderbolt that will rend to fragments any form of government </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: If this bill were to pass, the debtor would be denied the right to renew
            his obligation, and in a majority of cases the creditor will demand judgment in
            accordance with the obligation as it now stands. This is the most important point
            connected with this bill </p>
          <p>Mr KENT: The objections raised by the senator from Marshall [Mr Reeve] can be very
            easily answered. Is it true that the repeal of the law authorizing the collection of
            attorney's fees is class legislation? If so, what kind of legislation was it
            that passed the act permitting attorney's fees to be collected on promissory
            notes? The provision as it now stands is absolute--it does not depend upon the question
            as to whether or not suit is brought. The senator talks about class legislation. We have
            had it for the last ten or fifteen years, and it has been in favor of the rich man and
            against the poor. The men who have money to loan have it in their power to compel the
            poor borrower to comply with their terms. The first duty of the Government is to pass
            such laws as will restrain the strong and protect the weak. We should go back to the
            fundamental principle of Government itself, and insist that laws be passed for
            restraining the strong and for protecting the weak. </p>
          <p>Mr. Winterbotham: In the session of 1875 the Legislature was flooded with petitions
            asking that the attorney's fee clause be stricken from such contracts, and in
            accordance with such petitions a law was passed with that intention, that was partly set
            aside by a decision <pb n="55" xml:id="VAA8558-17-057"/> of the Supreme Court, and now
            we are asked to pass a law to meet the objection raided by the Court; He favored
            concurrence in the minority report. </p>
          <p>The motion to recommit was rejected--yeas 15; nays 29. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>A motion, [Mr. Olds], to lay the minority report on the table was rejected--yeas 19;
            nays 25; the minority report was rejected--yeas 21; nays 23--; the majority report, was
            concurred in, and so the bill was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
              Privileges</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS introduced a bill [S. 205] to provide against unjust charges by surgeons and
            physicians for services rendered, and against excessive charges by farmers. Surgeons not
            to charge to exceed $5 for an operation, phyisicians 50 cents for prescriptions--each
            five cents mile age. Farmers not to sell wheat for more than 50 cents per bushel; corn,
            25 cents: oats, 15 cents, clover seed, $3; timothy seed, 75 cents; and charges for any
            amount in excess shall be illegal and void. [Laughter.] </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 125--Mr. Foster's, by request] for the conviction of persons in
            possession of stolen property coming up, with a committee amendment, it was concurred
            in, and the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 121--Mr. Trusler's] to repeal section 2 of the misdemeanor
            [provoke] act of March 22,1855, coming up, with a committee report recommending
            indefinite postponement-- </p>

            act, described in these reports of the 14th inst., was read the second time, with a
            committee report that it lie on the table. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK it was recommitted.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL introduced a bill [S. 206] to repeal section 6 and amend section 16 of an
            act concerning promissory notes, approved March 11.1861. </p>
          <p>A message from the House of Representatives announcing the passage by that body of a
            joint resolution instructing senators and requesting Indiana's delegation in
            Congress to favor the granting of pensions to the veterans of the Mexican war, was made
            simultaneously with the appearance at the bar of the Senate of those Mexican war
            veterans now attending a convention in this city, in pursuance of am invitation extended
            by a resolution adopted this afternoon, offered by Mr. Menzies, by the terms of which
            the lieutenant governor announced a recess of ten minutes. After the time had expired he
            resumed the chair and spoke words of greeting to the veterans, extending to them, in
            behalf of the Senate, the privileges of the floor. </p>
          <p>General Mahlon D, Manson, in behalf of his comrades, thanked the Senate for the
            compliment paid them, and referred to many victories won by the American soldiers on
            Mexican soil 33 years ago. </p>
          <p>Major Jonathan W. Gordon, in response to persistent calls, also made a little speech,
            in Which he referred in tender terms to many who have passed over on the other side. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. Menzies the message just received from the House of Representatives
            was taken up and the resolution passed unanimously. </p>

          <p>Pending the reading of this bill--</p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON (entering the side door in advance of the veterans of the Mexican war) said:
            "Mr. Speaker, I am directed by the chairman of the committee appointed to

            performed that duty, and the veterans are here ready to avail themselves of the

            seats upon the floor. He wished that they would make themselves at home, as every
            privilege of the House was by resolution extended to them. </p>
          <p>General Mahlon D. Manson was then called for, and responded in behalf of the veterans,
            recounting some of their battles and referring to the results in the acquisition of
            territory to the United States. </p>
          <p>Major Jonathan W. Gordon being called on recited his experience, illustrating with an

        <p> The session was opened, with prayer by Dr. LEA W. MUNLALL, of this city, of the M. E.
          church. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the standing committee on reapportionment of the State
          for senatorial and representative purposes, viz.: Messrs. Viehe, Moore, Sarnighausen,
          Grubbs, Reeve, Langdon, Davis, Urmston, Hellman, Winterbotham, Garrigus, Tarlton and
          Coffey; also, the standing committee on reapportionment of the State for congressional
          purposes: Messrs Burrell, Taylor, Menzies, Olds, Fowler, Harris, Kent, Comstock, Hefron,
          Mercer, Wood, Smith and Reiley. </p>
        <p>Several of the standing committees of the Senate returned a number of Senate bills--a
          dozen and a half or two dozen--with a report on each embracing the judgment and
          recommendation of the committee returning it which reports, at the suggestion of the
          lieutenant governor, were placed on the files without reading, this order to be continued
          unless set aside by the action of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE offered the following resolution, which was adopted:</p>
        <floatingText>
          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p> Resolved, That the auditor of State is hereby required to request of each and
                every county auditor, treasurer, sheriff and clerk in the State of Indiana, under
                oath, a full and complete exhibit of his salary, fees, emoluments and perquisites
                received, by him or his predecessor for the year 1878, and also a full statement,
                under oath, of all expenditures of every kind and nature--the name and number of
                clerks or assistants employed by each, with the true amount paid to each and for
                what service rendered, for and during the year 1878, showing the net proceeds or
                profits accruing from said respective office; said information to be furnished to
                the State auditor before the 15th day of February, 1879. </p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE declared the purport of the resolution to be all right, but in order to obtain
          this information if; would be necessary to pass an act requiring these questions to be
          answered; and because of that he opposed passage of the resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS--If there is anything needed by members of this Assembly it is information in
          regard to fees and salaries of county officers, Senators know nothing of the fees and
          salaries of county officers other than what they may have picked up in their own counties
          or districts. If this resolution is adopted, and officers do not respond, and in acting
          upon the best information we are able to obtain, we do them injustice, it is not our
          fault, but theirs, because we have called upon them to give us information we desire, and
          which we need, and if they do not give it to us the responsibility will rest with them.
          Therefore this is a resolution in the right direction. It is not mandatory. If these
          officials shall choose to give the information asked for, they can; if they don't
          we should act as best, we can without it. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, instructing senators and
          requesting Indiana's representatives in Congress to procure the enactment of a
          law requiring plaintiffs in all cases where judgment is rendered in Federal courts against
          residents in this State, to cause a brief memoranda of the judgment to be sent to the
          clerk of the circuit court in which defendant resides, to be entered on the judgment
          docket. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON offered a resolution instructing the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> to
          ascertain whether the assessment laws are conflicting, and if so report a bill to secure
          the proper assessment and collection of taxes. </p>
        <p>It was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER offered a resolution requesting the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> to
          report a bill, reducing the interest on money, at its earliest convenience. He said: It
          looks as though the object is to defer action on this interest matter as long as possible.
          The committee has had time to consider the question of interest. The whole ground has been
          traveled over in debate in this Senate, and now a test question might be taken on this
          resolution, whether we are willing or not in any reasonable length of time to have a bill
          reported to reduce the rate of interest. <pb n="59" xml:id="VAA8558-17-061"/>
        </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE: The Senator (Mr. Trusler) is mistaken when he intimates the object is delay.
          The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> has considered all the bills on the subject of
          interest that have been referred to it, and has determined to have a new bill in lieu of
          them all, which has already been drafted in pencil. The <orgName>Judiciary
            Committee</orgName> has been at work almost every night. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS: This resolution ought not to pass. The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
          has determined upon a report. If the Senate chooses to take the matter out of the hands of
          this committee, and refer it to some other committee, of course it can do so. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE would submit at no time and in no place to an open charge of corruption in the
          discharge of duty. If this Senate adopts a resolution, the import of which declares, as
          its author has said, to censure the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, including the
          chairman (Mr. Reeve), for corruptly failing to discharge its duty, it is at liberty to
          find some other chairman and some other member of the committee. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. STREIGHT the resolution was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. RAGAN offered a resolution that speeches be limited to five minutes. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. HARRIS it was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS offered the following: </p>

                shall be notified when his bill will be considered by such committee, and no bill
                shall be adversely passed upon by such committee unless its author be so notified.

        <p> After prayers were said by Rev. Or J. H. BAYLISS, pastor of Roberts Park M. E. Church,
          of this city--</p>
        <p> Three or four dozen committee reports were submitted, and placed on the files without
          reading, under an order of the presiding officer of the Senate made several days ago. And
          then</p>
        <p> Mr. OLDS offered the following: </p>
        <floatingText>
          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p>Whereas, It has been charged by the public press that the Trustees of the Indiana
                Soldiers' Home, and the trustees and officers of the other benevolent
                institutions of the State, have been guilty of mismanagement and misappropriation of
                funds, and believing it to be the duty of the Senate to investigate the management
                of the benevolent institutions of the State, and to prevent, as far as in their
                power, all mismanagement of said institutions, and all misappropriation of moneys by
                the trustees and officers of the same,</p>
              <p>Therefore, Be it Resolved, by the Senate, That a special committee of five senators
                be appointed by the president of the Senate to investigate the management of the
                Indiana Soldiers' Home, and the management of all the other benevolent and
                reformatory institutions, and to investigate in regard to the charges made by the
                public press against the trustees of the Indiana Soldiers' Home in regard
                to charging and receiving for their services an amount in excess of the amount to
                which they were entitled by law, and to further investigate and ascertain whether
                any trustee or officer of any of the benevolent institutions of the State have
                charged or received for their services any amount in excess of the amount to which
                they are entitled by law; and that such committee shall have power to send for and
                compel the attendance before them of any person to testify in relation to the
                matters contained in this resolution, and to compel the production or inspection of
                any paper or book that may be deemed necessary by them to be produced and inspected
                in making such investigation; that said committee make a detailed report of the
                result of their investigation to the Senate at as early a period as practicable.

        <p>Mr OLDS made an ineffectual demand for the previous question, which was defeated by a tie
          vote on a division of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN offered as a substitute the following:</p>
        <floatingText>
          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p> Whereas it has been charged in the columns of the papers in this city that the
                various state benevolent institutions are managed in an extravagant and corrupt
                manner, therefore, be it </p>
              <p>Resolved, That a committee of three senators be appointed by the president the
                Senate, whose duty it shall be to investigate the management of the hospital for the
                insane, the institutions for the education of the deaf and dumb and blind and the
                soldiers' home at Knightstown, and report the results of their
                investigation to the Senate at least six days before the close of the regular
                session. And for the purpose of aiding such committee in a full investigation, they
                are hereby authorized to employ an expert, provided the said expert shall not be
                paid more than three dollars per day for the time he is actually engaged in such
                duty. And said committee is hereby authorized to send for persons, papers, and
                examine witnesses under oath.</p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </floatingText>



        <p>Mr. BURRELL thought this substitute a good amendment. A special committee as provided for
          in the original resolution would take away several senators, while the standing committee
          can discharge the duty in connection with its other business. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS: The substitute ought not to be adopted, because it embraces institutions under
          the charge of two of the standing committees of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER preferred the substitute because it is better to employ an expert at 93 a day
          to do the proposed work than to send a committee of five or six members of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEILMAN did not believe it good policy to adopt the substitute. How can you hire a
          man for $3 a day who will not sell out for $5 a day to somebody else? He thought the
          special committee should be appointed. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN had greater confidence in <pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-17-066"/>men than to
          believe they would sell out for $5 a day. The demands of the times are for economy, and
          there are now so many bookkeepers and accountants at leisure we can find one for $3 a day,
          no doubt. Anything else than an investigation that goes to the bottom of affairs is a
          farce. What we want is to get a complete and thorough investigation without favor to
          anybody.</p>

        <p>Mr. STREIGHT. It has not been charged that the books of these institutions have been
          improperly kept. What we want to know is whether extra salaries have been drawn, or
          whether extra charges have been made for labor or materials furnished or in the general
          expenditures on account of those institutions. It would take no expert to find that out. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL. The regular standing committee of the Senate should investigate whatever
          appears to be irregular and wrong about these institutions. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK favored the substitute. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, as a usual thing, would favor the regular committees doing this kind of work,
          but the substitute covers too much ground. If it is expected of the <orgName>reformatory
            committee</orgName> and examine each one of the committee to visit and examine each of
          these institutions the members might as well vacate their seats and commence the work now.
          If an expert could be set to work, and one or two members of the committee by turns
          accompany him, Mr. F. would favor the substitute, otherwise he should oppose it. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE. This investigation should be made thorough and complete, and to do this we
          ought to have a special committee whose duty it shall be to devote its time and attention
          to this business until it gets at the bottom facts. As to whether it should employ an
          expert that question may come up hereafter and need not be decided now. </p>
        <p> This substitute was rejected. </p>
        <p> The original resolution was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHOUSEN offered a resolution " which was adopted, that the auditor of
          State be requested to inform the Senate of the amount of money drawn from the State
          treasury for the Normal School of Terre Haute, the State University at Bloomington, and
          the Purdue University at Lafayette, during the last year. </p>

          <head rend="center">NEW PROPOSITIONS.</head>
          <p> Bills for acts were introduced, read thy first time and severally referred to
            appropriate committees as follows: </p>
          <p>By Mr. FOWLER, [S. 222] providing that certain misrepresentations in life or fire
            policies shall not affect, the policy or defeat the collection of the claim. </p>
          <p>By Mr. WlLSON, by request,[S. 223] to extend the time for the completion of certain
            unfinished macadamized turn pikes or gravel roads. </p>
          <p>By Mr. GARRIGUS, [S. 224] providing for giving notice by publication to defendants who
            are not residents of the State, in actions pending in the circuit courts and other
            inferior courts in this State, and to cure defects that are believed to exist in notices
            given defendants who are not residents of this State in actions that have heretofore
            been tried and determined in courts of this State.</p>
          <p> By Mr. GRUBBS, [S. 222] giving Justices of the peace jurisdiction in proceedings
            supplementary to executions.</p>
          <p> By Mr. FOSTER, [S. 226] amending section 159 of the general practice act of June,
            1852. so that persons sending claims against laboring men for collection outside of the
            State by attachment or garnishment must swear that the property attached is not exempt
            from execution--the same as if action were brought in this State. </p>
          <p>By Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, [S. 227] to authorise township trustees to transfer money from one
            special fund in their hands to another in certain cases. </p>
          <p>By Mr. POINDEXTER, [S. 228] to suppress intemperance, panperism and crime, and
            providing for the recovery of damages for injuries growing out of the sale, barter or
            giving away of intoxicating liquors--against the party from whom the liquor came and
            that owner of the building having knowledge that liquor can be obtained therein. </p>
          <p>By Mr. GRUBBS, by request, [S. 229] in relation to settlements made by county
            commissioners with county, township or school officers.</p>
          <p>By Mr. VIEHE, [S. 230] enabling married women between eighteen and twenty-one years of
            age to convey real estate when their husbands join with them in the deed, and to
            legalize conveyances heretofore made in that way.</p>
          <p>By Mr. FOWLER, [S. 231,] to amend section 1 of the act of February 7, 1855, providing
            that no justice shall hear or determine any State prosecution for an assault and
            battery, or assault unless the injured party be present or being summoned refuse to
            attend, or when the summons for him is returned " not found " and that
            no trial shall be had in cases of affray, unless a witness thereof be present and
            testify upon such trial, or being summoned, refuses to attend.</p>
          <p>By Mr. MOORE,[S. 232], to amend section 8 of the act regulating and granting divorces,
            by striking therefrom the words " for a period of two years", so the
            failure of the husband to make reasonable provision for his family becomes a just cause
            for granting a divorce to the wife.</p>
          <p> By Mr. BURRELL, [S. 233] to authorize county commissioners to purchase books,
            stationery and other articles for the several county officers for the conduct of public
            business; and providing how claims against counties shall be settled.</p>
          <p>By Mr. VIEHE, [S. 234] to amend section 524 of the general practice act of June,1852,
            so that in proceedings supplementary to execution, if the defendant has transferred his
            property to defraud creditors, the assignee or grantee of the property may be made a
            party and the question of fraud be tried in the proceeding.</p>
          <p>By Mr. Harris, [S. 235] concerning payment of salaries of judges of the Superior
            courts--to be paid in the same manner and at the same time as salaries of judges of the
            Circuit courts.</p>
          <p>By Mr. TRUSLER, by request of the Indiana State Horticulture Society, [S. 236] to amend
            the act for the protection of game, to-wit: It shall be unlawful in any way to kill or
            destroy quail for four years from the taking effect of this act. Nor pheasants from the
            1st day of January to the 1st day of November in each year.</p>
          <p>Pending the second reading of the bill, [S. 88--Mr. Comstock's]to establish a
            Probate Court in each county of this State.</p>
          <p>The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>The reading of bill [S. 88] was finished. A committee report thereon recommending the
            passage of a substitute bill--striking out from the enacting clause and inserting new
            matter, was also read. </p>
          <p>The whole subject was made the special order for next Wednesday at 2 o'clock
            p. m., and 150 copies of the substitute ordered printed.</p>
          <p> The bill [S. 155] [Mr. Grubb's), to prevent carrying concealed weapons, was
            read the second time, with a committee report recommending passage with amendments. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES thought this was taking a serious departure to allow peace officers to <pb n="65" xml:id="VAA8558-17-067"/> carry concealed weapons. It is an open question
            whether they are proper custodians for such privilege. We are likely to establish a very
            dangerous precedent. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS: The trouble is with a construction of the words "on
            duty." Our peace officers now when they go around, do so in violation of law,
            even when in discharge of their duty. The exception ought to be extended to peace
            officers. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES: When are peace officers on duty, if not continuously? They should not have
            a wholesale permission to make walking arsenals of themselves. The law now keeps them
            somewhat in restraint, and the present 'law, as it is, is not strict enough.
            This practice of carrying concealed weapons has sent more men to the penitentiary than
            anything else. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The Senate refused to concur in the committee report--yeas 13, nays 30. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. DICE, the bill was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 119--Mr. Kahlos] to abolish the Superior Court of Cass County, was read
            the second time, with amendments reported by a committee, which were concurred in, and
            the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 192--Mr. Grubbs] amending sec. 468 of the general practice act was read
            the second time with a committee amendment, which was concurred in, and the bill ordered
            engrossed. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 58--Mr. Harris] to work prisoners in jail, was read the second time and
            ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 80--Mr. Kramer's] abolishing town assessors and treasurers, was
            read the second time with a committee report ordering the printing of the bill, which
            was concurred in. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 101--Mr. Sarnighausen] to repeal the act authorizing formation of
            water-works companies, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN: It leaves with a bare majority of the council the power to authorize
            water-works companies. </p>
          <p>The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 174--Mr.Viehe's] to provide for trial of accounts by jury or
            referee, was read the second time with committee amendments, which were concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE: The object is to remedy great evils now existing. The object of the bill is
            not to try all accounts before a referee, but only such accounts as are intricate and
            complicated. Manufacturers' and other difficult accounts are not proper to be
            tried before a jury--they can not deal out justice between man and man. The jury can not
            remember it all. They are frequently composed of men who do not understand bookkeeping
            and accounts. </p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY: This bill is surely in conflict with section 20 of the bill of rights,
            which provides that in all civil cases the right of trial by jury shall remain
            inviolate. This bill deprives citizens of this right. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE: The right of trial by jury did not exist when the constitution was framed,
            and the provision referred to only applies to the class of cases existing at the time of
            the adoption of the organic law. It is only by provision of the statutes that a jury in
            such cases can be had at all. The class of cases referred to by this bill had never been
            tried by jury till after that time. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS: If the bill refers to civil cases, as he believes they are, then it is in
            conflict with the constitutional provision referred to by the senator from Brown [Mr.
            Coffey,] and it is wrong to deprive any citizen of the right of trial by jury. The
            committee's amendments to this bill were certainly not understood by senators
            or the report would not have been concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES favored the passage of the bill. Under the interpretation of the Supreme
            Court, in 27th Indiana, the General Assembly has the right to pass such a measure as
            this. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL urged another objection to this bill. That it permits the jury to take the
            papers and books to its room. The case is presented to a class of twelve judges instead
            of one, which will be productive of much confusion in courts of justice. When this comes
            under the head of class legislation. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored engrossment of the bill. Business men feel the lack of fair
            hearing in the adjustment of intricate accounts in courts of justice where juries take
            such cases. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE: The remedy sought for in this bill is already provided for by the statute.
            This bill ought not to be engrossed. Who is to determine upon the qualifications of the
            special juries referred to in the bill? This provision would cause delay. </p>
          <p>Mr. 0LDS moved to reconsider the vote by which tho committee amendments were concurred
            in. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>This motion was rejected on a division--affirmative 12, negative 16--and the question
            recurring on ordering the bill engrossed for a third reading--</p>
          <p>Messrs. OLDS and MENZIES demanded the yeas and nays: Pending which several motions to

        <p> The session was opened with prayer by Rev. A. Bessonies, of St. John's Catholic

        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS the readier of Saturday's minutes were dispensed
          with.</p>
        <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, from the special committee to which was referred a special message
          from his excellency, the governor, recommending the sale of University park in the city of
          Indianapolis, being the square bounded by Meridian, New Yorks, Pennsylvania and Vermont
          streets, and appropriating the proceeds thereof to the support of the Indiana State
          University, in lieu of the usual appropriation from the general state treasury, reported
          as the opinion of the committee, that at the present time it is inexpedient either to sell
          or authorize the sale of said parcel of ground. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the report was concurred in. </p>
        <p>Several reports from committees returning Senate bills were submitted and placed on the
          files without reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. F0STER offered the following: </p>
        <floatingText>
          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p>Resolved, That a committee of three senators be appointed by the president of the
                Senate instanter, whose duty it shall be to repair immediately to the office of the
                Journal Printing company, in this city, to ascertain the amount of printing done by
                order of the Senate the present session, and the cost thereof, and report the same
                to this body as soon as such information can be obtained. </p>

          </body>

        <p>Mr. HARRIS desired the author to explain the intent of the resolution. This printing is
          being done by the Journal company under a contract with the printing bureau. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER was satisfied the Senate was having entirely too much printing done, and that
          when senators were informed of the amount of printing ordered and its cost they will be
          astonished. There can certainly be nothing wrong in ascertaining the amount of work
          ordered and the probable cost, and having it brought to the attention of the Senate. </p>
        <p>The resolution was adopted. </p>
        <p>Subsequently the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made the committee to consist of Messrs. Foster,
          Woollen and Dice.</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR again laid before the Senate the communication from the
            governor, printed in these reports Saturday, nominating as trustees of the State normal
            school, Timothy Nicholson, till December 20, 1879; John T. Scott of Vigo, and Murray
            Briggs of Sullivan, till December 20,1881; and, </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, these nominations were confirmed by the Senate. </p>
          <p>The bill, [S. 163--Mr. Ragan's] election inspectors shall be appointed from
            the party in the majority at the last previous election for secretary of state, was read
            the second time and ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill, [S. 45--Mr. Peterson's] allowing township trustees to levy a tax for
            a fund that has been used for another, was read the third time with a committee report
            recommending indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT moved to refer it to the <orgName>committee on corporations</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Pending which came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>The Senate bills, on the subject of interest. were returned from the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName> with a substitute for all, making the legal rate of interest six
            per cent; on written contracts eight per cent: renewals of existing contracts may be
            made at the rate originally agreed upon. This subject was made a special order for
            Thursday, at 2 p. m., and 200 copies were ordered printed. </p>
          <p>The Senate returned to the consideration of the bill [S. 45] pending at the time of the
            noon recess. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the bill goes too far in providing that the sureties may be released
            from their bond. This bill only applies to cases where confusion already exists--it is
            retrospective, and not prospective. Some remedy of this kind ought to be adopted, and
            the purport of this bill is right. The safest course usually is to follow the
            recommendations of committees, but in this case, possibly the provisions of the bill
            were not properly understood by the committee which considered it. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER favored the adoption of the committee report, and approved the pending
            motion [Mr. Kent's ] The township trustee has now too much power, and this
            bill, for a special act, goes too far--one should look well to the future in the making
            of laws, and be exceedingly careful how powers are extended in any direction. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL: When we come to legalizing acts the Supreme court has decided are not
            legal, we are resolving ourselves into a court; and that is what this bill proposes to
            do. Whenever the trustee converts the school fund in any other direction, he should
            suffer for that illegal act by which he wrongs the tax-payer. When a levy is made
            according to law, the tax-payer should rest assured that the fund will not be converted,
            and then the Legislature steps in and legalizes the unlawful act of the trustee. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE: This is not a bill to enlarge the powers of the school trustees. It is a bill
            to legalize what trustees in townships all over the State have been doing, and no harm
            has come of it except in this case in Montgomery county, which this bill would relieve.
            It is a hardship to that trustee, and the bill, while relieving that man, would work a
            hardship to no one. This case appeals to the equity of every man. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER could see no injustice in voting for a recommitment of this bill, which Is
            only intended to meet the one particular case referred to, or to similar ones. And the
            only remedy is in the passage of such a bill by the General Assembly. The courts can not
            do that trustee justice, because they have to decide according to law; and, while it is
            admitted that he acted illegally, yet by passing this relief for him no one can be
            wronged. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK doubted not but that this bill has been carefully considered by the
            committee recommending its indefinite postponement. It may be true, in this instance, no
            great harm may be done by the passage of the fill, but it would be setting a very
            dangerous precedent, and might lead many a one hereafter to act unlawfully, in the hope
            that this precedent would be followed and he be relieved from harm. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER believed there are some merits in this bill, and thought it ought to be
            recommitted. If there is any really good thing in this bill it ought not to fail. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS also believed there are merits in this bill. Many of the 1,000 trustees in
            the State can not be supposed to know the volumes of law enacted for their government.
            They act more on the principle of strict equity, where there are doubtful provisions in
            the statute. It is a common custom for them to overdraw from certain friends till
            another levy and collection was made, and Boards of commissioners have advised and
            consented to such acts. This bill ought to be recommitted for more careful
            consideration. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS: If this bill is proper, pass it; if not, concur in the report of the
            committee. Every citizen should obey the laws. It would be strange, indeed, if
            trespassers of the law should all come up to the Legislature for relief from their
            violation of the law. There is no good reason why officers should not comply with the
            laws as well as every other citizen. Officers should not go forward in vio1ation of law,
            and then hope some future Legislature will legalize their illegal acts. It is setting a
            bad precedent--saying to these officers in effect," you can act according to
            your own discretion." </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion to recommit was agreed, to by yeas 28, nays 15.</p>
          <pb n="74" xml:id="VAA8558-17-076"/>

          <p>The bill [S. 71-Mr. Leeper's] authorizing justices to require additional
            replevin bail where insufficient, was read a second time, with a committe report
            recommending passage. The report was concurred in and the bill ordered engrossed for a
            third riding. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. l05--Mr. Fowler's] requiring vendors who desire to retain a lien
            on real estate to take a mortgage, was read a second time, with a committee report
            recommending indefinite postponement. </p>

          <p>Mr. FOWLER did not believe the committee report should be concurred in.
            Vendor's liens should be abolished, and those desiring to retain a lien should
            do so by mortgages, and these mortgages should be recorded as others are. The almost
            absolute necessity of this bill is known to every lawyer. He hoped the report of the
            committee would be rejected.</p>

          <p>Mr. LANGDON favored concurrence in the report. This is a proposition to legislate upon
            a subject now well understood. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE, the bill and report was referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>. </p>


          <p>The bill [S. 117--Mr. Briscoe's] to abolish the criminal court of Allen
            county, was read the second time with a committee report recommending indefinite
            postponement. On his motion, it was referred to the <orgName>Committee on the
              Organization of Courts</orgName>.</p>

          <p>Mr. FOSTER, from the special committee appointed this morning to ascertain the cost of
            printing already ordered by the Senate, reported that 17 bills have been printed at a
            cost of $92.50; the cost of printing 200 copies of the rules of the Senate and 175
            copies of the calendar is $75.16, making the total cost of printing $167.96. He thought
            it unnecessary to enter into any discussion of this subject, for every senator could see
            an unnecessary amount of printing is being done under the resolution adopted four or
            five days ago. Already ninety odd dollars have been expended in printing bill alone. He
            would like to have the resolution authorizing the printing of bills reconsidered.</p>

          <p>Mr. HARRIS objected to interference with the regular order. He moved the report be
            received and the committee discharged. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

          <p> The bill [S. 124--Mr. Smith's] defining jurisdiction of justices and mayors
            was read the second time with a committee report recommending its indefinite
            postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. SMITH: Now our circuit courts have jurisdiction of small cases and the object of
            the bill is to give justices and mayors of towns and cities exclusive jurisdiction of
            trivial cases. It would save a large expense to the State and much time to the people,
            who could then attend the trials of small cases in their own townships. There never was
            a litigant who carried a very small case to the circuit court without involving both
            parties in greater expense than the amount first sued for. This measure is greatly
            desired by his constituency. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE: The committee take a different view. Trials before Justices generally result
            in two trials, and instead of saving expenses it piles it up greater than if the suit
            was commenced in the Circuit Court. If these cases are confined to Justices of the Peace
            it will be a Virtual denial of Justice in many instances. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped the bill would be recommitted for more careful consideration. There
            is as much substantial justice obtained before Justices of the Peace as anywhere. If
            Justices are given exclusive jurisdiction in little cases, you will get rid of much
            expense. He moved the recommittal of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS thought it useless to recommit without instructions, because the committee
            would make the sane report they made before. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought this bill need not be referred to any committee. Those in favor of

          <p>Mr. HARRIS: A similar bill was passed the Senate two years ago, prepared by the Senator
            from Marshal, [Mr. Reeve] at the instance of the superintendent of public instruction,
            but failed to become a law for want of time to pass the other branch of the General

          <p>The report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 158--Mr. Harris'] removing legal disabilities from married women,

          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p> Whereas, The public burdens have become so onerous that, retrenchment and economy
                are necessary in every branch of the public service; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, the belief is widespread in this State that the expense of education is
                too great, and that the public schools and the revenue set apart and created for
                their support are being managed and operated in conflict with the constitution of
                the State, and at variance with the wishes of the people, and that great abuses have
                grown and become a part of our system of education; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, Expending public revenue for establishing and maintaining what are known
                as "high schools," and the further maintaining of colleges and
                universities, is a violation of the constitution; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, The present laws of this State foster the abuses aforesaid, and have been
                interpreted and executed to that end; therefore, be it </p>
              <p>Resolved, That every effort should be made to keep taxation for common school
                purposes, and the use of the common school fund of the State, within the limits
                defined by the letter and spirit of the constitution of the State. </p>
              <p>Resolved, That the committee on education be and are hereby instructed to report,
                at their earliest convenience, a bill revising our school laws, prohibiting the
                expenditure of school funds and revenue for any other than common schools;
                prohibiting frequent changes in text books putting a limit to and a check upon the
                extravagance of township trustees and school boards in erecting costly school
                houses, and filling them frequently with expensive and unnecessary furniture, and
                repealing all law by which any college or university within this State draws money
                from the public treasury. </p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN offered the following as supplementary to the above:</p>
        <floatingText>
          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p> Resolved, That the State superintendent of public instruction is hereby requested
                to furnish at his earliest convenience, to the Senate, a statement as to what extent
                the local school levies, now authorized by law, can be reduced without injury to the
                public schools of the State. </p>
            </div>
          </body>
        </floatingText>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES: Only 3 or 4 in the high schools, out of classes of 50 or 60, usually
          graduate, and they generally all apply for teachers' license; in other words, the
          State is called upon to keep up schools for the manufacture of teachers. The State might
          as well educate lawyers, doctors, or blacksmiths. At the Purdue University they educate
          pupils to be farmers--to learn how to plough, and raise shanghai chickens. Are we to
          misappropriate funds of the people in this way? Let us meet these evils bodily and not
          shirk the issue. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD: If the resolution means to reduce a just and necessary expenditure, he should
          oppose it, as a friend to education. So much under our theory of government depends upon
          education--our government could not exist one day but for a good system of education--is
          it not just to qualify people in this State to teach the common schools? </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON was glad to see the gentlemen ta&amp;e so lively an interest in this old
          question; they will have abundant opportunity before the close of the session to
          ventiliate the question of appropriating money to the cause of higher education, and we
          can settle it without frittering away the morning hour on a resolution like this. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN assured senators this resolution shall not die in the committee room,
          and that it shall receive the most careful consideration at the hands of the committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE insisted this resolution should be <pb n="77" xml:id="VAA8558-17-079"/>
          ' acted upon now. It suggests to the Senate where we shall stop in the matter of
          education. When the State provides a common school education for the children of the
          State, she has done her whole duty. She can not furnish education for all the trades, and
          she ought not to educate either farmers, lawyers or teachers. There is no branch of the
          public service hears so onerously on the people of the State as the expenses for education
          The annual appropriations to the higher schools ought not to be made. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: The <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> is organized to aid the Senate
          to reach ajust conclusion in the consideration of matters relating to the subject of
          education. If this resolution is adopted it commits the Senate to a proposition of very
          grave importance, which would be attended with disadvantage, but its reference to the
          committee can be productive of no harm. He favored the proceeding motion.</p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM knew that every year for many sessions these higher institutions of
          learning come in here asking for appropriations for the education of a privileged few in
          one of the high schools, to his knowledge, $900 a year is paid to a fiddler. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored the State giving the best possible education to the whole people,
          but it is improper to do for the few what can not be done for the many. The State can not
          give a college education to all, therefore he favored the principle embodied in the
          resolution. He hoped the committee would not throw it. aside as impracticable, but give to
          it careful consideration. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. LANGDON, the resolutions were referred to the <orgName>committee on
            education</orgName>. </p>

          <p>The bill [S. 13--Mr. Wood's] authorizing guardians to settle the estate of

        <p>The SPEAKER called the House to order, and announced prayers by the representative from
          Washington county (Mr. MITCHELL.) </p>
        <p>The reading of the journal was ordered, add the clerk proceeded to read until-- </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. LEHMAN the further reading was disposed with.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER called for reports from committees, which were submitted on the following
          described hills,the recommendations being concurred in by the House unless otherwise
          stated:</p>
        <p> On Mr. Tulley's bill, [H. R. 227] to repeal the act for the protection of fish,
          recommending that it lie on the table. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Schwitzer's bill, [H. R. 219] to repeal an act for the protection of
          fish, recommending that it lie on the table. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Edwin's bill, [H. R. 19] for the protection of fish, recommending that it
          lie on the table. </p>
        <p>On Mr Dalton's bill, [H. R. 17] to repeal the act for the construction of
          railroads by counties and townships ;, with an amendment recommending its passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS and Mr. SHANKS submitted further amendments. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, the bill was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Edwin's bill, [H. R. 214] to regulate passenger fare on railroads, with
          an amendment striking out the emergency clause, and recommending passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart counseled carefulness in voting concurrence in such committee
          reports, as the effect was the amending of the bill. 0n his motion the bill was ordered
          engrossed for the 3d reading. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Davidson's bill, [H. R. 62] for the organization of county boards, with a
          recommendation of indefinite postponement </p>
        <p>On Mr. Copeland's bill [H. R. 287] to abridge the duties of county
          superintendent, with the recommendation that it be referred to the <orgName>committee on
            education</orgName>. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Mitchell's bill [H. R. 313] to provide for a more speedy way of listing
          personal property, with the recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Baker's bill [H. R. 41] to repeal an act regarding eligibility to office
          of township trustee, recommending its passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER explaining that the object of the bill was to legalize the election of last
          April. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, thought the bill transcended the power of this Legislature. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER read from page 79 of the acts of the special session of 1877, the act that
          this bill proposed to repeal. He was opposed to the repeal of this law, and declared that
          there was never a better law on the subject. The principal business of the trustee was to
          levy taxes, and he could so manipulate matters as to hold on to his office for a longer
          time than was profitable to the tax-payer. It was for that reason that the law of two
          years ago was passed. The trustee would go out of office by statute limitation. He was
          opposed to concurring in the report of the committee, and on his motion it was laid on the
          table. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN offered an amendment, which was adopted, to strike out the first section. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS make an ineffectual motion to lay the bill on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH said that the motion to strike out the first section strikes out the enacting
          clause, and has the effect to destroy the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. VANPELT and Mr. CALDWELL thought the bill of sufficient importance to merit the
          consideration of the House, and hoped it might come up yet in some shape. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORN, of Elkhart, said the bill was gone from the action of the House, and on his
          motion It was indefinitely postponed. </p>
        <p>On Mr. Edwin's bill [H. R.213] to authorize sheriff's to administer
          oaths, with a substitute therefor [H. R. 364] authorizing sheriffs to administer oaths in
          all matters pertaining to the duties of their office. The bill was read the first time and
          passed to the second reading. </p>
        <p>The <orgName>Judiciary Committee </orgName>in answer to a resolution heretofore passed
          the House reported, that in the absence of any law compelling county officials to furnish
          the necessary information it is impossible for the committee to determine the expense of
          the judicial system. It would be inexpedient to limit the right of appeal from justices.
          The business of the State does not require the enlargement of the judicial circuits. Some
          parts of the State the circuits are already too large. It would neither be judicious nor
          economical to increase the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace or enlarge judicial
          circuits. </p>
        <p>The report was accepted, and laid on the table. </p>
        <p>The committee also returned the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_340">[H. R. 340--Mr.
            Humphrey's]</ref>for legislative apportionment, recommending passage with
          sundry amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK submitted a minority report recommending that the bill lie on the table.
          He thought the committee was all along disposed to be fair in this matter, but the
          Republican members of the committee felt compelled to present a minority report, because
          the counties of Lagrange and Steuben get by this bill but one representative, while such
          counties as Perry, Owen, Pike and Lake each get a representative, no one of which <pb n="79" xml:id="VAA8558-17-081"/> counties have a population equal to either Lagrange or
          Steuben. In the second place the proposed senatorial districts are formed in such a manner
          as till at the strong Democratic counties which helped to elect senators last fall will be
          allowed to vote together again at the next election. And then again in the manner in which
          their floats are distributed to bear down the Republican majority in Marion county. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON, in order that members may have time to consider this bill, moved it be made
          the special order for Tuesday next at 2 o'clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS stated that the Republican have a larger representation in this bill than
          the Democrats, so far as members are concerned. When the vote was put in the committee
          room last night there was not a dissenting voice. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER cited figures which made him think this does not look like a fail-bill. He
          would like to see it considered in committee of the Whole House, and made that motion. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON accepted the amendment. He wanted only a fair apportionment--the districts to
          be contiguous and giving a fair representation to the minority. There can be but two great
          political parties, and they are the means through which the people express themselves. He
          insisted on a fair representation without reference to party. Wherever a district is
          formed in which a nomination is equivalent to an election, you wink at corruption. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS moved to make this subject the special order for 10 o'clock
          Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. CALDWELL said the excitement over this bill has grown up since the adjournment of the
          committee last night. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS was a member of the committee. There seemed to be a show of fairness in the
          committee room, and he did not propose to condemn their action. The Republican members of
          the committee were nearly all from one portion of the State, and did not know as well as
          they should about other portions of the State. He desired further time to consider the
          provisions of this bill. </p>
        <p>The motion (Mr. Humphrey's] was agreed to. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. COMPTON his bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_007">[H. R. 7]</ref>
          regulating the working of coal mines way ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. ALLEN the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_015">[H. R. 15--Mr.
            Lehman's]</ref> legalizing Edinburgh town elections was ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DRAKE the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_015">[H. R. 15--Mr.
            Reed's] </ref>concerning cemeteries was ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock p. m, </p>

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p>The SPEAKER proceeded with the call by counties for the introduction of bills,
            resolutions, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. CALDWELL offered a resolution, which was adopted, for a joint convention of the two
            houses, on February Sat 10 o'clock a. m., for the election of a librarian and
            directors of the State prisons north and south. </p>
          <p>By Mr. CAMPBELL, H. R. 365] to protect public highways and ditches from animals running
            at large. </p>
          <p>By Mr. HART, [H. R. 366] to reduce the salaries of members of the General Assembly to
            $4 per day. </p>
          <p>Mr. DONNELL [H. R. 367] to limit the number and increase the jurisdiction of justices
            of the peace. </p>
          <p>By Mr. MARCH, a resolution, which was adopted, that the Superintendent of Public
            Instruction be requested to report to this House to what extent, if any, the rate of
            taxation for school purposes in the local levies can be reduced without injury to the
            efficiency of the common schools. </p>
          <p>By Mr CAREY, [H. R. 368] for the relief of George M. Winchell and other sureties of
            Jos, D. Bearley, a defaulting trustee. </p>
          <p>By Mr. HUMPHREY, [H. R. 369] to amend section 5 of an act to provide for a uniform
            assessment of property. Also [H. R. 376] to repeal an act, amending section 316 of the
            general practice act. </p>
          <p>By Mr. HANDY, [H. R. 371] creating the Forty-third Judicial Circuit. </p>
          <p>By Mr. CUNNINGHAM, [H. R. 372 ] to repeal section 1 of an act to amend section 3 of an

            animals. </p>
          <p>By Mr. OVERMEYER, [H. R. 374] to amend section 2 of an act in relation to county
            auditors, approved May 31, 1852. </p>
          <p>By Mr. OVERMEYER, [H. R. 375] concerning parties to actions.</p>
          <p> By Mr TAYLOR,of Legrange, [H. R. 376] for an act defining certain misdemeanors. </p>
          <p>By Mr. EDWINS, [H. R. 377] to regulate the practice of medicine. </p>
          <p>By Mr. GORDON, [H. R. 378] supplemental to an act defining misdemeanors. Also, a
            resolution that the Committee on Ways and Means report a bill exempting property of
            unmarried women of the age of 21 years from taxation. He said the principle in this
            resolution was identical with the principle that precipitated the war of the
            revolution.</p>

          <p>Mr. SLEETH referred to the resolution as unconstitutional, and while willing to be as
            gallant as the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Gordon], he was not willing to sacrifice his
            conscientious scruples on the alter of gallantry. Such a provision can only be enacted
            after amendment of the organic law. </p>

          <p>Mr. GORDON. The constitution can be so amended and if the object desired cannot be
            otherwise attained be should favor amendment of the constitution. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to amend by instructing the committee to report a bill conferring
            the right of suffrage. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON accepted the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY moved to lay the resolution on the table. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas 44, nays 42. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT offered a resolution instructing the <orgName>Committee on
              elections</orgName> to inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill conferring the
            right of suffrage upon unmarried women owning real estate subject to taxation. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS made an ineffectual motion to strike out the word
            "unmarried." </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH was willing to vote for instruction to the committee as to the propriety of
            extending to all women the right of suffrage. He did not want to discriminate against
            unmarried women. A woman should not be disfranchised because she may be either married
            or unmarried. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT desired the sense of the House as to whether it was willing to grant the
            right of suffrage to women who are tax-payers. </p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY moved to lay the resolution on the table. </p>
          <p>The yeas and nays being demanded and taken resulted--yeas 42, nays 46. </p>

                the amount of salaries, fees, emoluments and perquisites received by them during the
                year 1878. In reply I have the honor to say that a similar resolution was passed by
                the House, and in compliance with same blanks were prepared by my predecessor and
                forwarded to the county officers to eligible them to make the desired reports, and
                this office is now daily in receipt of the replies in compliance with the resolution
                of the House. These reports will be compiled and permitted to the House by the 10th
                of February, the time mentioned in the resolution. I suppose the desired information
                will be furnished the Senate by the <orgName>committee on fees and
                  salaries</orgName> of the House, and the expense of duplicating the same
                information be saved to the State. If this response is not entirely satisfactory I
                await your further order and will readily comply.</p>

              <p>Dear Sir--In reply to a resolution of the Senate, requesting this office to give a
                statement for the information of the Senate of all the moneys drawn from the State
                treasury by the State University, State Normal school, and Purdue university, for
                the year 1878, I have the honor to say that in response to a resolution of the
                House, a statement was prepared in this office by my predecessor, giving an exhibit
                in detail of the amount of moneys drawn from the State treasury by the foregoing
                institutions for the last four years, and I take pleasure in herewith transmitting
                to you a printed copy of the statements.</p>
              <closer>
                <salute> Very respectfully, </salute>

        <p>The statement sets forth that during the years 1875,1876, 1877, and 1878, there was drawn
          from the State treasury by the State University the sum of $121,738,00. The total amount
          drawn from the State treasury by Purdue University during the same time was $33,235.42.
          The amount drawn from the State treasury by the State Normal school for four years ending
          October 31,1878, was $98,291.85. </p>
        <p>The lieutenant governor also laid before the Senate a communication from Patrick H.
          Jameson, president of the board of benevolent Institutions, transmitting itemized
          statements of receipts and expenditures of the incidental funds. At the insane hospital
          the receipts for the two fiscal years ending October 31,1878,from the sales of hides,
          tallow and other products was $8,852.01, and the disbursements from the Incidental fund
          for the same time amounted to $14,010.91. </p>
        <p>At the Institution for the deaf and dumb the disbursements on account of incidental
          expenses for the year ending October 31, 1877, amounted to $7,502.63. and for the year
          ending October 31,1878, $5,256.66--all drawn from the state treasury, </p>
        <p>"The statement of Wm H. Churchman, superintendent of the Institute for the
          Blind, settling for the Items of the incidental expenses of said institution,"
          covers over fifty pages of legal cap size paper, finely written, but is not footed up,
          neither in total nor on any one of the pages, </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. Fowler, chairman of the <pb n="82" xml:id="VAA8558-17-084"/><orgName>
            committee on Benevolent and Reformatory Institutions</orgName>, these reports were
          referred to that committee without reading. </p>
        <p>And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock p. m.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

          <p>the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour being the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_080">[S. 80--Mr. Kramer's]</ref> abolishing the office
            of assessor and treasurer in cities and towns, on the second reading.</p>
          <p>Mr. DICE agreed with the main features of this bill, but it will be a hardship for men
            paid in towns to have to go in the county seat to get the money on their warrants. He
            moved to amend by striking out section 2, which would obviate this objection.</p>

          <p>Mr. VIEHE: If the second section be stricken out, the third section would have to be
            amended in order to make the bill consistent. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE modified his amendment, so as to strike out both sections 2 and 3. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON thought all the sections of this bill should be stricken out. Under the
            present law towns may either have an assessor of their own, or adopt the assessment made
            by the township assessor. He also urged the objection referred to by the senator from
            Fountain [Mr. Dice.] </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER insisted senators did not, understand the provisions of his bill. It
            proposes simply to do away with two or three offices that are entirely unnecessary. Then
            the people ought to elect, the town marshal, as provided for, in this bill, instead of
            allowing that officer to be chosen by the trustees, as is now the case. In his county
            this bill would save to the tax-payers annually some $400 or $500, and in large counties
            there would be a much greater saving. </p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS was against the whole bill. It is the intent and spirit of our law to make
            our corporations distinct and separate--a sovereignty within a sovereignty--which is the
            right principle of government; and they should be allowed to manage their own affairs in
            their own way. This bill is also objectionable because it would ten to complicate
            matters--and the affairs of county treasurers are sufficiently complicated now, without
            further burdening them with the finances of towns and cities.</p>


          <p>Mr. REEVE opposed the bill because wholly impracticable. It would tear down without
            making reparation. For the purpose of cheapening the administrations of town or city
            government it would leave an entire irresponsibility, and even then defeat the object it
            is intended to accomplish. The town authorities have no control, of the remotest
            character, over the county treasurer. Every provision except the election of marshal and
            the abolishment of treasurer may be had under existing laws.</p>

          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN thought this bill not wholly bad. A substitute embodying the provisions of
            the first section would be an excellent one, and save much money to the several towns
            and cities of the state.</p>
          <p>Mr. DICE believed there are several good provisions in this bill and with his
            amendments it ought to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS--Indianapolis has a city duplicate of fifty million of dollars. He was not
            prepared to say this city desired the office of assessor abolished, but the people
            desire a bill prepared to relieve tax payers; and he would like to see the bill
            recommitted that Senators might consider how it may be perfected. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER thought, there were good features in this bill, but the County Treasurer and
            assessor should not control the revenue of such a city as Indianapolis. He also would
            like to see the bill recommitted, and made that motion. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER opposed the bill--if cities bt stricken from it towns should be also. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS objected so committing the bill. The Senate can as well determine its action
            now as at any other time.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
            its operation the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was rejected by 16, nays 33,
            and the motion to recommit to the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
              Business</orgName> was agreed to.</p>
          <p>The bill [S. 88--a substitute for Mr. Comstock's] to provide for the
            appointment [by the circuit judge of each county] of a Probate Commissioner, and for the
            more speedy settlement of decedents' estates, being also a special order for
            this afternoon. Coming up on the second reading--</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE considered this bill more important than any other one proposition that will
            come before the General Assembly. There are 4600 estates and guardianships that have not
            received proper attention for years in the district he comes from. The bill provides
            this commissioner shall be similar in many respects to surrogates in States that have
            that official. The bill will produce immense benefits to the masses of the people at a
            trifling expense. After careful consideration senators must conclude this bill to be a
            necessity for the protection of estates and the interested minors and wards, in view of
            the accumulation of that class of business in a State with as large a population as
            this.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE moved to amend section 3 by striking out the world
            "freeholder" where referring to the qualifications of the
            commissioner.</p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS regarded the 4th section as empowering this commissioner to be a smelling
            committee of one; and, as far as he had examined the bill it had not impressed him very
            favorably. To give time for further examination, he moved to postpone the consideration
            of the bill till Monday next at 2 o' clock p.m.</p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER regarded it absolutely unnecessary to make some change in the management of
            probate business, which now gets very little attention compared with what it ought to
            have. He had read the substitute carefully, and could not see any merit in it, or, at
            least, could see nothing that can not be attained by existing laws. He moved its
            indefinite postponement.</p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK learning that majority of his constituents are opposed to a probate court,
            readily consented to the committee , reporting this constitute. Where districts desire a
            probate commission it is nothing more than right they should have one, consequently he
            should vote against the pending motion to indefinitely postpone, and for the bill at the
            proper time.</p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL thought there were merits in this bill. If there is one thing above another
            the people want, it is that probate business shall be speedily transacted, that is shall
            be closed up before bondsman die or become insolvent and thus endanger estates and the
            interests of minors and wards. This bill ought not to be indefinitely postponed. If the
            people need this bill we ought to give it to them.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER did not think this substitute would meet the demands of the majority of the
            people of the State, nor the people of his district, because it will not aid judges in
            the dispatch of probate business. The people want and demand the passage of a law <pb n="83" xml:id="VAA8558-17-085"/> creating a probate court with sufficient civil
            jurisdiction to command some considerable legal talent on its bench. This proposition to
            appoint a general roust-a-bout in each county under the direction of the district judge
            will not satisfy the people. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS did not think a man would be found fit to take a place on a probate bench
            for less than $1,500, a year, and the cost to the State of a Probate Courts would be
            from $100,000 to $150,000 annually; an expense too great to enter into in these times.
            Estates of widows and orphans, it is said, are being frittered away in many districts in
            this State, and for this reason he was willing to vote for this bill. We can not abolish
            circuit courts because those judges are judicial officers under the Constitution. This
            bill makes no charge upon the State. The pay of the Commissioner will come out of the
            county wanting such an officer; and while such a bill is not needed in his county, it
            might be very acceptable to many other counties in the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. Hefron while recognizing the necessity for some legislation in this direction, he
            failed to see where this bill would relieve in the least degree the labors of the judge.
            It creates an officer at considerable expense with no benefit to the tax-payer, </p>
          <p>Mr. Foster demanded the previous question, Which was seconded by the Senate, and under
            its operation the bill was indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>The SPEAKER called the House to order. Prayer by Representative Davis of Boone
          county.</p>
        <p> The journal was being read, when--</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. LINDLEY, the further reading was dispensed with.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER then called for reports from committees.</p>
        <p> Mr. BRIGGS, from the committee on the organization of courts, returned Mr.
          Stucker's bill [H. R. 198] reducing the jurisdiction of the circuit court and in
          creasing that of justices of the peace. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. GORDON the bill was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R.76--Mr. Lehman's] to amend the justice act with a recommendation
          with the amendments submitted, the bill do pass. The amendments of the committee were
          concurred in, and the bill ordered to the engrossment. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS explaining that under the law as it now stood, cases may be taken from one
          justice to another. The object of his bill was to limit parties to but one change. The
          amendment was simply to strike out two changes and make but one. </p>

        <p>MR. LINDLEY'S bill [H. R. 169,] giving justices of the peace jurisdiction over
          all defendants in any suit upon a promissory note was returned with a recommendation that
          it lie on the table. </p>
        <p>MR. L1NDLEY said the bill was introduced for the purpose of obviating the trouble
          incident to collections by suit instituted before justices of the peace. It not
          unfrequently occurs that the principle on a promissory note resides on one side of a
          county or township line, while the surety resides on the other side of the line, in
          another township or county, and in such cases the payee of such note is put to a good deal
          of trouble, inconvenience and expense, in order to procure service upon all the defendants
          and the collection of a just claim. The purpose of the bill is to provide in such cases
          the justice before whom suit is instituted having jurisdiction over the principal
          defendants shall also have jurisdiction over other defendants in such suit, and may send
          his constable across such county or township line to procure service upon other sureties.
          The bill is so fair and just that, had the committee carried out the instructions of the
          House to notify the author of a bill when the same would be considered by them. he would
          have had little difficulty in prevailing upon the committee to make a favorable report. </p>
        <p>Mr. Shields' bill [H. R. 80] to amend section 20 of the general practice act of
          June, 1852; that it lie on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS, explaining the provisions of the bill, said that it simply doubled the time
          for stays on execution.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHIELDS said the bill provides for doubling the time now fixed by law for the stay
          of executions on judgments. He had been induced to withdraw the bill in order that the
          mass of the people who had been impoverished by class legislation should find some relief
          from the financial crisis which now threatened their utter and irretrievable ruin. He
          hoped the bill would not be laid on the table, but that it would go upon the files, and
          receive from this body that candid consideration to which the importance of the question
          involved in its provisions entitled it. He knew the people were de,anding relief, and that
          they would be much disappointed to find that their representatives here were indifferent
          to their welfare. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD said the report should be concurred in. He thought if this bill should become a
          law it would work against the laboring man, he was opposed to giving any longer stay on
          execution. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS thought to extend the stay on executions would certainly be to the interest of
          the man who earned his bread by the sweat of his brow. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD insisted that the State should give all the relief possible to the debtor
          class. </p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY thought the indications were very plain that it was the intention of this House
          to reduce the rate of interest from 10 to 6 per cent. When money loaned a few years ago
          shall have to be collected by execution and sale, it will then work hard against the
          laboring man. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS did not think this was the proper way to get at the remedy sought for. The
          proper course would be to pass a law exempting a reasonable amount of the property from
          sale on execution. The stay should not be extended. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON would go as far as any one for the relief of that class of our citizens who
          are burdened with debt. He did not think the House should take any action on the matter
          now. </p>
        <p>Mr. MITCHELL was as much interested in the laboring class as any one, and for that reason
          he was favorable to extending the time for stays of execution. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER: If the stay on execution was necessary it should have been provided for by
          law some time ago. The necessity for it, if there ever was one, is gone by. Why come in
          now and pass such a law? What man can be induced to loan his money if you allow judgments
          to be stayed for 865 days? Six months was long enough. By the passage of such an act you
          would drive loaning capital out of the State. </p>
        <p>Mr.TAYLOR, of Daviess, thought that the laboring class known as farmers--of which he was
          one--were not asking for this kind of a law. He thought the law as it stands now was good
          enough, and he would rather vote for <pb n="84" xml:id="VAA8558-17-086"/> the abolition of
          all laws for the collection of debt than to vote to extend the time for the stay of
          execution as indicated in this bill</p>


        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart--Ninteen twentieths of our population are debtors and creditors.
          The law as it now stands have given satisfaction. It goes far enough for the man who loans
          his money. He thought the law ought to stand as it is. Permanence in law is what will
          benefit the people most.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREY was in favor of the law and opposed to the report of the committee. He
          therefore moved to lay the report of the committee on the table and asked for the yeas and
          nays--which being taken resulted--yeas 25, nays 64--so the motion was rejected.</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. HEROD the report of the committee was concurred in, and so the bill
          lies on the table.</p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 23] to create the Forty-third Judicial Circuit, was indefinitely
          postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said: As he did not feel very well, and inasmuch as there was about to be
          enacted a terrible tragedy on this square [referring to the hanging of Merrick and Achey],
          he moved that the House do now adjourn.</p>
        <p>According, the House took a recess until 2 o' clock.</p>

          <p>On Mr. OVERMEYER' bill [H. R. 13] to amend section 172 of an act prescribing
            the manner of impanelling petit jurors--with amendments.</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER explaining said it simply reduces the number of jurors in the circuit,
            criminal and superior courts from 12 to 6. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS cited the 20th section of article 1 of the constitution, " In all
            civil cases the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.".He insisted
            this matter should be carefully investigated.</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER did not believe that after we had enacted such a law the supreme court
            would every say that the Legislation had not right to decide how many men should
            constitute a jury. The expense of our judicial system is more than it should be. If you
            reduce the number of jurors to 6 in every case, you save $200,000 a year to the people.
            Six jurymen can try a case as well as 12.</p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON (interrupting): If it is economy you are after solely, give but one
            juryman.</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER (continuing): Let us concur in the report, order the bill engrossed, and
            if the House think best, then we can pass it.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS: When the framers of our courts said the General Assembly may modify or
            abolish the grand jury system, they did not intend we should reduce the number of petit
            jurors, or they would have said so. Ever since man was put upon trial for his life, 12
            men have constituted a jury.</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH regarded this as one of the most important measures that will come before
            this legislature, and was willing it shall lie upon the table that members may have an
            opportunity to examine it. Since the adoption of our constitution, and for 1,000 years
            before, juries have been composed of twelve men. He insisted where the word "jury"
            occurs in the constitution it mean 12 men. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, would favor changing the number of jurors in certain cases.
            Civil cases might as well be tried by 6 jurors, and it is in the power of the
            Legislature to make such a provision.</p>
          <p>The Supreme Court has decided that a criminal jury can not be composed of less than 12
            men. No criminal can be denied his right of trial by jury of 12 men.</p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH had a great respect for the Constitution, but no respect for the divinity of
            numbers. On his motion the bill was referred to the <orgName>Judicial
              Committee</orgName></p>

            that it pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. COMPTON explained: It provides that street railways may be run on streets or public
            roads by first getting permission of the county commissioners on such terms as they may
            agree.</p>
          <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>On Mr. Mitchell' bill [H. R. 46] to amend section 1 of the township election

          <p>On Mr. Garroutte' bill [H. R. 138] requiring township trustees to appropriate
            any surplus funds now on hand to the benefit of the road fund, that the bill so
            pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. GARROUTTE said: The object of the bill is to transfer the surplus township fund now
            on hand in the hands of township trustees to the road fund and to be used for that
            purpose and to legalize such transfer where heretofore made by said trustees. In many
            townships this fund has accumulated to large amounts and should be used in the
            improvement of the road. Many trustees have use this fund for road purposes, contrary to
            law. This bill legalizes such acts of trustees. This is all that there is in the bill.
            This bill is of importance, and I hope it will pass this House.</p>
          <p>Mr. BAKER reported this as an act legalizing what has already been done by some
            township trustees.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARLAN favored and Mr. FAULKNER opposed the bill.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LINDLEY, the bill was amended by striking out all that legalizes the

        <p>The bill [S. 192-Mr. Grubbs'] adding to section 468 of the general practice act
          of June 18, 1852, a provision that the plaintiff or his agent shah be notified by mail or
          otherwise of the time and place of the sale of personal property on execution. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS explained that the bill was intended to render more certain the sales of
          property on execution. </p>

        <p>Mr. MENZIE couldn't see why the plaintiff should stand on more favored ground
          than the defendant. The former is supposed to take due notice of the time and clay of sale
          because he takes the property of the defendant by force. This bill proposes an unnecessary
          change and discriminates in favor of the party who has brought to his aid the machinery of
          the law. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE referred to the well known fact that under an execution, if it runs 180 days
          and contemplates more than one appraisement of property, the time of action is uncertain
          and entirely optional with the officer; and it looks unreasonable to require they party
          plaintiff to dance attendance of the officer in order to ascertain when the property will
          be sold, in order that he may be present and bid off the property or let it go without
          action on his part. This bill is an eminently proper one--it can do nobody any harm and
          would be beneficial to all concerned. There could be no objection to the officer notifying
          both parties. The presumption is, the property being advertised in the neighborhood where
          it was seized would induce the defendant to look after it, while the plaintiff may reside
          at a long distance and know nothing about it.</p>

        <p>Mr. BRISCOE: The bill proposes to make extra costs for the defendant, if the plaintiff
          should live at a long distance, or even be a non resident, if his attorneys are faithful
          to their trust they will notify him of everything that is necessary. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK: The objection that the bill makes an unfair discrimination in proposing to
          give notice to the plaintiff and not to the defendant also, while making additional costs
          for the defendant, is sufficiently answered by the senator fro Marshall [Mr. Reeve] in
          this, that the plaintiff may not be resident of the county, and it can't possibly
          do any harm. The attorney for the plaintiff amy be absent from the county. The plaintiff
          may be a non-resident, and this bill would give him an opportunity to make the amount of
          his claim, and to do no harm to the defendant. He saw no reason why the bill should not
          pass.</p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE also thought the bill should pass. It has been said that it is the duty of the
          plaintiff's attorney to know all the proceedings of the sheriff. As a matter of
          fact that is <pb n="87" xml:id="VAA8558-17-089"/> utterly impossible. It is not the
          attorney's duty to watch the sheriff and find out when the sale is to be. The
          attorney can do his duty without watching for the sale day. The plaintiff and the
          defendant are both benefitted by this bill; It is for the benefit of the debtor as well
          for the benefit of the creditor, and should be passed. </p>

        <p>Mr. GRUBBS regarded this bill as being in the interest of economy. There are innumberable
          offers of personal property in this State where there are no sales, thus incurring costs
          upon defendants because of the fact that the plaintiff are not advised where the sales are
          to be. Senators say, "Why not advise both? Simply because it is not necessary: the
          defendant is notified that has property is taken-- he knows that fact; and in addition the
          statute provides that notice shall be given in the township in which the property is
          taken, and in which the sale is to be made.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order being the consideration of the
            bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">S. 277</ref>, and the subject of interest
            generally.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>committee of the
              whole</orgName>--Mr. Woollen in the chair--for the consideration of the interest
            questions. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to strike out of the first section the words "when the
            parties do not agree," and also the words "unless the same be in
            writing, signed by the party to be charged thereby, and in such case it shall not be
            lawful to contract for more than eight per cent, per annum. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: That destroys the purpose of the bill, and leaves the rate absolutely at six
            per cent. Thousands of people have been compelled to mortgage everything they have:
            capital is gradually being invested in business ventures now, and unless people are
            allowed to renew their obligations at the original rate of interest, they will go into
            absolute beggary; the effect, would be appalling; Indiana would sink to the very lowest
            position in the scale of States. It is just such legislation as this that now makes war
            between labor and capital. This amendment amounts to this: A body of 50 men say to
            2,000,000 of people, "You. shall not exercise your own judgment in the
            borrowing of money." The same principle would compel a man to have but a six
            inch leg to his boot. If you adopt such a system the tune will come when you will reap
            the terrible effects of proceeding: in direct violation of the natural laws that govern
            finance. Every time you bring down the rate too low, you make but a bid for the
            production or crime, for the people will have money when they must have it , even though
            it be obtained by circumventing interest acts. Once disregarding the law is but the
            entering: wedge that will eventually make it necessary to call in the policeman and the
            soldier. He appealed to senators to vote down the proposed amendment. Do not say to the
            people they shall not exercise their discretion in the matter of borrowing money. </p>


          <p>Mr. HART. The people are demanding a reduction in the legal rate of interest. All the
            political parties are on record in favor of cutting down; and why should we hesitate?
            The laboring men, who sustain this Government, are anxious for it: we have get to throw
            safeguards around the poorer class of people, and the sooner we do it the better.</p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON did not think very great calamities would before the people if the legal
            rate of interest be fixed at 6 percent. The great mass of the people of Indiana demand a
            measure of this kind. No legitimate business can be carried on profitably in this State
            and pay interest at 10 per cent. The argument that the people will violate a law
            reducing the rate to 6 percent, is not argument against passing a law demanded by the
            times; if it were, jails had better be closed and statute books burned.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOODS--The demands of capital are from ten to twenty per cent. There is no such a
            thing as satisfying the demands of capital. But go among business men and they will say
            they can not afford to pay more than six per cent. Here on one side is the great
            producing interest and on the other side stands capital. Now who can hesitate as between
            the two? Business is depressed because money has found an avenue that yields greater
            revenue--it has gone into the loan channels where it can earn ten per cent. Six per
            cent, now is worth as much as twelve per cent, five years ago , and that being the case
            why should capital complain of a six per cent law.</p>


          <p>Mr. TRUSLER could not understand why we should legislate upon two rates of interest. It
            is contended the higher rate will benefit the poorer class, but who are crying out for
            the higher rate? It is the capitalist. Capital is educated, capital has been to school
            and knows how to compute interest; yes, and compound it, too. In other countries it has
            ground labor in the dust; but thank God it can't do it in this country. No
            great object can be accomplished without uniting capital and labor, then <pb n="88" xml:id="VAA8558-17-090"/> why should they be kept apart by legislation. The laboring
            men is willing to take his chances at the lower rate of interest and the speaker favored
            the adoption of the pending amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS finds 12 of the States have no limit as to contracts for rates of interest,
            and 17 allow 12 per cent, to 20. This proposition for putting down the rate to 6 per
            cent, would be ruinous. Parties now holding mortgages on real property in this State
            would foreclose and take the realty. There are but few clamoring for the reduction, and
            they mostly men who have broken themselves up. A half dozen of them will make more noise
            about it then 500 good and substantial citizens. It is better tat every one should make
            such contracts as they please. For the present he should favor the bill as it came from
            the hands of the committee. </p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT asked by what manner of means the advocates of this measure can borrow
            money at 6 per cent. Does not this amendment mean that no one having less credit than
            the government itself shall borrow money? Why should you deny a man the right to borrow
            money at any rate he may see fit, any more than you would deny him the right to buy
            dinner at any price he may choose to pay? Years ago when there was a 6 per cent law in
            this State money was universally loaned at a greater rate all over the State. If
            senators think they can bring down the rate of interest to 6 per cent, by simply
            enacting a law, why not make it 4 or 3 per cent.? The man who has money to loan will but
            laugh at such laws. No class of men have sunk larger per cent of capital in the last
            five years than bankers. The result of low interest laws have never benefitted the man
            of poor means. The man who loans money can not afford to loan as cheaply to the poorer
            classes as he can to those in better circumstances. Money will bring what it is worth,
            just as wheat and corn and pork does. He would support this bill for the reason that
            money has got down to be worth just about that much. This amendment means that if your
            neighbor can not borrow money at 6 per cent, he shall not borrow at all. Many States
            have abandoned the idea of legislating on the subject of interest, and he hoped this
            State would come to that before many years.</p>

          <p>Mr. BRISCOE: This question should be ably and carefully considered, The eyes of the
            people of this State, as well as the sharks and Shylocks of New York, are turned to this
            Legislature at this time. The bill proposes only a difference of two per cent. from the
            present law. Nine out of ten uncollected notes in this State bear on their face ten per
            cent., and in a short time after the enactment of such a bill as this, the same
            proportion would show eight percent. If this bill will drive capital out of the State,
            let it go. He favored the fixing of a rate of Interest at six per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: The only question is, Shall this Legislature restrict the people in the
            exercise of their discretion to the making of contracts for money at the rate of eight
            per cent.? </p>

          <date>THURSDAY, Jan. 30,1879,</date>
          <time>10 o'clock, a. m.</time>

        <p> The SPEAKER called the House to order, and the journal of yesterday was being read when </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr ALLEN the further reading was dispensed with.</p>

        <p>The SPEAKER said the first thing in order would be the special order--being the
          consideration of the proposed nine constitutional amendments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osborne of Elkhart submitted a concurrent resolution, the consideration of which was
          made the special order for next Saturday at 10 o' clock--for a concurrent vote
          for the election of officers of the benevolent institutions.</p>
        <p>A call of the House was ordered and taken, which discovered as unexcused absent--Messrs.
          Dalton, Hess, Tully and Willard.</p>
        <p>Further proceedings under the call were dispensed with.</p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. GORDON the House took up the consideration of the constitutional
          amendments.</p>
        <p>The clerk then read the first proposition, being to amend section II of article 2, of the
          constitution prescribing the qualification of votes, as printed on pages 159 and 160, of
          the acts of the regular session of 1877.</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, said, we all understood that to amend the constitution of the
          State is a matter of considerable importance. He supposed members have all made up their
          minds upon the subject, and he did not expect that anything he might say would change
          their opinion. He was in favor of throwing around the elective franchise every healthy
          restraint that would tend to purify or preserve it from fraud. The cry of fraud always
          accompanies an election, and has become so general as to detract largely from the respect
          and obedience due to the observance of the election laws. This government can only be
          sustained by the will of the people. There is no government where its laws can be enforced
          alone by the bayonet. In a free republic like ours we are all bound by the voice of the
          majority. There ought to be a time fixed in which a gain a residence, and that would tend
          greatly to security in the purity of the ballot box. The time state in the
          amendment--sixty days--had been recommended by statesman of such eminence that it
          impressed him favorably. He was in favor of the amendment.</p>

        <p>Mr. GORDON: If there is one thing that has clung to his heart more than another for a
          long time, it is that this people may have a pure ballot. He cited cases in Morgan county
          in 1858. and along the Wabash, and during the war, when the sacred right of the elective
          franchize had been sorely abused and disgraced. He favored the 60 days clause required to
          gain a residence, in order that men who have no right to vote may be restrained. This
          action was but primary to the action of the people themselves, They understand what
          affects their welfare, and the man is not a friend to popular government who is not
          willing to trust the people. This amendment ought to pass.</p>
        <p> Mr. MIERS thought this amendment would disfranchise many citizens. There was a class of
          people in the State who were compelled to seek for employment where they could get it, and
          to compel them to live in the township or ward for 60 days prior to the day of election
          would be to cut off their right of suffrage. He was opposed to a registry law for the
          reason that this same class of people could not afford to live one day to registering and
          another to voting. He should vote against the amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. Caldwell said: "Mr. Speaker I am opposed to this amendment, for the reason
          that if adopted it will disfranchise not less than 10,000 voters in the great State of
          Indiana. Why? Simply because the amendment affixes the status of the voter: it requires a
          residence in the county of 60 days, and 30 days in the precinct where he offers to vote.
          This is a dis-[crimination] <pb n="89" xml:id="VAA8558-17-091"/> [dis]-crimination against
          the poor laboring man, who travels from one end of our broad country to the other seeking
          employment whereby he can maintain an honest livelihood, and an ' honest living
          for his wife and little ones. Now, Mr. Speaker, I submit in in all candor, if this is
          going to the voting population of this State the privileges and immunities that ought to
          be guaranteed to the citizens of this great commonwealth. This amendment, if adopted, is a
          direct stab at the vital principle upon which our glorious institutions are based the
          right of self government, and no man is so low or so humble but what the right to be heard
          at the ballot-box is an inherent right that belongs to the whole people--a right given to
          us by the fathers who made this country free, in consequence of the oppression of the
          mother country. I tell yon, gentlemen, if this amendment is ultimately adopted, and
          becomes a part of the organic law of this State, you abridge the freedom of elections in
          Indiana so much so as to deprive a very large per cent, of the honest, hard-fisted
          yeomanry of this State from the inestimable privilege of voting for men who make the laws,
          and assist, effectually to run the whole machinery of county and State government. There
          is no question come before this General Assembly since its convention of more and of
          greater importance than this question of incorporating this amendment into 1 the
          fundamental law of this State; the principle of declaring in our constitution that a
          citizen of the State shall not have the right to vote unless he remains in his township 60
          days and in the ward or precinct 30 days before he shall have the God-given right to
          exercise the privileges of a free man is at variance with the established usage of free
          government since the formation of our glorious constitution. Now, Mr. Speaker, I appeal to
          gentlemen on this no floor to travel slow on this question of amending the constitution of
          Indiana, for fear that we get it worse than it now is. Corruption at the ballot-box can
          net be averted by changing our organic law. The trouble arises from another and a very
          different source, it arises through the agency of money and capital. Money is used largely
          and freely at every election to corrupt the ballot box, and can not, in my judgment be
          averted or controlled by The passage of this amendment to our constitution. The privileges
          of the elective franchise should be so arranged as to give the greatest legal facility to
          all classes of our citizens, rich or poor, high or low, learned or unlearned; all should
          have the right to vote who have be come citizens of our great State, and we should not
          abridge that right by the passage of this amendment requiring a residence of 60 days in
          the township and 30 days in the precinct where the voter offers to deposit his ballot.
          Upon this question I will stand or fall and leave to the people of my county to determine
          my action upon this constitutional restriction. I shall therefore vote against this
          amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr KESTER though this amendment would deprive 20,000 of the sons of toil in Indiana of
          the elective franchise. We are not called upon to disfranchise so large a class in order
          to reach the few guilty ones. He should raise his voice and vote against so unjust a
          measure. </p>
        <p>Mr. SNODDY did not think that to require a residence of 60 days would interfere with the
          vote of a laboring man. His people are in favor of the passage of this amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD would not be in the discharge of duty were he to fail in advocating the
          adoption of the proposed amendment. The laboring men are not the corrupt men in politics,
          He was in favor of this amendment. He had an abiding confidence that the expression of the
          will of the people would be in the right direction, and it is a duty we owe to posterity
          to make arrangements for the submission of the question to the people as soon as possible.
          This is not and should not be a political question. We are here to do the bidding of the
          people. He was thoroughly impressed with the necessity of this amendment. </p>
        <p>And then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>


        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> A call of the House discovered all the unexcused members present except Mr. Saint, and
            he came in afterward.</p>
          <p> Mr. DAILEY should vote against the amendment. There is tent one question in this. He
            would not object to a residence of 30 or 60 days, but to limit the territory to a ward
            would work hardships. A number of bona tide residents in every city are compelled to
            move about from place to place to seek employment. The poor man's right of
            suffrage is as dear to him as is the rich man's. This amendment is an indirect,
            proposition to narrow the right of suffrage. if a man happens to cross the line of a
            ward or township he is disfranchised, though he may have been a resident of the county
            for years or for a life time. Mr. D. did not like the register feature of the law. Our
            past experience in that line we should profit by. The constitution and laws are now
            broad enough if the proper guards are thrown around it,</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD had left a sick bed in order to come here and be placed on the record on
            this question. There is no question of so vital importance to all the people as an
            amendment to the constitution. The majority of the people of the State are not supposed
            to understand questions in their legal aspect, and they have sent their representatives
            here to decide for them. There has never been adopted a resolution for amendment of the
            organic law so loosely drawn up as this one; and for that reason he should be compelled
            to vote against it, as it is beyond the reach of amendment. It is well known that a
            registry law could not be passed in this Legislature, and should this constitutional
            amendment be proposed to and ratified by the people the next General Assembly would be
            called upon to pass such a law. Commercial travelers might be disfranchised under this
            amendment, because it might be said they had no fixed residence for 60 days preceding an
            election. Is there any state in the Union, under the operation of a registry law,which
            protects the ballot-box from fraud? He did not want to see it tried in Indiana unless it
            be productive of good. We should hand the right of suffrage down to posterity as pure as
            we received it from our ancestry. Will you hamper it, and deprive 30,000 citizens of the
            right of suffrage? Why are Republicans so solicitous this amendment should go before the
            people? How did they pass the XVth amendment? They know they can no longer persuade the
            laboring classes to vote with them. I trust that the Democrats will vote against this
            amendment because the people do not demand it. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT supposed it proper to explain his vote at this time. At first he was in favor
            of this amendment, but after reflection he does not believe it best for the people of
            the State. What is to be gained by it? Will the ballot-box be any more carefully guarded
            by this amendment? He said "No." Most infamous practices have been
            carried on under registry laws. Until there is more purity among lenders of parties
            legislation will not be respected as it should be. He would not argue this from any
            party stand- point. He should oppose any change in the laws that would deprive any class
            of fellow citizens of the right of suffrage.</p>
          <pb n="90" xml:id="VAA8558-17-092"/>
          <p>Mr. OWEN favored the amendment because he favored free ballot. The poor man can not
            afford to be a candidate because he can not afford to pay for imported votes. Men seek
            to monopolize ballots as they would monopolize anything else. It is not liberty that
            would require a man to live in a township 60 days before he shall vote, it is a license.
            We want every man who has the right to deposit his ballot, and he should be protected in
            that right. The people understand what they want, and they are just as well qualified to
            vote upon this amendment as we are. He favored its adoption. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH considered that no remonstrance has been offered against these amendments
            which have been proposed now for two years, and as the Senate has adopted them, they
            should receive his vote. If the people do not want them, they can decide upon them as
            intelligently as we. </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON did not know what his constituents would think of this amendment. The
            stride that Indiana has made in the past 15 years disputes the charge that great frauds
            have been perpetrated at the ballot box. He did not care what the cost would be in
            money; If we need a registry law, let us have it; but we do not need it. If it were for
            the good of the people he would favor it. Many mechanics have to move to find employment
            within 6 days of an election, and by so doing under this proposed amendment, he would
            lose his right to vote. And his rich landlord might serve a notice that would compel him
            to move within that time, and thus deprive him of the right of the elective franchise.
            We have had as good elections in Indiana, as in any State, whether they had a registry
            law or no registry law. Our fundamental law is good enough on this question. The
            builders of railroads, the workingmen who rent, are the ones who will be injured by such
            an amendment, and not the men who own their houses. </p>
          <p>Mr. MITCHELL, felt it is a duty to offer objections to this proposed amendment. We
            should educate the morals of the people as one of the moss potent guards to the
            ballot-box. He opposed the 60 day residence clause because it would take the ballot out
            of the hands of the laboring class; and he also opposed the registry clause. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS spoke in favor of the amendment, answering objections, and thinking that the
            fairest ballot ever taken in Indiana was under the registry law. </p>
          <p>Mr. 0VERMEYER insisted there ought not to be any politics in this question. We are not
            the tribunal to try this question. It should rest with the people to say will they put
            these words in the constitution. He was willing to risk the people. Under this amendment
            but a small number would lose their residence. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN was for this amendment, because it fixes a residence. </p>
          <p>Mr. March [one of the framers of the present constitutions] favored submitting this
            amendment to the vote of the people. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS demanded the previous question, which was seconded, by the House, and, under

          these words: "In the cheapest manner possible." </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour being the
            consideration of the bill [S. 158--Mr. Harris'] concerning married
            women--removing all legal disabilities--the same as if she were single. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend section 7 so that the husband shall not make repairs or
            improvements upon the property of his wife without her consent in writing, delivered to
            the contractor or person making the improvements. Unless there be some way to preserve
            her objection it will be impossible for her to show that objection. Sooner or later we
            must come to the principles embodied in this bill, and the sooner the better. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS: The amendment will have to be written to meet the object of its author.
            There are men in this city who think whatever they may acquire, if not in direct
            violation of the criminal code. Is all right; and they have wives who aid and abet them
            in the way of getting improvements on the property of the wife and never paying for
            them. Usually the wife will protect her own interest; but in the interest of even handed
            justice this provision ought to stand as it is in the bill. It she don't want
            the improvement she can say so to the workmen, and then her property will not be
            chargeable. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON: How far we shall go in advancing the separate interests of married women
            is a serious question. There is no justice or common sense in some of the provisions of
            this bill. It would start a controversy at the hearthstone, where it is the policy of
            law to keep peace and quiet. Would you go into the courts of justice with a controversy
            between husband and wife? Unless the husband has her authority he ought not to bind his
            wife's property; and to preclude controversy the authority ought to be put down
            in writing. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: If senators can find a laboring man, that, during life time, is deserving of
            more pity or commiseration than the average wife, they can find what he has not yet dis-
            covered. If Use balance of the bill be of any consequence, moist certainly this
            amendment should be made. It is an easy matter for a laboring man to ask for the written
            consent of the wife before making improvements on her property.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL cited reasons why the amendment should be adopted. He would favor such an
            agency as would be a matter of record.</p>
          <p> Mr. OLDS moved to amend section one by inserting after the words "personal
            property" the words 'in certain cases,' with a view to follow
            this amendment with others to carry his idea through the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS--The amendment would make nonsense of the section. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved to amend section two so it will read as follows: </p>
          <p>A married woman may carry on any trade or business and perform any labor or service on
            her sole and separate account. The earnings and profits of any married woman accruing
            from her trade, business, services or labor, other than labor for her husband or family,
            shall be her sole and separate property. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES favored this amendment because the language in the bill is capable of
            different interpretations. Every law should be free From any ambiguity or doubt. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to amend by striking out the words "other than labor for her
            husband and family." </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: The amendment would make the wife a femme sole to all intents and purposes.
            Every movement towards separating husband and wife is attended with danger. They will
            adopt themselves to the inevitable. He urged senators to make no innovation that will
            tend to the destruction of the marital relation, but to make laws consistent and
            dignified. </p>
          <p>The amendment, was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE made a motion to reconsider the vote adopting the amendment [Mr.
            Comstock's.] </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE this motion was laid on the table--yeas 36, nays 10. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS offered a substitute for section 3, which was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved to amend section 3 by inserting the words "in
            writing" in lieu of the word "affirmatively." We are treading
            upon holy ground in attempting to define the legal rights of husband and wife.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> It was agreed to upon a division--affirmative 24, negative 15. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE moved to strike from section 3 these words; "And unless her
            husband con- sent thereto affirmatively and make use of such property and its proceeds,
            he shall in no wise be held liable for any debt so contracted by her.'7 </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion was agreed to upon a division--affirmative 24, negative 14. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved the following as a substitute for section 7: "Whenever The
            husband causes repairs or improvements to be made on the real property of the wife with
            her knowledge and consent thereto in writing delivered to the contractor or person
            performing the labor or furnishing the material, she shall alone be liable for material
            furnished or labor performed." </p>
          <p>It was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE proposed an additional section declaring all transfers of property made by
            the husband to the wife, when he is indebted to any other person, he being otherwise
            insolvent, to be null and void.</p>
          <p> It was rejected. </p>
          <p>The nine sections, as amended, were adopted as a whole, and the bill ordered engrossed
            for the third reading. </p>

        <p>The SPEAKER then announced the order pending the adjournment last night the consideration
          of enrolled Senate joint resolution No. 2, proposing amendment to section 5, arti-[cle]
            <pb n="93" xml:id="VAA8558-17-095"/> [arti-]cle 2 of the constitution. The resolution
          passed the House of Representatives without debate--yeas 51, nays 19. </p>
        <p>The clerk then read enrolled Senate joint resolution, No. 3, proposing amendment to
          section 14 of article 2 of the constitution. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess: The only reason why we desire a change is that we may better
          ourselves. The reasons for this change is to purify elections, but can it be reached by
          this section? He think not. It would be well for the State, if the elections could be held
          in November. If the language here was ''may" instead of
          "shall" [provide for the registration, etc.] he would give it his
          support. In no case can a registry law tend to purify our elections. Dead men's
          names are used to perpetrate fraud in the East where registry laws are in operation. Let
          us purity the elective franchise as much as possible; but he did not think it could be
          done under a registry law, and was therefore opposed to it. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS was opposed to this proposed amendment, but in the light he now had was in
          favor of a registry law. He was also opposed to force this matter upon subsequent
          legislatures. He would vote against it. </p>
        <p>Mr. SPEAKER CAUTHORN (Mr. Faulkner in the chair) thought this too serious a matter to
          make a political question of. The constitution wisely provides that no change can be made
          in that instrument except by a vote of the people. He did not think that this House ought
          to object to this amendment going be- fore the people. It has been intimated that it might
          injure some political party. If it had the effect to bury any political party he was
          willing to see that party buried. No one could go farther than. He was willing to go for
          the protection of the ballot. The only question now is, will we change the election from
          October to November? He hoped the resolution would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS had no use for a registry law. He thought there could be but one construction
          put upon the resolution. It had been clearly decided that the word
          "shall" in the constitution means "shall;" but in the
          statutes can be interpreted "shall" or "may." He
          should vote against the resolution, but he did not want it understood that in voting
          against this proposed amendment he wanted to throttle the people. He was in favor of
          uniting the two elections. If he thought the people would indorse these proposed
          amendments he would not put himself in their way, </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT said he opposed the resolution yesterday conscientiously, and by passing this
          we did not provide for a special election. The question is whether or not we are willing
          to consolidate the October and November elections. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said in order to get a judiciary separated as far as possible from politics
          and state matters from national politics, he would vote for this resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS was opposed to separating the election of judges from the general election for
          fear of running the matter still deeper into politics. If it provides for registration,
          and if it can not be determined whether it calls for a registry law or not he would oppose
          it. </p>
        <p>Mr. HESS was in favor of the proposed amendment, because it will cut off the expense of
          one of the elections. He also favored a registry law. </p>
        <p>Mr. PERRY voted against the resolution because it compelled a registry law, and because
          members of the legal profession in the House were not agreed as to what the resolution did
          require. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH said: The principle objection to this amendment evidently arises from a
          difference of opinion, as to its true meaning, Some insist that the last clause of the
          proviso makes a registry law mandatory for all elections, others insist that: it only
          applies to the election of judges in case their election should be made special by the
          Legislature. When we apply to this amendment the well settled rules of legal construction
          applicable to such instruments there can be no doubt of its meaning.</p>
        <p>1. It is an old and well established rule of legal construction that words of limitation
          placed in a proviso rebates to and limits the main proposition introduced by the proviso
          of which they are a part, and not to the provisions of the instruments preceding the
          proviso. Now in this case the proviso introduces the grant of power to the Legislature to
          provide special elections for judges, with the condition that it shall also provide for
          the registration of voters. No lawyer will question the correctness or the application of
          the rule to this amendment; therefore the registration will and can only apply to special
          elections for judges, in case we shall have any. Another equally well established role of
          construction is that you must look to the whole instrument in order to construct a
          particular part thereof, and that one portion shall be construed in the light of other
          portions, so that the whole may express the sense of the framer. Now, in the first
          amendment considered yesterday we provided-for all general elections, and left the subject
          of registration discretionary with the Legislature. Now, is it possible that a court, in
          construing these two amendments, shall say that the Legislature yesterday made
          registration only permissive and to-day mskes it mandatory, as applied to all elections?
          Would it not be compelled, under all rules of construction, to say they intended the one
          for general elections, to which provisions it is attached, and the other for special
          elections of judges, to which it alone relates? There can be no doubt as to the meaning of
          this amendment. </p>

        <p>Mr. STUCKER, explaining, when his name was called, said: Mr. Speaker, having been cut off
          both yesterday and to-day by the previous question, I now desire to explain my vote on the
          first and third amendments. On the first I voted "no." In my Judgment 60
          days is too long for residence in the township, but I care little for residence. I am
          satisfied that the registration laws will not affect fraud until the system of buying and
          selling votes is stopped, but will increase that infamous crime. </p>
        <p>Then the probability is that an election will <pb n="94" xml:id="VAA8558-17-096"/> be
          called to have these amendments submitted to the voters, which, in my judgment, will cost
          the State $150,000 to $200,000. That I am opposed to. As to the third proposition, now
          under consideration, the first part I am in favor of. I am in favor of holding on
          elections in November. But while it does away with the October election it, provides for a
          judicial election at a separate time. It also provides for a registration law, which, if
          ratified, will create an army of officers - from two to three in each township of this
          State. I never will consent to vote for any provision that will create any more officers
          or expand one dollar unnecessary. Believing, as I do, that this will be the consequence. I
          vote "No." </p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above. So the resolution was adopted. </p>

          <p> The SPEAKER resumed the chair, and announced the first thing in order to be Senate
            joint resolution No 4, proposing amendment to sections 4 and 5 of article 4 of the
            constitution, printed on page 161 of the acts of the regular session of 1877.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The proposed amendment passed the House of Representatives by yeas 86, nays 3. </p>
          <p>Th speaker then ordered the clerk to read Senate joint resolution No. 5, proposing
            amendment to the 14th clause of section 22 of article 4 of the constitution. </p>
          <p>Mr. 0SBORNE of Elkhart doubted the propriety of voting for this proposition, nor did he
            think it the correct, one to embrace in our constitution. If this resolution should pass
            he did not see what would prevent the party in power from grading fees and salaries in
            counties where the minority were in power so as to cripple the efficiency of its
            officers. It ought not to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS said there was a cry from all parts of the senate that the Legislature ought
            to have the power to reduce fees and salaries and this will give them the power. He
            believed this to be the right position and the people ought to vote upon it. </p>
          <p>Mr. SCHWEITZER said he was in favor of the proposed amendment. His constituents have
            instructed him upon this subject and he was not going to treat them slightly. He was in
            favor of the resolution. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH don't understand that this will give the Legislature power to
            discriminate in politics, but the rule must be the same in one county as another. He was
            for the resolution. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question, demanded by Mr. LEHMAN, the resolution
            passed the House of Representatives by yeas 91, nays 1. </p>
          <p>The House then proceeded to the consideration of the Senate joint resolution proposing
            to amend the second section of Act seven of the constitution as printed on page 162-3 of
            acts of 1877. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS did not think the House ought to come to a vote without some discussion on
            this point. He was opposed to the increase of the judges, and he had been informed by
            one of them recently, that the proposed amendment would not give the relief desired. </p>
          <p>Mr. CALDWELL said: Having already devoted much time to the discussion or these
            resolutions, and about, one-third of the time of the session has expired, he demanded
            the previous question. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question the resolution was rejected by--yeas 26,
            nays 69. </p>
          <p>Senate joint resolution No. 9, proposing to strike out all the sections of the 13th
            article of the constitution and insert new matter, printed on page 85 of the acts of the
            special session of 1877, coming up--</p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam said, If the whole State of Indiana was one incorporated city,I
            would vote this resolution, but as it is not. I must vote against it. He did not think
            the people should be called to vote upon a question they know but little about. The men
            who did not live in incorporated towns or cities were not the judges of what was
            necessary for those living in towns or cities. A large class were not interested in it
            at all. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought it effected each voter in Indiana, and the people ought to have a
            chance to vote on it. He was in favor of it.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The resolution passed the House of Representatives by yeas 81, nays 11.</p>
          <p> The House then proceeded to the consideration of joint resolution S. 19,for an
            amendment to section 29 of article 4 of the constitution to admit of a longer session of
            the General Assembly, printed on page 166 of the acts of the regular session of 1877. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart said he came here in favor of this amendment, but had changed
            his mind. If the sessions should be prolonged for 120 days, he did not believe they
            would be any better off. The resolution ought not to pass. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

          <p>The following enrolled Senate bills were read the first time and passed to the second

              <p>Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, that the pay of

        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN presented a remonstrance signed by almost ail the members of the bar of

          county. </p>
        <p> On motion it was ordered, that when the 'Senate adjourn it be till Monday at a
          quarter before 2 o'clock, p. m.</p>
        <p> The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a communication from the superintendent of
          public instruction in answer to a resolution of the Senate inquiring as to what extent the
          local school levies can be reduced without injury to the public schools, in which he
          states that he does not know of a single corporation which levies the full amount of
          taxation for school purposes now permitted by law. After a careful examination he is
          satisfied that the following reductions in the possible levy for school purposes can be
          made without seriously impairing the efficiency of the schools, viz: I. The tax for the
          erection of school houses, etc., to be levied by civil trustees of incorporated towns
          only, which is 30 cents on the $100. 2. He thinks it would be safe to reduce the
          limitation on the possible issue of bonds by the civil authorities of cities and towns for
          school buildings from $50,000 to $25,000, and to reduce the tax that may be levied for the
          payment of principal and Interest on these bonds from 50 cents on the $100 and $1.00 on
          each poll, to 15 cents on the $100 and 50 cents on each poll. 3. He thinks the local tax
          for school purposes commonly called "tuition tax" of 25 cents on the
          $100 and 25 cents on each poll, which can be levied only by civil authorities, and not by
          school trustees, can be reduced to 20 cents on the $100. and 25 cents on each poll. 4. If
          some provision could be made by which a tax could be levied on those corporations only in
          which debts have been already contracted, he thinks that the levy of 50 cents on the $100
          and $1 on each poll, for the purpose of providing school houses, furniture, apparatus,
          fuel and other necessary expenses, except tuition, which can be levied by school trustees
          of townships, towns and cities, could be reduced to 35 cents on each $100, and 50 cents on
          each poll. This will effect a reduction in the possible levy in townships of twenty-six
          per cent., in cities of thirty six per cent, and in towns of fifty-four per cent., without
          serious injury to the schools. The communication was referred to the <orgName>committee on

        <p>Mr. SLEETH inasmuch as this is not a political question, and as the <orgName>Judiciary

        <p>Mr. WORKS moved to amend by referring the resolution to the <orgName>Judiciary

        <p>Mr. SLEETH accepted the amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS did not think the time of this House or the committee ought to be taken up in
          further considering the matter. The session is far spent already, and he thought every
          member had his mind made up to go upon the record.</p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON wanted more time; he hoped the motion now before the House would prevail.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays being demanded and taken, resulted--yeas 41, nays 44. </p>
        <p>So the motion to refer was rejected.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH, in explanation of his vote, said: " I am compelled to vote for the
          reference, because this House, by a resolution, some time ago instructed the
            <orgName>committee on the judiciary</orgName> to investigate the report to the House
          their opinion as to the number of vacancies now existing by law in the officers of the
          benevolent institutions. That committee, of which I am a member, have that matter now
          investigation, and have not yet reached a conclusion thereon, the questions involved are
          complicated and important, and are purely questions of law, and should be settled before
          we heap confusion on confusion; besides, I understand that when the House by resolution
          order an investigation and report by a committee that it is not only a discourtesy to the
          House, but a violation of duty on the part of such committee to neglect or refuse to make
          such report. Now, while the identical question involved in this resolution is under
          consideration by the committee, and without any intimation to any other member of the
          committee the chairman of that committee comes in here <pb n="97" xml:id="VAA8558-17-099"/> and introduces this resolution, which is conclusive of the question his committee is
          investigating. If adopted at this time, the effect of it is to conclude the committee and
          smother an expression of their opinion on the question, and preclude a minority report in
          case of a difference of opinion on the question. Such courses is, in my judgment, not only
          discourteous to the committee, but an insult, and looks like a cowardly way of disposing
          of the matter without allowing those of the committee, who might differ from the chairman,
          to place themselves correctly on the record through a minority report. I vote "
          Aye.".</p>

        <p>Mr. Thompson, in explanation of his vote, said: I wish to say that, I am a member of the
            <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, and if I say a word in reply to the gentleman
          from Rush. (Mr. Sleeth) it is because it is necessary in order to explain my position. The
          gentleman claims it is the effort of this House to smother by this resolution the
          conscience and privilege of the committee of judiciary, and he characterizes those cowards
          who favor it. It will that a be found by the vote of this House that a majority of the
          committee are here voting against this motion, and in favor of the resolution. The
          minority of the committee may explain. But be this as it may I do not feel that gentleman
          need rest under the imputation of cowardice for favoring prompt action in the election the
          officers to be chosen by this body. We have already taken up too much valuable time with
          candidates for office.</p>

        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart explaining, said: He had not the remotest idea that this
          resolution would bring out such remarks from the gentleman from Rush (Mr. Sleeth). The
          facts were that the subject matter had been brought before the committee, and they were
          unwilling to express any opinion upon it without more time to investigate than they had at
          their command, and the chairman so reported to the House. He thought it unfortunate to be
          charged with injustice when it was the farthest thought from him, either as member of this
          House or chairman of the <orgName>committee on the judiciary</orgName>. He did not draw
          the resolution as chairman of the committee, or with the intention of taking the matter
          out of their hands, but as a member of this House in the discharge of his duty. He
          disclaimed any intention to exercise any arbitrary power, or smother up anything. The
          resolution had been postponed already for several days in order that members might have an
          opportunity to examine the matter. He was willing to meet the committee at any time ind
          submit the matter to them for their consideration, and would call a meeting of the
          committee as often as any member desired. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS, when his name was called, explaining, said: There seems to be a
          misunderstanding here. He understood that the matter been before the committee and he
          thought they were anxious for an opportunity to further consider it. It was for this
          reason that he made the motion to refer. </p>
        <p>So the motion was rejected, as above recorded.</p>
        <p> The question recurring upon the passage of the resolution--</p>
        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER said: If we pass this resolution we declare that the election of a
          president of the boards, and one trustee for each of said asylums in 1877, was illegal. In
          1877 these officers were elected by the House and Senate sitting together, but the vote
          was taken by each house separately, and no wrong was done to any one. The law was
          substantially complied with. In 1875, when the Legislature was under Democratic control,
          these elections were had in the same manner as in 1877, and in 1873 the same way. In 1873
          our honorable speaker and Governor Williams, then members of the Legislature, sanctioned
          the mode pursued in 1877, by their votes. And in 1873, Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Humphries and Mr.
          Davidson, now Democratic members of the House, sanctioned he same mode by helping to elect
          Democrats in the same way as the Republicans, now proposed to be ousted were elected. How
          can these worthy gentlemen now say that, it was not right to elect Democrats in 1875 and
          not right in the same way to elect Republicans in 1877? </p>
        <p>A slight variation from the law will not vitiate an election. If there was no fraud and
          it was not possible that the result was affected by the failure to fully comply with the
          law, the election is none the less legal. The fact that Governor Williams declined to
          commission the officials elected in 1877 makes no difference. The governor's
          commission is not necessary to enable them to hold their offices. This point is squarely
          decided by our supreme court in 33 Ind. We ought, therefore, to vote down this resolution,
          or amend so as to provide for the election of but one trustee for each of said asylums. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAILEY moved that the further consideration of the resolution be postponed until 2
          o'clock on Monday. In the meantime the resolution be referred to the
            <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> with instructions to report by 2 o'clock
          on Monday. </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the superintendent of public
          instruction, similar to the one described in the Senate proceedings this morning.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. Watson 200 copies were ordered printed. </p>
        <p>Mr. HERROD submitted the report of the special committee on the bill [H. R. 209] fixing
          the number and pay of employes, returned a substitute therefor, [H. R. 291] and
          recommending its passage. The report of the committee was considered in. The
          constitutional rule being suspended therefor, the bill was read the second time and passed
          to the third reading. </p>
        <p>An ineffectual motion was made to suspend the constitutional rule in order to consider
          the bill engrossed that it might be read the third time and put upon its passage. </p>
        <p>The House then took recess until 2 o'clock.</p>

          <head rend="center">PUBLICATION OF SHERIFF'S SALES.</head>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. STREIGHT the Senate proceeded to the consideration of bills on
            the second reading, to-wit:</p>
          <p> The bill [S. 5.-Mr. Moore's] to legalize certain sheriff's sales
            when the notice was defective--where three publications in a newspaper has been made,
            was read the second time with a committee report recommending its infinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE'S constituents are especially interested in this bill, and he hoped
            the Senate would not concur in the report of the committee. There has been a number of
            sales made in his county defective in the giving: of printed notice three weeks
            successively, by publication in a newspaper--the sheriff construing the statutory
            provision to mean that three publications or insertions were sufficient, even though
            they may not be in three successive weeks. The Supreme court has decided such sales are
            absolutely void, but standard authorities will sustain the power of the Legislature to
            legalize such sales, and it would be entirely proper to do so. As the Senate is not
            full, he hoped the bill would be permitted to lie upon the table that, it may be
            considered by a full Senate. He made that motion. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        </div>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">ILLEGAL ACTS OF NOTARIES PUBLIC. </head>
          <p>The bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_006">[S. 6--Mr. Sarnighausen's]</ref>to
            legalize the acknowledgments of all deeds, mortgages, etc., taken by notaries public
            after the expiration of their commission, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to amend by adding in the proper place these words: "or who,
            being duly commissioned as notaries, but being ineligible to hold such office, exercised
            the functions thereof in good faith."</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS felt that this bill can not injure any one, and that may be of great
            advantage to many in after-time, therefore, he favored its engrossment and passage. </p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE cared very little about the bill, as it simply goes to the record of deeds
            and has no other effect, only to make it, subject to record. Still it may be well enough
            to pass it, as it is perfectly competent to make the record of a paper legal. Though the
            acknowledgment of an instrument can not be legalized, but, after being admitted to
            record by virtue of the illegal acknowledgment, it is perfectly competent to legalize
            the record. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE agreed with the senator from Marshall, [Mr. Reeve] that the amendment is not
            germane to the bill. We have no power to say a person ineligible to office shall execute
            the functions of such an office. Neither can we ratify the official acts of a person
            ineligible, He would favor the bill as introduced, but was opposed to the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL opposed both the bill and the amendment. We should not attempt to legalize
            a thing the statute says is illegal. The bill attempts to legal something that is
            absolutely void. Then he objected again, be cause this would be class
            legislation--legislating to protect some certain individuals. Unless we could legislate
            brains into some <pb n="101" xml:id="VAA8558-17-103"/> people' heads, this kind
            of legislation might be continued, if begun, for all time. This is a useless piece of
            legislation and ought not to be indulged in.</p>


          <p>Mr. WOOD thought any honest mistake ought to be legalized, and that the Legislature can
            legalize de facto acts of an official. As a question of fact nobody can be injured by
            this bill. The ablest man commit mistakes, but the people should not be permitted to
            suffer therefrom if the Legislature can prevent it. </p>



          <p>Mr. BURRELL--If we resolve ourselves into a court to legalize the illegal acts of our
            neighbors the time would be entirely too short to get through with one single county.
            Our duty is to make law; the duty of the people is to obey. If we legalize everything,
            and do away with the courts, we would have a fine mess of business on our hands. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK--Unless we lay down the broad principle that every illegal act of every
            class of officers shall be legalized by the Legislature, we should stop somewhere. The
            same principle embodied in this bill would legalize the wrongful taking of property; and
            while this particular bill may not be productive of much, if any evil, but because of
            the principle embodied in it, he should oppose the bid.</p>


          <p>Mr. LANGDON--Here is a question arising between the people of the State. This bill does
            not reach the question of validity of instruments acknowledged by notaries after the
            expiration of commissions, but as to whether the instrument is legally recorded. It is
            within the power of the Legislature to say the record evidence is good, for there is no
            vested right affected here, and this bill certainly ought to pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES--The Legislature has repeatedly passed acts of this character in order to
            prevent litigation on technicalities. They are called " curative acts.
            ". This class of bills are to prevent persons coming into courts 15 or 20 years
            after the act and taking advantage of a mere technicality.</p>

          <p>Mr. BRISCOE demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
            its operation thy amendment was agreed to and the bill ordered engrossed for third
            reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 7--Mr. Riley's] to prevent corruption at elections--making it
            unlawful, to contribute to any fund used to influence elections-- was read the second
            time and laid on the table because of the absence of the author. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 8--Mr. Sarnighausen's]to prevent grave robbing and the
            disturbance of graves, and the stealing of dead human bodies not buried--punishable by
            fine not exceeding $2,000, and imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than one
            year--accessories to be punished in like manner--was read the second time, a committee
            report recommending that the bill lie on the table. </p>
          <p>The report was concurred in. </p>

          <head rend="center">To PROVIDE PHYSICIANS WITH DEAD HUMAN BODIES.</head>
          <p> The bill [S. 9--Mr. Sarnighausen's] to promote the science of medicine and
            surgery, and providing humans subjects for anatomical and scientific dissection--any
            person dying in any prison or public asylum and remaining unclaimed for 24 hours after,
            or any vagrant found dead, or any person killed while committing a felony, or while
            attempting to escape from the officers of the law, having no husband or wife, father or
            mother, son or daughter, brother and sister--was read the second time.</p>

          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN: The crime of grave robbing has increased very much during the past
            year--in his own county there have been some 12 or 15 cases; and it would seem
            absolutely necessary that some measure of this kind should be adopted.</p>



          <p>Mr. FOWLER, regarding this as a very important measure, and desiring further time for
            its consideration, moved to lay the bill on the table. </p>
          <p>The motion was rejected. </p>
          <p>The report of the committee with amendments were concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved to strike out the words "shall be held and deemed to be
            public property " after the words " such body." </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to add to section 1 a proviso, "that when any person shall
            express a wish to be buried, the dead body of such person shall not be delivered for
            dissection, but shall be properly buried." </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved ineffectually to strike out "24" and insert
            "48 hours after death." </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE moved to strike from section two the words "or Medical
            Associations." He thought when the State provides anatomical subjects for
            medical colleges, that was enough. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES did not suppose it would make any difference to the dead whether a college
            or an association shall dissect to the body. These words were put in the bid to cure the
            evils of grave robbing, and these medical associations have been much complained of as
            have been medical colleges. These are but four or five places in the State having
            colleges, and unless these words remain, but few localities would be benefitted by the
            bill</p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFER: Medical schools are not the only places where dissection is carried on. In
            every county it is almost absolutely necessary for the local physicians to have
            anatomical subjects, and if they have to send to medical colleges for material it will
            revive the old practices of obtaining subjects; therefore he opposed the amendments. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD opposed making a place in every county for the cutting up of human bodies. It
            would keep the community in a state of turmoil and excitement all the time. This is a
            delicate subject. He favored granting every facility of this kind to medical colleges,
            but opposed this thing of allowing the cutting up of dead bodies in every county, under
            sanction of law. For the sake of the public peace this bill ought not to pass as it
            stands.</p>
          <p> Mr. RAGAN also favored line amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE thought the question presented in this amendment was one of expediency only.
            If these societies can not get subjects in a legitimate way they will--purchase them.
            They will send for a leg or an arm, or any part they may want. They will send to where
            they are for sale. The immediate effect of this amendment would be that dead bodies
            would be kept in pickle by medical colleges to be sold as demanded. How many people know
            when a person dies in the poor house? Not one in 10,000. It would be injudicious to
            adopt the amendment. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. BRISCOE the words in section 2 "and becoming as aforesaid,
            public property," [referring to the dead body] were stricken out. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON moved to insert in line 8, section 2, after the word
            "college,"' the words "or medical
            association." </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The years and nays were demanded on this amendment, but being ordered and taken
            resulted--yeas 29 nays 4. </p>
          <p>No quorum voting--</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LEEPER a call of the Senate was ordered, and being taken discovered 33

          <p> Mr. BRISCOE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON moved that the absentees be sent for. </p>
          <p>The motion was rejected. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS further proceedings under the call were dispensed with and

            trustee for each of the institutions referred to in the resolution herewith returned to
            the House, but did not elect them by the concurrent vote of the two Houses, as the law
            required: and they now hold their offices by virtue of the law which enables them to
            hold over until their successors are elected and qualified. By the act of March 5,1859,
            the regular term of the presidents of the several boards expires April 2, 1879. It is
            claimed that one trustee for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, one for the Blind Asylum, and one
            commissioner for the Insane Hospital, held their offices by virtue of an election held
            in the same manner as that of the Fiftieth General Assembly above referred to, and if so
            they are now only officers de facto, having never any legal title. It is the opinion of
            a majority of the committee that the present General Assembly has the power, under the
            law and the constitution, and that it is its duty to elect all of the officers named,
            and in the manner provided for in this resolution. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS, as a member of the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>, submitted a
            report occupying over 20 manuscript pages in which he argues as to the validity of the
            election of these officers in 1877, reaching the conclusion that the election was void
            and that the offices attempted to be filled remain as if no election had been held. He
            argues that but one trustee and commissioner for each institution can be elected by this
            General Assembly, and his report recommends that the resolution be so amended. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH, in presenting the report of the minority of the committee, explained that
            the necessity for a minority report only became apparent about two hours ago, and, on
            account of the brief time, with dinner intervening, two members of the minority had
            worked separately on the report and tacked their work together and were compelled to
            submit the same without an opportunity of comparing the different parts, in consequence
            of which <pb n="104" xml:id="VAA8558-17-106"/> there will likely appear much repetition
            and awkwardness. </p>
          <p>The report was signed by Messrs. Sleeth, March, Gordon and Shanks, and covers some 20
            foolscap pages, in which the minority of the committee set out the reasons why they
            consider as valid the election, in 1877, of the president of the several boards, and one
            trustee for the Deaf and Dumb, and one trustee for the Blind, and one commissioner for
            the Insane Asylum, by the General Assembly in joint convention. Every department of the
            State has ratified and sanctioned the mode of election now in question, as shown by this
            report. It closes by recommending that the concurrent resolution be amended by striking
            out "two" where it occurs in relation to the number of officers to be
            elected, and inserting; 'one;'in lieu thereof, and by striking out ail
            in relation to the election of a president of the several boards. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH insisted there was no escape from the conclusion that the law of l859
            intended these several Boards should have a member who had seen some service thereon be
            retained at all times. In 1873 and 1875 there were elections held in the same manner as
            the one in 1877, and Governors Baker and Hendricks raised no question as to the legality
            of such elections, and Governor Williams himself, a member then, conceded their
            legality. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS said there was nothing in the journals that shows the House of
            Representatives in 1877 ever met to elect these officers. Under the statute it takes the
            concurrent action of both Houses to elect. It is evidently the intention of the law that
            one experienced, member of each Board should hold over. There was a failure to comply
            with the law by the last General Assembly. The joint committee had no more power to
            elect these officers than had a meeting composed of any other 150 men. It would be hard
            to construe the statute so as to legalize that election. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS spoke in favor of his report. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, deemed a joint convention of the two Houses of the General
            Assembly, a distinct parliamentary body, as distinct as either one of the two branches
            of the Legislature. It was this body that attempted to elect these officers in 1877
            Routine in office is the only safeguard. Men should go out of office promptly on the
            expiration of their term. The Legislature may elect whenever a vacancy occurs. This is
            the body to elect these officers, and this body is required to do so by statute. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON protested the exercise of party power. There ought to be rotation in office.
            He would not vote for a man for the third time as president. Be complimented the present
            management of the benevolent institutions of the State, if the governor has not
            commissioned these officials he has recognized them by acting with them. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT regarded every act of the joint convention two years ago as illegal in
            reference to the election of the officers referred to in this resolution. The gentleman
            from Marion had cited no recognition, by the executive, of these men. They held their
            positions under the clause in the statute which says they shall remain in office until
            their successors are elected and qualified. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON moved that the whole subject lie on the table. </p>

          <p>Mr. THOMPSON had prepared an argument on this question, but in view of the work before
            the House, demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by the House of

          <p>By Mr. TAYLOR, by request, [S. 362] to amend section 1 of an act amendatory of the
            relocation of county seat acts--65 per cent, to petition.</p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the Senate returned to the consideration of his bill, [S.
            9] to provide anatomical subjects for dissection. The question pending at the
            adjournment last night being in an amendment to insert the words " medical
            associations " after the word " college " in section 2. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE opposed the amendment for the reason that it would establish in every county a
            dissecting room. The inevitable result would be a radical change--a chance for public
            dissections by medical societies in almost every county. A poor man dies in the county
            asylum, and the first rumor that goes abroad is that the doctors have got his body.
            " Let us go and see him," will be the cry. The law authorizes it, and
            the result will be great scandal. It is bad enough to have these bodies sent to the
            medical colleges, let alone giving this power to medical societies. The science of
            medicine will not be greatly advanced by this amendment, and it ought not to be
            adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON did not believe this amendment contemplates the public dissection of human
            bodies. He opposed giving monopoly to medical colleges, for there are many medical
            societies having as able members as are embraced in the faculties of medical colleges.
            If the right is given to colleges it should be given to associations also.</p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT thought the amendment very objectionable. He might possibly vote for the
            bill, but not for the amendment.</p>

          <p>Mr. URMSTON could see no valid objection to his amendment. Whether the meetings of
            these medical associations are public or not,they ought to be entitled to anatomical
            subjects as well as colleges. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN said the present law places the members of his profession under great
            disadvantages in this: the law requires them to be possessed of the highest order of
            knowledge and yet shuts the door for the obtaining of that knowledge. Senators are not
            warranted in intimating that medical societies would allow the public to witness the
            dissection of human bodies. He assured senators that the public taste would not be
            offended through the working of this amendment, should it become a law. The memories of
            physicians should frequently he refreshed, in many instances, and they should not be
            compelled to travel to some medical college to get an opportunity to refresh their
            memories. Unless this amendment is incorporated in the bill,it will not be of much
            benefit to the profession at large. This country owes <pb n="107" xml:id="VAA8558-17-109"/>a great deal to the medical profession. Physician went to the
            plague-stricken South recently, and in many instances while there attempting to relieve
            the suffering of others, themselves crossed over the dark waters of Jordon and rested in
            the beautiful country beyond.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER believed senators were ready to vote on this amendment. He hoped the
            amendment would be passed, otherwise the bill would be crippled and fail to meet the
            wants of the profession.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD would allow no one to go farther than he to advance the interests of the
            medical profession; but this bill is full of mischief and, should it pass, no act would
            cause more terror in the minds of the people. It is the worst piece of class legislation
            yet introduced into these halls. It proposes to give a particular right to 99 or 100
            societies in the State. This would be construed as a loathing license to go to the
            grave-yards and procure anatomical subjects: the bars will be broken down, and the
            grave-yards opened all over the State. This bill would prove to be a feeder to three or
            four medical colleges in the State. Senators should look to the effect on the minds of
            the people that this bill would have. The establishing of a saw-bones institution at
            every door, in the face of our children and our friends, is appalling, and ought not to
            be allowed.</p>

        <p>Mr. CALDWELL stated that the <orgName>Committee on Appointment</orgName> had been unable
          to have a full meeting, and therefore unable to make a report., and he moved that the

          <head rend="center"> REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.</head>
          <p> The committee on elections reported a bill [H. R. 453] to amend section two of an act;
            prohibiting for the election and appointment of supervisors of highways, which was read
            the first time. Also the bill [H. R. 270] to protect the ballot-box, with a report
            recommending its passage.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 31] to define certain practices in various courts, with a report
            recommending that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN explained that the object of this bill was to prevent the double trial by the
            mayor's court and justices of the peace.</p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORN of Elkhart, said the committee was compelled to look a little deeper. The
            bill would prevent any punishment by the State after the case was tried before a
            mayor's court, and was likely to favor criminals.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. GORDON the bill was referred to a special committee of five, with
            instructions to prepare a new bill on the subject.</p>
          <p>The bill[H. R. 35] providing for the election and qualification of justices of the
            peace, was returned, with a report recommending that the bill be indefinitely

            Dailey.</p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 53] defining who shall be competent witnesses, was returned, with a
            report recommending its indefinite postponement.</p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 60] to incorporate the Orphan' Home of New Albany, was

            administrators or guardians, was returned from the committee, with a report recommending

            back with a report recommending its indefinite postponement.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS stated that this bill changes the rule as to practice in the circuit courts
            only. He moved that the report of the committee be laid on the table and demanded the
            yeas and nays, which being ordered and taken resulted--yeas 51, nays 31. </p>

          <p> So the report of the committee lies on the table.</p>
          <p> On his further motion the bill was ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 48] fixing the time when actions shall stand for trial in the circuit

        <p>Prayer by Rev. W. B. F. TREAT, senator for the counties of Monroe and Lawrence.</p>
        <p> The reading of the minutes of yesterday's proceedings was dispensed with.</p>
        <p> On motion of Mr. MENZIES the House concurrent resolution, for a joint convention at 10
          o'clock to-day, to elect a State librarian and directors of the State Prisons
          north and south, was taken up, amended by changing the hour to 2 o'clock p. m.,
          and passed the Senate without a division. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, rising to a question of privilege, stated that early in the session he
          introduced a bill at the instance of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, which was
          read the first time, and referred to the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, but
          there is not a trace of it to be found in any of she records of the Senate, nor is it on
          the calendar, nor has it received a number. He claimed the right to have an exact copy of
          the bill placed on the calendar as having been passed the first reading early in the
          session, given a half number, and referred to the <orgName>Committee on
            Education</orgName>. There being no objection the bill was numbered S. 137 1/2 for an
          act to prohibit the disclosures of school examiners' papers prepared for
          teachers; and, without reading, it was placed on the files as referred to the
            <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">RAILROAD COMBINATIONS.</head>
          <p> On motion of Mr. STREIGHT, his joint resolution for instruction and request of Indiana
            congressmen to favor the passage of the bill passed by the lower House of the national
            legislature, to regulate inter-state commerce was taken up, with a committee report
            recommending its indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT spoke against concurrence in the committee report. It is understood by all
            parties that organized capital has a powerful lobby wherever legislation by that class
            is desired, but no plan can be brought about by which legislators can properly
            understand the wishes of the people on any given question. Unless the people can
            successfully strike against this great monopoly--this pooling--no man can ship surplus
            produce without bowing in submission to its iron rule. In this city, in one day, this
            pool caused our shippers to lose $40,000. Under these pool arrangements it la impossible
            to have competition. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE heartily joined the senator from Marion [Mr. Streight] in hoping the report
            would not be concurred in. There can come no harm from such a resolution as this.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON had a war to make in favor of right, and should continue such fight as long
            as he had a vote to cast. The combinations of these immense corporations practice great
            injustice upon the people, and, if Congress has the power so to do, the people should be
            protected against such a monopoly. He hoped the report would not be concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, as one of the committee who made the report, gave reasons for the action of
            the committee. It could see no good reason for passing the resolution,as the United
            States Senate is already advised of the wishes of the people by the action of the United
            States House of Representatives. The notion is in the direction desired by the
            resolution, and is unnecessary in the particular stage in which the subject now stands
            in the national legislature. He should sustain the action of the committee.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER: Whenever important measures are pending affecting the money power they
            find many supporters; but when the people desire action their measures are not so well
            supported. This Senate ought to pass this resolution, and he desired to urge congressmen
            to regulate railroad corporations so they shall be compelled to do justice to the
            people. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER heartily concurred in the remarks made in opposition to concurring in this
            report from the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>. The agricultural community only
            ask simple justice--that, a living rate be established for railroad transportation. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the step proposed to be taken was worthy of grave consideration. He
            was not willing to concede the power to Congress of legislating on our State tariffs. It
            is only where a railroad corporation run in or through one or more States that Congress
            has the power to interfere under the federal consti-[tution] <pb n="110" xml:id="VAA8558-17-112"/>[consti]-tution. It is competition which brings about just
            results. He seriously doubted whether the bill pending in Congress was in accord with
            the federal constitution. He opposed the resolution and favored concurrence in the
            committee' report. Railroad companies sometimes make unjust discrimination and
            business men sometimes takes unjust advantage of their opportunities. In every avenue of
            life ought the principle of competition to reule, and it is to the interest of every one
            to keep transportation routes open for competition. When, by some short-sighted view, we
            attempt to indorse the principles contained in the bill before Congress, we are treading
            on dangerous ground. When the right of congressional interferences is once recognized to
            confine or restrict to certain bounds, the right to regulate and dictate rates of
            transportation will soon follow; and he was surprised to see State rights men on this
            floor advocating the passage of the resolution offered by his colleague (Mr. Streight).
            This is too serious a question to give our adherence to after a short 30
            minutes' debate.</p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES favored concurrence in the committee reports, because believing in the
            reserving inviolate the rights of States, he was fearful of any power looking to a
            centralization of power. This resolution presents a most serious problem, viz: How to
            handle this great monopoly,Give such power to Congress and the railroad combination
            would own Congress in less than six months--body, soul, and breeches. He would rather
            pin his faith to the several Legislatures; the railroads might buy two or three but they
            have not enough to go all round. Some of these great corporations have more wealth than
            the Roman empire, and it will require master statesmanship to protect the people against
            these encroachments. It is unnecessary to ask the Senate, after the immature
            consideration afforded by a 40 minutes' debate, to act upon so important a
            measure. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD wanted exact justice as between the railroad and the people. He resolution
            does not contemplate the regulating of railroad freights in Indiana, but to favor a
            general freight bill for all the States. He was surprised senators would intimate to the
            contrary. Legislatures made the railroad companies, and it is a hard proposition to say
            we can not unmake or regulate them. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE compared this debate to a dispute between two Irishmen as to whether one was
            digging a hole or only pulling out the dirt while the hole dug itself. He made in
            effectual demand for the previous question.</p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE, while opposed to this resolution, did not desire to be understood as
            opposing the principle in it. He was not strongly in favor of instructing or requesting
            congressmen at any time or on any occasion. Railroads have conferred on this country
            almost inestimable blessings, and he would like to see competing lines everywhere and
            anywhere, all over this land. We can not expect freights to be the same throughout the
            entire line of the road.</p>
          <p>Mr. KENT also favored concurrence in the committee report. The State of Indiana can
            well afford to let this resolution alone. He doubted the power of Congress to pass such
            a bill as the resolution refers to. At least was willing to leave it in the hands of
            Indiana' representative in Congress.</p>
          <p>Mr. Langdon falls to see any legal reason why the committee should have brought in such
            a report on this resolution. The only question is whether it is for the interests of our
            people that we should vote the instruction contemplated by the pending resolution, and
            of that we are the sole judges. The people of this State are interested in inter-state
            commerce, and why should they not express their opinions on this subject through their
            representatives here? There ought to be something done in this direction. We have the
            indorsement of the Lower House of Congress, and now we only ask to instruct our senators
            to aid in cutting down a great abuse at as early a day as possible. WE should not sit
            silent and allow a few men to fix arbitrary rates for freight and put an iron heel on
            competition. He saw no judicial reason to sustain the report, and many why it should be
            rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, as far as the question of railroad is concerned, this Senate or any other
            may talk till Gabriel blows his last trumpet and nothing will be accomplished. It is not
            worth while to argue about matters of fact--principles may be discussed. To-day there
            are nearly $300,000,000 of foreign capital invested in railroads in this country that
            does not pay a cent of interest on the investment, while paying heavy taxes that relieve
            the burden of the resident tax payer and brings to this door every facility for getting
            surplus products to market, near and far away from this own door. While railroads have a
            corporate existence they are but individuals; they operate these companies for the
            purpose of making money out of them. The resolution goes so far as the say that congress
            may dictate to these companies what they shall charge for transportation of freights.
            Some senators doubt this right; there is not doubt about it; Congress has no right to
            regulate this matter; it would lead to imperialism, and this Senate surely is not
            prepared to vote against this committee report and thus place itself in such a position. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER came here to legislate for the people. The Jeffersonian principle is
            against all monopolies. He hoped the resolution would be adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT replied to some of the arguments made by the senator in favor of the
            committee report. This subject affects the interest of more people than any bill that
            will come before this body. He believed any senator opposing this resolution would
            oppose measures favorable to the people and leaning toward the interests of the
            railroads. This bill does not seek to legislate so as to fix the prices of
            transportation of freight. He protested against unfair representation in this debate,
            and urged the rejection of the committee report and the passage of his resolution. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The committee report was rejected by--yeas, 15, nays 32. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to amend by adding to the preamble a declaration that it is wrong for
            any railroad to carry freight and passengers for less than cost, with a reasonable
            profit added.</p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to lay it on the table.</p>
          <p>The yeas were demanded on the motion to lay on the table, pending which came the recess
            to 2 o'p.m.</p>

          <p>Mr. STREIGHT demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate--yeas 41,
            nays 8--and under its operation the amendment was being voted on, when a committee from
            the House of Representatives appeared to escort the Senate to the hall of the House for
            a joint convention, as provided for by amendment resolution, for the election of State
            librarian and prison directors. Senators left the chamber in charge of the House
            committee.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>When senators returned the amendment [Mr. Harris'] was rejected by--yeas 38,
            nays 9; and the resolution was adopted by--yeas 34, nays 13. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <pb n="111" xml:id="VAA8558-17-113"/>
          <p> The bill to which the resolution refers was read for information.</p>
          <p> Mr. GARRIGUS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: It seemed to
            be worse than playing blindfold for this Senate to say to members in Congress that they
            shall vote for that bill. He did not believe a half dozen Senators understood the
            provisions of the bill now, not even enough to say that our members of Congress ought to
            vote for it. And not believing it to be within the province of Congress to come in to
            the State of Indiana to regulate matters here, he should vote " no.
            "</p>

          <p>Mr. GRUBBS, when his name was called, said he believed senators and representatives in
            Congress were as immediate representatives of the people as we, and that they will vote
            properly upon the bill before them. He was in favor of regulating this matter as
            comprehended in the joint resolution, and if it were calling attention to the unjust
            discriminations practiced by railroad monopolies generally and asking Congress to
            legislate so as to regulate that matter, he would favor it; but as has been intimated by
            the senator from Howard (Mr. Garrigus) he was not sufficiently acquainted with the
            provisions of the bill to know whether it is wise to pass it or not. Therefore he would
            vote " no. "</p>

          <p>Mr. HEILMAN, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said: Believing as I
            do that this bill is a high handed outrage on men who have invested money in railroads.
            I am compelled to vote " no.".</p>

          <p>Mr. MENZIES, in explanation of his vote said as he understood this bill he took it to
            be in violation of a cardinal doctrine of the Democratic party--a violation of the
            rights of States--and he should oppose anything that would wantonly violate the rights
            of States; therefore he voted " no. ". </p>

          <p> Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said: Knowing this bill to be unconstitutional;
            believing it to be class legislation; that such action taken by this body would be
            dangerous in character and tend to disrupt the public peace, and interfere with the
            rules and laws of trade--a thing that ought to be condemned--and believing that no good
            can grow out of it, he desired to express his protest against it, first last, and all
            the time, and do what little he could to defend it. Therefore, he voted in the negative. </p>

          <p>Mr. SHAFFER,in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said, while he held
            the opinion, as expressed by other senators, that railroad transportation should be
            regulated in some way, yet, at the same time, he had always been very slow to attempt to
            instruct senators in Congress, or any person who knows more about any particular matter
            than himself, and therefore he voted "no."</p>
          <p> Mr. TREAT, when his name was called, was understood to say that, as he believed
            congressmen would cast their votes without regard to any remonstrances or instructions
            from us, he would vote "no." </p>
          <p>The result was announced as above recorded; so the resolution was adopted. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

        <p> The SPEAKER called, the House to order, and announced that the proceedings this morning

        <p>The reading of the journal was ordered, and read, until-- </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. HEROD, the future reading was discontinued. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER said that the first thing in order was the disposition of unfinished
          business, being the consideration of the resolution congratulating the country on
          resumption of specie payment, with a report recommending its indefinite postponement,
          submitted by the committee on Federal relations. </p>

          of the prisons north and south.</p>
        <p> Seats for senators were accordingly prepared on the right of the speaker. The committee

        <p> The report of the committee was rejected, and--</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. LEHMAN the resolution was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> The House took up the message just received from the Senate fixing the time of the joint

          afternoon. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. HUMPHREY the amendment was concurred in.</p>

        <p>The <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName> also returned a joint resolution

        <p>The resolution was passed the House of Representatives by--yeas, 90, nays, 2.</p>
        <p> Pending the roll call Mr. SHANKS, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote
          said: While he was opposed to instructing other people in the management of the business
          committed to them, he was constrained to vote for this resolution. He said that mem-[bers]
            <pb n="112" xml:id="VAA8558-17-114"/> [mem]-bers of Congress receive a salary of $5,000
          per year, and have since 1866, until repealed by what is coarsely called the salary grab,
          and that being repealed leaves the old law in force. In addition to the $10,000 per term
          each member receives $125 for stationery, and ten cents per mile each way, to and from the
          capital, when it costs him about three cents. Each member also receives five pine boxes
          filled with choice roots and plants, from the National Botanic garden, that is kept up at
          an expense of about $30,000 per annum. Prominent men in this and other States, by what is
          commonly called the "salary grab," attempted to repeal these perquisites
          Under that salary grab law every congressman paid for his own stationery, boxes and roots.
          He desired to protect the public treasury from all these outside expenses, and that all
          officers, State or National, might have a fixed, unmistakably defined salary.</p>
        <p> Mr. Speaker CAUTHORNE, when his name was called, said for the same reasons stated by the
          gentleman from Jay [Mr. Shanks] he should vote "aye." </p>
        <p>So the result was then announced, as above recorded. </p>
        <p>So the resolution was adopted.</p>
        <p> The <orgName>committee on federal relations</orgName> returned a resolution that we, as

        <p>On the motion of Mr. THOMPSON, the report lies on The table.</p>

        <p>On the motion of Mr. OVERMEYER the section of the old law set forth in the bill was
          stricken out. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER moved that the bill be engrossed as amended, without being printed.</p>
        <p> It was so ordered.</p>

          interest at the rate of 4 per cent., and to exempt the same from taxation, with a
          recommendation that the bill pass.</p>
        <p> On motion the bill was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> The committee also returned the bill [H. R. 59] to allow appeal from county board, with
          a recommendation that the bill do pass. The bill was ordered engrossed for the third

        <p>Also the bill [H. R. 21] abolishing the office of county assessor, with a recommendation
          that it lie on the table.</p>
        <p> The bill and amendments were recommitted to the committee.</p>

        <p> The Senate having thus agreed to consider the House concurrent resolution now, it was
          read by the clerk, when-- </p>
        <p>Mr. Grubbs moved to amend by striking out all that refers to electing a president of the
          several boards, and by striking out the word "two," where it refers to
          the election of trustees or commissioners, and inserting in lieu the word
          "one." He said no more important matter can come before the General
          Assembly than questions concerning the management of the benevolent institutions of the
          State. Such questions ought to be left outside of any political view whatever. We are
          governed, or should be governed, by law in this matter of electing officers of these
          benevolent institutions. We have no authority to elect a single one of them, though they
          all be vacant, unless it be in pursuance of the law approved March 5,1859. Not only is
          this power conferred by that law, but the time and circumstances under which we shall
          exercise those powers are fixed as well, and fixed in a way from which there can be no
          evasion by any session of the General Assembly until the law be changed. Two trustees at
          first were to be elected for each of these institutions, one to serve two years and the
          other four years, What was the purposes of the General Assembly in enacting that
          provision? Evidently that we might always have one man in the control of each institution
          who, by experience would be acquainted with its needs and wants. so there may never come a
          new and untried hoard. So the law provides that at each biennial session thereafter there
          shall be elected one member and not two. Vacancies by death, resignation or otherwise are
          provided for in a way perfectly consistent with the provisions of the first section of the
          act, If a vacancy is filled, the statute says it shall be for the unexpired term. That is
          the legislative interpretation of what is meant by this law. It does not take a lawyer to
          interpret the provisions of this law; its provisions are so plain and clear that no man
          need err in the interpretation of it. It provides that the biennial session of the
          Legislature shall only have the power, under any contingency, to elect but one member of
          the several boards of the benevolent institutions, while this resolution asks the Senate
          to take the law in its own hands and elect two. How is it with the president of the
          boards? The time, under the law, to elect occurred in 1877. The Legislature exercised its
          right and power and did elect, for a term of four years, the man who holds the position to
          day, and we have no right to elect again in 1879. The law provides that when elected he
          must be elected for the term of for the term of four years, and, as shown by a report from
          the secretary of state, made to the Senate yesterday, the term expired in 1877. </p>

        <pb n="115" xml:id="VAA8558-17-117"/>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES moved that the amendment [Mr. Grubbs'] be rejected and on that
          motion demanded the previous question. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE appealed to the senator to withdraw the demand for the previous question to
          allow a motion to postpone the election till Thursday, February 13. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE declared that unless there is time given to consider this matter further he
          should vote for the amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES withdrew his demand for the previous question. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE suggested to the senator from Morgan [Mr. Grubbs] to withdraw his amendment and
          allow the senator from Marshall [Mr. Reeve] to submit his motion.</p>
        <p> Mr. GRUBBS: Only upon this consideration, that when this resolution comes up if we
          desire to offer amendments we shall have the privilege of so doing without being bound by
          the previous question or having it called upon us. If gentlemen will consent to that 1

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> On motion by Mr. FOSTER the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">[S. 277--the
                <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>'s</ref>] concerning interest and
            usury was taken up. By consent the report of the committee of the whole, submitted
            January 31, was set aside and the bill considered by sections. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON offered a substitute for section 1, making the rate of interest 6 per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to amend the substitute so that citizens may receive the same rate of
            interest changed by the State on school fund loans. He insisted that it would not be
            consistent to make the legal rate of interest, less than the rate charged by the State
            for loans of congressional and other foods. You can not regulate by law the price of
            money any more than you can regulate the price of farm pro ducts. Money in this city is
            now being loaned at 6 and 8 per cent. The price for the use or forbearance of money must
            be fixed by supply and demand and the kind of security offered. it would be a misfortune
            for the people if the Legislature were to create a 6 per cent. law. He was willing an 8
            per cent. law should be passed, for it, is not fair to say that our citizens shall ask
            and receive a rate less than the rate asked and received by the State government. The
            effect of such a substitute as the one pending would be to drive money into the purchase
            of government bonds and out of the regular channels of trade. </p>
          <p>Mr HEFRON: Whenever the question comes up for us to determine the rate the State hall
            charge for her loans, then will be the time for us to consider such a proposition as is
            contained in the amendment proposed by the senator from Marion, [Mr. Harris.] Debts are
            created in 1,000 different ways other than in borrowing money, and it is to cover these
            larger mass of dealings, that the substitute is its tended to affect. This question of
            interest ought to be fixed at a right, and proper standing. Is it the borrower or the
            poor men of the State who are insisting the rate of interest shall be kept up at 8 or 10
            per cent ? It is the capitalists on this floor and in the lobbies who are insisting on
            the higher rate, while the people at large are demanding a reduction. We should not
            cater to a favored few, but enact measures that will benefit the masses of the people. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE protested against this pretense of discussing an interest law identically the
            same with the one now on the statute book. The question he desired the Senate to meet Is
            whether or not it will change the limit to which citizens shall go in agreements to pay
            for the use of money :--shall citizens have the privilege of contracting for money at a
            greater rate of interest than six per cent? It is not in the power of the Legislature to
            say a citizen shall not do a flung unless that thing is contrary to public morals or
            contrary to the preservation of the public liberty, person or property. He denied the
            assertion that the people are clamoring for a reduction of the legal rate of interest,
            which is now, as the statute provides, six per cent. In view of all the foreign loans in
            this State, renewals are absolutely necessary to prevent general bankruptcy; and is the
            Senate prepared to say the people shall not have this privilege if they choose to
            exercise it? Will this Senate say to them: your lands must go, you shall not have the
            privilege of renewing the loans you now have? </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL: The proposition to amend the substitute is provided for in the 9th section
            of this bill, and that effectually does away with the pending amendment. The question of
            interest has always been a subject of legislation, and every Democrat upon this floor
            comes here well instructed upon this question. We all know no man can promise to pay ten
            per cent, interest, or he does not intend to pay the principal. Shall the capitalist be
            allowed to loan his money at an exhorbitant rate of interest and so keep the poor man
            down? Certainly not. He would follow instructions, and let the responsibility rest with
            his constituents. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER believing we have enough votes to carry this question through, demanded the
            previous question. The demand was seconded by the Senate upon a division--affirmative
            29, negative 17, and the main question ordered by yeas 32, nays 17. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question the amendment [Mr. Harris'] was
            rejected by yeas 24, nays 26, and the substitute [Mr. Hefron's] was also
            rejected by yeas 23, nays 27. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved that section 1 be adopted, and on that motion demanded the previous
            question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under its operation the first section
            was adopted by yeas 48, nays 8, in the following words: </p>
          <p>"That the interest, on the loan or forbearance of money, goods or things in
            action, when the parties do not agree on the rate, shall be six dollars a year on one
            hundred dollars, and at that rate for a greater or less sum, or for a shorter or longer
            time, but it may be taken yearly, or for a shorter period in advance. And no agreement
            to pay a higher rate shall be valid unless the same be in writing, signed by the party
            to be charged thereby, and in such case it shall not be lawful to contract for more than
            eight per centum per annum." </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER offered a substitute for section 2, that judgments hereafter rendered shall
            bear the rate of six per cent., provided nothing herein shall be construed so as to
            prevent the <pb n="116" xml:id="VAA8558-17-118"/> taking of a higher rate or contracts
            already made.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT insisted the section as it stands in the bill is better than the proposed
            substitute.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to strike from the substitute the proviso. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS believed in cultivating a reasonable degree of commercial integrity. The
            proposed amendment would act as an incentive to men not to pay their debts, and
            consequently is not right. The section as in the bill is far preferable. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES regarded the substitute as effectually restoring the law as it was previous
            to February, 1873. While the section as in the bill would leave the law as it has been
            since that date. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON: The argument made by the advocates of this bill the other day was, that if
            a rate of six per cent were enacted, the people of this State would not renew their
            loans. If Senators were honest in that argument they ought not to support this measure;
            for this substitute would enable the borrower to evade the danger that would otherwise
            surround him. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: As the law now stands the judgment follows the rate of the note, not
            exceeding ten per cent interest. He moved that the substitute be rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER thought the substitute would prevent the harassing of the people by the
            taking of judgments. Under it the borrower will be indulged for mouths and probably
            years. If there is a question before the Legislature the people feel a great interest
            in; it is this very question of interest. He desired senators to act upon this matter
            with great care and deliberation. The section as it now stands should not be adopted.
            The substitute will afford great relief to a large class of our people. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and
            under its operation the substitute and amendment were both rejected by one vote.
            Sections was adopted without amendment by--yeas 29, nays 20--in the following words: </p>
          <p>"All judgments in contracts hereafter rendered shall bear the same rate of
            interest expressed in the contract. The court rendering the judgment shall specify
            therein the rate of interest the sum shall bear. In other cases the rate shall be six
            per cent." </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

            new matter. He thought the report ought not to be concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN urged the adoption of the report because it gave the people time to consider
            the matter, and fixed the time when the people would vote upon the question. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, thought the April election of 1880 was perhaps the better time
            to submit to these amendments. If the proposition to abolish the April elections should
            prevail it need not take effect until After the election in April, l88O. A fair
            submission to the people ought to be had, so it seemed to him the report should be
            concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS said it seems that the opposition was trying to cast odium upon these
            amendments and make an additional expense of a special election. He favored the adoption
            of the report. </p>
          <p>Mr. M1TCHELL was willing the people should have time to consider this question fully,
            but favored as little expense in the matter as possible. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS was in favor of an early submission of these amendments to the people--this
            spring, so that the fees and salaries of county officers might be regulated this year.
            He would favor a special session of the General Assembly, if necessary to do so. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved that the report of the committee lay on the table, and upon that
            motion demanded the yeas and nays. </p>
          <p>A call of the House being demanded and taken, discovered 93 members present. Further
            proceedings under the call were dispensed with. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The yeas and nays being taken upon Mr. Overmeyer's motion to lay the report of
            the committee on the table, resulted--yeas 52, nays 42. </p>
          <p>So the report was laid upon the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to fill the blank in the bill with "the first Tuesday in
            March, 1879." </p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
          <p> The yeas and nays being demanded and taken, resulted--yeas 41, nays 51. </p>
          <p>So the motion to lay on the table failed. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS moved to strike out the first Tuesday in March, 1879, and insert in lieu the
            first Monday in April, 1880.</p>
          <p> The SPEAKER stated that parliamentary rule requires the question shall be taken upon
            the longest time first, consequently the question recurs on filling the blank with the
            first Monday in April, 1880. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The yeas and nays being demanded and taken, resulted--yeas 41, nays 53. </p>
          <p>So Mr. Miers' amendment did not prevail.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. TULLEY made an ineffectual effort to adjourn--yeas 20, nays 74. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Warrick, moved to amend by inserting the second Tuesday in October,
            1879, and demanded the yeas and nays on his amendment. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the House and under
            its operation the House rejected the amendment of Mr. Taylor by yeas 18, nays 75. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS moved that the further consideration of the bill and amendments be postponed
            and made the special order for next Tuesday at, 10 o'clock a. m. </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER ruled the motion out of order under the operation of the previous
            question.</p>
          <p> Mr. MIERS and Mr. TULLEY appealed from the decision of the chair--Mr. Miers
            subsequently withdrew his appeal. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN moved to adjourn.</p>

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION</head>

          <p>The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o' clock, and announced the unfinished business,
            being Mr. Overmeyer's motion for the engrossment of the bill [H. R. 421].</p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS moved that the bill be recommitted to the <orgName>committee on the
              judiciary</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER claimed that it was not competent for any committee to change the date as
            fixed by the House this morning. Then why recommitt? This bill is nearly identical with
            the bill that submitted the Wabash and Erie canal amendment to the people in 1873. It is
            competent for this Legislature to fix the time for submitting these amendments. There is
            no need that this bill should go to the <orgName>committee on the judiciary</orgName>,
            and consequently he should oppose its reference.</p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart would submit amendments if he had an opportunity. He objected to
            the form of the ticket for the reason that it would confuse the voter and most likely
            force them to vote on all yes or no, without knowing the meaning of No. 1, 2, 3, etc.,
            of the amendments. He favored the printing of the amendments in full upon the ballot, so
            that the people may vote intelligently. He was opposed to the bill in its present
            shape.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question the yeas and nays were demanded on the
            motion to refer and being taken resulted--yeas 49, nays 43, so the bill was referred to
            the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER then moved that the committee be instructed to return the bill to the
            House to-morrow.</p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON moved for an order to employ a stenographer for the<orgName> committee on
              the State House</orgName> investigation.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLIARD offered an amendment which was accepted, that the committee report the
            cost of said stenographer, before engaged, to the House.</p>
          <p>The motion, as amended, was agreed to.</p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY introduced a bill [H. R. 456] for an act to require certain Gravel,
            McAdamized and Plank road companies to whom was relinquished the right of the State in
            the so-called National and Cumberland road to finish, complete and keep the same in
            repair, within a certain time, which was read the first time and passed to the second
            reading.</p>
          <p>Mr. Reed introduced a bill [H. R. 457] to amend section 6 of an act to divide the State
            into circuits for Judicial purposes, which was read the first time and passed to the
            second reading.</p>
          <p>A communication from the Auditor showing that the telegraph companies make returns to
            county officials of their lines except the L. N. A. and C. R. R. Co., who claim their
            line as a part of their property. </p>
          <p>A concurrent resolution from the Senate allowing the same pay as last session to the
            employes of the Senate, was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Also a concurrently resolution from the Senate that all printing paper, stationery,
            etc., used by officers or employes of this session shall be ordered through the State
            printing board; the auditor of state is authorized to issue his warrant therefor and
            charge the same to the general appropriation bill. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The yeas and nays were demanded upon the resolution, and being taken resulted--years
            53, nays 36.</p>
          <p>So the resolution was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Also a concurrent resolution of the Senate No. 7, for instruction to congressmen to
            favor a national law requiring the plaintiff in all cases where judgments are rendered
            in the Federal courts against persons resident in this State to cause a brief memorandum
            of the judgment to be sent to the clerk of the Circuit court of the county, etc. </p>
          <p>The resolution was concurred in.</p>
          <p>Also a Senate concurrent resolution No. 2, requesting our representatives in Congress
            to use their influence for the passage of the bill now pending before the U. S. Senate
            regulating inter-state commerce.</p>

        <p> On motion of Mr. HARRIS, the reading of the minutes of yesterday's proceedings
          was dispensed with. </p>
        <p>Mr REEVE Introduced a bill [S. 363] to consolidate certain funds [$15,197 96] belonging
          to the school fund into one non-negotiable bond, which was read the first time and
          referred, to the <orgName>committee on education</orgName>. These funds are now lying in
          the treasury unused, and can not be diverted to any other purpose than the use of the

        <p>On motion by Mr. DONHAM, the bill [H. R. 140] to legalize annexation of certain lands in
          Terre Haute was read the first time. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WOOLLEN, the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_060">[S. 60]</ref>--Mr.
          Wilson's, concerning the 6th, 7th, 44th and 45th sections of the circuit court
          act--making an exchange of judicial districts for the counties of Switzerland and Scott,
          was read the second time and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. TRAYLOR, the bill, <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_080">[S. 80 Mr.
            Kramer's]</ref> to abolish assessors and treasurers in town and cities, and to
          provide for the election of town marshals by the voters thereof, was read the second time.
          Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN and Mr. HARRIS desired to reserve the right to offer an amendment
          excluding the cities of Indianapolis and Fort Wayne from the provisions, of the bill, if
          they deem it advisable at a future day. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER, believed the more senators consulted with their constituents the more anxious
          would they be for the passage of this bill. It would save a great expense to the taxpayers
          which is now borne unnecessarily by the present plan of paying two sets of officials to do
          the same work. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend so that in cities and towns the assessment of township assessor
          may constitute the assessment. Imperative legislation for municipalities has been the
          means of so many of them becoming so largely in debt. Fifty men sitting here should not
          attempt to dictate to 3,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 40,000 people in any city or town. He hoped
          the bill would not pass in its present shape. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRISON--On 278th page of the 1st statutes will be found the law under which cities
          are operating. He would abide by the judgment of the Council of the city he represents in
          this matter, as soon as advised thereof. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER thought the amendment would practically destroy the object of his bill. He
          believed the provisions of the bill to be a good one. Why should the city duplicates show
          $50,000,000 and the county duplicate $40,000,000? There is no use of hiring men twice for
          doing the same work. If senators think their cities should be excluded from the provisions
          of the bill, he would not seriously object. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM thought the bill would save the town where he resides $1,000 or more
          annually. In times like these it is the duty of senators to vote for any measure that will
          relieve the tax-payer. He opposed the amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOODS: The office of city assessor is utterly useless, and undoubtedly should, be
          abolished. In nine eases out of ten he goes to the county assessor's books and
          copies the assessment therefrom. He hoped the amendment would be rejected, and the bill
          passed in its present shape, </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN was decidedly in favor of this bill, regarding it as a measure much desired
          by many of his constituents. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON favored the provision authorizing the adoption of the county or township
          assessment, for cities and towns. While there may be a necessity for cities to have an
          assessor, there is no necessity for towns having an assessor. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR was not able to say whether the bill ought to apply to cities or not, but he
          opposed the amendment because it will give towns the right to elect assessors, of which
          privilege many of them would be sure to avail themselves, and thereby keep up this useless
          expense. He also favored the election of marshals by the voters of the town. In his town
          the town assessor copies from the county assessor's books, and is well paid
          therefor. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE had heard nothing against the <pb n="120" xml:id="VAA8558-17-122"/> amendment
          except assertions, or hopes and wishes that it should not prevail. If his amendment had no
          merit in it, it should not be adopted, the bill prohibits the people from exercising their
          wills in a matter closely affecting their persons and property. A city has the power to
          levy its own taxes, and should have the power to assess the property to be taxed as a
          necessary accompaniment. Unless cue power does accompany the other, there is injustice
          unavoidable, and an infringement upon natural rights. Is it not right that citizens shall
          have the privilege of exercising their best judgments in this matter, or would you tie
          their hands and bind them to abide the judgment of a man whose record may show his
          judgment to be unsound.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to reject the amendment, which motion, under the operation of the
          previous question demanded by Mr. VIEHE, was agreed to by--yeas 23, nays 15. </p>
        <p>The bill was then ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

        <p> On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK his bill [S. 280] affecting his locality with reference to
          township libraries and taxes for their support, was read the second time with a committee
          amendment increasing the tax from one to five cents on the one hundred dollars, which was
          agreed to by consent, and the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading by--yeas 30,
          nays 9. It will apply only in cases where a private library of the value of $1,000 or over
          has been donated for public purposes. In such cases the township trustee may levy a tax
          for its maintenance. The only locality known to the affected by this bill is in the

        <p>On motion by Mr. LEEPER the <orgName>Committee on Insurance</orgName> had leave and
          thereupon reported to the Senate his bill [S. 303] to amend sec. 1 of the fire and life
          insurance act of March 14, 1874, with a recommendation that it pass. The report was
          concurred in and the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading, </p>
        <p>Some fifty or sixty bills were returned from committees with reports thereon, which were
          severally placed on the files of the Senate "without reading, under a custom
          sprung up this session, which is to erated by unanimous consent. </p>
        <p>Several leaves of absence were asked and obtained for senators until Monday and Tuesday. </p>
        <p>The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock p. m.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> On motion by Mr. HARRIS the Senate proceeded to consider the <orgName>judiciary
              committee's</orgName> bill on the subject of interest <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">[S. 277]</ref>, commencing with the third section thereof,
            where the Senate left the bill last evening.</p>
          <p> Mr. KRAMER moved to amend section 4 by providing that the excess of interest
            "over six per cent.' shall be deemed usurous and illegal. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK thought the amendment Should be agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. STRElGHT did not want to force people having money to loan to call in the services
            of a third party--a broker--through which loans must be negotiated, or a go between who
            will sell notes in order to get a greater rate of interest than the law allows. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR favored the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE resisted the adoption of the amendment. The place for a penalty is on the
            criminal side of the statute. In this case it will amount to nothing but a bid for men
            to commit crime, and pay disrespect to the law. The penalty should be fixed in the shape
            of a misdemeanor.</p>
          <p>Mr. DICE thought the amendment should be adopted to preserve the consistency of the
            bill, and make it definite and clear. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER insisted there ought to be a penalty clearly set forth for taking usurious
            interest.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILSON offered a substitute declaring that a person taking usurious interest shall
            forfeit all interest.</p>
          <p> Mr. V1EHE opposed it.</p>
          <p> It was rejected and the amendment (Mr. Kramer's) was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE--Under this nobody can commit an offense without some one to help, and he saw
            no justice in punishing one altogether and letting the other go free. </p>
          <p>Mr. V1EHE insisted the section was just right as it is. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE moved to strike out of the 9th section ail that refers to the public funds. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE opposed the amendment, preferring the section as it stands. </p>
          <p>Mr. STRAIGHT favored the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS hoped the Senate would be consistent on this subject. The State has
            possession of nearly four millions of dollars for which the State pays six per cent.,
            and is it reasonable to say individuals shall not stand on the common basis? </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM thought this would give a dangerous discretion to county officers,
            that it would allow them to loan to some at a less rate than to others. He hoped the
            amendment would be rejected. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill as amended was passed the second reading by yeas 37, nays 1. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call-- </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE, when his name was called, said he desired to explain his vote. He was not in
            favor of any interest law at all, upon principle. The Legislature might as well attempt
            to regulate the price of corn or wheat, or any other commodity, but believing a large
            majority of the people he had the honor to represent are in favor of a six per cent.
            interest law, he voted steadily all the time in favor of a six per cent. law. He was
            here to represent their wishes, and not being able to get a six per cent law, he would
            vote for the next least rate, and therefore voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR, when his name was called, desired to say in explanation of his vote, that
            it has always been a question with him as to whether there ought to be any interest laws
            at all. As the rate has heretofore been established at the rate of eight per cent. and
            from the fact that every $900 out of $1,000 in his co. is loaned ad six per cent., which
            was enough he voted yesterday for six per cent.; yet, as it seems to be the views of a
            majority of the members or the Senate that it would be right to contend for a higher
            rate than six per cent., he was anxious to vote for the next best thing, and as that is
            this bill, he would vote "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
          <p> So the bill passed the second reading. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion of Mr. LANGDON the constitutional rule was dispensed with--yeas 37, nays
            3--the bill read the third and last time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas 37, nays
            1. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p> Mr. KRAMER, when his name was called, said he came here with the intention of voting
            for a law regulating the rate of interest at six per cent , believing three-fourths of
            the people of this State want a law cutting the rate of interest down to six per cent.,
            but seeing no prospect whatever in this Senate to get the reduction of the rate of
            interest lower than eight per cent., and believing that half a loaf is better than no
            bread, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said, protesting against the whole bill, he voted
            " aye. " </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said, believing the
              <pb n="121" xml:id="VAA8558-17-123"/> whole system of legislating on the question of
            interest is as wrong as to legislate on the price of any commodity, and will result in
            working an injury to the class who wish to borrow; and believing all such laws are in
            and of necessity vicious within themselves, he voted "no." </p>
          <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded. </p>
          <p>So the bill finally passed the Senate, making the legal rate six per cent., with eight
            per cent. on contracts, judgments to bear same rate as contract. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the bill, [S. 136--Mr. Dice's] to regulate the
            use of human. bodies for the purposes of dissection, was taken up, read the second time,
            and ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT offered the following:</p>

        <p> The reading of the journal of yesterday's proceedings was read until--</p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. SCHWEITZER the further reading was dispensed until.-- </p>
        <p>The <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> returned Mr. Conner's bill [H.
          R. 421] for submitting the proposed constitutional amendments to the people, with
          amendments striking out all after the words "the first Tuesday in
          March," to cause to be distributed to each sheriff a sufficient number of
          ballots, on which shall be printed all the proposed constitutional amendments in their
          order; and that the governor shall issue his writ to the sheriff, stating the cause,
          object and the day of the election, and the sheriff shall give ten days' notice
          by publication, etc. </p>
        <p>The report of the committee was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER, moved that the bill be considered engrossed and put upon its passage, and
          demanded the yeas and nays thereon. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart stood committed to the propriety of these amendments, but under
          the present status of the bill he was compelled to oppose its passage. He was opposed to
          burdening the people with the expense of a special election. He thought the people were
          unprepared to vote intelligently upon these amendments for the reason that they had not
          time to consider them. He hoped that the bill would be defeated in its present shape. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the public mind fully prepared to vote intelligently, and insisted
          that the question should go to them as soon as possible. The question of economy prompted
          him to favor a speedy verdict from the people. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays being ordered and taken, resulted--yeas 50, nays 46. </p>
        <p>So the bill was considered engrossed, and read the third time, </p>
        <p>The question being, Shall the bill pass? </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER thought the cost of a special election would be less in March next, the
          time fixed in the bill, than to have these elections in 1880. Ho was of the opinion that
          if this House was disposed to harry important measures of this kind, there would be time
          enough to give due notice of the election. Should the bill be passed now, it can be in the
          Senate by 3 o'clock this afternoon, and read the first time to-day, and on Monday
          could be passed that body and be submitted to the Governor of the State for his approval.
          The people had discussed the matter a long time, and were well informed upon the subject
          matter of these proposed amendments, and were as well prepared to vote upon them now as at
          any future time. He gave it as his judgment that there would be a full vote. </p>
        <p>Under our present constitution we are unable to do any effectual work upon the subject of
          fees and salaries of county officers; and members well know that this was a subject the
          people are much agitated about, and demand relief, and this Legislature should give the
          people themselves a chance to incorporate into the organic law of their State a
          constitutional measure that will enable the Legislature to give them the relief they
          desire in this particular. He insisted that the bill now pending should pass without
          delay. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN demanded the previous question, and under its operations the House of
          Representatives failed to pass the bill for the want of a constitutional majority--yeas

        <p>Mr. SAINT, when his name was called, in explanation, said the vote he was about to give
          would be different from nearly all those of his party just cast. It was nevertheless
          consistent with what he had said and done on this subject. He voted against the
          constitutional amendments from principle, and gave this reason at the time, but a majority
          of this House having decided that they should be submitted to the people he did not see
          how he stultified himself, as had been intimated he would do, by voting for this
          resolution, fixing March 4 ensuing as the time for said election. It is not true that an
          election then will cost the State more money than in April or October, l880; for in the
          former case a special session of the General Assembly must be called to carry out the
          legislation proposed in said amendments, admitting, as any one must, that at least one or
          more of these amendments will be ratified by the people, and especially the one changing
          the October elections to November, and if that is ratified, the amount saved will be much
          larger than the expense of a March election. Certainly there was no inconsistency in
          voting for an early submission of a question that a majority hay decided against us, shall
          and ought to be submitted. </p>
        <p>Again, he found that among those who were the most hearty, if not the most numerous, in
          their congratulations of his vote originally given against the submission of said
          amendments, were the county officers from various portions of the State, showing
          conclusively that those who are in the enjoyment of high salaries and fees, are a unit
          almost in opposing the whole thing. Knowing that his constituents were demanding a
          reduction of the enormous fees and perquisites of public officers, and believing that it
          can be most successfully done under an amended constitution, and that it should be done at
          once, he voted "aye."</p>
        <p> Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said he was op posed
          to the first constitutional amendment because it disfranchises poor men. He thought it
          never ought to be submitted to the people. Whenever poor mechanics and laborers are living
          in tenement houses in small wards of cities and precincts of towns, the owners of the
          tenement houses can, under this amendment, disfranchise their tenants by ordering them to
          move within the 30 days preceding the election. Poor men have hardships and troubles
          enough already, without adding to the galling yoke of want and domestic distress, the
          incomparable misery of political disfranchisement. We come as members of this House
          largely by the votes of poor laboring men who do not own homes, but who are as honest and
          as deeply interested in political results as the richest in the land. We promised these
          poor men that we would legislate for them; that we would preserve their liberties and
          enlarge their opportunities, he made this promise in good faith, and should keep it
          sacredly by voting against this bill, and against ail other bills aimed at the dearest
          object of the poor man's political desire, a free and perfect liberty at the
          ballot box. He could not stultify himself by voting t submit in this way. Members in the
          Democratic party who voted with the Republicans for these amendments then said there was
          no party or politics in the mutter. Now they suddenly see great political significance in
          the passage of this bill. He stood by his political conscience, and no party could force
          him to smother it. He voted 'no," </p>
        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
        <p> So the bill failed for want of a constitutional majority of 51 votes. </p>
        <p>The <orgName>committee on apportionment </orgName>returned the bill<ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_340"> [H. R. 340]</ref> to apportion the State for legislative
          purposes, with amendment, and, when so amended, recommend the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p> Pending the consideration of the report from the committee, the House took a recess for
          dinner.</p>

          <p>Mr. SAINT, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he was opposed to

            another district could be formed that would do justice to his people, he voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he could not I
            vote for this bill because he believed it unjust. He said he came here pledged to a fair
            apportionment, and believing this bill would work an injury to any party fostering it.
            He, therefore, voted "no. ' </p>
          <p>The result was then announced as above recorded. So the report was rejected. </p>
          <p>The clerk, by order of the speaker, read the bill by sections, each section being

          <p> Pending the order for the introduction of bills.--</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON gave notice that on Tuesday, the 10th day of February, 1879, he should
            move to amend the rules by adding to rule 49 these words: "Nor shall any rule
            be suspended except by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members present." </p>
          <p>On motion, by Mr. COMSTOCK, the vote of yesterday afternoon ordering the engrossment of
            his bill [S. 280] in relation to public libraries, was reconsidered, the tax authorized;
            herein to be levied by township trustees for the maintenance of such libraries was
            reduced from five to two cents on the $100 valuation, and the bill, as amended, was

          <p>On motion by Mr. GARRIGUS the bill [S. 17--Mr. Kent's]to enable the owners of
            wet lands to drain and reclaim the same was taken up. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT stated that the report of the committee recommends striking out all after the
            enacting clause and inserting new matter. He suggested it unnecessary to read anything
            except the substituted bill as embodied in the report of the committee.</p>
          <p> The report of the committee being read-- </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE said he would not submit with the few members present to patting that bill on
            its second reading now. He moved its further consideration be postponed till Monday, and
            that 200 copies be printed. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT has had this matter of preparing a drainage law under consideration for a long
            time, with the senator from Howard [Mr. Garrigus] They had called to their assistance
            some of the best tale;t in the State, and he was not mistaken in saying this substitute
            would make the best drainage law ever drafted in Indiana. It provides against all
            possible contingencies, and he was very anxious it should become a law. One reason he
            was asking early action on this substitute is that it has been submitted to the House
            committee, and members of that committee desire the Senate shall take action on this
            bill that they may have the benefit thereof. He had no objection to the pending motion
            if the bill be taken up at 2 o'clock Monday. </p>
          <p>The motion [Mr. Reeve's] was agreed to. </p>
          <p>And the Senate adjourned, under the order above set forth, till Monday at 2
            o'clock p. m.</p>

        <p>Mr. MIERS, with all due deference, thought Mr. Carter ought not be a member of the
          committee, bat ought to be invited to go along. Mr. Carter had already committed himself,
          and therefore, was not qualified to sit as a juryman. The committee ought to have Mr.
          Carter as a witness. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT: Mr. Carter has denied that he knows or any crookedness. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD insisted that as the proposition proposes to change the rules it must lie
          over for one day. </p>

        <p>In the absence of the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR the Senator from Jackson (Mr. Burrell) took the
          chair and called the Senate to order, under authority from the Lieutenant Governor, who,
          by telegraphing from his home in Union City, exercised his right to name any Senator to
          perform the duties of the chair for a time not extending beyond an adjournment.</p>
        <p>Prayers were uttered by Rev. J. O. McCullough, pastor of the Plymouth Congregational
          church, of this city.</p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER directed the reading of the Secretary' minutes of
          Saturday' proceedings. But they were not at hand, whereupon on motion of Mr. KENT
          the reading of the Journal was dispensed with for the present. He then moved that the
          Senate proceed to the consideration of the special order--being his bill [S. 17] to enable
          the owners of wet lands to drain and redrain the same where it can not be done without
          affecting the rights of others. </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
        <p>Mr. KENT also moved that the report of the committee thereon be concurred in. He said
          there was an absolute necessity for a good law on this subject. He gave a review of the
          history of legislation on this subject in the past few years. He would be willing to see
          the law of 1875 repealed, but it may be of advantage where ditches are to be made of the
          length of three miles or over. The major part of the first section is the same as the law
          of 1867. This section differs, however, where reference is made to the owners, by
          declaring the transfers are first evidence. Section four is an innovation on the law of
          1867. It is intended to drain the entire water shed for a distance of three miles, at
          ordinary stages. Section 10 makes the engineer the sufficient judge as to the capacity of
          the ditch where completed. Section 11 is similar to the law of 1867, as also are sections
          13, 14, and 15, and from section 16 and on the bill is different. In a short space of time
          ditches are usually clogged or destroyed, and a drainage law would be a failure without
          some provisions to keep the ditches in repairs, and so the remainder of the bill makes
          ample and just provisions in that direction. The assessments for keeping up repairs should
          be in proportion to the benefits, as this bill provides. This drainage act ought to pass.
          The committee has given to it more than usual thought and consideration. He hoped the
          report would be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped this matter will not be pressed to-day. A few years ago a drainage law
          was passed, that cost a large amount of money to get the people out of its meshes under
          advantage, taken by speculators. This is a long bill, and senators should have more time
          for its consideration.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE wished the Senate to take such steps as would be fair to the author of the
          bill, and to all concerned. By an implied understanding made last Saturday, this bill
          should be considered by the Senate this afternoon, as it author desires leave of absence
          for several days from to-night. He called attention to this bill as being the fairest
          drainage law ever presented in this State--inimical though it be. The bill starts out by
          giving power to any "who may be interested" to rob the owners of the
          State, by getting up a job. The veriest brain talent enough, is of course
          "interested" enough to get up a plan for ditching which can not be done
          without affecting the rights of others. He defied any man to put together in language such
          an immaculate set of absurdities as are contained in the first section of this bill. It
          proposes to assess benefits and damages to something that has not existence. Can you put
          your finger upon an instance where you can step in and take possession of another
          man's property without giving the owner notice? No where. Yet in this bill there
          may be proceedings had fastening a lien upon a man' land without the owner having
          a chance to be heard for a single moment. The first notice the owner has under this bill
          is to appear and see the assessment made. How grand and <pb n="128" xml:id="VAA8558-17-130"/> gloriously magnanimous--puissilanimous and insignificant.
          [Laughter.] This bill would allow any fellow who wants the power to mortgage any
          man's land to employ an engineer to do that which Kings dare not do. What would
          you think of such a proceeding as that under other circumstances? What would you think of
          a law that would allow any galoot who might desire to rob you, to go to work and on that
          desire employ an engineer, and obtain an order from the County Commissioners and without
          notice to you appoint three appraisers who make their assessment which is put on record,
          and thereupon he should be reimbursed for all the outlay made by himself and the very
          moment it is seconded it becomes a lien on poor land. It further provides that he may go
          on and complete the ditch--it gives him greater power than is possessed by a king, an
          emperor or the czar of all the Russias--he may do all this and unless you pay according to
          the assessment your land goes. Damn such laws and the men who undertake to crush down the
          rights of citizenship under such kind of legislation [not referring to any senator, but
          only to the principle underlaying this kind of legislation], the brain of the man, that
          conceived it ought to be damned to eternal misery. Laws under the right of eminent domain
          should be enacted only where the public interest requires them, and then the public should
          bear the expense. This is a miserable, cowardly subterfuge to rob men of their hard
          earnings, and take away farms they have been a life-time in clearing up, by allowing
          county commissioners, acting under imperative statutes, to appoint a man who, without
          notice, can levy assessments, convert them into mortgages, foreclose payments and issue
          executions where owners of property have no more power than a new-born babe to protect
          themselves. Why will men rise up in deliberate bodies and advocate such legislation as
          this? May God forgive them, for they know not what they do. [Laughter.]</p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES: Has the General Assembly the constitutional power and authority to pass this
          bill? If not, any further consideration is a waste of time. Has the General Assembly the
          right to confer on any citizen the power to appropriate property of other citizens for
          private uses? To get around this difficulty these words are put in this bill, "or
          when the same shall be of public utility, and be conducive to the public health,"
          well knowing without them it could not stand before this Senate an hour. But these words
          can not bring this bill within the right of eminent domain. The State can not take the
          property of the citizen without compensation The public benefit is something that goes to
          the whole community, and is something that has to be kept up by the public. A public
          improvement must be kept open by public taxation. If this bill calls for a ditch that is
          not to be a public ditch, then there can be no authority given to infringe on private
          property. He read from legal authorities to sustain his position. Here is an attempt to
          infringe on a cherished right, put in every bill of rights in this country, that you
          cannot take private property for private uses. The senator from Marshall (Mr. Reeve) did
          not characterize this bill too strongly when he said it bordered on the infamous. When he
          had concluded.-- </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. KENT the further consideration of this bill and pending report thereon,
          from the committee on swamp lands, was made the special order for this day week at 2
          o'clock p. m. </p>
        <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR took the chair. Prayers were uttered by Rev MYRON W. REED, of
          the Third Presbyterian church</p>
        <p> Mr. FOWLER offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the committee on
          benevolent institutions to send for persons and papers. Also, a resolution requesting
          officers of all benevolent and reformatory institutions to furnish a list of employes,
          their compensation,whether relatives of any person in authority, etc., which was also
          adopted.</p>
        <p> On motion, by Mr. HARRIS, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on
          the second reading: </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 12--Mr. Harris'] concerning the trial of civil causes in circuit
          and superior courts, was read the second time.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS explained: This bill simply provides that any party to a civil suit may,
          before the argument begins, tender to the court what he thinks to be the law in writing,
          and the court indicates whether it shall be given; it so, the lawyer can say to the jury,
          "The law in this case is" so and so. It gives this advantage where there
          is a dispute as to what the law really is, that dispute may be settled in advance of the
          argument. This provision is taken from the law of Kentucky, where any party demanding it
          may have ail the questions of law decided before argument. </p>
        <p>Mr BURRELL objected to the bill because it leaves the court to decide, from the written
          instructions submitted, as to which shall be the law that shall govern that case. That is
          an innovation which ought not to be made. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE thought the bill gave sufficient latitude--the court could hear argument if it
          wished; if not it would not be worth while to argue. The bill is right just as it is. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS his bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>
        <p> The bill [S. 14. Mr. Kahlo's] to legalize the annexation of certain territory
          to the town of Logansport was read the second time, with a favorable report from a special
          committe, substituting a new bill, which was numbered <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_379">S.
            379</ref>, with the same title.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE; This bill embodies an important question: As to the right of the Legislature
          to cure not only simply defective acts of municipal corporations, but the right to make a
          law now which would have the same force and effect had there been no defective legislation
          or act on the part of the corporation. If this Legislature adopt this bill and it becomes
          a law it is a declaration that the Legislature may pass an expost facto law--a law
          impairing the obligation of contract, and declaring that to be legal which never had any
          existence in fact or in law--that it may pass a law divesting vested rights, and that it
          may assume jurisdiction over that which a co-ordinate branch of the Government has already
          decided adversely. These questions must be decided by the Senate, if this report be
          concurred in. Retroactive legislation is admissable to the extent where power is conferred
          upon a subordinate which attempts to exercise that power in a way which is defective; but
          if in attempting to exercise that power it exercises a power never granted, it not is
          within the reach of curative statutes. Be then presented to the Senate a statement of the
          facts surrounding the cases affected by this bill. Mr. R made a long speech in opposition
          to this class of curative legislation, warning members against retroactive bills in
          general, and all propositions that may in the remotest manner affect vested rights. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE, being a member of the committee to which this bill was referred, felt it a
          duty to say a few words in behalf of the relief sought for. Of late years legalizing bills
          have become entirely too frequent in the Legislature, still there are cases where it is
          eminently proper that a legalizing bill should be passed. He then gave a statement of the
          facts in the cases affected by this bill, in one of which he contended the local
          authorities had sufficient power to act, though imperfectly done, and save reasons which
          induced him to support the bill under consideration. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON opposed the cutoms of corporations coining before the General Assembly to
          settle their lawsuits of course there are many eases where equity demands that curative
          acts shall be passed; but Legislatures <pb n="132" xml:id="VAA8558-17-134"/> should
          proceed with a great deal of caution with such legislation. That sort of practice is a
          dangerous one. As there seems to be grave questions of doubt as to the facts in this case,
          and believing it should receive due consideration, he moved to refer the bill and report
          to the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>.</p>
        <p>Mr. KAHLO declared the passage of this bill was in accordance with the wishes of the
          entire people of his county, with the exception of not more, perhaps, than 20 persons,
          principally men owning large tracts of lands effected. Unless this bill is passed the city
          will be left in a bad condition pecuniarily, as there is an indebtedness of about $400,000
          hanging over it.</p>
        <p>Mr. TREAT understood the act passed two years ago exempting from taxation for city
          purposes farming lands within the boundaries of incorporated towns, was intended to meet
          such cases, and that some of these parties desired to get rid of taxes assess prior to the
          passage of this act. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS inquired of the special committee which made this report, if the court at
          Logansport, has pronounced judgment in this case? </p>
        <p>Mr. V1EHE, a member of the committee referred to, was understood to say that the validity
          of this annexation was not involved in a case passed upon by the court. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, in his seal, was understood to say the court was to have rendered judgment in
          this case last Saturday. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS was not in favor of the passage of legalizing acts as a general thing, but if
          the people residing on this territory have considered themselves as part of the city of
          Logansport, and have received benefits thereby, and have sent a representative to the
          common council, they should be included as part of the city, and be would vote to concur
          in the report of the committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT stated the custom to be where special legislation is asked for by any member
          for his particular locality, it is generally granted because it is supposed their
          immediate representative is advised as to what his people want; and in that view of the
          case he proposed to vote with the senator from Cass (Mr. Kahlo) on this bill. </p>

        <p>Mr. DICE--Senators should consider first where we have the right to legalize acts of the
          authorities of the city of Logansport, and secondly, if we have the power, whether it is
          expedient to do so. As the first question, he called attention to numerous acts that have
          heretofore been passed legalizing actions of incorporations throughout the State. The
          supreme court has in numerous instances declared that the Legislature has the power
          absolutely to legalize even void acts. He quoted authorities to sustain his position. He
          understood that his trouble to arise from a mistake, and gave reasons why he thought it
          expedient to pass this bill as a matter of just and right.</p>
        <p>The motion to refer to the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> was rejected.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The report, of the committee was concurred in by yeas 32, nays 12, and the bill referred

          <p>Mr. FOWLER, gave notice that on Thursday at 10 o'clock a. m. he should move to

          <p> Mr. FOSTER offered a resolution referring to the charges in the Indianapolis Daily
            Journal of the 7th inst. against the principal secretary of the Senate; declaring that
            certain senators believe him unworthy the confidence of the Senate, and appointing
            Messrs. Foster, Woollen and Harris a committee to investigate the charges and report the
            result of their investigation to the Senate at the earliest possible moment. </p>

          <p> The bill [S. 16--Mr. Dice's] in reference to changes of venue in cases of
            preliminary examinations for felony, was read the second time and ordered engrossed; as
            was also the bill [S.22--Mr.Foster's] to legalize acts of trustees of the town

          <p> The bill [S.23--Mr. Shaffer's] to legalize certain acts of the town of

          <p>The bill [S. 25--Mr. Reiley's] to amend section 1 of the superior act of March
            5, 1877, was read the second time.</p>
          <p> Mr. TRUSLER said bill S. 187 covers all in this bill, and as it was preferable he
            would like to see this one laid on the table. He made that motion. </p>
          <p>It was agreed to.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill [S.33--Mr. Comstock 's] to abolish the April election was read a
            second time with a committee report recommending indefinite postponement. The report was
            concurred in by yeas 30, nays 15. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill [S. 10--Mr. Dice's] fixing the mileage and per diem of members add
            employes of the Assembly was read a second time with a majority report from the
              <orgName>committee on fees and salaries</orgName>, recommending a substitute therefor,
            and a majority report recommending indefinite postponement. The letter report was
            concurred in by yeas 23, nays 21. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. GRUBBS his bill [S.34] providing for voluntary assignments of real and
            personal property, in trust for the benefit of creditors by insolvents, providing in
            what manner and in what cases a discharge may be granted to such insolvent, was taken
            from the table, and on his further motion the Senate agreed to consider it by sections. </p>
          <p>The first section was agreed to by consent. </p>
          <p>Messrs. Reeve, Fowler and Streight spoke in opposition, and Mr. Grubbs in favor of the
            bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON opposed the motion to indefinite postponement. There are defects in the
            present assignment law, and this Legislature could do no better work than to overhaul
            the statute. </p>
          <p>Mr. V1EHE--There may be some objections to this bill that ought to be sustained, but
            there are some good features in it, and, consequently, he was opposed to indefinitely
            postponing it. This bill provides that a person who receives a dividend shall release
            his claim. Such an important bill as this should not be postponed indefinitely. This is
            not a bankrupt law, as it has been characterized on this floor. When a debtor is
            hopelessly involved, it is for the public good that his assets should be distributed
            among his creditors. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS--This motion means, if sustained, that we will indefinitely postpone the
            whole subject of State assignment law. Our present law is very deficient. The courts can
            not tell what it means sometimes, and a good deal of litigation grows out of its
            uncertainty. Let us take this bill up, section by section, and let us perfect a bill
            that will not be made use of as a cloak to cover up fraud. What a man <pb n="133" xml:id="VAA8558-17-135"/> owns is held for the benefit of all his creditors, and that
            is right. This bill points out a method for securing that end. A man insolvent ought not
            to have the right to give preference to one over another of his creditors.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES insisted that the Legislature has no power to give a discharge to a
            debtor. The only chance Congress has to override vested rights is through the passage of
            a bankrupt law. In deference to the author who has given so much thought to this bill,
            the pending motion ought not to prevail.</p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS asked for his bill the calm and deliberate consideration of the Senate. It
            was by far more perfect than the existing law. </p>
          <p>Mr WOOLLEN thought it would be the proper thing to submit this bill to a special
            committee of three lawyers, with instructions to incite it the basis of changing the
            present assignment law leaving out the discharge feature. He made that motion--Mr.
            Streight withdrawing his motion for that purpose.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE characterized the present assignment law as perfect, and subject only to the
            usual legal technicalities: and did not think any three lawyers here could improve on
            its provisions. He suggested the special committee be further instructed to report what
            defects they can find in the present law. </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. FOSTER, the whole subject was laid on the table and made the special
            order for Friday at 10 o'clock a. m. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

            certain cases, with amendment, and when so amended that the bill do pass. It was ordered
            engrossed.</p>
          <p> Also the bill [H. R. 75] to limit appeals to the Supreme Court, with a recommendation
            that the bill do pass. Less than $200 can not be appealed to the Supreme Court. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS moved to amend so that the party shall first file his or her affidavit that
            he or she has a meritorious cause of action, and that the appeal is not taken merely for
            delay. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT said he was opposed to the amendment, for the reason that there was not one
            party in a hundred to any cause but what will readily make an affidavit, upon the
            suggestion of his attorney, that his cause is a meritorious one, and whereby defeat the
            object of this bill, which is to diminish the large number of unimportant appeals to the
            Supreme Court. He regarded this as one of the most important bills that will come before
            this body, and will go far toward remedying a very great and growing evil in our
            judicial system, if this amendment fail and the bill passes. To limit all appeals to
            cases where the amount in controversy is $200 or over, will relieve our supreme court of
            a large amount of unnecessary labor. It seemed to him it would cost more than the amount
            recovered to appeal, where the amount was less than $200, and would leave more time for
            the judges to devote to the consideration of more important cases; therefore he was
            opposed to the amendment, and hoped the bill, as reported, would pass. He would vote to
            concur in the report of committee. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected, and the bill was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>The <orgName>committee on organization of courts </orgName>also returned the bill [H.
            R. 307] to amend sec. one of an act to divide the State for judicial purposes, with a
            recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 351] to authorize justices of the peace to appoint substitutes
            with amendments, and when so amended that the same do pass. It was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 356] to amend sec. 64 of an act for the election and
            qualification of justices of the peace, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
            postponed. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 367] to limit the number and increase the jurisdiction of
            justices of the peace with a recommendation that the bill do pass. </p>
          <p>Mr MARCH moved to amend in section two by striking out four and inserting $500. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK proposed an amendment, by striking out the word "two"
            and insert "one" justice. The object was to provide the township with
            one justice, instead of two. </p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY moved an amendment to the amendment "where the population does not
            exceed 2,000 voters." The amendment to the amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS moved to reconsider the vote just taken, adopting the amendment of Mr.
            Kirkpatrick. </p>
          <p>The motion to reconsider was objected, and the bill ordered to the engrossment. </p>
          <p>The House then adjourned.</p>

        <p>Prayer by Rev. Mr. Jones, of the Sixth Street M. E. church of this city. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER introduced a bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_382">[S. 382]</ref> to provide
          for the government of the Hospital for the Insane, and providing for the admission of
          persons thereto, both curable and incurable, which was referred to the <orgName>committee
            on benevolent institutions</orgName>. </p>
        <p>The order of business for Wednesday, under the rules, being the consideration of bills on
          the third and last reading in the Senate--</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_006">[S. 6, Mr. Sarnighausen's]</ref>
          legalizing acts of ex-notaries public, was read the third time, and finally passed the
          Senate by yeas 43, nays 2. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the bill [S. 136, Mr. Dice's] in relation to the
          use of human bodies for the purpose of dissection was read the third time and finally
          passed the Senate. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 9, Mr. Sarnighausen's fully described in these reports of Feb. 4.]
          to promote the success of medicine and surgery by furnishing subjects for anatomical
          dissection, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER was conscientiously opposed to the passage of this bill, and he believed nine
          out of every ten of the voters of this State will be opposed to it. He would vote against
          it for the further reason that it proposes to furnish subjects for the dissecting knife
          from the poor and unfortunate class of our fellow-citizens. These poor creatures, so
          unfortunate as to have to live and die in the poor house is enough of sorrow for them
          without the addition of a statute who will say that when they die their bodies shall
          become public property and turned over to the tender mercies of the dissecting knife. Then
          he opposed the bill be cause it would establish a dissecting room in every county in the
          State. If this bill should pass he would favor the passage of another doing away with all
          burying grounds attached to poor asylums, for thereafter there will be no use for them. A
          man to-day may be surrounded with all the comforts of life, but to-morrow may bring about
          a reverse of fortune and he may become as poor as the poorest; and by voting for this bill
          how does any senator know but that indirectly he may be voting as public property the
          bodies of his own or his neighbors' children, who may, by the vicissitudes of
          life, find a death-bed in a poor asylum. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT spoke in favor of the passage of the bill. He would not favor a measure that
          would turn over to physicians for dissection all the bodies of those who may die in
          charitable institutions, but this bill, by an amendment proposed by himself, saves such
          from the dissecting knife as may express such a wish.</p>
        <p> Mr TREAT characterized the bill as anti-Christian, anti civilization, and odious in the
          sight of God and man. It is one of the most injudicious measures ever presented to a
          legislative body. No man familiar with the history of the world will call in question the
          fact that a respect for the human body as the temple of the soul, and a regard for the
          sacredness of human life, marks the development of science, of civilization and of
          religion. The respect manifested for the poor and the unfortunate is also a test of
          advancement in civilization. This bill proposes to make such a disposition of the bodies
          of the poor and the unfortunate as but very few of us or our friends are willing to make
          of theirs. We should not make such a disposition of the bodies of the poor that we would
          not make of our own or those of our friends. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN referred to the well known fact that prejudices are deep-seated, and in many
          instances set the better of the judgment. Physicians engaged in the active duties of their
          profession must have material with which to refresh their memories on the subject of
          anatomy and add to their knowledge of surgery. The Senate has just passed a stringent law
          against grave robbing, and now will it say we shall be estopped from learning anatomy and
          physiology and still hold us responsible in person and property for malpractice? That
          would be the grossest inconsistency. He had as deep sympathy as any one for the poor and
          the unfortunate, but under this bill no man on account of poverty will be put to any <pb n="136" xml:id="VAA8558-17-138"/> disadvantage. If worthy, his kin folk to the sixth
          degree of consanguinity can claim the body. It is a well known fact that a great many die
          in alms houses whose relatives even disown them, and their bodies will become material
          which we can use under this bill. It is a class of persons without friends, which nobody
          cares for, that is made use of for anotomical purposes. Were the people made acquainted
          with the provisions of this bill, no doubt a majority would be in favor of it.</p>
        <p> Mr. W. appealed to the Senate, in behalf of his profession, to pass this bill. Anatomy
          is a science that depends upon the memory, the minute details of which will fail from the
          memory in the routine of business life, and we must dissect and redissect in order to
          understand how to replace a dislocation or reduce a fracture in the human body; and yet
          there is an unwillingness on the part of some senators to pass a law that will furnish the
          necessary subjects. Is it right and just?</p>
        <p> Messrs. Riley. Sarnighausen and Reeve spoke in favor of the bill.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> It was finally passed the Senate by--yeas 28: nays 18. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill [S. 12--Mr. Morris'] described early in yesterday's
          proceedings concerning the trial of civil causes in circuit and superior courts, was read
          the third time and passed the Senate by--yeas 38, nays 6.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill [S. 16-Mr. Dice's] but for one change of venue on preliminary
          examinations in cases of felony, was also finally passed by--yeas 44, nays 0. </p>

        <p>The bill [S. 22--Mr. Foster's] legalizing certain acts of the trustee of the
          town or New Haven, was also finally passed in the Senate by--yeas 36, nays 6. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill [S. 23--Mr. Shaffer's] legalizing acts of the trustees of the town
            of Huntington, was read the third time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas--31, nays
            8. </p>
          <p>The court bill [S. 60-Mr. Wilson's] making an exchange of the counties of
            Switzerland and Scott in judicial districting. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS regarded the exchange as unwise, and as probably sought for on account of
            political reasons more than anything else. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN desired the passage of the bill principally because the contiguity of
            territory is far better if the proposed exchange is made. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill passed the Senate by yeas 30; nays 14.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON, when his name was called, asked but failed to obtain an excuse from voting. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 80--Mr. Kramer's, fully described in these reports of Feb. 7] to
            abolish assessors and treasurers in towns and cities. </p>
          <p>Messrs. HARRIS and SARNIGHAU5EN were not willing to have the bill passed without an
            effort to so amend it that cities may not be compelled to do away with these officers.
            They were willing to leave it discretionary. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER moved to recommit. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON favored the abolishment of the office of assessor, but was opposed to the
            election of marshals by the people, as they were necessarily thrown with the rowdy
            elements of society, and in nine cases out of ten fail to prosecute that class of
            individuals to whom they look for support at the polls. He favored the motion to
            recommit in the hope that that portion of the bill will be stricken out. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER opposed the motion to recommit. He was willing to except from the provisions
            of the bill the cities of Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, so it may be left optional with
            these cities whet lier they abolish these offices or not. There are always a number of
            candidates for marshal who will favor unqualified men for the office of trustee in order
            that they may get the place of Marshal. Now, which is worse--to have Trustees who are
            incompetent, elected to an important office where they control great financial and other
            interests or to have a town marshal elective, though he may occasionally jail to
            prosecute offenders against the law?</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to recommit the bill with instructions to so amend it as to exclude
            all towns and cities from the operations of the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE offered a substitute so as to make it optional with all cities and towns
            whether they come under the operation of the provisions of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE thought the question was settled the other day that the bill should pass with
            the amendment suggested by the Senator from Marion (Mr. Harris). He opposed any further
            amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON would not favor any proposition to disturb the bill, where it refers to the
            office of marshal. There is no necessity for cities and towns to have an assessor, or to
            make separate assessments. If the word "may" be inserted before the
            word "marshal," who is to determine the question? He desired the bill
            in this case to be imperative.</p>
          <p> Mr HARRIS proposed, as a substitute, to re-commit the bill to a committee of one, with
            instructions to amend the bill, so that cities "may" and towns
            "shall" abolish the office of assessor, and report at 4
            o'clock. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL favored his own proposition in preference to this.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. KRAMER desired immediate action, under the operations of the previous question,
            demanded by Mr. GARRIGUS. The substitute [Mr Harris'] was adopted by--yeas 28,
            nays 17. Thereupon the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR appointed Mr. Harris as said committee. </p>
          <p> Subsequently Mr. HARRIS returned the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_080">[S.
              80]</ref> with a report in accordance with the instructions above set forth. The
            report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR has some experience and knowledge of town business and knew that the better
            class of men would not accept the place of marshal as a rule, and consequently second
            rate men are generally put in that position. He preferred the proposition submitted by
            the senator from Jackson [Mr. Burrell]. </p>
          <p>Mr LEEPER had heard expressions from his constituents in opposit on to this bill, and
            consequently should vote against it. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill finally passed the Senate by--yeas 37, nays 9. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill [H. R. 140] to legalize certain proceedings of the trustees of the city of
            Terre Haute and the board of commissioners of Vigo county in the matter of annexation of
            land to Terre Haute was read the third time and finally passed by--yeas 40, nays

            passed by--yeas 42, nays 3. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER explaining that the bill is to enable such companies as may desire to insure

          <p> were submitted and concurred in unless otherwise stated, as follows: </p>
          <p>The <orgName>committee on statistics </orgName>returned the bill [H. R. 20] creating a
            bureau of statistics, recommending the passage of the bill. It was ordered
            engrossed.</p>
          <p> Also the bill [H. R. 446] creating a department of statistics, with a recommendation
            that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>The <orgName>committee on education</orgName> returned the bill [H. R. 228] for the
            correction of the school account of Adams county, with a recommendation that the bill do
            pass. It was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Also the bill [H. R. 442] to amend the common school law, recommending its passage. It
            was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p> Also the bill [H. R. 320] to enable boards of school trustees of cities of 3,000 or
            more inhabitants to establish schools for special purposes, with a recommendation that
            the bill do pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON opposed the bin from the beginning to the end, and for that reason he
            moved that the bill and report be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Mr. REED said the purpose of the bill was to benefit that class of truants who were
            deceiving their parents. It was not a compulsatory bill, but cities may avail themselves
            of its benefits if they choose. He hoped it would not be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Mr. MITCHELL had some experience in school teaching, and he knew that; many children
            were playing truant when their parents supposed they were in school. He was in favor of
            compelling the attendance of this class of boys in some way, and consequently he was in
            favor of the bill, </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD also had some experience in compulsory education. The State ought to assume
            a parental control of the boys of widows, or of parents who do not control their
            children. He believed this was a move in the right direction, and hoped the motion to
            indefinitely postpone would not prevail. </p>
          <p>Mr. WATSON thought the bill ought to be printed, in order to allow representatives a
            chance to see the details of the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. THOMPSON thought the bill started out in a wrong premise. The miller of education
            ought not to be tampered with unless it is bettered. He never wished to vote for a bill
            that would allow an officer to arrest his child if he thought best not to send it to a
            common school, and the child should be found upon the street during the hours of school.
            There is a large portion of the people of this country who, on account of their
            religious views, do not send to the common schools, and this bill will cut deeply upon
            this class of our people.</p>
          <p> Mr. Allen of Putnam, was opposed to the bill for the reason that he was opposed to
            making prisons out of our school houses. He was opposed to clothing school or other
            officers with the extraordinary power provided in this bill, but would make the school
            house as inviting as possible, that he child would seek it as a pleasure, instead of
            shunning its responsibilities as sought to be enforced by the provisions of this bill.
            We now have too much power developed in school officers. Some of them have come to feel
            that they have a right to control our children in and out of school. He was opposed to
            this bill for the reason, that it strikes at the liberties of the parent and child, in
            conflict with our principles of government. He would reduce rather then increase the
            power of school officers and should vote against the report and the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON was opposed to bringing the strong hand of the law upon children between the
            ages of 6 and 14 years. He though it was an outrage upon their tender feelings. His
            hatred of tyranny was growing stronger with the return of every year of his life. He
            thought the parent should be compelled to educate his child, but was opposed to
            punishing the tender little child. Our school system is oppressive enough. He stood
            against the passage of this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN was in favor of the bill because he wanted the sensibilities of the children
            cultivated, and the school room was the place to do it. He thought one year's
            experience under this law would bring parents to understand that their children must go
            to school. Compulsory education was the feature in this bill that he was in favor of. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS, believed that discussion now would do no good, would only say he hoped the
            report of the committee would be concurred in and the bill printed.</p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH claimed that we had advanced farther in the line of education than in any
            other. Order and obedience was the first law of a republic, and should be taught to our
            children. He was in favor of the principle in this bill. </p>

              <div type="resolution">
                <p>WHEREAS, The material reduction of the fees and compensation of county officers
                  was made the paramount issue before the people in the last political campaign and
                  all parties stand pledged to the people to bring about at this session of the
                  General Assembly such material reduction, and thereby relieve the people of a
                  portion of the burdens yet resting upon them, the results of the high prices of
                  the preceding years. And whereas, more than half of the session has already
                  expired, and as yet no general discussion has been had upon the subject, by which
                  the members might be able to compare views and arrive at the same basis upon which
                  to make such reduction which will be just toward the officers and beneficial to
                  the people; therefore be it </p>
                <p>Resolved, That in order to avoid the almost universal habit of charging
                  construction fees, not in truth and spirit warranted by the statute, which has
                  obtained among public officers of ate, and in order that the people may at all
                  times know just what they are paying their servants for the transaction of their
                  business, and may intelligently reduce or increase such pay so as to do justice at
                  all, it is the duty of this General Assembly, and in accordance with the best
                  interests of the people, that the pay and compensation of county auditors,
                  treasurers, sheriffs, and clerks be established by permanent and fixed salaries,
                  and graded among the several counties according to population, and that the
                  general features of House bill NO. 113 should be carried and engrafted into the
                  law, making such changes, if necessary, as to amounts to be paid or received as
                  will afford the officers a fair compensation for their services, and bring to the
                  treasury a proper sum of the services rendered to the litigants and others having
                  business done by the public officers. </p>

        <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, entered his protest against this class of
          legislation. Aside from the tact that the bill has no merit; that it proposes to legalize
          that which never had a legal existence; mat it attempts to cure that which never was
          curable; he protested against the custom of officials of incorporated towns coming
          together and drinking whisky and smoking cigars, then taking the opinion of some
          fifty-cent attorney for about one half the time as to what the law is, and upon such
          opinion passing ordinances and levying assessments and taxes, and taking in farming lands,
          and after six or seven years of illegal proceedings, then come up to the capital and
          occupy the time of the General Assembly in attempting, by the passage of bills, to cure
          inexcusable enactments, caused by gross Ignorance of public officials, to legalize that
          which never had a legal existence and to supply brains for galoots too ignorant to do
          business. He denounced this thing as infamous, and hoped to live to see the time when
          public opinion will give it such kind of response that is due to it--and that is, to
          reject it. Sixty-three out of the 93 bills passed by the last Legislature were of this
          character, J3 were of general interest, and the rest were of local application to cure the
          defects caused by the infernal ignorance and negligence of the officials of the people. </p>

          offer a substitute therefor. The motion was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 14.</p>
        <p> Mr FOSTER offered his substitute, reciting that whereas an article in the Indianapolis
          Daily Journal of February 7 contains serious charges against the principal secretary of

          therefore a committee of three be appointed, with power to send for persons and papers,

            thereto, and when so amended recommending its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved that both the Congressional and the Legislative apportionment bills
            be printed and made the special order for to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS opposed the motion, as on his side of the House they had been relying on an
            implied arrangement, under which these bills were not to be considered till every
            Senator should be present.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON, speaking for himself and friends, said: We desire a bill under which all
            shades and all parties shall have a joint representation in the Legislature. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL, replying for the other side, said: We are asking for a fair bill--our bill
            does not propose any fence rail districts, </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to amend by making: these bills the special order or Tuesday next,
            at 10 o'clock a. m.</p>
          <p> After considerable conversational debate--</p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to, and on motion by Mr. VIEHE, 200 copies of the majority and
            minority reports on both bills, were ordered printed. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. HART offered a resolution directing the <orgName>committee on fees and salaries
            </orgName>to report such a fee and salary bill at the earliest, possible moment as will,
            in its opinion, meet the demands of the people. The resolution was adopted by yeas 45,
            nays 2. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT offered a resolution instructing the <orgName>committee on
              finance</orgName> to prepare a bill to authorize the assessment of property for
            taxation in April of this year. He said the people are demanding a reappraisement as
            soon as possibles </p>
          <p>Mr COFFEY favored the resolution. The interests of the people, especially the farmers
            of this State, demand a reappraisement at as early a period as possible. This
            Legislature can pass no law that will relieve them more. Since the last appraisement
            real estate has declined 40 to 50 per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON failed to see what benefits the taxpayer would realize from an appraisement
            this year, when the cost of taking it--probably $100,000 is taken into consideration.
            The public expenditures remain the same. No difference about the appraisement, the money
            must come. Under the present law a reappraisement will have to be made next year anyhow,
            and why take one this year? </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM also thought the expenditure necessary to take a reappraisement this
            year is uncalled for. There is no general demand for a reappraisement now. He hoped, the
            resolution would not pass--he regarded it as uncalled for, unnecessary and unwise. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER: The resolution would only cause an unnecessary expense as has been said,
            and he opposed it. There would be noshing gained by an appraisement now. Real estate has
            not depreciated much more in one section of the State than another, although the
            complaint is general that the assessment is too high. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT asked and obtained consent to amend his resolution, by adding thereto the
            words "and every four years thereafter," which amendment would do away
            with the objection as to the extra expense. Marion county now pays one eighth of the
            entire tax of the State. We should have had an appraisement two or three years ago--it
            is now unfair and unjust. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIER was satisfied the appraisement is now higher than it ought to be in many
            places, but in his part of the State it is more equal. If it would not increase the
            expenses of the State he would favor the resolution, out of consideration to those
            sections suffering under a too high appraisement. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER did not think the benefit to a few localities would overbalance the
            expense--nothing would be gained by it to the State at large. Under the present law we
            are getting along well enough. We are not now in such a financial condition as to
            authorize us to make an outlay for another and an extra appraisement this year without
            obtaining A corresponding benefit. </p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY believed a majority of the people demand a reappraisement of real estate in
            order that the burdens of government may be equalized throughout the State. </p>

          <p>The resolution was adopted by--yeas 32, nays 12. </p>

          <p>The session was opened with prayer by Mr. HUBBARD, the representative from Henry
            county.</p>
          <p> The reading of the journal was dispensed with. </p>
          <p> Mr. OVERMEYER entered a motion to reconsider the vote yesterday, setting the
            time--Friday at 10 o'clock, in committee of the whole--for the consideration of
            Mr. Osborne's resolution in relation to fees and salaries. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said he noticed, in his absence on duty with the prison committee, that a
            resolution had been submitted to the House, concerning fees and salaries, and that a
            time was fixed for the discussion of the resolution. It was well known the committee on
            fees and salaries had employed an expert, to collate all matters pertaining to the
            subject, and that the committee would be ready to report a bill thereon, and he thought
            the consideration of the resolution was premature. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, said when he introduced the resolution yesterday he had not the
            remotest idea of doing any one or any <pb n="142" xml:id="VAA8558-17-144"/> party
            injustice but was desirous that the discussiun of fees and salaries should be free, open
            and fair. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER did not make the motion to reconsider for the purpose of defeating the
            resolution, but that all these matters should be first considered by the committee on
            fees and salaries. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT did not believe that there was any other intention in the resolution, or by
            the author, than that the subject matter should be fully discussed before the House. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD: There was no subject except that of temperance that agitates the mind of
            the people of the State more than that of fees, and salaries, and the discussion should
            be free and without party bias or prejudice.</p>
          <p> Mr. MIER8 hoped the motion to reconsider might not prevail, and that the House may
            have an opportunity to discuss the subject. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON had voted for the consideration of the resolution so as to bring the matter
            before the House. He thought it full time that the House had taken some action upon the
            subjects of fees and salaries, and he was in favor of a full and fair discussion. He was
            of the opinion that the discussion before the House would aid the <orgName>Committee on
              Fees and Salaries</orgName> in completing more a acceptable bill on that subject. </p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. ALLEN of Putnam, the motion to reconsider was laid on the table by
            yeas 61, nays 31.</p>
          <p> The <orgName>committee on county and township business</orgName> returned the bill [H.

          <p> The <orgName>committee on county and township business </orgName>returned the bill [H.
            R. 290] regulating domestic animals running at large, recommending that the bill do
            pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH moved to amend so as to give the County Commissioners discretionary powers. </p>
          <p>Mr. FANCHER said the bill amended the law so as to allow stock to run at large in one
            section of the township when made consistent by the division by river or railroad. The
            amendment was rejected, and the bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Also, the bill [H. R. 183] concerning licenses in certain cases. It was indefinitely

          <p>The <orgName>committee on agriculture</orgName> returned the bill [H. R. 482]

          <p>Also the bill [H. R. 406] for the protection of sheep--being a substitute for the
            original bill--recommending that the original bill lay on the table, and the adoption of

          <p>On the motion of Mr. JOHNSON the constitutional restriction was suspended by yeas 77,

          <p> On the motion of Mr. COPELAND the bill was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 444] defining warehouses and receipts, recommending the passage
            of the bill. It was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p> Also, the bill [H. R. 114] to legalize the organization of building, etc.,

          <p> Also, the bill [H. R. 253] for the execution and acknowledgement of official bonds,
            with, a recommendation that the bill pass. It was ordered engrossed </p>
          <p>The committee on cities and towns returned the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_231">[H. R. 231]</ref> to legalize the corporation of the town of Auburn, DeKalb county,
            with a recommendation that it do pass. It was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 303] to legalize the acts of Tell City, in Perry county,
            recommending passage. It was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN moved that the report of the <orgName>committee on temperance</orgName> on the
            bill [H. R. 144] to indefinitely postpone the bill, be laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the provision in the bill that makes the owner of the building in
            which the liquor is sold liable for damages, is wrong and ought to be amended in that
            particular. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN thought if a man rents his property for the sale of intoxication liquor he
            ought to be held responsible for damages sustained by the sale thereof. He considered
            temperance one of the most sacred interests of the State, and he was therefore in favor
            of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT thought the bill was all right. There were but few men who were retailing
            liquor, that were responsible, and from whom you could collect damages, and thought the
            owners of the property ought to be responsible. He would vote for the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT did not believe that the man who rents his property ought to be
            responsible, and therefore as a member of the committee he voted for the indefinite
            postponement of the bill, and he did not now propose to go back on his action. </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY was opposed to the bill because it would take away property from one man to
            pay for the damages committed by another when the former was ignorant of the fact that
            whisky was sold in his building.</p>
          <p>Mr. MIEKiS was as much for temperance reform as any one. If it is wrong to sell liquor
            it is wrong to license the sale of it. He was opposed to the bill because he believed it
            was unconstitutional; and if wrong it ought not to I be passed at all.</p>
          <pb n="143" xml:id="VAA8558-17-145"/>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH thought the person owning the property ought to be made jointly liable for
            damages, but would not go as far as this bill and make him wholly liable. If the party
            renting has knowledge of the retailing of liquors on his premises Mr. S. would say
            "amen." </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. SLEETH the bill was recommitted to the <orgName>committee on
              Temperance</orgName>.</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, the business on the speaker's table
            was taken up. </p>
          <p>The resolution of the House returned from the Senate, for pay for Janitor McDaniels,
            with amendment that the statutes for senators be paid for, coming up--</p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN moved that the House concur in the amendment of the Senate.</p>
          <p> After considerable discussion, and the fact developed that a motion had been entered
            upon the journal of this House for a reconsideration of the vote refusing to concur in
            the matter of paying for the statutes for senators.--</p>
          <p> Pending which-- </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS said: Mr. Speaker--I am mortified that the House did indefinitely postpone
            the Senate concurrent resolution relative to the payment for the statutes purchased by
            the Senate. This House has decided that its members do not need the statutes when making
            new laws or changing old ones. The Senate thought that it is not so well informed as the
            House thought it was. That the House is mistaken, I fear it will find out when too late.
            Sir, there is a respect due to the Senate from this co ordinal e branch of the
            law-making power that is not found in our indefinite postponement of its acts without
            consideration. If the governor, who is a co-ordinate branch of the law-making power of
            the Senate, were to send this House his message, we would not, I hope--indeed, I do
            sincerely hope--would not return it to him or indefinitely postpone it without
            consideration. Certainly the Senate is entitled to as much consideration. The present,
            enlightened civilization and proper management of legislative business forbids such
            disrespect by one house of the law-making power toward another. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN moved that the House now reconsider that action. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The yeas and nays were demanded, and, being taken, resulted--yeas 46, nays 46. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH made the point of order that by reconsidering that vote, it would authorize
            the pay for 50 copies of the statutes.</p>
          <p> So the motion failed. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. TULLEY,the House refused to concur in the amendment, and a
              <orgName>committee of conference</orgName> was authorized to be appointed by the
            speaker. </p>
          <p>The speaker appointed as such committee, on the part of the House, Messrs. Tulley and
            March.</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. CALDWELL the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_340">[H. R.
              340]</ref> for the apportionment or the State for senatorial and representative
            purposes, was taken up and read the third time. </p>

          <p> Peoding the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. HESS, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called said: This bill
            disfranchises over 3,100 voters of Koscinsko and Wabash counties simply because these
            counties give large Republican majorities. The amendment he offered the other day would
            have given a just representation to the counties of Huntington and Wabash, Kosciusko and
            Whitley, Allen and Wells, but the party in power saw fit to vote down the amendment.
            Believing, therefore, that this bill is unfair and unjust, he voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: He deemed
            it a right to protest, and as he considered some of the provisions of this bill
            infamous, he therefore was compelled to vote "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. REED, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: He voted against
            the bill because it placed our distinguished fellow citizen, Thos. A. Hendricks, in a
            position of antagonism to his party. In a public speech at a ratification meeting, held
            in this city after the October elections, he said that no apportionment which was not
            perfectly fair would receive his approval. This bill is not fair or just in its
            apportionment of senators and representatives. He therefore voted "no
            " </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH was once guilty of voting for a gerrymandering bill, but should never be
            guilty of the like again. There were portions of this State that this bill would do
            great injustice to, and for that reason he was compelled to vote "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. STEVENS, in explaining his vote, said: On account of injustice done the Northern
            part of the State by this bill he would vote "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Lagrange when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he
            was obliged to protest against the bill as being unjust to Lagrange and Steuben
            counties, as it disfranchises 2,500 legal voters, and that Lake and Porter counties,
            with a less number of voters, has a senator and two representatives. Therefore he voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS, in explanation of his vote said: When this bill was before the House before,
            he objected to it on one ground, and one only. He believed then that injustice was done
            to the voters of two of the counties in the, Northern part of the State, He held the
            gentleman from Elkhart(Mr. Osborne) responsible for what he then said. If he had no
            other light now than that given him by the explanation given by Mr. Osborne then, he
            would undoubtedly vote against the bill; but lie had found, upon investigation, that the
            surplus population that he had then believed to be disfranchised by the bill has been
            properly distributed among the adjoining counties South of the ones referred to, he
            therefore voted "aye." </p>
          <p>So the bill passed the House of Representatives.</p>
          <p> The following described bills were read the first time and passed to the second
            reading: </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 9] to promote the science of medicine, which was read the first time. </p>

          <p>The bill [S. 158] removing legal disabilities of married women. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 280] an act supplemental to public libraries. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 303] to enable farmers and others to form voluntary associations.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 543] to repeal sections 2 to 22 inclusive of an act to provide for the
            registration of voters was read the second time and referred to the <orgName>committee
              on elections</orgName>. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 35] providing for the election of justices of the peace, coming up in
            regular order, was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS was opposed to the passage of the bill because it did not allow appeals on
            smaller claims than $20. The party with a small claim should have the right of appeal as
            well as the larger ones. It ought not to pass because it is wrong in principle. </p>
          <p>Mr. WATSON claimed that when these small cases got into the higher courts the claim was
            lost sight of, and the question was who should pay the costs. He thought the ill favored
            tho poor man. Therefore he was in favor of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, did not think it would be safe to pass the bill, and thought
            it would work an injury. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS was opposed to the increase of the one man power the justice of the peace
            would have if this bill should pass, and for this reason he opposed it.</p>
          <p> Mr. VANPELT thought that this was one of the needed reforms, and hoped the bill would
            pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said that in nine cases out of 10 the poor man gets his rights before the
            justice of the peace. He believed in the admonition of scripture to agree with thine
            adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him. He believed the bill ought to
            pass. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill then passed the House of Representatives by yeas 58, nays 30. </p>
          <p>The House then adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow.</p>

        <p>Prayers were uttered by Rev. Dr. Henry Day, of the Baptist church, of this city.</p>
        <p> Mr. KRAMER asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill [S. 388] amendatory of the fee
          and salary act of March 12, 1875, so as to reduce the salaries of all State and county
          officials, except the governor and auditor and treasurer of State, which on his motion was
          referred to the <orgName>committee on fees and salaries</orgName> without reading. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL, the bill<ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_340">[H. R. 340]</ref>
          which passed the House of Representatives yesterday] to fix the number of senators and
          representatives for the General Assembly of Indiana was taken up, read the first time, 200
          copies ordered printed, and made the special order for Tuesday next at 10
          o'clock, a. m , at the same hour with the Senate bills on legislative and
          congressional apportionment.</p>
        <p> Mr. LANGDON' offered a resolution that the auditor of State communicate to the
          Senate the names of foreign insurance companies which have complied with the assessment
          laws; also what, if any, measures have been taken against such corporations as have failed
          to comply herewith, their names, etc. He understood bat one of the corporations coming
          under the provisions of the act referred to has complied with its terms, and that but
          once, since the enactment of the law in 1873.</p>
        <p> The resolution was adopted.</p>
        <p> The <orgName>committee on printing</orgName> returned the bill, [S. 381--Mr.
          Traylor's] for the publication of legal and official matter in newspapers, with a
          favorable recommendation. The report was concurred in, the bill read the second time and
          ordered, engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour, being the bill,
          [S.31--Mr. Grubbs--see these reports of February 11, p. m.] The question being on Mr.
          Reeve's amendment to Mr. Woollen's motion to refer the bill to a
          committee of three lawyers, with instructions. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE referred to the present law a one under which a just administration of a live
          man's estate could be had; when once in the hands of the court the man is
          powerless to do harm. The smartest committee in this Legislature can not find anything in
          it that would admit of fraud under this bill, everything is placed subservient to the oath
          and schedule of the assignor. He has the inside track, he has the time-keeper and the
          bell-ringer on his side, and the creditor has to come in and prove everything. This bill
          amounts to an absolute and unqualified discharge from every debt the assignor owes. There
          is a cat in this meal tab--not that the author intended it; but that is the case. The bill
          is in effect an absolute and complete insolvent law, and in no sense a law made for the
          benefit of creditors. It is nothing like so just as the red law, the common law under
          bankruptcy proceedings in England, nor does it protect the creditor. The law as it now
          stands is an absolute trust in control of the court, within the reach of every party
          interested for relief. He desired the proposed reference, and when the committee reports
          defects in the present law he had no fears but that every senator will agree that the
          present law covers every conceivable right and contingency, admits of equal and exact
          distribution with absolute protection to the assignor and the creditors, no one of which
          features this bill accomplishes. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK: The bill has been carefully prepared. He hoped the motion to refer would
          not prevail. While not pretended that the bill is perfect, it should be carefully
          considered and receive the treatment it deserves. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS: If this bill is no improvement on the old law. Senators can discover that at
          it may be considered. All the best provisions of the old law are incorporated in the bill,
          and it is an improvement on the old law as every practicing lawyer will say it is. Then it
          ought to pass. </p>
        <p>The amendment was rejected, and the motion to refer was also rejected. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS moved to so amend section. two as to prevent the transfer of property by the
          assignor to his sureties or indorsers.</p>
        <pb n="146" xml:id="VAA8558-17-148"/>
        <p> Mr. REEVE insisted this section should be amended so as to avoid collusion; if not, it
          will do more to overturn the commercial and trade relations of the State than anything
          else outside the old bankrupt law. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS: Under the law as it now stands the assignor has a right to make preferences.
          That ought not to be possible under our law, and it is the object of this section to
          strike down such transactions. Before he makes his assignment his preferences will stand,
          and they can not he affected by proceedings in court. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL: A man ought to be rewarded for diligence. He who looks after his own
          business best is best calculated to take care of himself, and this section is contrary to
          that principle and consequently ought not to stand as it now is.</p>
        <p> Mr. WOOD thought the section ought to pass. The old law is a nuisance, and we ought to
          have a good assignment law If this bill will answer the purpose the old law was intended
          to it ought to pass. If the creditor and debtor are both protected, what more do you want
          in an assignment law?</p>
        <p> Mr. TRAYLOR objected to this section. If a man in failing circumstances desires to rob
          his neighbors, under this section it can be done to perfection. He could borrow money 50
          days before making an assignment, give a mortgage on his real estate to secure the
          repayment of it, and by this section the loaner would be placed on the same terms with
          those debts not secured; and for that reason Mr. T. was opposed to this section. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES: The first line in the Reckon will be an element of great uncertainty and
          trouble. Possession is presumptive evidence of ownership of personal property. The bill is
          simply a voluntary bankrupt law; and all the personal property the assignor disposes of
          sixty days previous is swept into it. It would strike down at one blow all transactions of
          personal property. If the Senate passes a voluntary bankrupt law let it be stripped of
          uncertainty. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON: Under the present law the assigner may make preferences up to the time of
          his application. This second section, does not interfere with any race for diligence, as
          intimated by the senator from Jackson [Mr. Burrell]. The section only invalidates where a
          guilty knowledge is had-- where a party taking benefit under the law is par icipis
          criminis in a transaction for the purposes of fraud. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE offered a substitute for the amendment the following: insert the words
          "or to any person liable to such debtor as surety or indorser, such creditor
          serving notice that the assignor was not the owner of sufficient property or means to pay
          his debts at the time, and intending to obtain a preference in his own favor and prevent
          an equal distribution of the property under any assignment," in lieu of the words
          "having notice of the insolvency."</p>

        <p>Mr. MENZIES--Ninety-nine out of a hundred transactions are those affecting personal
          property, and to propose to put this element of uncertainty with all such dealings would
          be an outrage.</p>
        <p> Mr. GARRIGUS: Under the provisions of this section every man would be afraid to deal in
          personal property; while now we have a reasonable law to set aside fraudulent
          transactions. This bill would make a smelling committee of everybody who buys personal
          property. He opposed the section. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON could see no objection to the transfer of personalty as set forth in this
          section. He could see no risk as the section does not contemplate that the personal
          property shall be effected only so far as the creditor of the insolvent is concerned.
          Other than creditors of the insolvent would not be effected. </p>
        <p>The substitute was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. BURRELL made an ineffectual motion--yeas 12, nays 22--to indefinitely postpone the
            bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER thought legislation should favor those who can not help themselves, and he
            moved to amend by adding a proviso that this section shall not apply to sureties where
            the same relate to bonds of administrators or guardians. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON failed to see the propriety or necessity for this amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES though this proviso would go further than any bankrupt act ever yet has.
            This bill makes a proviso that, whenever a man wants to, he may commence a systematic
            swindle of his creditors. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved to amend by striking from the third line the words "of
            insolvency or." It was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE--This bill will throw the burden of proof upon the purchaser, and it would
            unquestionably injure more innocent persons than it would benefit deserving ones. He
            made an ineffectual motion to strike out the words "and sale of personal
            property" where they occur in the first line. </p>
          <p>Section 2 as amended was agreed to by--yeas 22, nays 19. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS explained that section 3 was the same as the present law, with an additional
            provision that a list of liabilities with the postoffice address of creditors shall be
            furnished.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE moved to amend section 3 by requiring deeds to be recorded
            "immediately" instead of "ten days." Anything in the
            shape of colluding that law should be prevented. The assignor has no business to make a
            deed till it is ready to be delivered. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment was agreed to by--yeas 18, nays 17.</p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS explained section 6 was similar to the red law. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE offered an amendment to section 8, so that the appraisement shall be based on
            a sale on a credit of 18 months. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>It was rejected by yeas 16, nays 20. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, by consent, amended section 10 by the insertion of a clause empowering the
            assignee to make partition of lands. Under the present statute there is doubt about that
            power. </p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY offered an amendment to section 15, so as to reach the inchoate right of
            wives of parties availing themselves of the benefit of this act. </p>
          <p>It was agreed to. </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. REEVE, an amendment was made to section 17, requiring all bills of the
            trustee to be allowed by the court.</p>
          <p> MR. COFFEY moved to amend section 21 by striking therefrom the requirement of the
            written consent of two-thirds of creditors before the assignor shall be discharged. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to strike out sections 22, 23, 24, 25--making provisions for the
            discharge of the assignee. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS--This raises one of the most important questions in the bill--whether the
            assignee shall be granted a discharge. A man after complying with the provisions of the
            bill should no longer be weighted down with indebtedness. We should offer that premium
            to an honest man who gives up all his property to pay all his debts. Justice and equity
              <pb n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-17-149"/> demand the insolvent should be set free to begin
            again the work of life and build up a fortune if he can. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: Any one entitled to the name of a business man desires to live within his
            income, and does not look around for a loyal subterfuge under which to find a soft bed
            to lie down on. An honest man can always make a fair coin promise with his creditors.
            The law aims at justice; otherwise it ceases to be law. No such law as this should go
            upon the statute books, for it provisions will be pronounced unconstitutional, because
            it impairs the obligation of contracts.</p>
          <p> Mr. HART did not believe the people desired a voluntary bankrupt law passed. He moved
            to indefinitely postpone the whole subject matter. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON still believed the provision for discharge of the honest debtor was a just
            and humane provision; it was a matter of public policy to relieve the burden of debt
            from the shoulders of an honest, energetic man. Security debts often bears a man down
            beyond any hope of relief, without granting a discharge by some such law was proposed in
            this bill, otherwise what encouragement have such to acquire property? He believed in an
            honest and just bankrupt law. We have recently got rid of an odious law--odious in its
            practice--but under the State law there should be some remedy for the unfortunate men of
            brains, enterprise and ability. Is there anything more just and honest than, when one
            complies with the provisions of this bill, a discharge shall be granted? Only those who
            file their claims and participate in dividends are barred. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER moved that further debate cease on this question, which motion was agreed
            to. </p>
          <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was rejected. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment [Mr. Reeve's] was also rejected by--yeas 14, nays 25. </p>
          <p>The amendment [Mr. Coffey's] was also rejected. </p>
          <p>The section, as amended, was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. Reeve moved a substitute for section 28, declaring all laws in force relating to
            voluntary assignments repealed where in conflict with this act, in other respects this
            act is to be held as cumulative; and will affect no procedings pending. </p>
          <p>It was adopted. </p>
          <p>Other minor amendments were agreed to. The sections were severally adopted--frequently
            without being read; and the bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

        <p>Mr. MAJOR, representative from Morgan county, opened the session with prayer, and the
          reading of the journal of yesterday's proceedings was dispensed with. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS, from the<orgName>committee on the judiciary</orgName>, returned the bill [H.
          R. 187] defining the meaning of the first proviso of the act relocating county seats
          recommending its passage. The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>The House resolved itself into a <orgName>committee of the whole</orgName> (Mr. Caldwell
          in the chair) for the consideration of the special order being the resolution of Mr.
          Osborne of Elkhart, on the subject of fees and salaries as printed in full in these
          reports of last Wednesday. </p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS said during the campaign last year the Democracy and a good portion of the
          Republican party promised the people they would use mi their influence for the seduction
          of fees and salaries of county and State officers. The county officers are getting more
          from their offices than they can get in any other business in life. Constructive fees was
          the greatest evil, and, therefore, he was opposed to constructive fees and in favor of the
          resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD had given a great deal offline to the consideration of this subject, besides
          having an expert employed to assist him. There was a demand to reduce the fees of
          officers, but we should not yield so far as to make their salaries too meager. It should
          be made so as to stand the constitutional test. He read from several authorities to
          sustain his position, that under the present State constitution the Legislature can not
          pass a law that will fix a salary for the clerk or sheriff. The sheriff and clerk should
          be paid by fees. How can we regulate the fees by population? The only way would be upon
          the census of 1870. He wanted a full and fair discussion of this question. The
            <orgName>Committee on Fees and Salaries</orgName> unanimously decided they could not
          make the clerk and sheriff salaried officers. </p>
        <p>Mr. STUCKER said it was the duty of this Legislature to pass a fee and salary bill, and
          that soon. He was not particular what kind of a law was passed so that it showed to the
          people that something was tried to be done in the right direction. The fees were now
          double what they ought, to be, and must be cut down. Nearly all the fraud in elections we
          have to contend with is on amount of high salaries. He wanted the fees reduced so low that
          men could not, afford to buy their offices.</p>
        <p> Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart said he supposed it devolved upon him to show that a
          constitutional law could be passed to salary these officers. A reduction of fees and
          salaries had been attempted by previous Legislatures, and yet the fees are in some cases
          larger now than before. He believed it about impossible to make a fee bill that would not
          be construed as containing constructive fees. He insisted that the supreme court decisions
          sustained the idea that the county officers may be all salaried officers. The only point
          urged against the unconstitutionality of the law of 1871 was the surplus derived from
          litigants should go into the county fund, to be used for general purposes. It was not
          intended that the clerk and sheriff could not be salaried officers. The same distinction
          is held in the decision of 1874. If the money was used solely for judicial purposes it
          would have been constitutional, but because it was used for general purposes it was
          illegal. The proposition now is to make a straight, square salaried officer of both the
          sheriff and clerk, and in his judgment it was constitutional. He thought the basis for
          grading the salaries can be made from either the census taken by the United States or our
          own State. If the salaries are made too high or too low the next Legislature can correct
          them. Clerks and sheriffs now get more than their services are worth. It is giving a
          premium, to the man who can manipulate a convention,and obtain an election by skullduggery
          or otherwise. So long as our public officers get more than their services are worth, so
          long will we have cor-[ruption] <pb n="148" xml:id="VAA8558-17-150"/> [cor]-ruption in
          elections. To purify elections would benefit our people to a very great extent. If
          litigants were compelled to pay as they go you would keep out of the courts irresponsible
          men and'scalawags. You can not adopt absolute salaries unless you provide the
          system of pay-as-you-go. Fix a fair compensation and do away with fraud and
          corruption.</p>
        <p> Mr. BRIGGS cited the operation of the law in his county. What benefit would it be to the
          people to put these officers upon a salary and leave the fee bill unchanged? The bill of
          1875 does not authorize construction fees. He would like to see the fees and salaries so
          regulated as to do justice to all. He would not vote to reduce the fees and salaries so as
          to make them so low that men of ability will not take these offices, but was in favor of
          the passage of a bill he held in his hand, which would be introduced by the gentleman from
          Lawrence [Mr. Dalton], reducing the fees of county auditors and treasurers so as to save
          to the State at least $50,000 per annum, and reducing the fees and salaries of other
          county officers at least 20 per cent below the fee and salary bill of 1875, which would be
          a great saving to the people of the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. Speaker CAUTHORNE thought too much time was being spent in the discussion of this
          resolution. The only proposition we could accept now was the one proposed by the gentleman
          from Elkhart [Mr. Osborne]. The trouble is not with the law, but it is in the way the
          county officers construe the law. They ought to be paid liberally, but the pay ought to be
          fixed by law so that all could know what the officers are getting. There is no fee bill
          that will control a dishonest man muter the best bill that could be devised, unjust and
          unlawful fees would be taxed by dishonest officials, and by a reduction in the fees honest
          officials would be impoverished. He believed that the only way in which competent
          legislation on this subject could be had was by a change of the constitution, and with
          that belief be had voted to submit the amendments to the people for their action on the
          4th of March. We can have no substantial relief now unless we come to the proposition of
          the gentleman from Elkhart [Mr. Osborne]. </p>
        <p>On motion the committee rose, reported progress, and asked to sit again at 2
          o'clock. The report was concurred in. </p>
        <p>The House took a recess until 2 o'clock. </p>

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>The following described bills were introduced, read the first time, and severally
            passed to the second reading: </p>
          <p>By Mr. SHANKS, [H. R. 545] to provide for the purchase by the State of a certain tract
            of land, to protect the State against loss--36 acres north of the city of Indianapolis,
            known as the State fair grounds.</p>
          <p> By Mr. GOLDEN, [H. R. 546] to amend an met for the Incorporation of towns and cities. </p>
          <p>By Mr. GOLDEN [H. R. 547] to amend secs. 1 and 3 of an act to authorize cities or towns
            to negotiate bonds for school purposes.</p>
          <p> By Mr. G0LDEN [H. R. 548] to amend sec. one of an act to authorize trustee of
            incorporated towns and cities to levy a tax for school purpose.</p>
          <p> By Mr. BRIGGS [H. R. 549] to amend section 5 of an act to provide for the more speedy
            trial of causes. </p>
          <p>On motion the House again resolved itself into the<orgName> Committee of the
              Whole</orgName> [Mr. Caldwell in the chair] on the subject of fees and salaries. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS regarded the question of great importance. The question is how this matter
            may be brought about for the best. He considered the bill [H. R. 113] as clearly
            unconstitutional. He was decidedly in favor of an absolute salary, and if constitutional
            such a measure ought to become a law. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, had no doubt that the Legislature could pass a well-worded law
            that would be constitutional for the salary of county officers. He was in favor of a
            salary, but was opposed to some provisions of the bill referred to in the resolution,
            especially to that part which would compel a man to pay his fee to the clerk in advance.
            Require a cross bond if you will, or have a schedule of fees properly guarded, by which
            these clerks can collect their costs; then salary your officers, you would have it about
            right. Constructive fees he regarded as stealing.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH believed that the House was a unit as to the duty of passing a law for the
            reduction of fees and salaries, but did not want a law which might be decided
            unconstitutional; his county officers were honest, and he was willing to help others
            make their officers honest. He did not want to repeat the blunder of the Legislature of
            1871. It was to provide for a law upon this subject: that these constitutional
            amendments were started in the General Assembly two years ago. We have a right to
            require every litigant to pay the expenses of his suit. We can fix what the clerk shall
            charge. We may require a docket fee, which is to help pay for the books, etc., to record
            the matters pertaining to his own suits. We cannot plead ignorance, for we have the
            light of the highest judicial authority on the subject, and we ought to legislate in the
            light of the supreme court decisions. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT was not prepared for the argument. If there was one subject more than another
            that entered into the campaign last fall it was the extravagant fees paid to county
            officers. The people saw in a few years that county officers who went into the office in
            ordinary circumstances would, in a few years, be building large mansions driving fast
            and expensive horses. He believed to-day you could make a law that would regulate these
            affairs and stand the constitutional test. It is time that something was done in that
            direction, and it is within our power to do it. He voted to submit the constitutional
            amendments to the people at an early day. He believed that 90 out of the 100 who came
            here were pledged to a reduction of the fees of the county officers.</p>
          <p> Mr. Thompson spoke at length in favor of a bill fixing the salaries of county
            officers. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS: In view of the fact that this is a matter of economy he had thought that
            politics would not get into the matter. He was in favor of a bill that would reduce the
            salary of county and State officers to a level with the times. He wanted a paid salary
            so that every man in the State might understand it.</p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON was in favor of the general principle of the bill, and if he could get it
            amended in a few minor points would vote for it. He could not find the clause in the
            constitution that would conflict with the general principles of this bill. He had no
            party to serve in the matter. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON believed this Legislature could pass a constitutional fee or salary bill
            either. The bill could be passed without an emergency clause, and by the time the
            constitutional amendments were adopted the law would go into operation. His judgment was
            if <pb n="149" xml:id="VAA8558-17-151"/> members go home without passing a law to reduce
            fees and salaries the people will be very much disappointed. He wanted a reduction that
            should be fair. </p>
          <p>Mr. MITCHELL was sorry that party spirit had been manifested in this discussion. He was
            opposed to constructive fees, but was in favor of a plain salary for all county
            officers. </p>
          <p>Mr. SCHWEITZER thought when the House resolved itself into the <orgName>committee of
              the whole </orgName>that politics and war would not be discussed, but that the
            question of fees and salaries would occupy the time. He stood pledged before his people
            for a reduction in the fees and salaries of county officers, and cited figures to show
            what would be saved to the State by a reasonable reduction in the offices of clerk and
            sheriff. He was in favor of salaries. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD: The purpose of the resolution was to take the sense of this House as to a
            law for fees or salary. The committee on fees and salaries will report such a bill as
            the House shall direct. </p>
          <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam offered an amendment that the <orgName>committee on fees and
              salary</orgName> be instructed to draft and report to the House a fee and salary bill
            that will so adjust the pay of officers as will compare with like service in business
            life, and that said committee be especially instructed to reduce the salaries of circuit
            judges with other officers.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded VOte-->
          <p> The resolution [Mr. Osborne's] was then adopted--affirmative 53, negative not
            counted. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. Falkner, the committee rose, reported the adoption of the
            resolution, and recommended its passage by the House. </p>
          <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
          <p> The <orgName>Committee on Fees and Salaries</orgName> were instructed to return the

        <p> Prayers by Rev. Dr. O. A. BURGESS, president of Butler University. The reading of the
          minutes of yesterday's proceedings were dispensed with.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DAVIS, his railroad bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_382">[S. 382]</ref>
          was lead the second time. He explained that where counties or townships agree to tax
          themselves to aid railroads, under an agreement, with the railroad company for the
          building of depots, or machine shops, etc., this bill would give the local authorities
          power to compel the railroad companies to fulfill the agreement. These companies
          frequently promise to do certain things and often never comply with such promises, and
          this measure will compel them to comply with the terms of their contract. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON objected to the bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE: Under the present law stock-holders are individually liable for labor
          performed and material used, and unless counties and, townships, which may become
          stock-holders, are exempt from that provision, this bill ought never to become a law. If
          they are permitted to make donations, that should be enough. He moved to recommit the
          bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS: If townships and counties are allowed to vote subsidies to railroads they
          should also have the right to make such contracts as may be desirable; and under that
          theory he was in favor of allowing the enforcement of such contracts. The motion to
          recommit was agreed to.</p>

          <head rend="center">THE STATE PRISONS.</head>
          <p> The bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_027">[S. 27--Mr. Winterbotham's]
            </ref>to provide for the government and discipline of the State's prisons was
            read the second time, with a favorable majority and unfavorably minority report
            thereon.</p>


          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM: It is well known that laws governing our prisons are very defective.
            The object of this bill is to make a law that will be understood by, and give
            satisfaction to, the people, and fix the manner in which prison directors shall be
            selected. Now they only hold their positions by suffrage. The only law governing the
            Prison North is the one under which it was built. He desired the majority report
            concurred in, and that the bill be considered by sections. </p>
          <p>The minority report was rejected, and the majority report was concurred in. </p>

          <p>Mr. Streight moved to amend section 2 by providing that the management of both of the
            State prisons shall be under three directors. This was the principal amendment he
            desired. It would rid the State of three directors, and the three appointed would be
            better qualified,<pb n="151" xml:id="VAA8558-17-153"/> in consequence of having more to
            do. He favored reducing the management of our prisons to a business basis. The directors
            will perform their duties to the best of their knowledge, and if they had twice as much
            to do as now, they would prepare themselves better. He hoped Senators would throw aside
            party and vote for this amendment, so as to secure directors who would have a clearer
            knowledge of their duties, from the fact that they will be brought in closer contact
            with them than now. He urged the adoption of his amendment from a strict business point
            of view. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES contended there were equally competent business reasons why the amendment
            should not prevail. The State prisons are situated widely apart, representing almost
            different interests and different pursuits. By having two boards of directors on may act
            as a check upon the other. In other words, we would then have two business houses
            directly across the street from each other. The bill is well drawn in that regard. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM at first was in favor one board of management for both prisons, but
            after hearing the argument of the State executive in favor of the two boards--one for
            each prisons--he was convinced. It is better to let the bill stand as it now reads in
            that particular. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved that the bill be referred to a select committee, to consist of
            Messrs. Winterbotham, Streight, and Viehe.</p>
          <p>Mr. Fowler favored the motion. Two years ago he favored consolidating these two boards,
            and was of the same opinion still. So the same board might compose the workings of the
            Northern with the workings of the Southern prison. He would like to amend the motion to
            recommit by adding instructions to consolidate the two boards provided nothing shall
            interfere with the officers now elected. At the expiration of their terms then let the
            prisons be under one management.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: If there are officials in the service of the State not needed let them be
            legislated out of office. He advocated but one board two years ago, when his party was
            in power, and it was a bitter pill. There is no necessity for delay. This question might
            as well be settled now. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD believed this bill ought to be referred.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER hoped it would not be referred to a special committee. We can consider this
            bill as well as some day next week.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. PORTER demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
            its operation, the motion to refer was agreed to by yeas 19, nays 18. </p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. TRUSLER the bill [S. 187--Mr. Fowler'] amending sections 1,
            2, and 20, of the supervisor' act of March 5, 1877--see these reports of
            January 20--was read the second time, with a committee report recommending its passage.
            The report was concurred in, and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">SHERIFF'S DEEDS</head>
          <p>The bill [S. 42--Mr. Moore's] for protection of execution plaintiffs and
            purchasers at sheriff' sales was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE believed the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> was mistaken as to the
            merits of this bill, and trusted the report would be rejected. The purpose of the bill
            is to put parties to suits, when purchasers at sheriff' sales, on the same
            footing with those not parties to the record. It has been a rule long recognized, that a
            purchaser at sheriff's sale, who is a party to the record, is deemed to have
            notice of every irregularity; and if any irregularity is afterward discovered the sale
            may be attached and successfully set aside. The result of this rule is that it destroys
            the security that ought to be extended to this class of titles. Such a rule is
            mischievous, and ought to be changed. Why should the same rule not extend to one who is
            a party to the record? The only reason is, he is a party to the record, and is presumed
            to have notice then only who is not a party to the record. Why not, then, place them on
            an equal footing, and extend the same protection to one as to the other. This can work
            no hardship if this bill passes. The court, upon who judgement an execution issues, can
            control the process. The court can see that justice is done to parties, and that
            hardships may not result to any party affected by such a sale. In nine cases out of 10,
            the judgment plaintiffs are compelled to be purchasers, and it is impossible for the
            judgment plaintiff to follow the sheriff around and know he has taken every legal step.
            But he attends the sale, bids the property off, and after while somebody comes up and
            says the notices were not posted, or makes some other technical objection, and the
            return of the sheriff is allowed to be set aside by parole evidence. Such a rule should
            not be permitted to exist, and the Legislature should step in and put a stop to it. This
            bill is proposed to reach those defects, and will in no way affect the substantial
            rights of the parties. He was surprised that this bill did not meet the favor before the
              <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD did not think this bill should pass. The party plaintiff ought to be charged
            with every irregularity. An outside party should not suffer in such cases, where party
            to the record should under certain circumstances. Otherwise the party to the record
            could easily become a party to a collusion. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS: If one not a party to the record bid off the property without knowledge of
            defect, he is not chargeable with any irregularity. As to the parties to the suit, they
            must know what has occurred. If one of them does not and buys in, he should suffer
            rather than the judgement defendant, whose property is taken. If we pass this bill, we
            say in every case where due notice is not given, that the sale stands, and that would be
            a very dangerous principle--it would be a very broad reaching statute. We had better
            call a halt here. If this bill had said: Hereafter such a thing may occur, it would not
            have been so objectionable.</p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE expressed a willingness to have the bill amended so it shall be prospective
            only in its effect.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE--This bill seeks to put parties who are purchasers on a judgment on the same
            footing with persons not a party to the record; or, in other words, to overturn the
            principle that parties shall not be bound by their own negligence but may take advantage
            of their own negligence. That is the consummation sought for in this bill. Is it best to
            enact such a law as that? Is it not the fact that the law aims at justice? Is it not the
            meaning of the code: That law and equity should go side by side, in order that law
            should be more flexible under the rules of equity? You can not accomplish even handed
            and exact justice in all things. Such measures as are proposed in this bill are vicious
            in the extreme.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: This bill simply declares that the State will be impartial in such cases:
            that if her officers make a mistake the judgment creditor shall not suffer any more than
            any other individual. The bill is right, and he hoped the report would not be concurred
            in.</p>

          <p>Mr. MOORE moved to amend by striking out the words "has been or," and
            also the second section.</p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTRON can not support this bill. The plaintiffs is party to the record, and
            compels the defendant to appear: prosecutes to judgment, orders out an execution--all
            orders are carried out by officers of the court, and all the officers may be negligent,
            and thus render the sale void; and while a purchaser not party to record will be
            considered an innocent purchaser, it is the business of the plaintiff to see there are
            not mistakes made. This is just the kind of a bill to pass in order to make sheriffs and
            attorneys more careless. They are careless enough now, and ought to be bound by the
            strict letter of the law. Attorneys, too, should look after their cases to the last
            moment. This bill is of a class to impose a hardship upon the debtor class. The man who
            will obtain a judgment against a poor neighbor may come in at the end under this bill
            and say, "My title is good, for I am protected the same as in innocent
            purchaser."</p>

          <p>The bill [S. 49--Mr. Poindexter's] to prevent the running at large of domestic
            animals, was read the second time, with a committee report recommending that it lie on
            the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. POINDEXTER insisted that such a law is very much needed in this State. He would
            like to see the committee report rejected, and the bill ordered engrossed. He asked and
            obtained leave to have a similar bill [S. 67--Mr. Menzies'] read for
            information.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped that the committee' report would not be concurred in, and
            cited circumstances under which such a law would be almost a necessity.</p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES--A large number of farmers are anxious for legislation on this subject, and
            for that reason he introduced bill 67, copied largely from the Ohio law, which has been
            in operation for some 12 or 16 years. Where making fences is a great expense, no man
            should be compelled to build a fence to keep out his neighbor's stock. Such a
            law as proposed in this bill is demanded by a large number of farmers.</p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS hoped the committee report will not be concurred in for the reason that in
            a very large portion of the State, such a law is demanded by the farming community. The
            expenditure required to keep up fences is a very great tax upon the agriculturist. The
            timber of the State is fast passing away, and should be protected. In his county, there
            were thousands of acres of timber 25 years ago, while to-day it is quite scarce. Every
            one cultivating the soil, even on a small farm, is obliged to expend hundreds of dollars
            every year, in order to keep estray cattle or hogs from destroying the crops. A large
            majority of the 10,000 votes represented by himself desire some law upon this subject,
            and he urged non concurrence in the report, and the final passage of the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. WIER stated that in the committee, with reference to this bill, there was a
            diversity of opinion. The bill by the senator from Posey (Mr. Menzies) is the better of
            the two. A portion of the committee were in favor of one, and others of the other. We
            finally objected to reporting favorably on either, claiming that the power the county
            commissioners now have was sufficient, and therefore we report the bills back without
            recommendation, leaving the Senate to decide as between them.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD--The present law allowing boards of commissioners to regulate this thing is
            about right. A bill of this kind would not suit his people at all. In his district,
            there are thousands of acres used for grazing, and this law would operate as a hardship
            there. The State is too new to have a law of this kind.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON stated that the cost of keeping up the fences in the State was in excess of
            the value of the cattle therein.</p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER was satisfied that the time is coming, if not here already, when the
            agricultural community must have a stock law. It will work as a hardship upon some poor
            people, but for the individual who knows how to till the soil it would be cheaper to
            keep up stock than to keep fences around the land cultivated. The only question is, what
            kind of a stock law will be best? He would rather favor the one under consideration than
            the one offered by the senator from Pose [Mr. Menzies]; but, if geese were excepted form
            the latter, he would vote for it, also.</p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM: The passage of this bill will work great hardships in new portions of
            this State. Along the Kankake there is a large amount of natural pasturage, and such a
            bill would reduce many there to poverty. It would be doing very great wrong. It will not
            meet with the approbation of one man win 10 in his locality.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: That bill was introduced on the petition of many in the counties of Laporte
            and Porter and some from the very broad savannas the senator speaks of.</p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM: Land in Laporte county is worth from $50 to $100 an acre in some
            parts, while in others it is worth but $3 or $4 an acre. He hoped the Senate would not
            allow the bill to pass. The latter land has been brought into cultivation all within the
            past few years. This bill is asked for by the rich men, while the poor living in five or
            six miles of there are opposed to it.</p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLEN: The argument here convinced him that it is unwise to pass a general law of
            this kind applying alike to all parts of the State. In his county there is no demand for
            such a law. This matter should be left to the county itself. If we have a law that meets
            all the requirements, why take up time in considering a bill that will not work equity
            to all?</p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR was satisfied a majority are opposed to any such law. It would be a good
            law for a rich man, but a poor law for a poor man. It is better to compel the rich man
            to enclose the land desired for cultivation, and let the poor man's stock run
            at large. It would be an outrage on every poor man to enact such a law. He should vote
            against it.</p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR characterized the bill as part of a movement to oppress the poor. Under its
            provisions, an old woman in his district has so many geese she would have to employ a
            herder. [Laughter.] Then, according to the reading of the first section, even cats are
            prohibited from running at large. [Renewed laughter.] The difference of opinion
            manifested here is an argument against the passage of such a law as proposed by this
            bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER--If this bill could be recommitted and amended so it could be made
            effectual, it would be a very desirable act. It is a question whether the people at
            large are better able and should be compelled to build fences than to prevent poor men
            from keeping stock at all. He knows not of a single county that operates under the
            present law<pb n="153" xml:id="VAA8558-17-155"/>for restraining domestic animals. In his
            county, they are overwhelmingly in favor of a stock law.</p>

          <p>Also the bill, [H. R. 71] providing for the selection and appointment of supervisors,
            recommending that it be indefinitely postponement.</p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT thought the bill ought to pass. He drew the bill by instruction from the
            citizens of his county, who were church-going people. Gravel roads were getting into the
            hands of monopolies. Until these gravel roads were bought up by capitalists they did not
            charge toll on Sundays. Their dividends were large enough without charging toll for
            light travel on Sunday. </p>
          <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK and Mr. VAN PELT said one of the improvements sadly needed was good
            gravel roads. A11 going to church on Sundays were allowed to pass over the road without
            pay. </p>
          <p>Mr. STUCKER thought if free toll were allowed everybody on Sunday, a great many would
            do their business on that day. </p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY: Corporations making these roads have rights and should be protected in their
            rights. If this bill should pass, three-fourths of the roads in Hancock county would go
            down. He hoped the report would be concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT: Not a road in the State would go down if light travel were allowed free toll
            on Sunday. It was a God-given right that the Gospel should pass on the highways free and
            unmolested. </p>
          <p>Mr. Allen, of Putnam, read the statement of a gravel road company in Putnam county,
            showing that the road paid but 2 to 4 per cent. He thought we should do nothing to
            discourage that character of improvement. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT said one or two roads in his county had to be abandoned because it did not
            pay to keep them up. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH believed 19 out of 20 of the gravel roads were built under the laws of the
            State, by taxing the owners along the road. </p>
          <p>The report of the committee was then concurred in. </p>
          <p>The <orgName>committee on roads</orgName> also returned the bill [H. R. 422] that
            county commissioners may declare abandoned certain roads. Also the bill [H. R. 411]
            amending the gravel road law of February, 1855. Also the bill [H. R. 399] authorizing
            county boards to construct and purchase gravel roads, etc., with recommendations for
            their indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT insisted the latter bill ought to be passed. It allowed the county
            commissioners to purchase and build gravel roads. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. SHANKS, the bill was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 388] to divide the public highways among the owners of land,

            prison directors. Advocating but one board, he was willing to pay each director an
            increase of $100 a year, making the one board cost $1,800, while now the two boards cost
            $3,000. The wardens of these prisons virtually run the prisons. The directors usually
            take a good dinner with the wardens, and report things going along all right. He would,
            give these directors enough to do to interest them, and he would have a better class of
            men than heretofore. Where is the sound business reason for employing six men as
            directors for the State's prisons when the number well qualified for such
            positions are not very great. He hoped the friends of economy and good business
            management, would vote for the minority report. He also favored the appointment of a
            clerk for each of the prisons who would not owe his position to the warden. The State
            should have an agent in the clerk. As now, the warden has the management of the prison
            and the appointment of the clerk, which custom ought to be changed. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE: The committee has agreed upon the whole bill, with two exceptions--in the
            second section, providing for two boards, and in a subsequent section, with regard to
            the appointment of clerk to the prisons. The material question is: Shall there be two
            boards or one board of directors? If we have two there will be rivalry between the two
            prisons, and a healthy competition. As far as expense is concerned, it can make but
            little, if any, difference. If there is but one board the traveling expenses would
            perhaps be nearly as much as under the present plan; and then the salary must be
            increased, as the eirectors will have additional labor to perform. There never should be
            a time when men may come to the Legislature and electioneer for this office. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, by consent, offered a resolution declaring it the sense of the Senate that
            there shall be a separate Board for each of the State Prisons under the bill now being
            considered.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The resolution was adopted by yeas 26, nays 11. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER, explaining his affirmative vote--Because this bill is of such great
            importance he did not want to place anything in the way of its passage--there being some
            doubt about the validity of an act consolidating the two Boards of Directors--though
            still believing that a consolidation of the two Boards would be better for the
            institutions and for the State. </p>
          <p>By consent, a resolution was offered that the clerk for each of the prisons shall be
            appointed by the bord of directors under this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM--Put in a clerk independent of the warden and you will have two heads
            to the institution. The wardens are held responsible for the management of the
            State's prison. He should be the head of the institution, and he should appoint
            his own clerk. He hoped the resolution would be rejected. Put a clerk between the warden
            and the financial affair of the institution, and confusion would follow. It would be one
            of the worst features that can be put in the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: Let the warden appoint a clerk under obligations to him, and there is
            danger of favoritism. The clerk has nothing to do but keep the accounts. He should not
            be permitted to go inside the prison, except by permission. The clerk should be
            answerable only to the board of directors. We hear that the management of these prisons
            have not been honest; and, why? Because there has been nothing between the State and the
            warden. The clerk should be entirely independent of the local management of the
            prison.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOSTER moved to amend by making the directors elective by the General Assembly at
            the present session. The people sent us here for that purpose, and he was not disposed
            to put that responsibility on the shoulders of the governor. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE thought the governor represents the people also. We come here to make law and
            for no other purpose. He opposed the amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT: Any one witnessing the scramble for these offices at every session can
            not but conclude the governor can weigh the matter better and make appointments more
            carefully. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS dissented from the idea that the governor represents the people as much as
            the General Assembly. If the governor is to appoint directors, and they the warden,
            would it not be better to turn the whole State over to the governor, and let him appoint
            members of the legislature also? He favored the amendment.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The amendment [Mr. Foster's] was rejected by yeas 6, nays 36. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR moved to amend sec. 3 by making the salary of directors $300 a year instead
            of $500. They only make about one visit a month, and that would give them a larger per
            diem than members of the General Assembly.</p>
          <pb n="158" xml:id="VAA8558-17-160"/>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS favored the amendment. It was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 9. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD, in explanation of his negative vote, while representing a constituency that
            demand a cutting of all salaries, from the governor down, yet thinking men fit for these
            positions will not serve for $300, he was compelled to place himself against their
            wishes in this instance. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to reduce the salary of warden from $1,500 to $1,000.</p>
          <p> Mr. Winterbotham: One thousand dollars would not pay the expense of some wardens in
            entertaining the people of the State visiting the prison. To say he shall act penurious
            toward the citizens of the State is doing what Mr. W. is not willing to do. In Illinois
            the warden has $2,500 and everything furnished. Our wardens have to furnish their own
            houses--the State gives them fuel and house-room, and that is all.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS thought the recommendation of the committee ($1,500 is right.</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected and the committee amendment agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr BURRELL moved to reduce the salary of physician from $1,000 to $600. This officer
            only goes around among the prisoners once a day and attends as usual to his outside
            business. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER: It requires a well educated physician to perform the duties and he is
            liable to be called at any hour of the day or night. The northern prison physician can
            not get time to do any private practice to speak of. If that is the case, the salary is
            too low. He hoped the salary would not be reduced. He would rather see it increased. </p>
          <p>Mr. REILEY knew of some 15 or 20 cases, two years ago in the northern prison, that
            required treatment, and the physician, authorized, did not know how to manage them. He
            insisted the salary should be sufficiently large to command the services of a competent
            man. It is due as an act of common justice, and required by every instinct of humanity,
            that a well-read physician should be kept in such positions. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE--If a competent physician should prescribe for 15 or 20 a day at 10 cents
            apiece it would be $2 a day, and that would amount to $730 a year. Physicians usually
            get a dollar for every office prescription, and $2 for every visit. The proposition now
            is to give him $600 a year. To make it consistent he should be compelled to live in the
            prison and be fed on mush and milk, where he should be required to eat with a pegging
            awl, out of a jug. [Laughter.]</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to amend section 15 by providing that all corporal punishment shall
            be inflicted in the presence of the chaplain or the surgeon.</p>
          <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM opposed the amendment and expressed surprise that a military man
            should offer it. It would be one of the worst amendments that could be made to the bill. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 19. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLEN moved an amendment that the use of the cat shall not be permitted in any
            prison in this State, regarding it as a relic of barbarism, and one we ought to be
            ashamed of. He hoped Indiana would abolish, where it refers to helpless prisoners, the
            terrible cat which comes down on the back till the flesh quivers and the blood oozes out
            of the flesh. Other methods of punishment certainly would work as well. There is
            something horrifying in punishing a man with the cat till the blood oozes from him. This
            bill has nothing in it to prevent the use of the cat, </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE--There are some people so brutal that nothing will subdue them but the whip
            and the sack. All that is necessary escape the whip is to behave. The whip is dreaded
            and is an effective punishment for those so brutal they care for nothing, and have no
            hope for the future. The cat and whip are a necessity. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM: The object of all punishment is to compel obedience to the rules with
            the least delay and with the least injury to the prisoner. This sort of morbid sympathy
            abolished the cat in Illinois and Ohio a few years ago, and since then, in the former
            two and in the latter three, have been punished to death. What punishment will you
            resort to to bring these prisoners to subjection? These wardens know public sympathy is
            with the prisoner, and it is this that returns men to the penitentiary--because you make
            the punishment so easy. He was always opposed to capital punishment, until recently he
            has become convinced it is a necessity, because of this morbid sympathy.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON: The question is, whether the cat answers the purposes for which it is
            used? He believed it destruciive of the ends and purposes for which it was intended, and
            subversive of the fundamental law of the State. Spectacles of brutality have been
            repeated time and time again in both the penitentiaries of this State. Other means have
            been found in this enlightened age--awaken, the humanity, instead of brutalizing them,
            and sending them out into communities again disgusted with laws and full of vengeance. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES: The cat was abolished in the army and navy because soldiers and seamen
            enlisted to defend society, and the distinction was made between such and the thief, the
            tramp and those guilty of crimes unmentionable--the depraved, demoralized and debased
            classes of society. It is not well to indulge in too much sentimentality and gush in
            this matter. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT--The agument in favor of the use of the cat is based on the principle that it
            is part of the punishment due for crime. That is a mistake; it is no part of the
            punishment allowed by law. It is simply an arbitrary use of power by the wardens. The
            fact is, as civilization and Christianity advanced, society improved, and these old
            forms of punishment were lain aside as unworthy of humanity. Punishment by flogging is
            repulsive to society at large, and he hoped Indiana will not be the home and asylum of
            this inhuman practice. If we allow the use of the cat, the ware en may become a despot
            and a tyrant, and abuse his power. </p>

          <p>Mr. CONNER, from the <orgName>select committee</orgName> thereon, returned the bill [H.
            R. 468] respecting text books in the common school, with a favorable report.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. OVERMEYER the bill and report was laid on the table, and 200 copies
            ordered printed. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. ENGLISH his bill [H. R. 3], and the committee report thereon, for
            the re-appraisement of real estate in 1879, was taken up. </p>
          <p>Mr. English thought the provisions were so plain, it did not need an argument in favor
            of its passage. There was no measure the people demanded more now than for a
            re-appraisement of real estate. Other property is appraised on the 1st of Aril, and he
            thought real estate should be appraised at the same time. Under the appraisement of 1875
            real estate was appraised for near twice the amount of its real value, and he was
            informed that it was the same all over the State. The bill will cause no additional
            expense to appraise in 1879 instead of 1880 He would be the last man to favor capital as
            against the small real estate owners of our State. He held it the duty of the General
            Assembly to reduce expenses as far as possible. He asked no discrimination in favor of
            the land-owner, but wanted them put at least upon an equal footing. [Mr.
            English's remarks in full appear elsewhere in our columns.]--Ed. Sentinel. </p>
          <p>Mr. STEVENS said every one was aware that real estate had shrunk fully one-half.
            Personal property way appraised yearly. There was no good reason why we should not have
            a re-appraisement of real estate in 1879. The people holding real estate are paying more
            than their proportion of the taxes. He thought this bill ought to pass. No man can hide
            his real estate, yet there is a great deal of personal property hid away hence the
            burden falls on the land owner without a chance for a just valuation. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREY thought it a proposition every one could understand. Next year the land
            would be re-appraised in the regular way and he did not see why we should insist upon a
            re-appraisement in 1879. If it requires 12 cents on the $100 now, and you are appraise
            real estate in 1879 it will likely be reduced 50 per cent ,which will require a levy of
            24 per cent. to raise the amount of revenue necessary to carry on the State Governments.
            A re-appraisement would help him, but if it is done you will have a deficency of
            $500,000 in 1880. He hoped the bill would not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. HOPKINS thought the taxes on real and personal property should be equal. Real
            estate ought to be re-appraised, for as it now is the burden of the taxes falls upon
            real estate owners. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD--The main objection he had to re-appraisement was the impossibility of
            making a levy now in anticipation of a re-appraisement in 1879. What would be the
            result? The re-appraisement of land would reduce the revenue so low you would not be
            able to sustain the benevolent institutions of the State. If it is made now we are in
            the dark for one year, for it will be impossible to make a levy to suit the appraisement </p>
          <p>Mr. HART did not see what would be gained by a re-appraisement. He thought it would
            cost more to appraise real estate now than it would l880. It was bad policy to urge a
            re-appraisement now.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEROD said real estate was appraised very much too high, and the appraisement
            should therefore be made in 1879. It would be no very great stretch of authority to
            bridge over any small deficit that may occur in the revenue. There ought to be some way
            to reach the notes, mortgages, etc., that escape taxation. He wanted all property to
            bear its just proportion of tax. If the levy is insufficient, the governor can. provide
            for all the wards of the State, as has been done before. He was in favor of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER said there was no farmer asking for a re-appraisement of the real estate,
            and it did him good to see these city landholders asking for it.</p>
          <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam said the last conversation he had with a farmer in his county he
            had implored him for God's sake to pass a bill <pb n="160" xml:id="VAA8558-17-162"/> to reduce the appraisement of real estate. Personal property
            had shrunk fully one-half, and still the realty was compelled to pay the tax upon the
            high valuation of former years. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said in his portion of the State farmers would he willing to sell their
            farms for less than half the appraisement. It was an unfair discrimination in favor of
            personal property. What we want is an equitable assessment. Real estate owners are
            paying on more than they are worth. There is a universal demand in his county for a
            re-appraisement, and he wanted to see a uniform and equal valuation of property. </p>
          <p>Mr. BAKER was in favor of a re-appraisement in 1879. It was an evident fact that the
            people all over the State demanded it.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS said that real estate was appraised far beyond its value, while personal
            property was appraised at its real value, which was an unfair discrimination. It was
            injustice to allow this to remain so, and he was in favor of the passage of a bill. It
            may not facilitate the <orgName>ways and means committee</orgName> in making a proper
            levy, but that was no reason why we should allow so unjust and unequal a burden of
            taxation.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHANKS--As it is known that real property had depreciated 50 per cent., let the
              <orgName>ways and means committee </orgName>levy accordingly. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAILEY thought the report of the committee ought to be concurred in. He did not
            think the people of the State would suffer much by awaiting the regular appraisement in
            1880. He thought, perhaps the real estate to-day was appraised at about what it ought to
            be. He opposed the bill on the ground that we could not tell how much of a levy to make
            to meet the demands of the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN had been urged, by citizens of his county, to favor an early re-appraisement. </p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY was opposed to the bill, for the reason that is you re-appraise now you would
            be compelled to raise the levy from 12 to perhaps 25 or 30 per cent. He was for
            sustaining the credit of the State, which he thought would not be done under a
            re-appraisement. It was shown that real estate had gone down 25 or 50 per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. STUCKER failed to see any advantage in a re-appraisement in 1879. If the
            appraisement should reduce real estate it would not affect the result. We have just so
            much to raise to run the State or township, and the money would have to be raised, and
            he did not see where would be the benefit. </p>
          <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK thought we ought to give the <orgName>committee on ways and means
            </orgName>some assurance that there would be a reduction in the other expenses of the
            State, that would go to make up a deficit from the shrinkage in real estate. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said too much personal property was concealed, and if a full appraisement of
            money, bonds, etc., could be brought out and taxed at its true value, it would go far to
            rem- edy the matter Put the property upon an equal basis so there shall be no
            dodging--there was where the difficulty lay. </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY: The great complaint was thousands of dollars that had been loaned out did
            not find its way upon the tax duplicate. If a law could be passed to regulate this,
            there would be no need of a re-appraisement of real estate. He favored the adoption of
            the report of the committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREY said the <orgName>ways and means committee</orgName> had already made the
            levy of 12 cents on the $100 based upon the law as it now stands. The last Legislature
            refused to give the governor the power to borrow money to carry on the State Government,
            in case the revenue was not raised. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH said the constitution gave the governor full power to borrow money to carry
            on the State Government. </p>

            settlements made by boards of county commissioners. The bill was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH says the bill does not affect the security law as it now stands. It simply
            allows the books to be opened, and an adjustment made by either a deficit or
            overplus.</p>

        <p>Mr. REEVE, rising to a personal explanation, (having obtained indefinite leave of absence
          on account of the death of his mother) stated that a week ago yesterday, when the drainage
          bill [S. 17] was under consideration, he felt called upon the discuss its merits with some
          earnestness and considerable vehemence. Through several papers in the State the Impression
          has gone abroad that he resorted to some profanity in his remarks at that time, when,
          after delineating the injustice of the attempt to transfer to irresponsible individuals
          the right of eminent domain and denouncing the absolute infamy of attempting to do such a
          thing, showing them principles that underlie such an attempt, and seeking to portray to
          some extent the results, he made use of this language: "Damn such legislation,
          and the names of the men or persons who first attempted to inject it into the laws of this
          State ought to be damed to eternal infamy." He was not in the habit of using
          profane language in any public speech, but he borrowed this from the great Master
          himself--using the words "dman such legislation" in a legitimate sense;
          that it should be condemned beyond all possibility of forgiveness; lost beyond the power
          of being found; put out of sight beyond all possibility of recovery; just as the Master
          himself says, " He who believeth not on Me shall be damneed." It was the
          farthest thought from him to express the least irreverent idea, or to utter the least
          possible profanity.</p>




        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">DISCIPLINE OF THE STATE PBISONS. </head>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM the Senate proceeded to the consideration of his State
            Prison bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_027">[S. 27].</ref>
          </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE section 15 was amended so that the man who has cause of
            complaint shall not be the one to inflict punishment on the convict. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to amend sec. 17 so that a light shall be allowed to convicts by which
            they can read and write till 9 o'clock at night.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON: saw no impropriety in the amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON thought the amendment should not be made obligatory. It would not be proper
            to furnish lights to insane convicts. At his suggestion the word
            "sane" was incorporated in the amendment.</p>
          <p> The amendment was then agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER moved to amend section 21 by inserting "$15" instead of
            allowing tho convict on discharge, "money to take him to place of conviction,
            and a good plain suit of clothes." </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM--The $15 is usually spent in dissipation, as soon as the convict
            leaves the prison. The bill, as it stands, is best.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOSTER urged his amendment as carrying out a custom long established. </p>
          <p>Mr REEVE offered a substitute: "Unless his earnings shall have furnished him
            sufficient means to take him to the place of conviction." </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT--Convicts should have a chance for making an honest living after getting
            out of the prison; and they must have <pb n="162" xml:id="VAA8558-17-164"/> some little
            means or they are put to their wit's end to obtain it. These amendments are in
            the wrong spirit, and the bill as it stands is much better. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER opposed both the amendments.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER thought the provisions in the bill were sufficiently liberal, and ought to
            stand as it now is.</p>
          <p> Mr. LEEPER moved to appropriately insert the words "or to his place of
            residence, if within the State." </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON favored the amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES regarded the State as under no obligation to land the convict safely in
            the bosom of his family. If the State sends him back to the place of conviction, that is
            ample.</p>
          <p> Mr. DICE regarded the amendment as humane, and one that ought to be agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON moved to amend the amendment by inserting the word
            "residence" in place of the word "conviction." </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER withdrew his, being satisfied with this amendment.</p>
          <p> It was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to reconsider the vote, fixing the pay of directors at $300; $500 is
            not too much, unless all the other officials are reduced. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER could see nothing in the bill compelling the directors to assemble oftener
            than once a year unless called together by the warden; that being so, $300 was
            enough.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE favored the motion, being satisfied the bill should be amended so as to
            provide for monthly meetings. </p>
          <p>Mr. F0STER: If that provision is placed in the bill, he would favor the $500 salary. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR opposed the motion; even if the directors were compelled to visit the
            prisons once a month $300 would be enough. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM: The provision requiring monthly modelings is absolutely necessary in
            order that the directors may have a proper oversight of these prisons, and $500 is but
            very poor compensation. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT believed the directors should be compelled to visit the prison once a
            month. At $300 a year they got $25 for each visit, which is enough. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: The directors should be men of good business capacity, and should be allowed
            four days time for each visit, and at least $500 a year salary. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion [Mr. Burrell's] to reconsider was agreed to by--yeas 25, nays 22. </p>
          <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. KRAMER made an ineffectual motion--yeas 11, nays 39--to amend the amendment, by
            striking out "$300" and inserting in lien "$400". </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The question recurring on the original amendment to the bill, striking therefrom. $500
            and inserting $300 in lieu, it was agreed to by--yeas 26, nays 21. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE the vote by which section 10 was adopted was reconsidered, and
            he moved to amend, so as to require the presence of the directors at the prisons at
            least once a month. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON saw no propriety in absolutely requiring these directors to appear at the
            prison once a month, unless their duties require it, especially as their salary has been
            reduced. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored the amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the amendment by making the visit imperative once every two
            months, </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM favored the amendment to the amendment, inasmuch as the directors are
            allowed but $300 a year. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment to the amendment was agreed to by--yeas 29. nays 20.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE moved to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was adopted, requiring
            the physician or chaplain to be present whenever a convict is punished. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT opposed the motion. There is nothing in the bill to prevent a great abuse
            of power if that provision be stricken out. No man should be permitted to inflict
            punishment without the presence of wit- nesses, who may report any inhumanity, and
            prevent bad men from perpetrating outrages. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM thought that we had perfected a very good bill as far as it has gone,
            but this is one of the worst provisions ever engrafted in a prison bill. It makes three
            heads. It is as much as saying to the warden: "You are not capable of enforcing
            discipline without the presence of the physician or chaplain." It will be
            injurious to the discipline of the prisons, and if not expunged, he should vote against
            the bill. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operations of the previous question, demanded by Mr. WILSON, the motion to
            reconsider was agreed by yeas 25, nays 22.</p>
          <p> The question recurring on the original amendment, requiring the physician or chaplain
            to be present whenever corporal punishment is inflicted on a convict. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE voted for the amendment, because, in this bill, the cat was authorized to be
            used, but after the cat was abolished, he could see a thousand evils that would grow out
            of this clause. He thought it not only superfluous, but dangerous. </p>
          <p>Messrs. COFFEY and FOSTER explaining--Since the cat has been stricken from the bill
            they would vote against this amendment. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected by yeas 22, nays 25. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.162 in BLR-->
          <p>On motion of Mr. BURRELL, a substitute for section 26 was adopted providing that
            directors elected at this session are to take their offices to which they were elected
            ,and the director holding over shall continue in office for the term for which he was
            elected; and on his further motion the amendments were considered engrossed, the bill
            read the third time, and finally passed the Senate by yeas 48, nays 0.</p>
          <p> The bill, [S. 393--Mr. Langdon's] concerning the sale of land for the payment
            of taxes--delinquent tax shall be a continual lien--was read the second time, with a
            favorable report from a committee, the author urging its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE doubted the propriety of passing this measure. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER thought there should be some legislation on this subject, and this bill a
            step in the right direction. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS could not see that this bill would do any good, or help the State to obtain
            delinquent taxes.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. WOOD did not think it good policy to pass such a measure as this. It would prevent
            the sale of property for taxes, where burdened with delinquencies, to a great extent,
            The report of the committee was concurred in by--yeas 28, nays 11. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR called up his motion submitted yesterday to change the rule, and so much of

          <p>Mr. BURRELL regarded it as needless law citing reasons.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE also opposed the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS deemed the bill utterly impracticable--it would involve the courts in
            inextricable confusion, and be a dead letter on the statute books. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL, it was indefinitely postponed.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. BURRELL, his bill [S.180] that non-resident notices shall be printed
            in one weekly newspaper only, was read the second time, he insisting that this was a
            change in the line of propriety and right. </p>

          <p>The session was opened with prayer by Mr. Mitchell, representative from the county of
            Washington. </p>
          <p>The reading of the journal was dispensed with. </p>
          <p>New bills for acts were introduced-- </p>
          <p>By Mr. BLISS, [H. R. 606] to amend section 56 of an act defining misdemeanors;
            and--</p>
          <p>By Mr. HUTHSTEINER, [H. R. 607] to amend section 467 of the practice act. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE'S, of Elkhart county, resolution fixing Wednesday of each week for
            the consideration of bills on the third reading, was adopted.</p>
          <p> The <orgName>judiciary committee </orgName>returned the following described bills with
            favorable reports thereon, and the bills were severally ordered engrossed: H. R. 273,
            prescribing the forms of deeds to be used by sheriffs and coroners; H. R. 32l,to amend
            the act for the election, etc., of justices of the peace; H. R. 211, for the
            cancellation of judgments; H. R. 378, defining misdemeanors; H. R. 310, to allow
            sheriffs and constables to pursue persons going into other counties; <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_030">S. 30</ref>, to authorize guardians to settle the estate
            of deceased wards; S. 125, concerning stolen or concealed property; H. R. 499, to amend
            section 336 of the practice act; H. R. 437, to legalize certain conveyances; H. R. 464,
            concerning persons of unsound mind; H. R. 349, deeming felonies; H. R. 217, deeds from
            Canada may be admitted in evidence; H. R. 332, supplemental to the practice act in
            criminal cases; H. R. 542, touching the boarding of prisoners confined in county ]ails. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved that the sheriff shall receive 40 cents a day, where there is but
            one prisoner. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, demanded a division of the question, and said he was in favor
            of striking out the reference to population ; but he thought 30 cents per day was
            enough.</p>
          <p> The House then, by consent, struck out the reference to population. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, thought a reduction to 40 cents would compare favorably with. the
            price of board. He did not want to make it penurious. He was in favor of what was fair. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD said sheriffs had to clean out the jail, furnish light, etc., at their own
            expense. He was in favor of the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS was in favor of the bill as reported by the committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER'S amendment was then agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER offered a further amendment that sheriffs may receive 30 cents per day
            when more than two prisoners were confined at one time. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS moved to amend by substituting five for two. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT was sure that 100 men could be fed cheaper than five. He was in favor of the
            amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. WATSON was in favor of 40 cents a day, and would favor amendments to the bill in
            other particulars. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment was agreed too--affirmative 52, negative not counted. </p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY moved to strike out the words "or jailor," which was
            agreed to, and the bill was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS, from the same committee, returned the bill H. R. 286, prescribing the duties
            of coroners; H. R. 393, defining embezzlement; H. R. 426, to whom certain costs shall be
            paid, with favorable reports thereon, and the bills were engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH, from the same committee, returned the bill H. R. 229, touching the relation
            of guardian and ward. He said the object was to have an itemized account returned every
            two years. </p>
          <p>Mr. STUCKER thought the object was to protect the ward against loss, and provide that,
            the sureties and others can examine and see how the account stands.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETS offered a proviso, which was adopted, "in case the amount does not
            exceed $500." The bill was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Also, [H. R. 119] providing for the election of justices of the peace, etc. It was
            ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS, from. the same committee, returned the resolution in relation to the
            abolition of the grand jury system, reporting it as inexpedient to abolish that system.
            The report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS, from the <orgName>committee on organization of courts</orgName>, returned
            the bill [H. R. 549] to provide for the more speedy trial of causes; also,<ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_268">[S. 268] </ref>to fix the time of holding courts in the
            Second judicial circuit; also, [H. R. 457] to divide the State into Judicial circuits,
            recommending their passage. It affects only Miami county. They were severally ordered
            engrossed. Also the resolution to inquire into the expediency of redistricting the State
            for Judicial purposes, recommending no action necessary.</p>
          <p> Mr. MIERS, from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, returned the bill [H.
            R. 372] to provide for the education of colored children, recommending indefinite
            postponement. Also [H. R. 16) defining what property may be taxed for edu-[cational] <pb n="164" xml:id="VAA8558-17-166"/>[edu]-cational purposes. Also [H. R. 506] regulating
            school fund loan, recommending their passage. They were severally ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS, from a minority of the <orgName>committee on rights and
              privileges</orgName>, returned the bill [H. R. 240] to prevent carrying concealed
            weapons, with a recommendation for its indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIMMER hoped the report of the minority would not be adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAKE thought if there was a bill before this Legislature that should pass, it was
            this one. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD believed this bill, or one like it, ought to pass. It gives the
            commissioners authority to say who shall carry concealed weapons. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS thought that by this act you license irresponsible parties--worthy men will
            not apply for a permit to carry deadly weapons. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS was in favor of passing a bill that would increase the penalty we now have.
            He thought no person ought to be licensed to carry weapons.</p>
          <p> Mr. THAYER said three-fourths of the murders committed were the result, of carrying
            concealed weapons. He hoped the bill would pass. There was no need of any one carrying
            weapons. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON hoped the House would not concur in the report. </p>
          <p>The minority report was then rejected.</p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH moved that the bill be recommitted to the same committee, with instruction to
            report to-morrow. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT thought it had been fully discussed and ought to be disposed of at once. He
            was in favor of the bill </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD--There were a number of citizens in the transaction of businesses in which it
            is necessary to carry weapons.</p>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess hoped the motion would prevail.</p>
          <p> The motion to recommit was agreed to.</p>
          <p> The same committee returned a majority report upon the bill <ref target="#HJR_1879_01_09_022"> [H. R. 22]</ref> for a homestead, recommending
            indefinite postponement.</p>
          <p> A minority report, was also submitted, with amendments, for $500 exemption, and when
            so amended, recommending its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER was willing to increase the existing law from $300 to $500. That will be
            enough for the present. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. SHANKS moved to amend by striking out "$500" and inserting
            "$1,500." This amendment was laid on the table--yeas 64. nays 27.</p>
          <p> Mr JOHNSON moved to amend by striking out $500 and inserting $1,000.</p>
          <p> Mr. SAINT was in favor of the amendment because he believed an exemption of $1,000
            would benefit all classes. It will encourage the laboring class to provide themselves a
            home, and it will not be long until that home will be worth more than $1,000. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>A motion to lay the amendment on the table was rejected--yeas 38, nays 51.</p>
          <p> The amendment was then adopted.</p>
          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, thought this was now in shape that the House could and ought
            to act upon it. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN moved to refer the bill and amendments to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
              Privileges</orgName>, with instructions to report to-morrow at 9 o'clock.</p>
          <p> The motion was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Then came the recess till 2 o'clock, </p>
        
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD, from the <orgName>committe on fees and salaries</orgName>, returned the
            bills [H. R. 344 and 113] with amendments, and without recommendation, as they are
            unanimously of the opinion that it is a very doubtful question whether either of said
            bills are constitutional in all of their provisions.</p>
          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, presented an additional amendment. And on his suggestion the
            bill was read by sections.</p>
          <p> Mr.-------- proposed to amend the first section so as to increase the salary of county
            treasurers and clerks from $1,000 to $1,500. </p>
          <p>Mr. Briggs said the clerk can not afford to take the office for less than $1,500. He
            was in favor of the amendment. </p>
          <p> Mr. REED was in favor of the increase as to but one, and asked for a division of the
            question. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS said this bill would require the clerk of his county to do the work for
            $1,122.50. He was not willing to reduce the salaries as low as this bill requires. He
            was in favor of a reduction in a reasonable ratio. The bill makes the salary too low.
            Fifteen hundred dollars is nearer right, and he was in favor of the amendment. </p>
          <p>The pending amendment was withdrawn, and Mr. Miers immediately, renewed it. </p>
          <p>Mr. MITCHELL did not wish to cut down fees and salaries too low, neither was he willing
            to bankrupt the people. He was opposed to the amendment, and in favor of the $1,000. </p>
          <p>MR. DAILEY stood ready to vote for a reasonable reduction, but was in favor of the
            amendment. If there is any distinction in these affairs it ought to be in favor of the
            clerk. He would cast his vote towards equalizing the compensation of county officers. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT knew that the officers in his county could hardly pay their deputies under
            the provisions of this bill, and he was, therefore, opposed to it. </p>
          <p>Mr. CALDWELL thought the salaries fixed in the bill were entirely too low. He was
            willing to a reasonable reduction, but would be compelled to vote against the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON was satisfied that most of the members here were pledged to a reduction of
            fees and salaries. He was in favor of the men elected to office doing the work
            themselves. He was opposed to the amendment.</p>
          <p> Mr. HOPKINS should oppose the bill, because in his county the work could not be done
            for the money.</p>
          <p> Mr. SAINT thought that high salaries lead to corruption in getting these offices. He
            favored the passage of the bill because the salaries provided were ample. This bill is
            just what citizens are demanding at the hands of this Legislature, He should oppose this
            amendment.</p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD: The effort to relieve the dear people is not so heartfelt as it appears. The
            bill shows upon its face that so far as being friendly to the people it is in that
            particular a mere farce. The clerk of Marion county could not carry on his office for
            less than $1,500 or $1,600. If you want honest officers, pay honest wages. If you want
            to reduce these salaries, why don't you begin with your highest officials--the
            governor. The amount in the bill was too small. He wanted the fair thing done by all
            these county officials. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARSH did not think it required any very great ability to discharge the duties of
            any of the county-offices. There are women in the country who could fill these offices
            for one-half the money. He was satisfied with the fees in this bill--all but the
            auditor, and thought the auditor should receive about $1,200. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, did not intend to say any more upon this subject, and should
            not, but to correct figures made by gentlemen who preceded him, It seemed to him that
            the fact of the presence in this city of so many county officers should spur members to
            do their duty in this matter, and not allow their <pb n="165" xml:id="VAA8558-17-167"/>
            presence here to have any influence on their action.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The amendment to make the treasurer's salary $1,500 was rejected by--yeas 45,
            nays 47.</p>
          <p> The amendment to increase the auditor's salary to $1,500 was adopted--yeas
            59, nays 34.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS offered an amendment, which was adopted, to reduce the salaries $25 for each
            100 voters less than 2,500 population. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD offered an amendment that the second proviso of the first section apply to
            sheriff as well as clerks, which was taken by consent. The first section was also
            amended so as not to interfere with fees due to which clerks and sheriff are now
            entitled. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend the third section by appropriately inserting the words
            "except clerks and sheriffs." He offered the amendment based on the
            decision made by the supreme court on the ground of its unconstitutionality. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER called attention to a section of the fee and salary bill of 1871. The
            only difference between this bill and the law of 1871 was that the law of 1871 states
            what should be done with the surplus, if any there was, and this bil does not. The
            decision did not go t0 the proviso only, but that these officers should pay any of their
            fees, or any part thereof, into the treasury was unconstitutional. Before he could
            support any such a measure as this he would want to know whether the fees allowed in
            this bill would relieve the people any more than the present law. He had no doubt about
            the unconstitutionality of the law, and therefore was opposed to it. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, thought the amendment should be rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARSH thought the Legislature has the power to enact a fee and salary bill, or
            both, and he saw nothing in the decision of the Supreme Court to the contrary. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. Willard's amendment was rejected--yeas 21, nays 72. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS offered an amendment which would strike out the words "paid
            before" and insert "due and payable after" the act was done
            or services rendered.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHANKS said he would not support this bill if any citizen shall have to pay in
            advance for the privilege of obtaining justice in the courts. It is the honest, people
            that need the protection of common justice. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess was opposed to the bill. Anything which looks like a tax upon
            justice should not be entertained for a moment. This bill he could not and would not
            support. It is not one that the people desire or demand, but he would like to see a bill
            passed that would reduce the present fees and. salaries. </p>
          <p>The House then adjourned.</p>

        <p> Prayer by the senator from Monroe [Mr. Treat].</p>
        <p> On motion of Mr. FOSTER, his bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_184">[S. 184]</ref> to
          prevent the sending out of the State claims for debt against Indianians, to be collected
          by proceedings in attachment in courts outside of the State, was read the second time. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS favored the bill as far as the question of wages is concerned, but its
          provisions were too broad. He moved it be postponed till 2 o'clock to give time
          for further examination. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK regarded the purpose of the bill to punish the intent, and that was made
          clear. </p>
        <p>The motion to postpone was agreed to.</p>
        <p>This being Wednesday, the rules make bills on the third reading the special order.</p>
        <p> The bill [S. 31--Mr. Grubbs' described fully in these reports of Feb. 11, p.
          m.] was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR: It is the duty of legislators to enact laws demanding what is right, and
          prohibiting what is wrong, but this bill reverses that just rule. </p>
        <p>The people are not asking the passage of a bill containing all the vicious features of
          the old bankrupt law without any beneficial feature. This bill allows a party to make all
          the preparations he desires, and then go into bankrupt cy if he wishes to. It is so
          constructed that within six months the insolvent may be discharged from all his
          liabilities. He pointed out objections and showed the workings of several provisions.
          Honest poor men never take benefit of the bankrupt law; and he boldly asserted that 99 out
          of every 100 who have taken benefit of the bankrupt law were rich men. It has been said
          that most any wealthy man can take the benefit of the bankrupt law and die rich. It is
          wrong to enact a law that will offer inducements for rich men to do wrong. The adoption of
          such a bill would show that we have sympathy for one man but no sympathy for hundreds who
          would be injured by it: By every principle of right and justice it is wrong for the
          Legislature to say a man can pay debts without paying them. The principle is wrong and
          preposterous ; and he hoped this Legislature will not pass such a bill as the one under
          consideration. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES asked if people of Indiana, within six months after Congress has repealed a
          voluntary bankrupt law, have made any demand for such a law. In the southern portion of
          the State the repeal of the bankrupt law met with universal assent. This bill goes farther
          than the late national bankrupt law, which was exclusively in the interest of the debtor
          class. Whenever the bankrupt got all things fixed and ready, he was allowed to spring the
          trap, and if the creditor got 20 cents on the dollar, it was a large divide. If this bill
          passes, the title ought to be "an act to re-enact the voluntary bankrupt
          law." It would pile up costs for sheriffs and courts, and eat up estates. It
          would be a vicious thing to enact such a law. It would be bad for the commercial interests
          of the State, because it would inaugurate distrust and misgivings in commercial circles. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON--As its opponents seem desirous to inaugurate discussion on this bill, the
          friends of it should say something in its favor. No objection is made to anything in it
          but the discharge feature. It is true there was an almost universal demand for the repeal
          of the late bankrupt act, not because a bankrupt law was not needed, but because the
          expense and injustice done to creditors made it odious. But this bill does not propose to
          re-enact such a law. Where is the expensive machinery connected with this bill? The
          purpose of this bill is to enable any man who wants to deal fairly and honestly with his
          creditors to surrender everything he has in the shape of property, and let it be
          distributed fairly and honestly among his creditors. And, then, why object to old claims
          being wiped out? Why hold old claims over him, under the burden of which he can have no
          hope for the future in this life? This bill is for the benefit of men of enterprise and
          energy, the men who want to build up and improve the wealth of the country.</p>
        <p> Mr. COMSTOCK: There is a demand on the <pb n="167" xml:id="VAA8558-17-169"/> part of
          business men for some law that will take the place of a bankrupt law. The chief objection
          always has been it was expensive; the business was transacted away from home; there was no
          one to protect interest of creditors, and great frauds were practiced. Under this bill the
          expenses are moderate, and abuses may be corrected if creditors are watchful. If an
          assignment law, under any circumstances, is justifiable, this proposition will fill the
          bill. It is an encouragement to honesty, looking at it from a purely selfish business
          point of view, and it should become a law. There are other States more liberal than ours,
          inviting men to take 40 acres of land, and States with limmitation laws which will free
          imigrants from debt in a few years. We should invite the unfortunate to take courage and
          commence life anew. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL: The bankrupt law, recently repealed, operated in favor of rich scoundrals;
          and this would be re-enacting the old bankrupt law in principle; it would be putting in
          the hands of dishonest men the power to rob honest men. The honest man never violates law.
          No honest man ever took advantage of the bankrupt act; for no honest man needs to. Then
          again, another objection to this bill is it would bring about the feeling of distrust,
          which was so prevalent under the late bankrupt law. It would disturb commercial relations,
          and is a dangerous principle to inculcate in a law. This bill would be more infamous in
          its workings than was the old bankrupt law. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS: Where men in business fall, usually their creditors are largely composed of
          those who have but a few hundreds of dollars surplus money. The larger creditors usually
          have their claims secured. This bill ought not to pass, because it is virtually reenacting
          the same old bankrupt act so recently repealed by Congress, which in nine cases out of ten
          was taken advantage of by scoundrels, rather than honest men. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER entered his solemn protest against the passage of this measure, being
          satisfied the people, if they had a chance, would vote it down almost unanimously. He was
          not in favor of legislating in favor of scoundrels and shysters, and therefore hoped the
          bill would not pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT insisted the bill is wrong in principle. What is most wanted now is the
          encouragement of commercial integrity, which has fallen so rapidly in the past few years,
          principally because it is so difficult to collect claims. Can we get back to the old high
          standard of commercial honor by enacting into a law such a bill as this? Certainly not. On
          the contrary, the best thing the State can do is to enforce honest, contracts. By leaving
          settlement to the debtor and creditor alone, where the debtor shows an honest hand, he is
          usually released on just principles. Nine tenths of all bankrupt cases under the old law
          were actuated by dishonest purposes. At first he thought the discharge feature was the
          worst in this bill, and on more close examination he found it bad all through. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS denied that this bill was for the benefit of dishonest men; on the contrary,
          it is for the benefit of the honest as against the dishonest man. To take advantage of
          this bill the dishonest man will have to resort to more subterfuge than under the late
          National bankrupt act. Why is it not right that a man in some contingencies should have a
          discharge from his indebtedness? If a man acts dishonestly he can not secure a discharge
          under this bill. It is guarded in every possible way, for the purpose of protecting
          creditors and preventing any dishonest man from securing a discharge, if the courts do
          their duty, and the creditors who don't want the man discharged do their duty. </p>

          <p>Mr. BURRELL had been informed that the passage of the bill would amount to a denial of
            justice to the people of Cass county, the court docket being behind 886 cases, and the

          <p> Mr. KAHLO was carrying out the pledges he made in the nominating convention--the

          <p> Mr. KENT knew the bar of White county and leading citizens there are opposed to this

        <p> Prayer by Representative Snoddy. </p>
        <p>The reading of the minutes were dispensed with.</p>
        <p> Mr. JOHNSON offered a resolution that no member shall occupy more than 10 minutes in
          discussion or explanation--which, under the rules lies over one day.</p>
        <p> Mr. HUMPHREY introduced a bill [H. R. 605] for the relief of the sureties of Jefferson
          Ollifant, defaulting trustee of Center township, Green county. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, offered additional amendments to the bill [H. R. 113] to
          regulate fees and salaries. He offered these amendments in consonant with the feelings of
          the friends of the bill, as expressed yesterday in debate. </p>
        <p>The amendments were adopted.</p>
        <p> Mr. HESS wanted to vote upon the amendments separately so that he could vote
          intelligently.</p>
        <p> Mr. HUBBARD and Mr. SHANKS wanted the bill with the amendments printed. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER said the bill could be explained in five minutes and the expense of printing
          would be thereby avoided.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam, moved to recommend the bill to the <orgName>committee on
            judiciary</orgName>.</p>
        <p> Mr. WILLARD reminded the House that he was placed at the head of the <orgName>committee
            on fees and salaries</orgName> under protest. The House had called for a report from the
          committee before it had fully considered the subject, and he now asked that the bill go to
          the committee on fees and salaries, that the committee may have an opportunity to perfect
          It. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion on the table. </p>
        <p>The motion to recommit, [Mr. Allen's], was rejected. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER thought we ought to have a direct vote so as to determine whether the House
          wanted a fee bill or a salary bill, and he therefore moved that the enacting clause be
          stricken out, and demand ed the yeas and nays thereon.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHANKS was in favor of salaries and not fees, and he was opposed to this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS did not think this bill would ever furnish a fund out of which to pay the
          officer. He also was opposed to it.</p>
        <p> Mr. REED deemed this the most important question to come before this Legislature. The
          difference here manifested between lawyers as to the constitutionality of this bill, would
          indicate that the judges of the courts might also disagree, and the result might be the
          same as with the law of 1871.</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart,admitted the disagreement among attorneys and said if we wait for
          an agreement we will never pass a law here. He wanted an expression whether we shall have
          a fee or salary law. </p>
        <p>The motion to strike out the enacting clause was agreed to by yeas 57, nays 35, as

        <p>Mr. CONNOR, in explanation of his vote, said: He voted in favor of the motion to strike
          out the enacting clause because he had voted with 92 members of this House for the fifth
          proposed constitutional amendment, which in in effect declares that such a bill would be
          unconstitutional, and he did not want to put another unconstitutional fee and salary law
          upon the statute book. </p>
        <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK, explaining, when his name was called, said he was satisfied the people
          wanted a salary bill, but this House had refused to submit the constitutional amendments
          whereby the General Assembly could pass a law which would be constitutional, and he would
          vote "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. LINDLEY explaining said he was not in favor of either proposition. He intended to
          vote for the best measure that, in his judgment, would materially reduce the exorbitant
          fees of State and county officers. Under the emphatic decision of the supreme court he
          deemed it imprudent to pass a bill which would be set aside by the courts. He favored a
          fee and salary law--a salary for all officers except the clerk and sheriff taking great
          care to guard against constructive fees by the officers named. After the proposed
          constitutional amendments shall have been duly ratified by the people, then we may proceed
          to carry out their wishes, and enact a proper salary law. He voted "no." </p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. </p>

          this measure as one eminently proper. </p>
        <p>Mr THAYER wanted to know what would be the effect in case a man is tried in this State

          would protect the people, then, when the criminal shall plead the protection afforded by

          <p>Mr. HEROD said this bill raised the standard of oil from 100 to 110 degrees, and also
            changes the test. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS said the change of test was objectionable as it allows a lighted match to be
            passed over the fluid at a distance not less than 1/4 of an inch, or it may be passed
            over at distance of 10 feet. </p>
          <p>By consent the bill was amended so as to read "not more than a 1/4 of an
            inch." </p>
          <p>Mr. REED thought the law as it now stands was in the interest of the people, and he was
            opposed to this bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. DRAKE thought this bill was in the interest of the dealer and not as good as the
            old law. </p>

          <p>Mr. Briggs' bill [H. R. 133] fixing the time at which causes shall stand for
            trial in the circuit court at the first term, after it shall have begun, when 10
            days' notice or publication has been made for 30 days before the first day of
            the term.</p>
          <p> Mr. OVERMEYER saw no good reason set forth to change the law. It seemed to him the
            present law was better than the bill now before the House, </p>
          <p>Mr SHANKS hoped the bill would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the law ought to stand as it is. The law as it stands presents a
            large amount of litigation. The bill was wrong, because it discriminates between
            citizens and corporations. It is no fair race, and he was opposed to this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT: To repeal this law would be unjust discrimination. A National bank having a
            note upon the same individual that the private citizen has, can go into the United
            States courts and get a judgment much sooner than the private citizens can in the State
            courts. He was opposed to the passage of this bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. BRIGGS: Under the present law, suit can be brought at anytime during court so long
            as 10 days' notice has been given. He offered the bill to get rid of an
            unnecessary expense in his county. He thought the bill ought to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess had waited for some time for some gentleman to tell why this law
            should be repealed. He spoke in opposition to the bill, and in favor of the people,
            because the law, as it is now, was more to their interest. He held that this bill would
            favor national banks and foreign corporations over citizens of our own State. He hoped
            the bill would not be passed, as it was in opposition to rights of the citizen. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said two years' experience with the present law has demonstrated the
            fact that it interferes with the business of the courts and encourages litigation;
            consequently he hoped the bill would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH: There were 100 men in court now under the operations of the present law,
            and by the passage of this bill you would throw them out; and who is going to pay the
            cost? He was opposed to the form of the bill? and the principles embodied in it. </p>

          <p>Mr. Kirkpatrick's bill [H. R. 210] to regulate weights and measures, was read

            68 pounds.</p>
          <p> Mr. JOHNSON hoped the bill would not pass, because 68 pounds of corn on the cob will
            overrun a bushel, or 56 pounds, when shelled. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER said in nine cases out of 10 a bushel of corn on the cob will not hold out.
            After corn has become dry and uniform, so much in weight will make a bushel. This bill
            was to make the weight uniform. He hoped the bill would pass, so that it may conform to

        <p> Prayer by Eld. M. Broyles, of the Baptist church.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. LEEPER his bill [S. 338--described in these Reports of Feb. 4] for the
          protection of game and birds was read the second time.</p>
        <p> Mr. WIER moved to amend the bill by providing that the trapping of wood duck for the
          purposes of propagation shall be permitted. There is a species of duck that inhabit the
          territory between Lakes Erie and Michigan called the "wood duck," which
          is transported for the use of Eastern Parks. The duck is abundant in that section, are
          migratory in character, and the object of the amendment is to give opportunity for
          transportation with a view to propagating the species.: </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER opposed opening the door for the trapping of any species of game, because the
          trapper can not keep other fowls out of his trap. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER also opposed the amendment, regarding it as striking at the vital principle of
          the bill. This bill has been indorsed by the shooting club of South Bend, composed of some
          200 members, and is desired by many in his section of the country. </p>
        <p>Mr. TREAT was satisfied the amendment is not attacking the bill in spirit, though
          probably unnecessary.</p>
        <p> The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. BRISCOE the bill was amended so as to make it unlawful to shoot or kill
          wild turkey between February 1 and November 1. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER regarded this bill as an improvement on the present law, and hoped to see it
          passed, though it was not as stringent as he could desire.</p>
        <p> Mr. TREAT moved ineffectually to amend by making ;it unlawful to destroy squirrels
          during the months of February, March and April in each year.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. LEEPER, the constitutional restriction requiring that "every
          bill shall be read by sections, on three several days in each House," was
          dispensed with--yeas 42, nays 2--and the bill and amendments were considered as engrossed,
          and bill was read the third time, under the operations of the previous question demanded
          by Mr. Leeper. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON deprecated the practice of amending the game law at almost every session of
          the General Assembly. He believed the present statute was sufficiently strict on this
          subject. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER insisted that his bill proposed vital and much needed changes from the present
          law; which law in his section of the State could not be enforced.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill was passed the Senate--yeas 43, nays 3--under the operations of the previous
          question, again demanded by Mr. Leeper. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK, his bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_069">[S. 69] </ref>to
          provide for the organization and support of an asylum for feeble minded children--near
          Knightstown--under the direction of three Trustees to be appointed by the governor, was
          read the second time. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MENZIES his bill [S. 140] authorizing the surrender of city charters on
          petition of two-thirds adult tax-payers where the population is less than 7,000, was read
          the second time--Mr. M. explaining it was simply to get rid of the large expense incident
          to the maintenance of a munuicipal government; and was well guarded. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON pointed out the difference between the bill and the present law, showing that
          while two-thirds of the tax-payers may surrender the charter one day, the very next a
          majority may obtain a renewal of the charter. He opposed the passage of the bill. </p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. MENZIES the constitutional restriction requiring all bills to be read on
          three separate days was dispensed with by yeas 44, nays 0. The bill and amendments were
          considered as engrossed, the bill read the third time, and finally passed the Senate by
          yeas 46, nays 1.</p>

        <p> On motion by Mr. VEIHE this bill [S. 254], for the payment of judges [per diem $8 and
          eight cents per mile] holding courts out of their circuits was read the second time, the
          constitutional restriction dispensed with by yeas 46, nays 0, the bill considered as
          engross-[ed] <pb n="172" xml:id="VAA8558-17-174"/>[engross]- ed, read the third time, and
          finally passed by yeas 46, nays 0.</p>
        <p> On motion of Mr. COMSTOCK his witness bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_184">[S.
            184--described in these reports of Januuary 20]</ref> was taken up and read the second
          time. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK explained the object of the bill to be only one change in the act, viz.:
          authorizing husband and wife to testify for or against one another. It proposes to place
          an honest man and an honest woman on the same footing in the courts with disreputable
          characters as to their competency to testify on the witness stand. There are countless
          wrongs, the very quintessence of cruelty, sometimes, known only frequently as between
          husband and wife, and the ends of justice would be advanced frequently by allowing each to
          testify. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON opposed any innovation upon this well established principle in law, which only
          operates where the husband or wife are interested in the result of the matter under
          investigation. The bill would give an undue advantage, an opportunity for husband and wife
          to collude as against another. The power of coercion the husband possesses over the wife
          would certainly be productive of wrongs innumerable under this bill, while the wrongs
          perpetrated under the present law are very rare indeed. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> A number of reports were submitted from standing committees, where, under a custom
            tolerated this session by consent, were placed on the files without reading. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS believed the only way to get at justice and truth is to let everybody
            testify, so he was not opposed to that provision in the bill under consideration, but he
            objected to the exception made therein, and he proposed an amendment to do away with
            his. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES could not see why this bill ought not to pass, inasmuch as the Senate has
            already passed a bill removing all legal disabilities from married women, and as the law
            now permits the most debased criminal to go upon the witness stand, there is no good
            reason why the married woman should have her lips sealed when placed in the witness box
            under the last restriction. He favored the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON--Although the criminal is allowed to testify in his own behalf. The
            experience of every attorney has proven that provision has operated more against than
            for the defendant. He opposed this bill and amendment as going a step too far. We should
            abstain as far as possible from interfering with the domestic affairs of families. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD: The bill recently passed by the Senate having separated husband and wife in
            their relations as to property, he should favor the bill, although another new
            departure. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON was afraid this bill would open up a way and means for advantage to the
            prosecution by allowing an additional witness for the plaintiff. He regarded it as
            against public policy to enact such a measure as the one proposed in this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS cited cases where the woman's character can not be cleared without
            her testimony in her own behalf. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT opposed the amendment. What could a bad woman and a willing husband not do
            under such a measure as now proposed? They could rob men of property in many instances
            and undr many circumstances.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The amendment was rejected by yeas 18, nays 27. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE proposed an amendment so that when suits are brought by or against
            administrators, etc., and there is any testimony with regard to conversation or
            transaction the administrator, guardian or executor may also testify as to the same.</p>
          <p> It was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER thought this bill would be a dangerous innovation upon the present
            practice. It is utterly impracticable. He moved to strike out the enacting clause. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT was opposed to this bill, and thinking this the quickest way to get rid of it
            would vote for the amendment. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment was rejected by--yeas 11, nays 35. </p>
          <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order being the bil [S. 17--Mr.
            Kent's, described in these reports of February 10] to enable the owner to drain
            and reclaim wet lands. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS said: More than one-half of the State is vitally interested in this bill.
            There was now three laws governing the drainage of lands, and the one under
            consideration is an addition to the individual drainage law of 1875, and a substitute
            for the law of 1873 and l877. It is absolutely necessary that a large portion of the
            State should have the benefit of a good drainage law. He explained the provisions of
            this bill at length, and urged its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT answered legal objections hereto* fore raised against this bill when it was
            discussed in the Senate. The report of the committee, embracing a substitute bill, was
            concurred in. </p>

          <p>Mr. WILSON made an ineffectual motion--yeas 2, nays 37--to lay the bill on the table. </p>

            "one" person to make the application to the board of
            commissioners.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> It was agreed to on a division--affirmative 18, negative 17. </p>
          <p>Mr. Kent declaring that that amendment would destroy the efficiency of the bill, and,
            if adhered to, his interest in the bill was at an end, desired some one voting with the
            majority to move a reconsideration of the vote just taken.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> On motion by Mr. DURHAM, the vote was reconsidered--yeas 31, nays 12. </p>

          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved that the amendment be rejected, and, on that motion, demanded the
            previous question, which was seconded by yeas 35, nays 7--and, under its operation, the
            amendment was rejected by--yeas 28, nays 15. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT offered an amendment, by which he hoped to cut off any stock-jobbing. </p>
          <p>It was rejected. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. KRAMER the bill was further amended in section 1, by requiring notices
            to be posted 10 days prior to the session of the board, and any person whose land is
            affected may contest the utility of making the ditch, and if the board be satisfied of
            its public utility it shall appoint three disinterested free-holders--one a surveyor--to
            assess benefits, etc. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LANGDON, section 1 of the bill was further amended by appropriately
            inserting the words "one who is the owner of at least a free-hold interest on
            the land affected," etc.</p>

        <p> The SPEAKER, laid before the House an itemized statement of accounts of the Northern
          prison for the year ending October 31, 1878, which was read and referred to the

        <p>Also, a communication from the governor in relation to Federal affairs, which was

        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, bill, [H. R. 252] defining adultery and fornication, was read
          the third time. Nearly all the governments of the world, except the State of Indiana, have
          a statute punishing such a crime. He wanted members to go upon the record whether they are
          willing longer that our statute shall be silent upon this subject. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS was in favor of the first section and thought the punishment should be more
          severe. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUBBARD supported this bill most heartily, and he believed he would be willing to
          make the penalty more severe.</p>

        <p> The bill failed to pass the House--yeas 49, nays 39--for want of the constitutional

        <p>The House resolved in a committee of the whole [Mr. Edwins in the chair] for the
          consideration of the general appropriation [H. R. 592] but immediately rose and reported
          progress, that the bill might be read a second time. The bill having been read, the House
          again resolved into a <orgName>committee of the whole</orgName>, [Mr. Edwins calling Mr.

        <p>Mr. LINDLEY moved to amend by reducing the salary of the governor's private
          secretary from $2,000 to $1,000.</p>
        <p> Mr. TULLEY moved to amend the amendment by making the salary $1,500.</p>
        <p> Mr. 0VERMEYER did not think the salary of the governor's private secretary
          ought to be reduced, but the governor's clerk might be dispensed with entirely, </p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN was in favor of reducing the number of employes, and paying well the men who do
          the work. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER said you could not change the governor's salary during his term, but
          you could cut off his clerk and secretary, and he thought the governor's salary
          was enough for him to pay his own clerk and secretary. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREY said the executive was the least expensive of the departments, and that the
          governor could not perform the duties of his office without a clerk. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY thought there were plenty of men able and capable to discharge the duties of
          private secretary who would be glad to do the work for $1,500.</p>
        <p> Mr. Lindley's amendment, as amended, by Mr. Tulley, was agreed to.</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. LINDLEY, the appropropriation for the governor's clerk was
          stricken from the bill. </p>

        <p>Mr. SHANKS supported the amendment in a short speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speaker CAUTHORN showed that the perquisites of the adjutant general, for postage
          expenses, and assistants, raised his pay to $1,586 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS thought the compensation of their officers ought to be increased. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Davies, moved to amend the amendment so as to make the salary $1,250,
          which was agreed to. </p>
        <p>The amendment as amended was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. LINDLEY moved to amend so that the salary of the deputy's secretary of the

        <p>Mr. LINDLEY moved to amend by striking out "$3,000" for deputy and

          <p>On the motion of Mr. Lindley the House again resolved itself into a committee of the
            whole [Mr. Shanks in the chair] on the general appropriation bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY made an ineffectual motion to strike out the auditor's clerk in
            the insurance and land department. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS offered an amendment to reduce the salary of these clerks to $1,000 each.</p>

          <p> Mr. LINDLEY desired further to amend so as to make but one clerk, which the committee
            rejected.</p>
          <p> The amendment [Mr. Work's] was then agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY moved an amendment to reduce the janitor's salary for State

          <p>The amendment as amended was then agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS offered to amend so as to compel the auditor to pay into the State treasury
            all moneys collected by him under section 3 of the act regulating foreign insurance
            companies including the 25 per cent. allowed the auditor by said section.</p>

          <p>Mr. BARKER moved to amend so as to allow the watchman of the treasurer $400 instead of
            $600. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN did not think we ought to manifest such a willingness to cut down the salaries
            of Janitors and watchmen. He thought $60O little enough. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS moved to amend the amendment so as to make the salary $500. </p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY was opposed to a reduction in the salary of the watchman.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD said that the way the committee was considering this bill pointed to an
            extra session. If there was any important measure to amend in this bill let it be done,
            and not waste the time of this House in reducing the pay of some minor offices.</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected, as was also the amendment to the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH and Mr. TULLEY saw no need to allow the attorney general a clerk. He was
            receiving a very large amount of fees, and he makes more money than most of the State
            officers. </p>
          <p>The salary for the attorney's clerk was struck out on motion by Mr. OWEN.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS moved to amend the item for the salary of the superintendent of public
            instruction, by reducing it to "$2,000" from $2,500. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH and Mr. HUBBARD were opposed to any reduction in the salary of the

          <p>Mr. MIERS thought the State that had the largest school fund of any State in the Union
            did not want to put at the head of her school system an incompetent man to manage that
            important branch of the State Government, and was opposed to a reduction of the salary. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS was in favor of appropriating just what the law allows and no more. He
            thought $2,000 was enough.</p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS moved to amend by allowing the superintendent of public
            instruction's clerk $1,000. </p>

            appropriation for the use of the board in connection with the State fair, which was
            adopted--affirmative 32, negative 31--on a division of the committee. </p>

            University, and allow the University board to fix the salaries of their faculty out of
            the monies appropriated to the University. It was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. FANCHER moved an amendment providing that no amount of the $3,000 appropriated
            therefor, be expended for or improving said normal School institution, until the city of
            Terre Haute shall place a like amount in the hands of the trustees for the same purpose. </p>
          <p>Mr. VAN VALZAH proposed an amendment to the amendment making the appropriation to the
            State Normal School $4,000 instead of $3,000, which was rejected.</p>
          <p> The amendment [Mr. Fancher's] was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. OVERMEYER moved to amend farther by adding "which sum hereby appropriated
            shall include and be in lieu of all sums appropriated by the act of March 5,1873, except
            that provided by section 4 of said act". The amendment was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD moved to strike out all pertaining to the Purdue University, which was
            rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. Miers moved to amend by making the appropriation for Purdue University $9,000 viz:

          <p> Mr. Connor moved an amendment t add for the expenses of the office of superintendent
            of public instruction $500, which was adopted.</p>
          <p> Mr. Overmeyer moved to amend by striking out the proviso to the last clause of section
            2, and inserting that all sums paid out for office expenses for any officer of State

        <p> The reading of the minutes were commenced when on motion by Mr. FOWLER the further
          reading was dispensed with. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK his bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_069">[S. 69]</ref> for the
          establishment of a home for feeble minded children, was taken up; and committee amendments
          with regard to Board of Trustees, were read and concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK explained: The bill makes provision for the care of such children as are not
          capable of being educated in the common way. Over 1,000 children and adults of weak minds
          or idiotic are now scattered all over the State, of which at least 400 are between the
          ages of 5 and 14. These have been a burden to society, and a burden which hangs with heavy
          weight on parents so unfortunately afflicted. Success has attended institutions of this
          character in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Iowa and New York,
          which latter State has two such. The success of these institutions everywhere has far
          exceeded the most sanguine expectations of their friends. Where there is feebleness of
          mind there is most always some weakness in the physical system, hence extraordinary means
          should be used for their improvement, which can not be properly resorted to in the
          ordinary routine of life. The buildings now used for the soldiers' orphan home,
          would answer the purposes of such an institution with a little improvement, and would
          accommodate all of this class who are apt to apply for admission for several years to
          come, so is will not require any great expense to start this institution, it being
          intended to supersede the one now at Knightstown; the necessity for the keeping up of
          which has almost expired. The bill proposes to place the new institution under the same
          officials now managing the Soldiers' Orphans' Home. He proceeded to
          explain its other features, and in conclusion moved to dispense with the constitutional
          restriction, consider the bill engrossed, and press it to the final vote now. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER seconded the motion in a short speech. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL resisted this motion, desiring time to examine the features of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM regarded this as a very important bill, but as highly improper the
          disposition manifested to hurry it through the Senate. Its object is a worthy one, but the
          bill should be considered carefully. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN feared defeat unless the bill were advanced as rapidly as possible; and for
          that reason should favor the motion. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER insisted this asylum should be established at once; was willing the bill
          should be perfected, but objected to delay. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER moved to amend by a proviso that the question of admitting children shall be
          determined by the Board of County Commissioners, under rules adopted by the board of the
          institution. </p>
        <p>Messrs. SHIRK, FOWLER and TRUSLER opposed the amendment. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. LEEPER the bill was amended so as to exclude from the benefits of the
          institution all over 21 years of age. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to amend so that none shall be admitted except upon a proper
          adjudication of sanity by two justices of the peace, a physician and the clerk of the
          court.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHIRK opposed the amendment. The amendment was rejected. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER made an ineffectual motion; to strike out "State" and insert
          "county" in lieu, in section 7. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZ1ES moved to amend by restricting the inmates to the children of poor and
          indigent parents. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK was not willing to exclude children of parents able to support them, the object
          of the institution being to develop their physical and mental characters. The bill
          provides that parents who are able shall contribute to the support of their children in
          the institution. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER opposed the amendment. </p>
        <p>It was rejected. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved ineffectually to strike the word "State" from section
          7. </p>
        <p>The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>

            substitute for the same reported by committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS stated: The substitute was drawn by the senator from Marshall [Mr. Reeve],
            and that it would be nothing more than an act of justice to the author that its
            consideration should be postponed till that senator shall be present.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. VIEHE these bills were postponed till Monday next at 2
            o'clock p. m., and made the special order for that hour.</p>

            the freehold qualifications required for supervisors of highways, and striking out all
            that relates to the taxing of acres of land for road purposes, was read the third time. </p>

            roads, located in roadbeds ceded by the United States to the State of Indiana, with a

          <p>Mr. STREIGHT said it had reference only to such roads as were originally built by the
            Government, and ceded to the State--really affecting only the road known as the
            Cumberland road. By the provisions of this bill such roads may collect, only enough to

            considered as engrossed, read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays
            5.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER, explaining the only change proposed by this bill, was to make the word
            "may" in section three read " shall." </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAHSEN his bill [S. 175] for the appointment of county
            superintendents by the Board of Township Trustees. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said this bill passed the Senate two years ago, but the House of
            Representatives took no action on it. It is a good bill, and will, should it become a
            law, elevate the standard of our common schools. Senators will please bear in mind that
            this bill does not define the duties or fix the salary of the county superintendent. He
            believed the opposition to this office arose from wrong selections that have been
            made--men have been placed in these positions without knowledge or experience, who were
            more anxious to enjoy their lives than to fulfill their official duties. He knew of what
            he spoke. This bill, if it should become a law, will remove to a great extent the
            present opposition to the office of county superintendent, because under this bill the
            township trustees will be almost compelled to select competent men. No costs or expense
            will be made by this bill as the fees for examination must be paid by the applicants to
            the treasurer of the board, and the treasurer of the board, turns over this money <pb n="177" xml:id="VAA8558-17-179"/> to the State treasury to reimburse the State for
            expenses of the State board of education. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE said there was a feeling in his portion of the State against this office. He
            moved the bill be recommitted with a recommendation that the committee so amend the bill
            as to abolish the office of county superintendent. There are bills pending before the
            Senate for the abolishment of that office, and that would be one of the best pieces of
            legislation that could be enacted. The office way no good for the educational interests
            of the State. The Senate should say now that it is in favor of abolishing this costly
            office. The schools are no better now than under the old examiner system, yet a greater
            expense is involved. This bill proposes to elevate this office and make it an additional
            expense to the county, while the people all over the State are crying for its
            abolishment. The cause of education has not been advanced by any legislation had for the
            past five or six years; and this bill being in the same direction, ought not to be
            passed.</p>
          <p> Mr. KENT: If this office is left in existence the officer should be examined by the
            State board. But he was opposed to continuing the office. As a general thing, these
            positions are held by comparatively ignorant men, trying to exercise more power than the
            czar of all the Russins. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARIGHAUSEN insisted the opposition is not so much against the law as against the
            persons who have been selected for the positions. The senator from Fountain (Mr. Dice)
            speaks of the expense of this bill; but it proposes not one cent of expense except such
            as is paid by the applicants for examination. We have made our school system sucessful;
            it is regarded as one of the best in any of the States, and to abolish this office would
            be a step backward. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN would be compelled to vote for the abolish merit of this office. Nearly
            every one in his district demands the abolishment of the office on account of its
            expensiveness. </p>
          <p>Mr. RILEY thought the superintendent should be subject to a very strict
            examination.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER regarded it unwise to abolish this office. It should be elevated, and that
            is the object of this bill. There has been more dissatisfaction grown up because a large
            number of its incumbents are not qualified for its duties than from anything else. in
            his section the people are not demanding the abolishment of this office. Until something
            better be devised, it would be bad legislation to abolish this office.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON insisted we have no use for such an officer as a county
            superintendent.</p>
          <p> Mr. HART believed if there Is any one office complained of in his end of the State, it
            is that of county superintendent and its expensiveness. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN knew of no complaint made in the Northern part of the State as as
            against the office of county superintendent.</p>
          <p> The motion to recommit was rejected by yeas 12, nays 26. </p>
          <p>Mr. Menzies believed the greatest complaint comes of the inefficiency of the incumbents
            of the office of county superintendent, and believing the system should be tried with
            increased facilities for the advancement of the position, he should vote in favor of the
            bill. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the bill was ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

        <p> The reading of the journal was suspended, on the motion of Mr. Allen, of Putnam.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER said there was a great responsibility resting upon the House now; that his
          table was loaded down with business, and he would stay in his chair as long as a quorum,
          would remain with him, until the business was disposed of. </p>
        <p>The <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> returned the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">[S. 277]</ref> concerning interest on money, with a
          recommendation that all after the enacting clause be stricken out and new matter inserted,
          making a uniform rate of 6 per cent.</p>
        <p> Mr. MARCH moved to amend by inserting before the word "interest" the
          word "illegal." The amendment was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON moved to amend by striking out of the first section all that relates to
          usurious interest and inserting in lieu that "no greater rate of interest shall
          be taken unless by agreement in writing and not to exceed a greater rate than 8 per
          cent." He said that 6 per cent. was incorporated into the bill without regard to
          the monetary condition of the country and against, the public sentiment of a large portion
          of the people. The rate being so low and the penalty so severe the law would not be
          regarded. The tendency of the law, if regarded, would be to create a cont action of the
          currency in the State, because the surrounding States, and even New York and Massachusetts
          provided for a higher rate of interest. He would support the bill if 8 percent. instead of
          6 was put in it. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. MIERS the amendment was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS moved that the bill be considered as engrossed and put upon its passage, which
          was agreed to.</p>
        <p> The bill was then read the third time.</p>
        <p> Mr. SLEETH insisted that the features of this bill destroyed the credit of commercial
          law. The bill would have the tendency to drive capital out of the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. Briggs said that a 6 per cent, law without a provision to forbid a larger rate of
          interest would be useless. He was in favor of a six percent. law, and wanted to see it
          enforced. All parties demanded a six per cent. law in their platforms last year, on which
          we were elected, and the people expect and demand it. Let us see if any member here will
          vote against the law with provisions that are intended to enforce it and prevent it from
          being a dead letter. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH: As it is conceded, on all hands, that there must be legislation upon the
          subject, it may not be improper to suggest that any law fixing a rate of interest is a
          clear departure from the principle of free trade in money, even though intended only to
          provide a rate where none is agreed upon. In fixing a rate of interest, we are to consider
          the purchasing power of money, the supply and demand at this time and for some years to
          come. Six per cent. would be a fair average rate. To allow a higher rate upon special
          contract nullifies any good effect that might otherwise be derived from the law. It would
          afford no protection to the needy or visionary borrower against the greedy and wary
          lender, as between these two classes the highest rate would rule. A higher special rate
          gives an advantage to the dealer in money over all other pursuits. He always makes a
          special contract, and can exact the highest rate. In the course of business the laborer,
          producer, mechanic and manufacturer advance their products on a credit before receiving
          any interest, and when they contract for interest they are compelled to ac-[cept] <pb n="178" xml:id="VAA8558-17-180"/>[ac]-cept of the terms offered, instead of dictating
          them.</p>
        <p> As to injuring commercial proper, if the law is obeyed, it will not injure any one. On
          the contrary it will promote stability and regularity in business, and restore confidence.
          Those who set the law at defiance ought to suffer.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam, demanded the previous question, and under the operations thereof
          the bill passed the House by yeas 78, nays 18, as follows: </p>

        <p>Pending the roll call-- </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, explaining, said he was in favor of a six per
          cent, interest law, but wanted to allow parties to contract for eight per cent. He voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER, in explanation of his vote, said the House re fused to allow him to offer an
          amendment to a very bad feature of the bill, but being in favor of a lower rate of
          interest on contract than 10 per cent.,and believing the Senate would so amend the bill,
          he voted "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. ElSGLISH, when his name was called, said he voted in accordance with instructions
          from the convention that nominated him. He voted "ave." </p>
        <p>Mr. RANCHER, in explanation, said it was a serious question whether this would not be
          detrimental to the hard working, enterprising men of our State, who have mortgaged their
          homes to improve the country, by depriving them of the privilege of removing their
          mortgages when they become due, and in consequence suffer foreclosure and lose their
          homes. The law-makers should not lose sight of this class and favor a class who are
          continually clamoring for a reduction of interest, so as to enable them to loan money. He
          voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. HOPKINS explaining, said he believed the bill was in opposition to the best interests
          of the people of the State; he therefore voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. REED, in explanation of his vote, said he was heartily in favor of a lower rate of
          interest than the present, and in favor of a penalty for usury. He would like to vote for
          some of the provisions of tins bill nd against others. It contains objectionable features
          which should not be incorporated into the law, and believing such a law detrimental to the
          best interests of the people of the State, he voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. SNODDY, when his name was called, said he believed the passage of the bill in its
          present form was ruinous, but hoping the Senate would correct it, he voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess, when his name was called, in explanation said he voted for this
          bill because he had promised to do so, but believed, it odious and objectionable. He voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. VAWTER, in explanation of his vote. when his name was called, said, with the
          gentleman from Daviess [Mr. Taylor] he believed the bill unjust and odious, bit he voted
          "no."</p>
        <p> The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
        <p> The commitee on benevolent institutions returned the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_112">[H. R. 112]</ref> to provide for the election of trustees
          for the benevolent institutions, with amendments, and when so amended that the bill do

          <p>Mr. Sleeth's bill H. R. 131 was passed the House--yeas 57, nays 25. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. WILLARD the House took up the special order, being the
            consideration of the bill [H. R. 295] in relation to a Metropolitan police, returned
            from the select committee thereon with a favorable majority and a minority report
            proposing amendments so as to make the police equally divided politically.</p>


          <p> Mr. ENGLISH was physically unable to discuss the merits of the amendments submitted by
            the majority of the special committee. Under the provisions of the bill there would be
            no expense to the State, as it would be borne by the city, and but very little, if any,
            more to the city than under the present law. The object of the bill was to remove, so
            far as possible, the influence of polities from the police matters. The present system
            was but a reward every year or two to the ward politician, from bad to good, and back
            again. It assumes the character of reward for political services. </p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY: If there is a necessity for a metropolitan police in Indianapolis, why is
            it not necessary for other cities? He said he could not see why the representatives from
            Marion county were not asking for the passage of this bill. He saw no reason why
            Indianapolis should have such a law.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion--yeas 45, nays 45--to lay the minority report
            upon the table.</p>
          <p> Mr CONNER wished to call attention to the fact that there was no one here asking for
            such a law--not even the party in the majority. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD: Not a man, so far as he knew, except those who was expecting appointments.
            was asking for such a law as this. He denied the imputation that the police were made up
            of rewards of favorites in ward politics. He cited the fact that the credit of the city
            of Indianapolis was as good as the National Government as evinced by the low rate of
            interest on which the city had recently borrowed money. He was as anxious as any one to
            take the police out of the dirty pool of politics. It was by the most rigid economy to
            day that the city was able to keep within the limit of the tax levy allowed by law. He
            understood this was a political measure, and he appealed to the House to stand by the
            city of Indianapolis and see fair play, and let the tax-payers control their own
            affairs. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAlNT said after consideration he thought for cities the size of Indianapolis the
            bill would be a good thing, and for that reason he should vote for it. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH said that under this bill he did not think it could be shown that it would
            increase the expense one dollar. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment proposed by the minority to strike out"45,000' and
            insert "20,000" in lieu was rejected by--yeas 39, nays 55. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The second amendment of the minority that the governor appoint one commissioner from
            each political party was also rejected by--yeas 41, nays 53. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The report of the majority was then concurred in by yeas 51, nays 43. </p>
          <p>Pending the call--</p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT, when his name was called, in explanation, said: Under a Federal law now in
            force every town and city in the United States can have, upon application, any number of
            so-called Federal supervisors, to be used in intimidating voters, who do not support the
            administration of this country, and he was willing to vote for any bill that, will
            counteract in some degree the partisan supervision of elections in this country, and
            that will tend to give both parties an equal chance, and therefore be in the interest of
            peace and good order. </p>
          <p>So the majority report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH moved that the bill be considered engrossed, read a third time and put upon
            its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD made an ineffeceual motion to recommit the bill. The bill was read the third
            time, and passed the House by yeas 53,nays 39--as follows:</p>

            metropolitan police bill, made to a friend last fall, who had his watch stolen in this
            city, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. KESTER, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said it seemed to him
            that this was a stretch or power, and he hoped that it would not be abused. He conceded
            that the evil so long felt of intimidation of voters had not been remedied, and hoping
            that this might work a reform in that direction, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. </p>

            bill do pass.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD said it reduced the fees from 25 to 33 per cent., endeavored to cutout all
            constructive fees, and to call the special attention of the grand juries to any
            attempted violation. He explained its provisions separately, showing the difference
            between the law of 1875, in force, and the bill in his hand. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. MIERS, the bill was made the special order for next Tuesday, at 10

          <p>On motion of Mr. KENT his bill [S. 197] to protect the ballot box, to procure a fair
            election, and to prevent the sale and barter of votes, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT explained that this bill is intended to amend the present law so as to punish
            the man who sells his vote by fine and disfranchisement, which would do more to protect
            elections than any other provisions of the law. Those selling votes being mostly poor
            men, he would not punish them by imprisonment, but by fine and disfranchisement. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On his further motion the constitutional restriction was dispensed with, the bill
            considered as engrossed, read the third time and<pb n="181" xml:id="VAA8558-17-183"/>
            passed the Senate by yeas 40, nays 0, on both votes.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK his bill [S. 271] enlarging the jurisdiction of mayors and
            justices of the peace was read the second time.</p>
          <p> Mr. COMSTOCK--The purpose of the bill is to economise time and money in the
            prosecution of petty offenses, by authorizing mayors of cities and justices of the peace
            to commit the defendant at once to the work-house, instead of getting his living at the
            public expense. He moved to dispense with the court's restriction, that the
            bill may be pressed to its final passage now. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS doubted the propriety of passing this bill. It gives justices of the peace too
            much power. Their jurisdiction, now, is too large--many of their decisions are a mockery
            on justice because of their limited knowledge of law.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS was not familiar with the details of prosecutions in minor offences, but
            this bill seemed to be proposing a correct measure The average jurymen are not lawyers,
            but when the facts are set before them they have a pretty just sense of right, and are
            very apt to come to a fair judgment. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD--It is decreed by very high authority that man shall earn his living by the
            sweat of his brow; and that being the point in this bill, he favored its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON was favorably impressed with this bill; not seeing how it can work any
            hardship to the defendant; and it certainly would be a great saving to the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS--In a great many instances the weight of the interest, of the justice of the
            peace is turned against the defendant, in order that the officer may secure his lees;
            and if the defendant be poor and unfortunate he is at me mercy of the prosecution to
            send him to the workhouse, and make a record against him. that will cling to him as long
            as he lives. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE was not sure but the bill was all right, but it may not be proper to hasten
            its passage by a suspension of the rules. The motion to dispense with the constitutional
            restriction was rejected by yeas 30, nays 8, for want of a constitutional majority of
            two-thirds to set aside the constitutional provision. </p>
          <p>The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS his bill [S. 59] authorizing the construction of work houses by
            the county commissioners, was taken up, read by title only, and ordered engrossed for

          <p> On motion by Mr. VIEHE the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_056">[H. R. 56]</ref>
            defining the 12th and 10th judicial circuits was read the first time and referred to the
              <orgName>committee on the organization of the courts of justice</orgName>. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. MOORE the bill, [H. R. 158] in relation to settlements by county
            commissioners with county, township or school officers, not to be binding when the
            officer is delinquent, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to strike out section 2, because that section proposes to go back
            and, unsettle the rule of practice which has prevailed up to this time, that a
            settlement is conclusive. It is a dangerous principle to make a man liable now for
            things he was not liable for at the time of settlement.</p>
          <p> Mr. MOORE: If that amendment prevails, it will destroy the point desired to be made in
            the bill. There can be no hardships in a bill of this kind, for a party who has actually
            put money in his pocket wrongfully should be compelled to make it up. The provisions of
            this bill are intended to apply to cases in Grant and in Fayette counties. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL insisted that this section was dangerous, and that it was unsafe to go back
            and unsettle settled principles of law. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <p> On motion of Mr. BURRELL, the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_112">[H. R. 112]</ref>
            to provide for the appointment of trustees of the benevolent institutions of the
            State--by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate--was read the first
            time and referred to the committee on benevolent institutions.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES, from the special committee to which was referred the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">[S. 277]</ref> regulating the legal rate of interest,
            reported the same back with a recommendation that the Senate do not concur in the House
            amendments, and recommending that a conference committee of the two Houses be appointed
            thereon.</p>
          <p> The report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing a <orgName>committee
              of conference</orgName>--three from the Senate and three from the House of
            Representatives--on the interest bill disagreement. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. KRAMER, his bill [S. 308] to fix the rate [20 cents per description]
            for annual publication of delinquent tax list, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON moved to amend by reducing the penalty for delinquent taxes from
            "ten" to "five" per cent., and striking out
            "six" per cent. on delinquent taxes and Inserting
            "five" in lieu.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS--It is difficult enough now for the treasurers to collect, taxes. The
            amendment would be an additional invitation to men not to pay their taxes. The penalties
            are now low enough. Legislation should look to encourage the payment of taxes. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER said the law is construed differently in different counties. He insisted, 10
            per cent. was not too much of a penalty, and where the tax remains delinquent for one
            year, six per cent. interest should be charged. His experience as a county treasurer
            showed the necessity for the provisions of this bill. He opposed the pending amendment,
            and insisted that no impediment should be thrown in the way of collecting taxes. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>

        <p> Mr. March's bill, [H. R. 58] to amend an act declaring attorneys' fees
          in bills of exchange, notes, etc.. illegal, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER submitted an amendment, which was taken by consent, providing that this law
          shall not affect any existing contracts. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD thought the bill should not pass. He said we ought not to put such sweeping
          clauses in the laws as this one, which does not allow a man to agree to pay
          attorneys' fees even if he wants to. </p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE said it would work hardships with widows and orphans in many cases. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS was compelled to vote for the abolishment of the entire matter of collecting
          attorney fees on contracts of all kinds. </p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND was opposed to the bill because he thought it would work hardships to the

        <p>Mr. DRAKE thought the passage of the bill would give rise to trouble in neighborhoods. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL said the passage or this bill would do much towards keeping neighborhoods

        <p>Mr. Osborn of Elkhart's bill [H. R. 498], to amend sections 65 and 66 of the

        <p>Mr. Works' bill, [H. R. 30] to amend section 8 of an act concerning the
          alienation of property, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER and Mr. HEROD did not see any reason to change the present law. The law, as
          it now stands, when the estate is deeded in common between the husband and wife jointly,
          does not admit of an execution on the the property for the debt of the husband, and in
          case of the death of either party the survivor comes into possession of the entire estate. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS explained: The object of this bill is to make the conveyance to the husband and
          wife, vest in them the title as tenant in common. The creditors can then reach the
          property of the husband, and upon his death the wife and children would inherit the
          property according to the law of decents. A conveyance to husband and wife under the
          present law places it beyond the reach of the creditors of both husband and wife, and
          takes the property entirely out of trade. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought this law ought to pass, in order to protect the legal heirs and
          creditors. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON was opposed to any innovation upon the principles of the old law, and he was
          opposed to the change proposed in this bill. </p>

          misdemeanors--it repeals the provoke law--was read the third time and passed the House
          by--yeas 55, nays 27. </p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, of Daviess' bill [H. R. 444] defining warehouse receipts, was read
          the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, explaining the features of the bill, said the bill was in the interest of
          farmers, producers and manufacturers of distilled, spirits, by enabling those not desiring
          to dispose of their products to store the same with warehouse men, and taking receipts
          therefor, which receipts can be used for collaterals or title to the property embraced
          therein can be transit: ned by assignment of receipt or receipts for the same. The bill
          would enables small manufacturers of distilled spirits, or persons storing grain or other
          commodities to realize monies by virtue of said receipts and thereby obviate the necessity
          of the owners sacrificing their grain, spirits or commodities by being forced to sell on a
          depressed market. </p>
        <p>The bill then passed the House by yeas 66, nays 11. </p>
        <p>Mr. Conner's bill [H. R. 84] to encourage the planting and growing of forest
          trees was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS objected to the bill as being clearly unconstitutional, and he did not think it
          would be right to exempt property from taxation because of what may be cultivated thereon. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER: There are four New England and six Western States that have such a law. He
          had examined the several constitutions of these states, and they were nearly like the
          constitution of this State, and he did not see that the proposed law conflicts in any way
          with the constitution.</p>
        <p> Mr. STUCKER understood that the bill exempts certain lands from taxation after being set
          out in forest trees. He was opposed to exempting any species of property from taxation,
          and in his judgment persons living in cities that owned large lots of land that is very
          valuable, located in the suburbs, would plant a few trees, and ask that they be exempt
          from taxation. Why not exempt all orchards in the State? He was opposed to this bill, or
          any other that will exempt any class of property from taxation.</p>

          House--yeas 72, nays 3. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD, in explanation of his negative vote, when his name was called, said it
          seomed to him that the bill was so carefully worded as to cut out the sale of any foreign
          fertilizer. He therefore voted "no. ' </p>

        <p>The reading of the minutes was dispensed with. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. KAHLO, his bill [S. 56] to amend sections 175 and l7d of the general
          practice act, was road the second time, with a substitute reported by the committee,
          providing that no court in this State shall have jurisdiction in case of attachment,
          garnisheement, or supplementary proceedings where the plaintiff and principal defendant
          are both non-residents, and the money sought for is the personal earnings or wages due the
          principal defendant from any person or corporation doing business in this State. The
          report was concurred in, and the bill ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHAFFER, his bill [S. 122] to provide for repairs on free turnpike roads
          in the several counties of the State, was read the second time and ordered engrossed,
          after concurrence in the committee amendments. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HEILMAN, his bill [S. 325] to amend the charter of the town of
          Evansville, was read the second time, committee amendments concurred in, and the bill
          ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HART, his mortgage chattel secreting bill: [S. 169, described in these
          Reports January 20] was read the second time, with a committee substitute therefor.</p>
        <p> Mr. HEFRON introduced the bill to fix a penalty for the violation of a civil contract;
          which was going a little too far: an innovation upon the practice in this country that
          ought: not to be allowed.</p>
        <p> Mr. HART believed the principle of this bill to be right, in order to prevent frequent
          losses of mortgaged property, especially in the border counties. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the bill was right.</p>
        <p> Mr. POINDEXTER referred to his knowledge of cases where the bill would prove a great
          advantage.</p>
        <p> The substitute was adopted, and the bill ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, his bill [S. 258] to legalize certain acts of the local

          <p> On motion by Mr. FOSTER his bill [S. 103] to authorize cities to construct and
            maintain water works; issue and sell bonds to pay for said construction; was read the
            second time, with committee amendments, which were concurred in.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS offered an amendment, which was agreed to, excluding Indianapolis from the
            provisions of the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES regarded this as too important a measure to be hurried through without
            careful consideration: it might destroy vested rights in many towns along the old Wabash
            and Erie canal, and in other places. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER understood the bill to apply to cities which desired to build water works.
            It is substantially the same bill that has worked well for many years in Ohio. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL offered an amendment providing that the bill shall apply only to the city
            of Fort Wayne and within three miles thereof.</p>
          <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said his bill, heretofore passed the Senate, excludes all cities
            where water works companies are already in operation. Toe amendment proposed is class
            legislation and nothing else, and should not be agreed to. A letter just received by him
            states that the citizens and authorities of Fort Wayne are very anxious for the passage
            of this bill. It is carefully guarded. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE saw no necessity for the 10-mile provision in the bill. The St. Mary and St
            Joe river forms a confluence at Fort Wayne, and that city can have all the water she
            wants, without going 10 miles for it. Two miles is a reasonable distance; he therefore
            would support the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER was satisfied if this amendment be adopted the bill will be
            unconstitutional.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON regarded the amendment as going beyond, the restrictions imposed by the
            constitution on legislative power. It ought to he within the power of the cities to
            employ any and every means to procure pure and wholesome water, and whether it is within
            one or ten miles is immaterial. They should be allowed to bring it from any distance
            they ;ire willing to pay for. There are provisions in this bill which prevent any
            advantage being taken of vested rights, or any abuse practiced under it.</p>
          <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN favored the 10 mile provision of the bill, so the city might have the
            advantage of it in cases of necessity or emergency.</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to strike out the word "artificial," wherever it
            occurs in the bill. He saw strong and cogent reasons for this amendment, in order to
            strike down incursions upon vested and private rights. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER moved to strike from the bill the words "incorporated
            town" wherever they occur. He said this bill proposes to place the right to
            levy taxes and construct costly and expensive water works, even where they can not
            afford such luxuries. Suppose town trustees conclude to have a job in the building of
            water works, they should be restrained by such an amendment as this. Trustees have now
            too much power, and the result is that most all the cities and towns in. the State are
            largely in debt.</p>
          <p> It was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER moved to amend sec. 1 by providing that bonds should not be sold for less
            than 97 cents on the dollar. To say that incorporated towns may negotiate bonds, on any
            condition or terms they can obtain, is a dangerous power. It was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES moved to amend sec. 2 by providing that nothing herein shall be construed
            to authorize the taking or condemning of any artificial water course belonging to any
            individual or corporation. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT thought the bill should be so amended that two-thirds of the voting
            population be required to petition therefor before the authorities can proceed in the
            matter of building water works.</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON believed the bill should be referred to another committee, that it may
            have an opportunity to engraft in the bill the provisions of law referred to in the
            bill. He made a motion that it be referred to a special committee of three.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD desired not to throw any obstructions in the way of the passage of this bill,
            as far as Fort Way nets concerned, but the second section was very dangerous, because
            under it any three trustees could burden a small or a large town with a very heavy debt;
            and under it they could also rob real estate owners. Shear off some of the power
            conferred by this section and he would vote for the bill. The motion to refer was agreed
            to. </p>
          <p>The Lieutenant GOVERNOR makes the <orgName>committee of conference</orgName> on the
            interest bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">[S. 277]</ref> to consist of Messrs.
            Menzies, Coffey and Cadwallader. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WIER, his bill [S. 166] to repeal all laws for the levy of a cash poll
            tax,. was read the second time, with a favorable committee report thereon. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR objected to this bill becoming a law because it would relieve all the young
            mien in the State from paying a poll or head tax. If this poll tax is swept away, the
            tax wil1 have to be made up on the 40 acre tract of the poor man or the lone widow. The
            poll tax is a source of revenue in every town, township and county in the State. Young
            men are better able to pay poll tax than the poor farmer or mechanic, who must pay more
            tax to make up the deficiency. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIER claimed the bill demands four days' work on the highway, which is as
            much as should be called for as a poll tax. The present operation of the poll tax law is
            very heavy on the poor men--in some places four or five dollars--which amounts to an
            outrage in very many cases. This tax should be taken off the poor men and put on
            property.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES--To say any man can enjoy the protection of society and contribute nothing
            to the support of government is wrong in principle, and evil in its effect. The bill
            would relieve the improvident and careless from paying one of the easiest and lightest
            of taxes. It proposes class legislation of the most vicious character. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS--There is no right more sacred than protection to person, and any man asking
            or expecting such protection ought to be taxed. This bill should not be passed, as it is
            class legislation--it is saying that all tax shall be collected from property only. It
            would be a misfortune to the people to say a certain class of men are not liable to pay
            any tax. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIER disclaimed any intention by this bill to wipe out the road tax, and if it so
            reads he was willing to have it changed. It is the last part only he desired to wipe
            out, and it is <pb n="186" xml:id="VAA8558-17-188"/> but just to the poor man that this
            bill should pass.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON failed to see how this bill could be denominated class legislation. It is
            broad and sweeping in it terms. As to the objection: the escape of young men from the
            poll tax if we repeal this law: nine-tenths of them escape now. The people who will be
            benefitted by this bill are the married men whose little store of furniture is likely to
            be dragged out in the street and sold by the tax gatherer. Thia measure is a just and
            fair one, intended to benefit that class of men. who are needy. There is no injustice in
            it.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE thought the poor man was sufficiently protected now. Government should be
            looked at in a business point of view. If property or person is protected that
            protection should be paid for, whether the man be rich or poor. He opposed the repeal of
            the poll tax.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT moved the bill be recommitted with instructions to prepare an amendment
            to exempt all property now exempt from execution. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to amend by indefinitely postponing the bill. </p>
          <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

          <!--P.186 in BLR-->
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill and report, was rejected by--yeas 14,
            nays 24. </p>
          <p>0n motion by Mr. WIER, his bill [S. 144] was referred to a special committee of three,
            viz: Messrs. Wier, Dice and Wood. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON introduced a bill [S. 639] extending the time for stay of executions, which,
            on his motion, was referred to Messrs. Briscoe, Woollen and Urmston without reading. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. COFFEY, his bill [S. 61] was read the second time and ordered
            engrossed.</p>
          <p> Mr. COFFEY explaining: The practice of sheriffs in many counties is to appoint a
            number of unnecessary bailiffs, and if this bill be passed the sheriff can only appoint
            by consent of the court, the object being to curtail the number of bailiffs. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LANGDON, his bill<ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_207"> [S. 207]</ref> for
            the determination and allowance of claims against the State. was read the second
            time.</p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON said there should be some limitation to claims accruing before the passage
            of the act. There are some claims originating before the limit named in this bill that
            could be substantiated in a court of justice more clearly than many claims that would
            undoubtedly, under every rule of justice, be allowed by any court, in the land.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE desired to see the individual protected. The State being sovereign it is to
            be presumed she will properly adjust all claims against herself. Ought not the statute
            to provide that every claim now existing should be presented within six years from the
            taking effect of this act, and any claim arising hereafter shall be presented within six
            years after they become due and payable? He offered a substitute for the report to this
            effect.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE thought this a very important bill, and should favor any measure looking to
            taking from before the General Assembly, any and all matters except these having direct
            reference to legitimate legislation. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. WOOD favored the substitute. The substitute was agreed to upon a
            division--affirmative 26. negative 12. </p>
          <p> The committee report as amended, was concurred in.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD offered an amendment to exclude from consideration all claims known as the
            Morgan raid or Wabash and Erie canal claims. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON said these claims are barred by the substitute just adopted. </p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD feared, unless specially barred. that by some special plea the claims
            referred to might be presented and by a misconstruction of the provisions of this bill
            acted upon. If the amendment does no good, it can do no harm. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment was agreed to by--yeas 37,nays9. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR ineffectually moved to amend sec. 10 by admitting claims for ditching done
            under the law of May 20,1852, if presented within two years.</p>
          <p> The bill as amended was passed the second reading and ordered to be engrossed.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to dispense with the regular order of business and take up the bill
            [S. 54] to apportion the State for senatorial and representative purposes. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said on his side of the House they were ready at the time set for the
            consideration of this bill, but at the instance of the other side the matter has been
            postponed from day to day, and now he moved that it be put off till to-morrow
            morning.</p>
          <p> On motion of Mr. MENZIES--yeas 26, nays 25--the Lieutenant Governor giving the casting
            vote in the affirmative--this motion was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the same vote. The
            main question was ordered by a similar vote--the Lieutenant Governor giving the casting
            affirmative vote in each instance. The motion to take up the bill S. 54 was then agreed
            to without a division. The bill was then read the second time, with a report of the
            committee thereon. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to amend the committee's report by substituting new matter;
            and on that motion demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and
            under its operation the was adopted, by yeas 26, nays 25. The report of the committee as
            amended was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved the bill be ordered engrossed, and on that motion demanded the
            previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under its operation the bill

        <p>House bills introduced and described in these reports of Saturday, numbered 610 to 632,
          inclusive, were read the second time by title only, and referred to appropriate
          committees,except the bill [H. R. 629] to repeal the act to provide for township
          elections, which was ordered to be engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's resolution amending the rules so that on the call of counties for
          the introduction of new propositions, each member shall have the privilege of calling up
          for final action one bill, was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS moved that the favorable committee report or the bill, [H. R. 118] allowing a
          circuit court to each county, be concurred, in and the bill ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. STEVENS said a bill of this kind would disgrace our judicial system, and he would
          oppose the passage of any such measure. He was therefore opposed to its engrossment. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS said he only wanted to get the bill in proper shape before the House, in order
          that their action thereon might be intelligent.</p>
        <p> The House concurred in the report of the committee, bat refused to order the bill to the
          engrossment.</p>

          has been made of any and all fees so collected by him. </p>
        <p>The House took a recess until 2 o'clock. </p>



        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> The following described bills for acts were introduced, read the first time, and
            passed to the second reading: </p>
          <p>By Mr. OVERMEYER, [H. R. 633] to provide means for the erection of the new State House
            (three cents on the $100 for 1879; for 1880 four cents.) He also introduced a
            resolution, which was adopted, that the treasurer inform the House what balance of cash
            remained in the treasury on November 30, 1878, December 31, 1878, and January 31,1879;
            also what have been the receipts and disbursements since January 31,1879, and what the
            balance of cash on hand now is. </p>
          <p>By Mr. CONFER, [H. R. 634] to amend section 8 of the subdivision of section 7 of an act
            to provide for an uniform assessment of taxes, etc. </p>
          <p>By Mr. CUNNINGHAM, by request, [H. R. 635] to amend sections 1, 2 and 3 of an act to
            provide for the running at large of domestic animals. </p>
          <p>By Mr. ROBINSON, [H. R. 636] to amend section 15 of an act to regulate elections. </p>
        
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES</head>
          <p> were concurred in, unless otherwise stated, to wit:</p>
          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, from the Com-[mittee] <pb n="188" xml:id="VAA8558-17-190"/>
            <orgName>[Com]-mittee on the Judiciary</orgName>, returned the bill S. 209 with a
            recommendation that the bill do pass. Also the following House bills from the same
            committee: H. R. 268, 214, 328, 539 and 247, which were laid on the table; also H. R.
            306, 596, 607, 609, 508, 685, 507, 478, 581, 83, 354, 432, 524, with favorable reports
            thereon; H. R. 404, 272 and 148, with a recommendation for indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. Tulley said the bill H. R. 148 was a bill which quite a number of the counties of
            the State were interested in, and he thought such a bill should be passed. He hoped that
            the report of the committee would not be concurred in. On his motion the report was laid
            on the table and the bill ordered engrossed. </p>
          <p>Also the bills H. R. 57, 287,352, 441, 440, 434, 360, 170, 105, 274, 293, 232, 490,
            165, 204, 523, 341, 474, 186 and 95, with a recommendation that they be indefinitely
            postponed--except the bill H. R. 95, which was ordered engrossed: also H. R. 416, 541,
            50, 309, 308, 196, 579, 178, 248, 517, 13 and 600, with a recommendation that they lie
            on the table. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. Major the report of the committee on the bill H. R. 600 was laid
            on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said the consideration of the report of the committee on his bill [H. R.
            13] brought out the question whether we shall reduce the number of jurymen to six. The
              <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName> recommend that the bill lie on the table. The
            constitution does not mention the number of jurors, and there is nothing that does fix
            the number unless we go back to the old English law. He introduced the bill for the
            purpose of saving the State at least $150,000 per annum. He demanded the yeas and nays
            upon concurring in the report. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON thought we had no right to cut down the number of jurors below the number
            that was required by the common law when the constitution was made.</p>
          <p> Mr. 0SBORNE of Elkhart could not support the bill because he believed it was
            unconstitutional. If it could be done constitutionally he would support such a
            measure.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The House refused to concur in the report--yeas 33, nays 53. The bill was ordered
            engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS, chairman of the <orgName>committee on organization of courts</orgName>,
            returned the bills [H. R. 276, 371 and 602] recommending their indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. CAMPBELL hoped the report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 462] to abolish the
            superior court of Cass county would not be concurred in. He had a resolution from the
            three political parties asking that the superior court be abolished. He was instructed
            to work for its repeal, and he hoped the bill would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SCHOLL had not a word of objection to abolishing the superior court in Cass county,
            but this bill goes further and asks for the reconstruction of the Thirty-ninth Judicial
            Circuit, and asks that Caps county be made a judicial chair of itself. He thought the
            report of the committee ought to be concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAILEY was a member of that committee, and insisted that the resolutions of the
            political parties were for buncomb, with the view of catching votes. He understood that
            the courts were already overloaded with business. He was opposed to abolishing cozrts to
            gratify whims. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON could see no objection to laying the report upon the table and let the bill
            come before the House, and as Cass county has demanded the abolishment of the superior
            court it ought to be done. Let us amend the bill and harmonize all parties. </p>
          <p>Mr. Briggs held in his hands several petitions from heavy tax-payers asking that the
            superior court be continued, and protesting against repealing the law that organized the
            court. He urged that the House sustain the report of the committee.</p>
          <p> Mr. Campbell said if they could get rid of Pulaski county in the judicial circuit they
            could do without the superior court. He said these petitions were signed under a
            misapprehension. There was no party in it whatever; it was a mere matter of economy. He
            made an ineffectual motion that the committee report be laid on the table.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.188 in BLR-->
          <p> The House then concurred in the report of the committee by--yeas 56, nays 29. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. HANDY, the bill, [H. R. 371] and report was laid on the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. KESTER, from the <orgName>committee on banks</orgName> returned the bill [H. R.
            519] for the incorporation of banks, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
            postponed. The report was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS, from the <orgName>committee on education</orgName>, returned the bills, [H.
            R. 382, 418 and 491] with favorable recommendations; also, [H. R. 394. 484, 314, 538,
            429, 437 and 302] recommending indefinite postponement. Also, [H. R. 287, 361, 282 and
            51], recommending that they lie on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. STUCKER said he hoped the report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 51] would not
            be concurred in. This bill is of great importance to the people of the State. It
            abolishes the office of county school superintendent and creates the office of school
            examiner, thereby saving to the people of the State at least $75,000 per annum. The
            school examiner can and will do all that is necessary to be done, and not cost the
            people one-tenth of what we now pay. The people demand that this surplus office shall be
            abolished and save that extra expense that is now enforced upon them. It is a settled
            fact that we have too many officers and we ought to curtail all that can be dispensed
            with. This is one that can be lopped off with good results, and our schools not impaired
            in the least. </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAK said it was an outrage upon the dignity of the State to suppose that you could
            get a man qualified to discharge the duties of school superintendent for the pitiful sum
            of $2 a day.</p>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR,of Davis, said no one gloried more in the school facilities of Indiana than
            he did, but he thought this Legislature ought to do something to relieve the people of
            this incubus that rests upon this branch of the school department. It was to correct an
            abuse which prompted him to support a measure that would limit the time of service of
            this officer. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, moved that the bill [H. R. 51] be recommitted to a special
            committee of five. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, offered an amendment, which Mr. Edwins moved to lay on the
            table. </p>
          <p>And then the House adjourned. </p>

        </dateline>
        <p> After prayer by Rev. E. A. Bradley, of Christ's church, the reading of the
          minutes was dispensed with. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE, his bill [S. 390] to prevent certain live stock from running at
          large, with the bills, S. 67 and 49, on the same subject. A committee report presents a
          substitute for the three bills. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE explained: The substitute provides that the board of commissioners may make an
          order to prevent the running at large of animals, except swine, but only on petition of a
          majority of the land owners. The hog cholera has spread all over the country by the
          running at large of hogs; those who live in the country know what an almost intolerable
          nuisance it is. No stock ought to be permitted to run at large, but as this is a
          compromise, he hoped it would speedily pass the Senate and be communicated to the House of
          Representatives. The pecuniary benefits of this bill is that it would save the people of
          the State more than all the public buildings cost, by requiring every man to fence only as
          against his own stock. No person shall be required to fence against stock running at
          large. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored the substitute. If a man wants to let his stock run at large, all
          damage done by the stock ought to be paid for by the owner. The extra expense of keeping
          up fences. Millions of dollars of fence are kept up. The cost of keeping. The value of all
          the stock in the State would not amount to one-tenth the expense to farmers of keeping up
          fences required to keep out their neighbor's stock, and protect his cultivated
          land. </p>
        <p> Mr. Tarlton favored the substitute. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON cited the fact that there are thousands of uncultivated acres, which afford
          grazing for the poor man's stock, not interfering with anybody. This State is not
          prepared for a law of this kind. For the purpose of testing the sense of the Senate he
          made n ineffectual motion--yeas 19, nays 29--that the whole subject lie on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK regarded the substitute as the best proposition of the four on this subject,
          but the present law is preferable. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS: The present law being ineffectual some such measure as the one proposed
          ought to be passed. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER: Some of his constituents desired legislation on this subject, but he did not
          believe this bill was what they desired. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. MENZ1ES the substitute was amended by providing that nothing herein
          contained shall be constructed so as to relieve any railroad company from keeping up
          fences. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE believed a large majority of his constituents are in favor of a stock law. The
          objection to the substitute is that it does not provide a penalty for the running at large
          of stock, except hogs.</p>
        <p> The substitute, as amended, was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR thought there is inconsistency in the bill, and he doubted whether the
          proviso will meet the emergency intended. The stock being trespassing when killed by the
          cars, the railroad company will not be held responsible. And he proposed the section
          proposing a fine, and also liability for damages; thinking that a little too strong. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.189 in BLR-->
        <p>The bill passed the second reading by--yeas 26, nays 21, and was ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK, his bill [S. 194, see these reports February 20 a. m.] to
          amend section 20 of the witness act, was read the third time, and passed by--yeas 36, nays
          14.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE and Mr. SHIRK stating they would be glad to have the bill go further, but as
          it is in the right direction it received their affirmative vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, believing the bill would introduce an element of discord between man and
          wife, voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. RAGAN, from the special committee thereon, returned his bill [S. 274] to relieve
          Thomas N. Jones, of Hendricks county, from a judgement taken against him on the official
          bond of Lawrence S. Shuler, late warden of the Southern prison, recommending its passage.
          The report was concurred in; the bill read the second time.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL insisted this is a case where the Legislature should not enter satisfaction
            <pb n="190" xml:id="VAA8558-17-192"/> of judgement--should not interfere with the court
          records. It is not a proper way to administer Government. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT: As a rule he favored holding bondsmen to their bonds, but this is an
          exceptional case. This man has but a little house worth the amount of the judgment and no
          more: kindness, good feeling and liberality should be exhibited here. </p>
        <p>Mr. RAGAN admitted this might prove a dangerous precedent, but being personally
          acquainted with the facts, believed the State should not turn out one of its best citizens
          in his old age to the cold charities of the world. This judgment would sweep away his
          little home and leave him homeless. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK in a general way, would not favor such legislation, but there are some cases
          which should be made an exception, and this is one.</p>
        <p>Mr. WITHERBOTHAM also thought extenuating circumstances were connected with this case. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR should vote against all such bills, and if this be a precedent we had as well
          burn statute books and abolish courts. This measure is against every principle of justice
          and right. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS regarded the general rule as a good one, but was favorably disposed to this
          measure, believeing it would, take the last dollar from this old gentleman. </p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE opposed this bill, believing such an act would say to every man who goes
          abroad, "You may steal what you have a mind to, and be as big a defaulter as you
          please, the Legislature will relieve your bondsmen."</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The Senate refused to order the bill engrossed by yeas 19, nays 29.</p>

        <p> On motion of Mr. LANGDON, the state claims commission bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_207">[S. 207-fully described in these reports of yesterday p. m.]
          </ref>was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER opposed the bill, regarding it as a dangerous measure to transfer this power
          from the Legislature into the hands of State officers. If this bill should pass, there
          will be so many claims filed against the State, the Marion circuit court will be kept busy
          in their adjudication, and it will require more than one attorney-general. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON took distinct issue with the senator from Spencer [Mr. Kramer]. This bill
          puts a quietus on all claims over six years old, and it will save much time of this and
          other Legislatures. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE--The State ought to pay her debt like any individual. The only question is how
          to determine the justness of claims preferred against her. He favored the bill because
          under it justice can be better done to all parties, and much time will be saved to each
          General. Assembly, besides getting rid of lobbyists coming up at every session. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT was unable to see why there should be any opposition to this bill. His only
          wonder was such a measure had not been passed long ago.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE could imagine the opposition to this bill might grow out of the hope to
          galvanize old claims into new life. He would rather trust such a board as the one proposed
          than the 150 members of the Legislature, and regarded the bill as providing for as cheap,
          safe and just disposition of claims as could be devised. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR favored the provisions of this bill until the Senate saw proper to restrict
          the limitation to six years. The State can not afford to refuse to pay her just debts to
          her citizens. </p>
        <p>The bill passed the Senate by--yeas 41, nays 9. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock, </p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> On motion by Mr. FOWLER the bill, <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_007">[H. R. 7]</ref> to
            regulate the working of coal mines, declaring a den upon the works and machinery, etc.,
            was read the second time. Mr. STREIGHT deprecated action on so large and so important a
            bill unless it be printed so it can be more carefully considered. He made a motion to
            print 100 copies. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER and Mr. BRISCOE objected to the delay the printing would cause. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT said this was a strike in a new direction, and interferes to some extent with
            a vast amount of property in this State. But few are acquainted with the provisions of
            this bill. He desired the bill recommitted and printed. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEILMAN reminded senators holding over of the right two years ago over a bill
            similar to this. It is an important measure, and the Senate ought to be cautious in
            acting upon it. In Clay county their are no mines over 70 feet in depth, but it is
            different down on the Ohio river. He knew of shafts sunk to the depth of 285 feet, and
            places where a single shaft cost $25,000. He opposed the bill, being in favor of cheap
            fuel for every inhabitant of the State, </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZ1ES insisted that there is a demand for some stringent police regulation to
            protest human life in the mines of this State. There is a large class who delve in the
            bowels of the earth for their living and a day's delay is dangerous. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEILMAN did not believe there had been a single life lost in the deep mines on the
            Ohio river in 30 years.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE watched the reading of the bill as closely as he could. It is a bill of great
            importance and should receive all the consideration it can get. It affects some of the
            moat vital interests of the State. He defied any man, no matter how great his
            acquirements, to understand even its legal effects from the reading. The relation of
            capital to labor is involved in it:--one of the most profound studies of the age. If
            that bill becomes a law as it is now, it might destroy the mining interest of the State
            of Indiana, and the very object it is intended to accomplish. Police regulations should
            be made as nearly equal in their bearing and effects as possible. The bill goes down to
            the miserable pettifogging known in justice's court, and should not be
            tolerated in legislation. On the pretext of protesting labor, there is dragged in this
            bill the very class of legislation that has been denounced here day after day. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD did not think the friends of the bill should desire to press it through
            without other senators knowing much about it. He favored the motion to print.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT could not see why the friends of the bill were so certain it will be
            defeated if printed, unless it is unworthy to be passed. He knew something of the
            spirit, that has been demanding this kind of legislation for years, and warned senators
            to act upon this subject with great care, </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER characterized the argument just made as a very strange one, and contended
            that this bill will not interfere with the mining interests of the State. Such
            provisions have not interfered with the mining interests of States where similar laws
            have been passed, and this bill is a much more modified law than those of Ohio or
            Pennsylvania. There is not a word of truth in the argument that this bill would raise
            the prici1 of coal. It is only to project those unfortunate men who go down deep into
            the earth, there to labor day after day in order that we may enjoy the benefits of their
            labor.</p>
          <p> The report of the committee, as amended, <pb n="191" xml:id="VAA8558-17-193"/> was
            adopted. 100 copies ordered printed, end the bill and report referred back to the
            committee. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HEFRON, his bill [S. 297] to abolish the office of state geologist was
            read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON said the office has outlived its usefulness, and now is an opportune time to
            get rid of it, as the occupant has tendered his resignation. There has been expended
            about $75,O0O for this office since its creation in l869, and probably no citizen
            unconnected with the expenditure has been benefited one cent Save the geological survey
            it has been used as the means for advertising the wares of different persons throughout
            the State (in confirmation of which statement he read extracts from the reports of the
            state geologist). The agricultural interests would not suffer much it the entire State
            Board of Agriculture were wiped out. Two years ago the State voted $28,000 to the State
            Board, and now it is asking $10,000 more. Every senator concedes that taxation should be
            reduced, but how can taxation be reduced unless there to be a reduction in public
            expenditures? We must commence somewhere to cut off, and this is nothing but a withered
            limb on the trunk of the tree of the body politic.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON moved to amend so that the geological specimens shall go to
            "Purdue University" instead of the "State Board of
            Agriculture." </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the researches of the State geologist have been of great benefit to
            the State in years past--not so much recently its heretofore. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE was unable to see any grounds for the ridicule and badinage sought to be,
            brought out in reference to the geological report. He argued against the passage of the
            bill, insisting that to strike out this department of the government would be consummate
            folly. He regarded it as a cheap investment, as contrasted with the great benefits
            derived from it. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved a substitute for the amendment by striking out the words
            "State Board of Agriculture" and inserting in lieu "The State
            Library." </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the substitute by striking out the words "State
            University "and inserting in lieu the words "State Library." </p>
          <p>This amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHAFFER hoped this bill would not be engrossed. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT was not anxious that this bill should pass. The friends of the state
            geologist. claim his report is an advertisement of the resources of the State, and a
            very valuable one,too. The State University is the most appropriate place to put the
            collection referred to if the office should be abolished, but he was opposed to that
            proposition.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The amendment to the substitute was rejected by--yeas 11, nays 37. The substitute was
            adopted on a division--24 affirmative and 16 negative--and the bill ordered engrossed. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

            State into congressional districts, was taken up by--yeas 40,nays 7. </p>

          church.</p>
        <p> The reading of the Journal was necessarily suspended, as the clerk had not produced it. </p>
        <p>The motion of Mr. Allen, of Putnam, to refer the bill to abolish the office of county
          school superintendent [H. R. 51] to a select committee of five was agreed to, and the
          speaker made the committee to consist of Messrs. Allen of Putnam, Slacker, Humphreys,
          Copeland and Owen. The bill, H. R. 408, on the same subject was also referred to the same
          committee.</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. HUBBARD the bill [H. R. 73] was amended and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. FLODDER, chairman of the committee on trust funds, returned the bills H. R. 529 and
          239 with favorable recommendations, which were concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS, from the <orgName>committee on Fees and Salaries</orgName>, returned Mr.
          Work's bill [H. R. 322] fixing salaries and duties of officers, with a
          recommendation that the bill pass. The report was concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. EDWlNS, chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>,
          returned Mr. Conner's bill [H. R. 22] for a homestead exemption estate of $1,000
          recommending its passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER offered an amendment that the provisions of this bill shall not apply to
          existing contracts. The amendment was accepted. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS moved to amend by striking out "$1 000" and insert
          "$500"in lieu, and that the debtor shall have the right to take either
          real or personal, as he shall elect; which was ruled out of order. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, moved to amend by making it $1,000, either personal or real. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON was in favor of a $1,000 real homestead, but was opposed to exempting so large
          an amount of personal.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHANKS said this bill, as reported by the committee, is shorn of one-half of its
          virtues. it has been changed from its original, character of securing. In the language of
          the constitution, "The privilege of the debtor to enjoy the necessary comforts of
          life shall be enjoined by wholesome laws, exempting a reasonable amount of property from
          seizure or sale for the payment of any debtor liability hereafter contracted,"
          and by this report now concurred in to grant to those who have lands, $1,000 worth of real
          estate, and to those who do not own laud, only the poor. $200, now in mockery allowed the
          debtor--under the present law. This is an unjust discrimination against the laborer that
          the land owner does not ask us to make in their favor. it is not criminal to not own land,
          nor is it an especial virtue to own land. The provisions of the bill to secure to the
          mechanic his tools, to the trader his substance, for the support of their families, has
          been stricken out of the bill. He desired to reconsider the vote by which the report was
          concurred in, so that we may do equal justice to all the people before the laws of the
          State. He, therefore, moved that the vote by which the report was concurred in be
          reconsidered. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS hoped the motion to reconsider would prevail. He wanted to see equality in the
          matter, and was in favor of a $1,000 exemption whether it was wrapped up in a homestead or
          not. </p>
        <pb n="192" xml:id="VAA8558-17-194"/>
        <p>Mr. OWEN thought the object was to make a permanent population, and if we make the
          exemption either personal or real, it would destroy the object of the bill and take away
          the merit of it. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER said that personal property exemption, was embraced in the bill. The theory of
          the bill was to encourage our citizens to secure permanent homes. </p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS said the committee after examining a number of bills on the same subject had
          concluded with the amendments reported to recommend the passage of this bill. A real
          homestead worth $1,000 and the $300 already allowed by statute would be the best law we
          could enact for the poor man. It would make better citizens, and so he was in favor of the
          passage of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY said it was the homestead exemption in this bill that recommended it to him.
          There is no greater incentive to a man than that he can take his little earnings and put
          them in a home and know that he has the protection of law in so doing. It would encourage
          men to save their dollars and put them into a home. It not only encouraged the man, but
          each member of the family. He hoped the motion to reconsider would not prevail. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Warrick, thought this bill did not encourage the poor man. He thought they
          should have the right to put their money in anything they may see fit, either personal or
          real. He would not vote for this kind of a bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. BRIGGS said under the provisions of this bill just as soon as the homestead gets to
          be worth over $1,000 the creditor has the privilege to call in appraisers and scalp it of
          all over that amount. He was opposed to that kind of a law, and this Legislature ought not
          to pass such a law. He was opposed to the amendment [Mr. Overmeyer's] for he
          thought that if the law ever intended to relieve its citizens and allow them an exemption,
          It ought to be done now.</p>
        <p> Mr. SAINT said he was in favor of a $1,000 exemption, but was opposed to confine it
          exclusively to a homestead. As he understood this bill, every dollar that a man was
          willing to lay by for a homestead was subject to execution. He thought this was wrong; and
          he thought it an unjust discrimination. He claimed that the $1,000 was just as sacred to
          the man in business as to the man who would invest it in a homestead, </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH said we were compelled to operate on general principles. He would go as far as
          any one to relieve those who are laboring under the burden of indebtedness, but the
          supreme court had decided that the Legislature can not make a law that would affect
          existing contracts. It is the laborer that the law should cherish, and he wanted to give
          him a homestead. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said the question seemed to be whether this exemption shall be in real or in
          real and personalty. He deemed it unjust to discriminate between the man who holds real
          estate and the man who has none. He was in favor of the $1,O00 exemption, and let them
          take it in either real or personal property. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON said that other States had enacted such exemption laws, and had specified
          first a homestead, and second specified personal property, He was for the $1,000 homestead
          exemption, because thus far it was right, and he was also in favor of increasing the
          personal property exemption to $500. </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER wanted to know how the man was to work up to the $1,000, if he was in debt
          to begin with. He was in favor of the $1,000 exemption in either crawfish holes (as the
          gentleman from Marion [Mr. Herod] the other day designated the land in Ripley county,) or
          personal property. </p>

        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The question then recurring upon concurrence in the report of the committee--which
          strikes oat the personal property clause, (leaving $1,000 as a homestead and the old law
          of $300 personalty), the House refused to concur in the report by yeas 31, nays 60. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. MARCH the bill was recommitted to a select committee of five with
          instructions to report to-morrow. </p>

          excepting rat and bull terrier dogs from taxation, and on the motion of Mr. JOHNSON the
          bill was laid on the table by--yeas 57, nays 32. </p>
        <p>The same committee returned the bills H. R. 98,137, 296, 292 for indefinite postponement,
          and H. R. 278 to lie on the table, which reports were severally concurred in. </p>

        <p>The report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 292] for an exemption of personal property
          to the amount of $500, was laid on the table, and the bill was referred to the select
          committee on the same subject. </p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, the special order--being the consideration of
            the bill [H. R. 344] on fees and salaries, was taken up, and the amendments, as reported
            by the committee, were ordered to be considered by sections. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS offered a resolution. which was adopted, that the auditor report the
            names and amount due to special judges, to this House, in order that the same may be
            embraced in the specific appropriation bill. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. HESS and Mr. TULLEY, the report of the committee thereon and the
            bill [H. R. 226] to repeal the act authorizing loan associations, pending at adjournment
            for dinner, was laid on the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. MIERS said he believed this House as well as the <orgName>committee on fees and
              salaries</orgName> were anxious to do justice in the matter of fees and salaries, and
            in order that exact justice might be done he moved that the bill [H. R. 344] in relation
            to fees and salaries with the amendments thereto be referred to a special committee of
            five with instruction to return the bill Thursday, which motion the speaker ruled out of
            order. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS moved that the action of the House heretofore made that the bill shall be
            taken up by paragraphs or sections be reconsidered. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER was opposed to a reconsideration,but was in favor of sticking to the bill
            until something could be done, and either pass or reject it. </p>
          <pb n="193" xml:id="VAA8558-17-195"/>
          <p> Mr. BRIGGS was in hopes that the bill would be stuck to until disposed of.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD said it had been before the <orgName>Committee on Fees and
              Salaries</orgName>, and it had been considered in <orgName>Committee of the
              Whole</orgName>. He was therefore in favor of considering it now, amend it if the
            House see fit, and come square to the vote and go upon the record for or against the
            bill. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. OWEN the motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. JOHNSON offered an amendment to the first section to reduce the
            governor's salary from "five" to "four"
            thousand dollars per annum. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. SHANKS moved to amend the amendment by striking out 4 and inserting $3,000, which
            was rejected by--yeas 17, nays 75.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. Johnson's amendment was then adopted by--yeas 62, nays 31. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS moved to strike "1,500" in the salary of the
            governor's private secretary and insert "$1,000." </p>
          <p>Mr. BARKER moved to amend the amendment by making it $1,200. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On the motion of Mr. JOHNSON the amendments were laid on the table--yeas 69, nays 25. </p>
          <p>Mr. REED moved to strike out 1,500 and insert $2,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. M1ERS was in favor of making a fair reduction, and he believed that the secretary
            could earn $2,000.</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. BARKER the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. JOHNSON moved to strike out $2,000, as the salary of the Secretary of State, and
            insert $1,500.</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. NAVE the amendment was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEHMAN made an ineffectual motion to reduce the salary to $1,250. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. WORKS: Strike out and insert, "for each certificate and seal, 50 cents;
            for each commission issued to any officer to whom a commission is required by law to be
            issued, $1; for each attestation and seal, 50 cents;" which wis adopted
            by--yeas 56, nays 4. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to make the salary of secretary of State $2,500. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON moved to amend the amendment by making the salary $3,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER could not see why it was gentlemen should vote for such large salaries. He
            would venture to say that our State officers have been receiving three times as much as
            they could have made in any other profession. He was willing to make this salary $2,500.
            He was willing to pay what the officers were worth, and no more. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON said after we had taken the fees from this officer less than $3,000 would be
            too small a salary. He was in favor of paying these officers a fair salary in order that
            they might live like gentlemen and not as beggars. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS said the fees that had been cut off would amount to about $3,000, and in view
            of that fact he was willing to raise the salary $1,000. He did not think that the
            secretary and his two deputies could live on $3,800 a year. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The amendment to the amendment [Mr. Gordon's] was rejected by--yeas 41, nays
            53.</p>
          <p> Mr. Willard's amendment was then adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved to amend by adding that the auditor shall pay in all fees from
            foreign insurance companies, which was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS moved that the salary be $2,500, and be allowed all fees and commissions
            heretofore allowed by law. He said that, this would place the auditor on an equal
            footing with the Secretary of State. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON said that the duties and responsibilities of the Auditor of State are nearly
            double that of Secretary of State. He moved to amend the amendment by making the salary
            $4,000. We ought not to forget that the present incumbent was a hero of two wars. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS said that if we must consider the matter of reward for military service we
            would find ourselves embarrassed in the county offices on every hand. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS thought it would be more in keeping to make the amount $6,000 for the pay of
            four men in so important an office. We can't do ourselves justice by making the
            auditor's salary less than $4,000.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH said there was a large amount of work in the auditor's office. If
            he knew how to count, the fees of the auditor would amount to $6,000, and the bill
            allows clerk hire besides. He was in favor of a fixed salary for the auditor, and let
            the fees be paid into the State treasury. Four thousand dollars should be the extreme
            limit. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said we were not legislating now for the present incumbent. We are fixing a
            salary for this office now and for years to come. He thought $2,500 or $3,000 ample
            compensation.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

          <p> The amendment to the amendment [Mr. Gordon's] was rejected by--yeas 13, nays
            51.</p>
          <p> Mr. HESS moved to amend the amendment [Mr. Willard's] by striking out $2,500
            and inserting $3,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said that according to a resolution, adopted heretofore by the House, to
            hear the ladies' argument on women's suffrage, the hour having
            arrived, he therefore thought the House should take a recess.</p>
          <p> The SPEAKER then introduced successively Mrs. Governor WALLACE, who proceeded to read
            a memorial upon the subject of women's rights; Mrs. Dr. HAGGART, who addressed
            the House on the same subject; Mrs. Dr. MARY THOMAS, of Richmond, who addressed the
            House upon the legal aspect of the subject, and Mrs. Mamie E. Duon, who discoursed on
            the subject of representative women. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD offered a resolution That, having heard the unanswerable arguments of the
            women who have to-day presented their claims to equal suffrage, with deep humiliation,
            and a burning sense of shame for any neglected duty, do now pledge our honor, our
            influence and our votes, that we will enact such laws as will give them equal rights as
            citizens with ourselves. </p>
          <p>It was referred to the <orgName>committee on rights and privileges</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, offered a resolution which was adopted, inquiring into the
            expediency of reporting a bill extending the right of suffrage to woman. </p>
          <p>And the House adjourned. </p>

          <time>9 o'clock a. m.</time>

        <p> On motion by Mr. WOOD, the reading of the minutes was dispensed with, the city ward
          laying-out bill [S. 425 see the reports of February 20], was read the second time and
          ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. TREAT offered a resolution, for a committee of three, to ascertain what portion of
          the geological cabinet is the property of the State, which was amended by Mr. Reeve so as
          to require a full inventory of all such specimens; and by Mr. Dice further amended so as
          to inquire why annual reports have not been made by the State geologist for the past three
          years; and then the resolution as amended was adopted. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WIER, his bill [S. 144] to abolish the cash poll-tax, was read the
          second time. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS, beside other objections, regarded a provision in this bill, which he pointed
          out as unconstitutional, and hoped the bill would not be ordered to the engrossment. </p>
        <p>Mr. WIER would not yield his judgment to lawyers and other objectors to this bill, but
          contended the bill in its present form was right, and should be passed.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Mr. REEVE insisted the bill means nothing as it reads now, or if it means anything it
          means that no poll-tax can be levied less $1, and there are two provisions in the
          constitution with which it conflicts. On his motion the bill and report were laid on the
          table upon a division--affirmative 23, negative 17. </p>
        <p>On motion By Mr. FOWLER the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_112">[H. R. 112]</ref> for
          the appointment [by the governor] of the trustees of the Benevolent Institutions of the
          State, was read the second time with a favorable majority and an adverse minority report,
          recommending indefinite postponement, but if the bill does pass it be amended so that the
          governor shall appoint but one trustee, and the other to hold over. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT demanded a division of the questions embraced in the minority report; first
          on the recomendation for indefinite postponement. The bill contemplates, he said, by one
          stroke of the pen, to remove every man who has had experience in these institutions. Why
          this resolution? The only answer is: to satisfy the demands of a few political
          place-seekers. No senator having the good of these institutions at heart can desire such a
          sweeping resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER apprehended nothing that could be said would change the mind of a single
          senator on this subject; he therefore moved to reject the minority report, and on that
          motion demanded the previous question; which being seconded by the Senate, under its
          operation; the minority report was rejected by yeas 26, nays 25--the lieutenant governor
          giving the casting affirmative vote Messrs. Grubbs and Menzies explaining. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.194 in BLR-->
        <p>Mr. HARRIS made an ineffectual motion--yeas 25, nays 26--to indefinitely postpone the
          majority report--the lieutenant governor giving the casting vote. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to amend section. one by providing that no appointment shall be made,
          except to fill vacancies as they may occur, which, under the operations of the previous
          question demanded by Mr. BURRELL, was rejected by yeas 26, nays 25--the LIEUTENANT
          GOVERNOR giving the casting rejective vote. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. MENZIES moved that the bill be adopted as a whole and placed on the calendar, and on
          that motion demanded the previous question. The Senate refused to second the demand for
          the previous question by--yeas 24, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE voting "no," because this motion would cut off all
          opportunity for amendment of the bill. He said he would not be satisfied with this bill
          unless amended, as it ought, to be, and as was distinctly understood it should be. He
          opposed any material amendment in its important features, but insisted on the two simple
          amendments he indicated. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK offered an amendment fixing the salaries of the trustees of the Insane, and
          Deaf and Dumb at the present rate. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to reject the amendment, and on that motion demanded the previous
          question which was seconded and the <pb n="195" xml:id="VAA8558-17-197"/> main question
          ordered by--yeas 26, nays 25--and under its operation title amendment was rejected
          by--yeas 25, nays 26--the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR giving the casting vote in each case.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE offered an amendment allowing the superintendent of each to reside in the
          Institution, which was agreed to by yeas 40, nays 9. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend so as not to in-
          crease the compensation of any officer, and 100 copies of the bill be printed. He defied
          any Senator to vote on that bill intelligently unless printed and laid before him. The
          people are not prepared to nearly double the salaries of some of these officers, as is
          proposed by some of the pro visions in the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS appealed to Senators to consider this subject above party. He believed one of
          the purposes of the bill was to take the question of the government of the Benevolent
          institutions out of party. They ought to be made the honor and glory of Indiana; and
          therefore he favored the general principle of this bill, but desired time to consider its
          many new features.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.195 in BLR-->
        <p> Mr. MENZIES pemanded the previous question, which was seconded by yeas 29, nays 25, and
          under its operation the motion to recommit was rejected by yeas 25, nays 26--the
          LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR giving the casting vote in each case. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend by allowing the family of the superintendent to board in the
          Institution, where he has his home therein; which was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to postpone till 9 o'clock Monday next the further
          consideration of this subject). He regarded such an important measure as worthy of
          discussion. It contains some very good features, and some very bad features--the letter
          should be amended. But we are asked to consider a bill of such great importance, and are
          compelled to sit here beyond the time for noon recess, in order that the bill may be
          passed without being printed, when nine-tenths of the majority, to say nothing of the
          minority, of the Senate, know very little about its provisions. He yielded the floor for
          that purpose, and--</p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT continued his remarks for some time. When he had concluded--</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. FOWLER thought discussion of the bill unnecessary for the Republican side, and was
            sure the Democrats had their minds made up, and seeing no reason for protracted
            discussion he demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and
            under its operation the motion to postpone the bill was rejected by-yeas 23, nays 25. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the bill was further amended by appropriately inserting a
            proviso that upon removal of an officer the officer may have opportunity to answer and
            defend the charges against him. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to adopt the bill as amended.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS made an ineffectual motion--yeas 26, nays 25--to lay this motion on the
            table.</p>
          <p> The bill as amended was then adopted--by yeas 25,nays 24--the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
            giving the casting vote in esdi instance.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. VIEHE, the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_399">[S. 399]</ref> to
            provide for the submission to the qualified voters of the State the proposed amendments
            to the constitution, was read the second time, with committee amendments. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought the bill needed no amendment, unless in regard to the time for
            elections, and in order to test the sense of the Senate he moved to amend the report by
            providing for submitting the amendments to vote in October, 1880, instead of April.</p>


          <p>Mr. VIEHE saw no difficulty in submitting the amendments in April, when, if adopted,
            they would dispense with October elections. The registry amendment is of no force and
            effect until after the Legislature can enact such a law. He hoped the report of the
            committee would be concurred in. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved ineffectually to amend by providing that if the third amendment to the
            constitution be adopted the fall elections shall occur in November instead of
            October.</p>
          <p> The committee amendments were concurred in.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> On motion by Mr HARRIS, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with--yeas 45,
            nays 3. The bill read the third time and passed by yeas 40, nays 7. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK, his bill, <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_069">[S. 69, see these
              reports Feb. 21,a.m.]</ref> to establish an asylum for feeble-minded children, was
            read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOODS objected to establishing at this time, above all others, a new institution of
            this kind. The people don't demand it. Then he declared this Legislature can
            not convert the Soldiery' Orphans' home into an institution of this
            kind, in proof or which statement he sent to the clerk's desk and had read the
            original deeds of these land to the State. Upon the score of expense it is wrong to
            build up a new institution until the State House is completed. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN: It is a needed charity to provide for a class of persons almost as
            helpless as the insane; and this unfortunate class should not be excluded from the
            benevolence of the State. In a few more years there will be no more soldiers'
            orphans left to be taken care of, and he hoped the construction placed upon the deeds by
            the senator from Lake [Mr. Woods] may be erroneous, so the property may be used for the
            purposes indicated in this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL thought no lawyer would contend but that a deed can be made to the trustees
            of the new institution by the present trustees who now hold it in trust for the State.
            But he opposed this bill as being a sucker that would draw from the State thousands of
            dollars at first, which sum would be rapidly increased with the lapse of time. It would
            be an unnecessary drain upon the tax payers of the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: Indiana is behind other States in this matter of providing for the
            education of this class of children. Why delay? The sum asked for is small. The people
            of this State are not as close-fisted as some senators would lead us to believe.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER could see nothing in the way of the transfer of the property. He favored
            this bill because it costs nothing. The orphan's home must be retired before
            many years, and this bill does not interfere with the two hundred children there. He
            would favor the bill even if it asked for an appropriation of $50,000. On the question
            of economy this measure should be passed. Out of 1,000 such children in the State at
            least one-half are in the poor houses. They should be educated so they can earn their
            own livelihood and something more. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON insisted this measure is not well understood. It proposes to establish an
            institution--asking how for an appropriation, of $2,000, but could there be any
            assurance that more than ten times that amount will not be called for in two years
            hence, and every two years thereafter in the same proportion? </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD was not willing to turn the sol-[diers] <pb n="196" xml:id="VAA8558-17-198"/>
            [sol]-diers' orphans out into the cold to left in a lot of half-witted idiots.
            [Laughter.] The deed of this property is not made to the State; and if the conditions of
            these instruments are violated a writ of ejectment would lie. He opposed the involving
            of the State or these institutions in an almost interminable law suit. Then such an
            institution would cost the State not less than $50,000 in 10 years.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE combatted the idea that any difficulty would occur in the transfer of the
            property referred to. The property is absolutely vested in the State, with no trust
            attached. He would favor the bill, but would like to see it amended in several
            particulars. It would be a measure of economy and reduce taxation generally, instead of
            increasing it. At any rate the State can afford to make the experiment.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL regarded this as a useless institution, and one that ought not to be
            fastened upon the people of the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK combatted the opinions expressed by some that this would be a costly
            institution. In other States they have done a vast amount of good. The Ohio Institute,
            which now contains 450 inmates, started with 15. No benevolent institutions ever
            established have done as much good as those of this kind. It is not intended to turn out
            the soldiers' and seamen's orphans by this bill. They are becoming
            less in number every year, and in a short time there will be few, if any, left; and this
            institution is intended to step in and take the place of the other.</p>

        <p> The clerk's minutes of Monday's proceedings were read until the
          reading was dispensed with; as was also the reading of the journal of yesterday's
          proceedings. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD, from a majority of the committee on State House investigation, reported that
          they find all changes made were in the interest of the Suite; the books of the State House
          commissioners well kept and in good order, and credit the board with having fully
          discharged their duty. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD submitted a minority report: that the evidence does not show fraud, but shows
          some changes in the original plans. and that the action of the board was unfair toward
          competing architects. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart moved that these reports be referred to the <orgName>committee on
            ways and means.</orgName>
        </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said there was nothing to do with these reports but to refer them to the
          committee on ways and means as suggested, or spread them upon the journal, as there was no
          recommendation in either the majority or minority reports. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD thought it was due the gentlemen of the State House commission, after having
          passed through the ordeal of an investigation, that some expression of the House should
          indicate their commendation to the State as faithful servants of the people. </p>

        <p> The committee was then discharged. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the House
          refused to allow the auditor of state a salary of $4,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said: If we had started out right in fixing the salary of the Governor at
          $4,000 the salary of the Auditor of State should not be increased. He was opposed to
          reconsidering. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS thought the Auditor's salary was too small, and he hoped the House
          would reconsider the vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said it was not honorable to the State to place the Auditor's salary
          at less than $4,O00. His labors will be much greater now during the building of the new
          State House. He favored the motion to reconsider. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, was willing to stand upon the redaction of salaries as low as
          consistent. The Auditor stands at the door of the treasury, and therefore occupies a most
          responsible position. In his judgment $4,000 was enough.</p>
        <p> Mr. VANPELT came here to reduce the salaries as low as possible. It was expected of
          these officers to furnish money for the expenses of the political campaign, and he was not
          in favor now of cutting down their salaries. He believed this bill was a fair bill all the
          way through.</p>
        <p> Mr. JOHNSON said the reason that the people wanted the salaries reduced was to prevent
          corruption. The demand for the reduction of salaries should be in proportion to the
          business of the country. He thought $4,000 was too much.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHANKS said the prices of commodities had gone down to the lowest level and the
          salaries of officers still stood at the highest point, and the people demand that their
          salaries shall be reduced to a corresponding level. He hoped this item would be left as
          passed upon yesterday. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY thought the friends of this bill ought not to insist on too much of a
          reduction. If we cut down these salaries with judgment, we shall be able to pass this
          bill, but if we run into parsimony, we will defeat it. He thought we ought to give the
          auditor of state at least $1,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS said the salary was fixed yesterday at $2,500. The question before the House
          is: Are the services of the auditor worth $4,O00 per annum? If it was this House ought to
          allow it. and if not, the salary ought to be placed at what the services of the office are
          worth. He was opposed to a reconsideration. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

        <p> The motion to reconsider was agreed to by--yeas 48, nays 47. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved that the salary of the auditor of State be $4,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH said: Let us reduce the salaries to a reasonable compensation--$4,000 was
          unreasonable : $3,000 was enough. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT came here pledged to the reduction of fees and salaries, and $4,000 was more
          than any man in the State was worth; $3,000 was ample compensation, and the action
          yesterday was about right. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said the National party, as well as the Democratic party, were pledged to a
          reduction of salaries. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, said so far as the <pb n="197" xml:id="VAA8558-17-199"/> pledges
          of Democrats were concerned, in his case he was not pledged to a reduction below what was
          commensurate with the position the officials were called to fill. He was opposed to
          salaries, and in favor of fees. </p>
        <p>The amendment [Mr. Gordon's] was rejected by yeas 36, nays 58.</p>
        <p> Mr. WORKS moved to amend by striking out $1,500 and inserting S2,500 in lieu, and adding
          that all fees shall be paid into the State treasury. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. GORDON the amendment was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS moved to reconsider the vote by which his amendment was laid on the table. </p>

        <p>Mr. JOHNSON moved, ineffectually, to amend by striking out $2,000 and inserting $1,500,
          and by striking out for the deputy $1,500 and inserting $1,200. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON moved to amend by making the salary of the attorney general $2,000 instead of
          $2,500, which was adopted by--yeas 49, nays 45.</p>
        <p> Mr. BARKER moved, ineffectually, to amend by allowing the attorney general a deputy with

        <p>Mr. COPELAND moved to amend so as to strike out all that provides for an assistant State
          librarian. He said the statutes plainly says that the librarian shall not have an
          assistant. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER said so far as the law is concerned, we are making a new law, and said the
          only question before the House was, shall the librarian have an assistant? </p>
        <p>The amendment [Mr. Copeland's] was rejected.</p>

            period. </p>
          <p>Mr. 0SBORNE of Elkhart moved a substitute for section 14 concerning fees of county
            clerks. He said the bill would increase the present fees of the clerks at least 50 per
            cent. over the law of 1875, and proceeded to prove that assertion by comparing the law
            of 1875 with the bill and with his proposed amendment.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. HEROD made an ineffectual motion that the amendment lie on the table--yeas 25,
            nays 68. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said it was a question whether when you cut out constructive fees the
            present law is not low enough. He did not want to act parsimoniously in this matter. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT said he came here in the interest of the people, and as a demand was made for
            a reduction in fees and salaries he would go as far as any one to obtain that object. He
            did not want to reduce the fees and salaries below a just standard. He felt as though
            there was an unlawful attempt to defeat the object of a reduction of fees, and believed
            county officers had raised a large fund to accomplish that object; at least he knew that
            assessments had been made upon the officers of some of the counties of this State for
            money to be used in preventing any reduction of fees and salaries, and he thought this
            fact ought to be kept in mind during the consideration of this bill, and he referred to
            the matter now in the outset that members might be reminded of the influence at work to
            prevent a free and untrammeled action, and for his part he had promised his constituents
            last fall to labor unceasingly to reduce the enormous and unjust fees of county
            officers, by which they are enabled in many cases to amass a fortune in one or two terms
            of office, and he proposes to fulfill his pledges. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON moved the adoption of the substitute for section 14, as submitted, by Mr.
            Osborne.</p>
          <p> Mr. HESS was in favor of the amendment, as it was in the right direction, and he

          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, moved as an amendment to section 15, a substitute, which. was
            also adopted. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD section 10 was amended by adding thereto the words,
            "When such estate is claimed by the widow."</p>
          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, moved to amend section 18 by providing that "Circuit
            judges shall each receive a salary of $2,000 per annum and no more." </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, made an ineffectual motion to amend the amendment by making the
            salary of circuit judges $1,800. </p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER made an ineffectual motion to add that the judges of the supreme court
            shall receive a salary of $3,000. </p>

          <p> Mr. WATSON moved to amend by providing that this section shall not apply to any judge
            who has been elected and commissioned.</p>
          <p> Mr. REED thought the amendment reducing the salaries of judges should not apply to
            such as have been elected and commissioned, but have not yet qualified and entered upon
            the discharge of their official duties. Of these there are only five. All others who
            were elected last October have qualified and are exempted from the operation of any law
            that may be enacted, by the constitutional provision which does not permit a decrease of
            their salary during their continuance in office. If the bill as amended shall become a
            law, there will be in the State 38 circuit judges on a salary of $2,500 each, and five
            on a salary of $2,000. It is an unjust discrimination to secure a paltry saving. </p>

          <p>Mr. SHANKS made an ineffectual motion to amend the amendment by making it $125 for each

        <p> Mr. HARRIS raised a constitutional objection to the wording of the bill--its execution
          being dependent upon a condition. He moved its reference to the <orgName>Judiciary
            Committee</orgName> with Instructions to report to-morrow morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE replied to this objection; consenting to the reference.</p>
        <p> The motion to refer was agreed to.</p>
        <p> The wet land drainage bill [S.17--Mr. Kent's as fully described in these
          reports of February 10. a. m. and 20, p. m.] was read the third time.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE on a former occasion sought to point out serious objections to this bill.
          While he was absent on a mournful duty the bill was passed to the third reading. The
          provisions of the bill are so unprecedently vicious in character, he desired in a brief
          manner to call attention to the fact that this class of legislation is in the direction of
          transferring to individuals the right of eminent domain. This bill in an absolute and
          overwhelming degree would transfer to an irresponsible individual rights over eminent
          domain that no Czar or Emperor dare exercise. It would give to an irresponsible man
          absolute control over anybody's land at any time of the year, make his own
          expenses as he pleases, and lie shall be reimbursed. In full, his assessments being a
          perpetual lien on the lands till paid; the ditch may cost five times what the land is
          worth, and the land is to be sold if the assessments are not paid in 10 days. He is
          legislator, judge and sheriff"; he declares the law, he expounds it and he
          executes; so there is nothing to appeal' from, and there is no provision made to
          contest these proceedings. The bill provides for 12 feet fall to the mile. This bill is
          got up for Clinton county and the counties adjoining. To transfer a power, the State can
          not and does not exercise, to an irresponsible individual, is something too preposterous
          to be seriously considered. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT insisted the senator from Marshall had certainly misunderstood the bill. The 12
          foot fall is not made obligatory-the fail can not be made to exceed 12 feet per mile.
          Every State in the Union has drainage laws, and almost ever since the organization of the
          State there have been drainage laws on our statute books, under which vast tracts of
          marshy land formerly worthless, have been made useful; and many thousand acres are yet
          remaining in need of some such measure as this. This bill may not be perfect, but, as the
          senator himself has said, it is 100 per cent batter than any former law on this subject.
          The senator says this bill gives to an individual the exercise of the right of eminent
          domain, which Mr. K. denied. Laws of this kind exist in all the States, and no supreme
          court has decided against them. This is a good bill and it ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under
          its operation the bill passed the Senate by--yeas 40, nays 5. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON explaining: He was not satisfied with the bill, and had much doubt as to its
          constitutionality, but believing it much better than any law on the statute books, would
          vote "aye." </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOSTER, his bill [S. 103] to authorize cities to construct water works,
          was taken up, with a majority report recommending sundry amendments, and a minority report
          restricting the issue of bonds by cities or towns whose indebtedness exceeds 4 per cent.
          on amount of taxables, etc., otherwise concurring with the majority. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON moved the adoption of the minority report, giving reasons therefor. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER said if the minority report be adopted Fort Wayne would be cut off from the
          provisions of this bill. He appealed to the Senate for a fair show in this matter, hoping
            <pb n="200" xml:id="VAA8558-17-202"/> the bill would pass after concurrence in the
          majority report </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES objected to allowing a town to be burdened with a debt of $4 on the $100 to
          increase its indebtedness, and, therefore, favored the minority report. Such a provision
          as is contemplated in the majority report would bring commercial paralysis and subsequent
          death to any community. He saw no limit to the bonds authorized to be issued by this bill,
          which comes here in the specious guise of general legislation, but is in reality a measure
          specially desired by the city of Fort Wayne. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: Even if Fort Wayne has an indebtedness of four and a half per cent., her
          citizens should still be the judges as to whether any more tax shall be levied or not. He
          favored the bill if it sufficiently guards the owners of artificial works. Unless this
          bill is passed, no city can thereafter construct water-works, if the constitutional
          amendment should be ratified by the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD counselled caution in the matter of authorizing cities and towns to issue bonds,
          so many such corporations being now largely in debt. Conferring such great power on
          trustees and common councils is very dangerous proceedings. Such power should be
          curtailed; restrict the indebtedness, let the tax-payer be heard and he would favor the
          bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM moved to amend the minority report by striking out "4"
          and inserting "2" per cent. in lieu. He believed no town should be
          allowed to create an indebtedness above two per cent of its taxables.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The amendment was rejected by yeas 13, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER again appealed to senators to favor Ins city of Fort Wayne by voting against
          the minority report. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. REEVE moved to strike from the minority report so much as refers to four per cent.,
          which, under the operations of the previous question demanded by Mr. FOSTER was agreed
          to--yeas 24, nays 21.</p>
        <p> The minority report as amended was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend by a provision protecting artificial water works from
          condemnation without consent of the owner. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. DICE moved an amendment requiring the affirmative vote of a majority before the
            water works shall be commenced. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved a substitute for this amendment, requiring a petition of three-fifths
            in value of taxable property. He said it is not right to allow a floating voter, who
            contributes nothing, to impose taxes upon free-holders. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON hoped no senator would vote to accommodate one city, when by that vote many
            others may be ruined. He favored the substitute.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOSTER, opposed the substitute, but was willing to adopt the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE opposed the substitute for his amendment, believing it would disfranchise a
            large number of voters, and believing it also impracticable.</p>
          <p> The substitute was rejected upon a division--yeas 17, nays 23. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to add to the section the words: "under the provisions
            of the present law regulating the sale of bonds," etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER opposed the amendment. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIER made an ineffectual motion to amend by striking from the bill the words
            "incorporated towns." </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN secs. 10,14 and 15 were amended by inserting a proviso
            that contracts shall be ratified by the Council. The bill as amended was passed the
            second reading by--yeas 37, nays 10.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE explaining: Insomuch as this bill provides that persons who are unable to
            pay anything shall be permitted to vote to tax owners of property, he should vote
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT explaining: Believing there is great danger in allowing corporations to go
            in debt, but believing there may be an exception made in cases of water works. On this
            bill he should vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON explaining: Having done what he could to amend the bill, it still lacking
            in guards about trustees of cities and towns, he should have to vote
            "no." </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOSTER, the constitutional rule was dispensed with by--yeas 42, nays
            4--the bill considered engrossed, read the third time, and passed the Senate by--yeas
            32, nays 11. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, the bill<ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_007"> [H. R. 7, see these
              reports February 25, p. m.]</ref>regulating the working of coal mines, was read the
            third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT hoped due consideration will be given to this bill, and desired that
            senators should be careful in putting such great power, as is proposed in this bill, in
            the hands of such gangs as have recently enacted scenes as the State should never see
            again. It is not safe to place the coal mining interests of the State in the control of
            this class of men. Experience in Pennsylvania shows that element should be controlled
            and not placed in a position to control. Their murderous course has placed them in
            antagonism to all law. But who is asking for this kind of enactments? Not the producers
            of coal or the proprietors of coal mines, but the miners themselves. If proper machinery
            is not used, the owners should be compelled to procure proper machinery and to keep
            their mines properly ventilated. If the friends of the miner want legislation for their
            protection inside of the mines, there should also be laws made to protect the miner
            outside of the mine, and the operators' property should be protected. This bill
            is a one-sided affair, not calculated to reach proper ends; it represents the element
            that not only destroyed property in Clay county, but murdered men there; and neglects to
            do any tiling for anybody else. He regarded this as the worst and most dangerous bill
            ever presented to the General Assembly. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT disagreed with the senator [Mr. Streight] about the construction of the
            section of the bill referring to the inspection of the mines. The design of the bill is
            humanitarian--it is intended to protect the workmen who delve in the bowels of the
            earth. In some of the mining States there are statutes more stringent than this. These
            men look to the strong arm of the law for protection, and they ought not to be permitted
            to look in vain. If the owner can not afford ventilation and outlets sufficient for the
            safety of his hands, he ought not to work his mine. As such legislation is necessary in
            al1 mining States, in behalf of thousands of men in this State engaged in mining, he
            desired to see protection extended to them. He favored the bill, and should vote for it,
            unless receiving more light than is now in his possession from its opponents. Men in
            illy ventilated shafts work in partial torture, and as a question of health and life he
            favored this measure. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE repealed his assertion made the other day, that no such inconsistent measure
            could be found in any similar act on the stat-[ute] <pb n="201" xml:id="VAA8558-17-203"/>[stat]-ute books of other States, and he referred to provisions in this bill which
            come under the head of class legislation, and consequently are unconstitutional. He
            believed a few rich men had drafted the bill for the purpose of crushing out all the
            other mines of the State, controlling the mining interests of the State, and raising the
            price of coal. This is not a bill in the interest of miners. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT would favor a bill for the proper ventilating of coal mines, but for this
            measure he could not vote. It places coal miners probably a member of a communistic
            order in charge of the entire mining interests of the State, embracing, possibly, a
            valuation of $50,000,000. He opposed placing this vast interest in the hands of men in
            league with the miners themselves. There are provisions in this bill unjust and
            improper. The bill goes far beyond any other mining laws in other States. He believed it
            will do the miners but little good, and that it would increase the price of coal 25 per
            cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD. It is asserted that this is a bill in the interest of the Molly Maguires, but
            no argument is advanced to prove that statement. If this bill makes the business or
            mining more safe it will make coal cheaper. Why do all mining States have bills of this
            kind? Simply to protect the miners. As he understood the bill it was intended, also, to
            keep the laborer from being swindled. This bill is not a perfect one, out as its great
            purpose is to protect mines and the miners, he was willing to forego small objections
            and support the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON regarded the bill, in its general scope and purpose, as worthy of acceptance
            as it stands. It throws around the miner the safety and protection it should, without
            imposing greater burdens than it ought to upon the owner of the mines. He defied
            senators to point out a single feature, word or syllable in this bill that will break up
            the mining interest in the bill, as has been charged. He favored doing what is right
            and. just and proper as between the miner and the operator, and declared it to be the
            duty of this Legislature, in view of recent disasters in the mines, to pass some act to
            protect the interest of the miners. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER conceded this to be a very important bill, affecting as it does the lives of
            thousands of miners, and property of the value of probably $50,000,000 or more. He
            combatted the statements that this bill was in the interests of communists;he would
            object to anything of that kind most seriously. The operators have moved heaven and
            earth to defeat this bill in this body every time it has passed the other House; and
            bills similar to this have passed the other House four times in the past few years. It
            is worse than pettifogging to talk about a good mining law raising the price of coal.
            Provisions are put in this bill to protect small mines. It does not operate on any mine
            from which less than 15,000 square yards of coal are mined. Had this bill become a law
            two years ago the eight lives recently lost in the Sullivan county mines would have been
            saved.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEILMAN denied the charge of being on the side of capital as agaist labor; on the
            contrary, he insisted that he was on the side of the workingman, being himself a worker
            as many hours in the day as any other man in the State. Landing in this State without a
            dollar, what he owns he made as a business man. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question, demanded by Mr. VIEHE, the bill was
            passed by--yeas 28, nays 14.</p>
          <p> Pending the roll call-- </p>
          <p>Mr. HART, explaining: This bill is not just the bill he desired, but as the best thing
            that could be got, he should vote "aye.' </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT, explaining: He would be glad to vote for a fair mining bill, but inasmuch as
            opportunity for amendments were cut off, he could not vote for this one.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE, explaining: By a fair understanding this bill was not to be considered as
            read the second time when last before the Senate, and inasmuch as amendments were cut
            off by win at he considered a trick, he should vote "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK explaining: Was not exactly suited with this bill, and would like to see
            amendments made to it; but inasmuch as it is the best thing that can be got, he would
            vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT explaining: Was unable to vote for this bill, as it contains no provision
            for the appointment of impartial and intelligent inspectors. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR explaining: Did not wish to be understood as against a proper mining bill,
            but there are some provisions in this one so adverse to good judgment that he could not
            vote for it. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT stated he was paired with the senator from Elkhart [Mr. Davenport] on this
            question. </p>
          <p>And so the bill passed. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS, from the special committee appointed to investigate the
            Soldiers'Orphans' Home at Knightstown, submitted an extended report
            concluding with a resolution instructing the attorney-general to take such steps in
            regard to recovering back to the State the extra per diem paid said trustees (George
            Sanford, of Crown Point, $222. Ellison Williams, of Knightstown,$222, and William
            Hannaman, of Indianapolis, $444) as in his opinion is just. </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. WOOLLEN, the report was made the special order for the morning hour
            to-morrow. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

              <p>Whereas, the statute authorizing the auditor of State to collect certain fees from
                foreign insurance companies, allows him to retain for his services 25 percent,

        <p>The amendment was then adopted by--yeas 73, nays 18. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON moved ineffectually--yeas 42, nays 50--for a reconsideration for the vote by
          which the House refused to allow the attorney general a clerk at $1,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to amend the bill by adding that township trustees shall not
          hereafter levy the tax heretofore known as "township tax," and that they
          shall be paid for all their services out of the county treasury, upon itemized and sworn
          statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS moved to amend so that the trustee shall be paid out of his own township
          fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER moved ineffectually to lay both amendments on the table--yeas 34, nays 47. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said he did not think the amendment to the amendment ought to be adopted,
          because he did not see any practical way to carry out its provisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY thought the amendment to the amendment should prevail. He did not think they
          county townships ought to be taxed for city trustee expenses. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question on the pending amendments and engrossment of
          the bills, which demand was sustained by--yeas 61, nays 28. </p>
        <p>The amendment to the amendment was rejected, to amendment adopted and the bill was
          ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS, chairman of the <orgName>committee on rights and privileges</orgName>,
          returned the following described bill with favorable reports thereon, which reports were
          severally concurred in and the bills ordered engrossed, unless otherwise stated: The bill
          H. R. 318,333,259,263,363,417,562,577,598,619,625,616; Senate bills 184,9,136,443,180,338.
          The bills H. R., 311,329,237,275,384, and 628 were indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WIMMER said he hoped that the adverse report of the committee would not be concurred
          in on the bill H. R. 373, concerning trespassing animals, and on his motion the report was
          laid on the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SCHWEITZER said: This bill H. R., 576, allows notaries public the right to perform
          the marriage ceremony, and on his motion the report was laid on the table, and the bill
          ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS said: that in the early part of the session he had introduced a bill on the
          same subject, with the bills S. 9 and 136, by request, but he was opposed to any such
          measure unless the unclaimed rich, as well as the unclaimed poor bodies were subject to
          the provisions of this bill, and would vote against them on their passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. VAN VALZEH, chairman of the <orgName>committee on railroads</orgName>, returned the
          bill [H. R. 379] to prevent railroad accidents, recommending its passage, which was
          concurred in. Also the bill [H. R. 572] to license steam engineers, recommending that it
          lie on the table.</p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER thought the report of the committee ought not to be concurred in, and in view
          of the destruction of life consequent upon engines being run by incompetent persons, this
          Legislatures ought to do something in this direction. On his motion the report was laid on
          the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER, chairman of the <orgName>committee on county and township business</orgName>,
          returned the bills H. R. 154,499,338,342,357,368,430,489,487, and 37, with favorable
          reports thereon. He also returned the bills H. R. 21, 63,
          209,262,267,325,330,374,438,503,516,522,479,469, and 451, recommending indefinite
          postponement.</p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. CONNER the report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 21] to abolish
          the office of county assessor was laid on the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. JOHNSON the report of the committee on the bill [H. R. 209] was laid
          on the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS said he hoped the report of the committee on the bill H. R. 262 would not be
          concurred in. On his motion the report was laid on the table and the bill ordered
          engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH hoped the House would not concur in the adverse report of the committee on the
          bill [H. R. 325] regulating repairing and the erection of bridges. On his motion the
          report was laid on the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. DALTON introduced a bill [H. R. 637] for aid in the construction of the new State
          House. Appropriating $1,000,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, introduced a bill, [H. R. 638] to regulate the proceedings of the
          State House Commissioners.</p>
        <p>The constitutional rule was suspended, the bill severally read the second time by title
          only and referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> together with the
          bill [H. R. 633] to provide means for the erection of the new State House.</p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY opposed concurrence in the report of the committee on the bill H. R. 469. On
          this motion the report was laid on the table and the bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handy, from the <orgName>committee on claims</orgName>, returned the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_312">[H. R. 312]</ref> to authorize a seal for the Adjutant
          General, etc., with a recommendation that it do pass. The report was concurred in and the
          bill ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p>The House took a recess until 2 o'clock.</p>



        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREY presented the credentials of O. E. FLEMING, representative from the county
            of Allen.</p>
          <p>Mr. FLEMING received the oath of office at <pb n="203" xml:id="VAA8558-17-205"/>the
            hands of the speaker, and took his seat as a member of the Fifty-first General Assembly. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAVIDSON, chairman of the committee on agriculture, returned the following bills
            with favorable recommendations thereon: H. R. 605, 488, 530, and Senate bill 303.</p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON, from the same committee, returned the bill H. R. 531, recommending
            passage.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS, from the <orgName>committee on benevolent institutions</orgName>, returned
            the bills, H. R. 101, 246, recommending passage.</p>
          <p>These reports were concurred in and the bills severally ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. SCHOLL, from the same committee, returned the bill [H. R. 100], to allow insane
            persons to send letters by mail, recommending indefinite postponement. He said the
            committee saw no reason why such a bill should become a law. He thought it would have
            many very bad effects. It was the unanimous opinion of the committee that this bill
            should not become a law. In cases of monomaniacs, when it is necessary that the patient
            should be cut off entirely from the matters which disturb his mind, how are you going to
            effect a cure when the outsiders can continue to irritate the mind of the patient, with
            no power to prevent it? A man wandering in delirium needs to be guarded as little child.
            The Insane Hospital is one of the most important institutions of our State. The
            superintendent, if he is qualified, should have absolute and complete control of his
            patients. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON said he knew the tenacity of doctors to hold on to power. Men and women who
            are in the way of some one's business, may be a mere sham trial, be hustled
            away and confined in the Insane Asylum without a fair trial. He said it was no more than
            fair to allow them to write their letters and put them in the letter box without
            interruption. He moved to lay the report upon the table, which was agreed to, and the
            bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER, chairman of the <orgName>committee on temperance</orgName>, returned the
            bill, H. R. 144, with a majority report thereon, recommending that it lie on the
            table.</p>
          <p>Mr. ARNOLD, of Blackford, submitted a minority report on the bill with amendments, and
            when so amended recommending passage.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The minority report, was, under the operation of the previous question, rejected--yeas
            43, nays 53.</p>
          <p>The majority report was then concurred in.</p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER returned the bill [H. R. 315] regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors,
            with a recommendation that the bill lie on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD submitted a minority report with amendments, and, when so amended,
            recommended its passage.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS moved to lay the minority report on the table, which was rejected by yeas
            45, nays 46. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT said the temperance question was no hobby of his. He hoped, in the
            consideration of this bill, there would be no party lines drawn. He had been in receipt
            of letters daily, asking whether the members of this Legislature dared to come to the
            rescue of the people, and pass such a law as they stand in need of. This bill allows a
            majority of the citizens in any township to say whether they will license the sale of
            intoxicating liquors within their midst. </p>
          <p>Under the operation of the previous question the House rejected the report of the
            minority by--yeas 46, nays 48. </p>
          <p>Pending the call--</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess, explaining, said as a matter of principle he was opposed to all
            sumptuary laws, and that no law can be sustained unless it meets the approbation of the
            people. Whenever we pass a sumptuary law the people will evade it. He would yield to no
            gentleman in his advocacy of temperance in the family an in the social relations of
            life, but because this was a sumptuary law he voted "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER, explaining, said that he took pleasure in giving this public expression to
            his sentiments. He voted "aye."</p>
          <p>The report of the majority of the committee was then concurred in, and the bill was
            laid on the table.</p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 359] from the same committee recommending its passage. The report was
            concurred in.</p>
          <p>Also the bill H. R. 415, from the same committee with a recommendation that the bill
            lie upon the table.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. MITCHELL the report of the committee was laid upon the
            table--affirmative 42, negative 39.</p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH had hoped that this House would have passed a local option law, but as they
            had refused to do it, he now hoped as this law was better than the one we are now
            operating under, we may have this law.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS said he was glad to notice that the word "quart" was not
            in this bill. Heretofore, any one could sell a quart at a time, and he was glad to live
            to see the time when this objectionable quart was stricken out.</p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess, from the <orgName>committee on corporations</orgName>, returned
            the bills [S. 18 and H. R. 509 and 632] with favorable recommendations.</p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY, from the <orgName>committee on mileage and accounts</orgName>, returned the
            bill H. R. 599, with a reccommendation that the bill do pass. It was ordered
            engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. Humphreys, from the <orgName>committee on ways and means</orgName>, returned the
            bill H. R. 608, 407, and 369, reccommending passage. Also the bill H. R. 407 to repeal
            the tax on dogs, recommending passage.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. HESS moved to lay this report upon the table, which was agreed to by yeas 65, nays
            24, and on his motion the bill was indefinitely postponed.</p>
          <p>The <orgName>committee on federal relations</orgName> recommended the passage of the
            concurrent resolution on the subject of the black death. The report was concurred in and
            the resolution adopted.</p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH, chairman of the <orgName>committee on the affairs of the city of
              Indianapolis</orgName>, returned all bill, H. R. 565,564, with favorable reports
            thereon, which were ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, chairman of the <orgName>committee on cities and towns</orgName>,
            returned the bills, S. 80,140, with recommendations for passage.</p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, returned the bill S. 139 without any report thereon.</p>
          <p>Mr. STUCKER, chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned the bills
            H. R. 207, 257, 597, 540, 561, 604, with favorable reports. </p>
          <p>Mr. KESTER moved to lay on the table the report on the bill H. R. 265, which was agreed
            on, and the bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>The bill H. R. 554, adversely reported on, was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>Mr. HUTHSEINER, chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Insurance</orgName>, returned the
            bill H. R. 380, with a favorable report thereon. </p>

          <pb n="204" xml:id="VAA8558-17-206"/>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY, from the <orgName>Committee on Drains and Dykes</orgName>, returned the
            bill H.R.471, with a favorable report. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. WILLARD, the report and bill were laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Also, the bill H. R. 284 and Senate bills 365 and 47, with favorable reports.</p>
          <p> Mr. CALDWELL, chairman of the <orgName>committee on apportionment</orgName>, returned
            the bill 486, with a favorable report. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH, from the same committee, returned the bill H. R. 143, recommending that it
            lie on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. DALTON, chairman of the <orgName>joint committee on public buildings</orgName>,
            submitted a report recommending a sufficient appropriation to make repairs needed. It
            was referred to the <orgName>committee on ways and means</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS, chairman of the <orgName>committee on sanitary affairs</orgName>, returned
            the bill H. R. 324, with a favorable report. </p>

        <p> Prayer by Rev. URBAN C. BREWER. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS the reading of the minutes was dispensed, with and the House
          amendments to his prisoner's work bill [S. 68] were read and concurred in. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DICE the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on the
          third reading.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The non-resident garnishee bill [S. 56--Mr. Kahlo's, fully described in these
          reports February 24, a. m.] was read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays
          1. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill [S. 57--Mr. Harris'] authorizing county commissioners to erect
          workhouses, was read the third time, and passed by yeas 47, nays 1.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill [S. 61--Mr. Coffey's--see these reports February 24, p. m.] concerning
          deputy sheriffs, was read the third time, and passed by yeas 43, nays 3. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE explaining his negative vote by declaring this bill would increase the number
          of bailiff's, which in almost every court are now too numerous.</p>
        <p> The bill [S. 94--Mr. Wood's] limiting the height of hedge fences to six feet
          was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. STKEIGHT regarded it as very detrimental to compel the cutting down of hedges in some
          cases, especially on the west side of fields in exposed places and on the prairies. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD explained the shade from these high hedges kept the roads in bad condition by
          excluding the sun's rays, and that these high fences obstructed the view of the
          country. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER favored the bill regarding it an imposition on the people to allow hedges to
          grow higher than six feet.</p>
        <p> The bill failed by yeas 20, nays 23. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 122--Mr. Shaffer's] to provide for repairs on free turnpike roads
          was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER explained that the important provisions of this bill embrace regulations for
          the repair of free gravel roads, and unless some such measures are passed thousands of
          dollars expended on such roads by the tax payers residing thereon will be lost.</p>
        <p> The bill passed by yeas 33, nays 10.</p>
        <p> The bill [S. 21--Mr. Davenport's] for the establishment of courts in cities of
          6,000 inhabitants, was read the second time and ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p> The bill [S. 169--Mr. Hart's] prohibiting the secreting, etc., of mortgaged
          goods was read the third time and passed by yeas 38, nays 4. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 175--Mr. Sarnighausen's--see these reports Feb. 21, p. m.] for the
          appointment of county superintendents of schools by the township trustees was read the
          third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN declared this bill would make the office more efficient, and that some
          senators who were opposed to it on the second reading were now in favor of its beneficent
          provisions.</p>
        <p> Mr. BENZ was in favor of abolishing the office of county school superintendent
          altogether; the State got along well enough under the old law, which was a very good one,
          and therefore he opposed this bill. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 33, nays 7. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill [S. 176--Mr. Traylor's] to legalize the acts of the trustees of the
          town of Jasper was read the third time and passed by yeas 36, nays 1. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill [S. 258--Mr. Sarnighausen's] to legalize the acts of local authorities
          in annexing certain territory to Fort Wayne was read the third time and passed by yeas 36,
          nays 2. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill [S. 271--Mr. Comstock's; see these reports of February 22, a. m.] to
          enlarge the jurisdiction or mayors of cities and justices of the peace, was read the third
          time. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK explained the bill was to economize the time of criminal and circuit courts
          by doing away with the necessity of a trial in said courts of causes which may be punished
          by imprisonment in the county jail. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT opposed the bill. It would be unsafe to place such power in the hands of
          justices of the peace. The jury has the benefit of argument by learned counsel, and also
          instructions of the court, thus educating their minds so as properly to apply the law to
          the facts. Among a liberty-loving people we can not <pb n="206" xml:id="VAA8558-17-208"/>
          allow the rights of a citizen to be jeopardized by authorizing such trials before justices
          of the peace. Even for the purposes of economy no such measure should be tolerated for a
          moment. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE also opposed the bill, Mr. TRAYLOR believed it only a measure to allow justices
          of the peace to fill our jails with poor men.</p>
        <p> Mr. KRAMER thought it a good bill and a measure of economy. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS regarded this bill as against the interests of reform and economy. It would
          create a greater expense than under the present practice. It is not right to talk about
          economy when liberty is at stake. The bill is so unjust it ought not to receive any where
          near a majority of votes favorable to its passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK: Senators have not carefully considered this bill, or they have forgotten
          some of the principles of the law. The purpose of the bill is not to deprive any one of a
          fair and impartial trial, either by the justice, or by a jury. As a matter of dollars and
          cents, this bill was not urged; that would be too trivial an argument where liberty of the
          person is involved. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS believed the bill wrong in principle. No felony is, or can be trivial. This
          crime is an important one, and one involving as many principles of law as the higher
          offences. This bill proposed to place such cases before a court in 99 cases out of 100
          utterly in- c6mpetent, and having no ability to comprehend the case in its proper
          bearings. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER at first favored this bill, but after examination he could not vote for it
          while containing the provision allowing justices jurisdiction over felony cases. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR was well satisfied this bill would prove a denial of justice to many parties
          charged with crime.</p>

        <p> Mr. OLDS explained: The bill provides that appeals, when taken to the supreme court, in

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION, </head>
          <p>The bill [S. 196--Mr. Streight's--see these reports, Feb. 21, p. m.]
            regulating tolls on roads located on beds ceded by the United States to this State, was
            read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT gave a history of the building of the roads affected by his bill: They
            were originally constructed in every particular by the general Government and ceded to
            this State; costing the present owners but a very small sum, and they should be
            compelled to desist from bleeding the people as shamefully as they do, by the
            restrictions in this bill which allows them 10 per cent. profit on their vestments, over
            and above the necessary repairs and cost of collecting toll. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: This bill seems to apply to one road and to no other. It allows pay for
            expenses, but does not allow anything for services of the owner or for the capital
            invested. He could not see where any advantage would accrue by the crippling of a little
            undertaking of this kind, nor why there should be $400 an hour spent to consider such a
            bill as this, when important legislation is awaiting action. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER thought this bill should not pass. Where war is made against such roads it
            is generally made by those living on them. He was satisfied this bill is intended for
            but one particular road, and insisted that such kind of legislation is radically wrong. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON could see no injustice in the provisions of this bill. He favored its
            passage.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER regarded this bill as impracticable, and a very doubtful piece of
            legislation. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE also objected to the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOOK gave reasons why he thought this bill ought not to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL characterized this bill as proposing a species of class legislation that
            would transcend the constitutional limit. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill passed by--yeas 28, nays 17. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 297--Mr. Hefron's] to abolish the office of State geologist was
            read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE: The State geologist has developed millions of dollars of property in this
            State that, but for this department, would be now unknown. It is about the only branch
            of the government that has been productive. By it wealth has been called here, and the
            attention of men of brains has been directed to the vast resources of the State. That
            which goes from the hands of the scientific department of the State receives respectful
            attention; where any other publication of the kind would be looked upon as a simple
            advertising venture. He trusted the State would save its credit by refusing to pass this
            bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: The development of our coal mines is largely due to the efforts of tho
            State geologist. Tile for floors had never been manufactured anywhere in the United
            States till it was commenced in this city, and this is due to the efforts of Prof. Cox;
            and we are not at the end of the investigations into the resources of the State. He
            opposed the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER did not question but that the State geological department has achieved much
            for this State, but in these times he thought it imprudent to keep up this expense. It
            does not pay in the present depressed state of business and considering the heavy burden
            of taxation now oppressing the people of this State, he should vote for the abolishment
            of this expensive department. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER thought this looked too much like legislating on a man's estate
            before his death. This office has not yet outlived its usefulness; and there is as much
            necessity for it in the 10 years to come as there has been in the 10 years past. He
            hoped this bill would not become a law. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON was not much in love with this bill, nor would he object to such a
            geological department as senators opposed to the bill have pictured. This office has not
            met public expectation in developing the agricultural interests of the State. The
            geological reconnoisance of his own county was notoriously imperfect. He felt disposed
            to consent to the abolishment, for the time being, of this department which is doing so
            little good at present, and therefore would support the bill under consideration, though
            much preferring to see the property belonging to this office transferred, to Purdue
            University, than to see it go in the direction indicated in this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT did not desire the abolishment of this department: It has been the means of
            bringing capital to the State, which has laid the foundation for her future prosperity.
            When attention is called to the existence of coal mines or stone quarries, or other
            under- <pb n="207" xml:id="VAA8558-17-209"/> lying wealth, just because the times are a
            little hard at the present, although immediate advantage may not be taken of such
            discoveries, it does not follow that in future it will not be productive of vast benefit
            to the State. He opposed the passage of the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON did not maintain that the geological department has not been of great
            benefit to the State, but contended that, aside from the survey, the benefits have not
            been so very large. We are in possession of that survey, made in l873-4 or 5; but there
            having been no reports made since then, of what benefit has the office been to the
            people? All the good that has been derived from this office has already been secured,
            and it is now but a useless expense. </p>

        <p> Mr. CONNOR, from the majority of the select committee thereon, returned the bill [H. R.
          22] to exempt property from execution, with amendments exempting $700 real estate and $300
          personalty.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam submitted a minority report, striking out all after the enacting
          clause and inserting new matter.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHANKS said under the proposition of the majority if a man held land he was exempt
          $1,000 if not only $300. </p>
        <p>Mr ALLEN, of Putnam, thought that every man should have an exemption of $1,000, giving
          the choice to elect as to whether it should all be in real estate or personal, or in both. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY said the object of the exemption was to attach men to the State, and incite
          them to make a permanent home. and it seemed to him one of the most laudable measures that
          could be passed. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON said: The idea of a homestead is a principle that should be engrafted in our
          laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN said: The minority report proposes to eliminate from the homestead bill its
          kernel: the idea that makes it commendable. Its purpose its to make permanent citizens.
          Lord Macauly predicted the policy of our Government would be a failure, and that the life
          of the nation would be menaced and finally taken by the floating population. Mr. O. had an
          abiding faith in the perpetuity of our institutions, but he believed that just as you
          multiply the little homes over our country, though they be humble ones, you multiply the
          safeguards of our Government. A homestead identifies the owner with the community and its
          interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said that men in the country and everywhere suppose that they are able to
          choose for themselves. They feel fully qualified to say whether they want their exemption
          in real or personal property. It would encourage men more to give them $1,000 and let them
          choose their own exemption then if you would exempt them $700 in realty and $300 in
          personalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH said the object was to protect the careless and heedless by making the
          exemption part in real and part in personal</p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY said there never has been such a demand for an exemption law in this State as
          now. He hoped that the majority report would be rejected, and the minority report
          concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE opposed a distinction between the man who holds real estate and the man who
          holds personalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, would vote for the bill if the means were provided by which we
          could reach the $1,000 homestead.</p>

        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, from the select committee thereon, returned the bill [H. R. 51] to
          abolish the office of county superintendent , with amendments.</p>
        <p>MR. OWEN submitted a minority report, with a recommendation to indefinitely postpone.</p>
        <p> Mr. STUCKER hoped the minority report would not be concurred in.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER thought we were not prepared now to abolish the office of county school
          superintendent. It is said that this office was expensive to the State. In 79 counties out
          of 92 it cost about $59,000. If you want to strike a blow at the entire school system
          abolish this office; but as for himself, he did not want to take such a backwards
          step.</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBOURNE of Elkhart, said while the bill as presented by the minority report, in
          terms abolishes the office of county superintendent, it does not do so in fact, but only
          changes its name to school examiner. The 5th section provides that wherever in the present
          law the words county superintendent was used, it shall be held and deemed to mean and
          refer to the school examiner. The bill only cuts off the unlimited power of the
          superintendent to visit schools and charge a per diem therefor. It places the right to
          visit the schools and charge therefor in the discretion of the county commissioners within
          a certain limit fixed in the bill, and this is the only material change in the present
          law. It limits the cost of the office, and is in the interest of economy, without, in his
          opinion effecting the efficiency of the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. MITCHELL did not know that he was <pb n="208" xml:id="VAA8558-17-210"/>in favor of
          either of the reports as a whole but there were points in the majority report which he
          favored.</p>
        <p> Mr. OWENS said since the establishment of the county school superintendent there had
          been rejected 6,600 applicants to teach. He wanted to try it for two years longer, and if
          then it did not pay he would be willing to abolish the office. </p>
        <p>Mr. HESS thought it was well enough to keep up the office of superintendent.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam said it would reduce the expenses at least $50,000.</p>

        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER, from the <orgName>committee on ways and means</orgName>, returned the
          State House appropriation bill [H. R. 637] with a favorable report.</p>
        <p> Mr. WILLARD submitted a minority report with amendments. He said that this bill even
          with amendments by the majority proposed to borrow $700,000 at 5 per cent. That this loan
          was to be paid in 1893. That the interest would amount to $100,000. This was to be taken
          out of the pockets of the people simply that contractors might buy their iron now while it
          was cheap. The measure was backed by the ring of politicians of Indianapolis who were
          interested in the rolling mill. There was now a surplus in the treasury of $600,O00. He
          was willing to appropriate $250,000 of this to the State House in each year and this with
          the 2 per cent. levy would make in the next two years $800,000. This would not satisfy the
          "ring" because it would not pay $350,000 for the iron. This bill was
          adding infamy to infamy. After the extra session called to pass the State House bill;
          after the bad faith with architects; after the unfair award, we are still to tax the
          people $400,000 more in order that contractors may buy their iron at a large profit. The
          proposition is simply infamous and that record will ruin any man voting for it. Mr.
          Willard continued in the same strain for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER: This is purely a financial proposition. The bill provided for an
          appropriation of $1,000,000 for the building of the State House during the years 1879 and
          1880, which the committee cut down to $700,000. The reports from the State treasury since
          October 31, 1877, show there has been an average cash balance of more than $500,000, and
          on February 25,1878, there was $633,000. Under our present tax levy and appropriations
          these cash balances will continue. Our appropriation will do little more than exhaust the
          large balance in the treasury, and we ought to be willing to set this balance afloat among
          the people in the erection of the State House. We also propose that the proceeds of the
          tax levies for 1878 and 1879 shall go into the State House fund. This will produce
          $150,000 in each of the years or $300,000 with $700,000 making $1,000,000. We provide also
          that the State officers shall be allowed to borrow money only when the cash balances in
          the treasury shad have been reduced below the sum of $100,000, and then only $100,000
          shall be borrowed, and this may be repeated only until the debt so created shall have
          reached the sum of $500,000, and no more.</p>
        <p> Thus it will be seen that while we provide ample means for the State House enterprise we
          grant but small opportunity for running the State in debt. The gist of the matter is that
          we apply the large balances now and hereafter to be in the treasury to the building of the
          State House. It is not likely that the State officers will be obliged to use, during the
          next two years, the full power to borrow that we grant in this bill limited as that power
          is; and if it should become necessary to use the full power, by reason of the exhaustion
          of the balances in the treasury, then such full power is exhausted when $500.000 are
          borrowed. The money so borrowed is to be represented by bonds bearing interest not to
          exceed five per cent., and redeemable at the pleasure of the State after five years. Thus
          we can provide the money for the building of the State House to the extent of $1,000,000
          for the years 1879-80, and at the same time we provide that the temporary debt of the
          State shall not be increased beyond the sum of $500,000. It is not likely the temporary
          debt will be increased near that amount, but we thought it unsafe to fix the limit at less
          than that. There is no question as to whether the judgment of the State House board has
          been in all things correct. It is our duty now to provide means for building the new State
          House. This we should do in such a way as to be just to the people, the contractors and
          the House board. </p>

        <p>Mr. GORDON: Every dollar's worth of that kind exempt from taxation increases the
          tax upon other property. On account of equality, he was opposed to it. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

          <p> Mr. THAYER: It is not the policy of this country to unite church and state. We ought
            to realize the fact that every fatherless child belongs to the State, and the influences
            of the church take them up and take them into Sunday-school and church, and make of them
            men and women. If that bill be passed he hoped it would be amended go as to apply to
            cities of 25,000 inhabitants. </p>
          <p>Mr. CONNER said he would tell the gentlemen who are clamoring for the taxation of
            church property, that this question was settled against that theory more than a century
            ago in this country, and hence every State in the Union has provided in their organic
            law that such property might be exempted, and every State had, by law, provided for such
            exemption. There are over $15,000,000 invested in church property in this State, and
            there is an annual expenditure of over $2,000,000. Church people tax themselves for
            public good, and to tax their property, which yields no revenue to them, would be an
            attempt to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. </p>

          <date> SATURDAY, March 1,1879--</date>
          <time>9 o'clock a. m. </time>
        </dateline>
        <p>The minutes were not read. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the special committee to
          investigate the affairs of the benevolent and reformatory institutions to employ a short
          hand reporter. In the afternoon, on motion by Mr. FOSTER, this was changed to a concurrent
          resolution and adopted.</p>
        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order--being the consideration of the
          bills [S. 84 and S. 278] to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery; and they were
          read the second time,</p>
        <p> Mr. FOWLER moved to indefinitely postpone the bill, S. 278. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON knew of no bills on the files deserving more attention than this bill, S.
          278. He sincerely hoped it would pass, as it far excels the bill, S.84.</p>
        <p> Mr. WOOLLEN personally liked the bill [S. 278] which probably gave better protection to
          the people, but preferred to consider the bill [S. 84] because it provides for a State
          board of health, with a board of examiners in each congressional district, and would be
          more likely to pass the other House. He did not expect to get a perfect bill passed this
          session, but desired some such measure to become a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE opposed the motion to postpone on the ground of public policy. The bill [S.
          278] contains provisions of more importance than any other before the Senate, and if it
          becomes a law would save more lives in the State and do more good than all the legislation
          in the State for the last 10 years. One provision in this bill is worth a thousand bills
          like 84, and that is the clause which prohibits the vending of patent medicines in this
          State unless the formula be first submitted to the board of examiners and the board shall
          declare the opinion that such preparation will not injure the life or health if used as
          directed. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZlES saw no antagonism between the two bills. There were good features in S. 278,
          and no doubt it is a good bill, but senators should not now condemn in toto either of
          them. He opposed the motion to postpone. The people desire some legislation on this
          subject, being now overrun with quacks, especially in the southern portion, where they
          have appeared in large numbers after being recently run out of the States of Illinois and
          Kentucky. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS favored the bill S. 278, believing that every school of medicine should be
          represented on the Board, and that the bill S. 278 is infinitely superior in many features
          to the other. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER would be satisfied with either of these bills, but believed S. 278 was more
          perfect and would be more likely to meet the wants of the people, as well as the
          profession. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. STREIGHT, the two bills were referred to a special committee of three,
          with instructions to report thereon Monday morning. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR subsequently makes this committee to consist of Messrs. Peterson,
          Riley and Mercer. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House and Senate
          bills, on the second reading. </p>
        <p>The bill H. R. 9, for regulating the setting up of corner stones in the public highways,
          was read the second time, with a committee report recommending its indefinite
          postponement. The report was concurred in, though resisted by Mr. WOOLLEN.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 12] to legalize the incorporation of Seymour, was read the second
          time.</p>
        <p> Mr. FOWLER moved, ineffectually to amend by adding the words, "and all other
          towns/' </p>
        <p>The bill goes on the calendar of bills on the the third reading.</p>
        <p> The bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_014">[H. R. 14]</ref> to amend section one of the
          private cemetery incorporation act of March. 3,1875, was read the second time and passed
          to the third reading.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.209 in BLR-->
        <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved that leave of absence be granted the senator from Porter [Mr.
          Wood] till Monday, on account of sickness in his family. After some humorous
          conversational debate thereon, the motion was agreed to by--yeas 36, nays 5. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE moved for leave of absence <pb n="210" xml:id="VAA8558-17-212"/> till some
          time Monday, thus enabling him to see about an important law suit. The motion
          "was resisted in several short speeches, but finally agreed to by yeas 37, nays
          7. </p>
        <p> Mr. BENZ thereupon moved that all the senators be granted leave of absence till Monday
          week; which motion, being put amid much merriment, was declared by the Lieutenant Governor
          to be carried. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the appointment of a
          committee of three senators to act with a like House committee, to receive a committee of
          both Houses of the Ohio Legislature, coming here next Monday at 5:55 p. m., to visit the
          Benevolent Institutions of the State. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR subsequently appointed as said committee on the part of the
          Senate Messrs. Shirk, Fowler and Streight.</p>
        <p> The bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_015">[H. R. 15]</ref> to legalize the election held
          in 1878 in the town of Edinburgh, was read the second time and passed to the third
          reading</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 35] to amend sec. 64 of the Justices' act of June 9,1852, was
          read the second time with a report recommending indefinite postponement. </p>
        <p>Mr. Comstock opposed concurrence in the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE thought such a bill should not pass--judgments are usually appealed from spite,
          and the cases where justice is done on the first trial are far more numerous than
          otherwise. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK favored this measure, thinking it much better to stop these small cases in the
          lower courts. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE referred to serious objections against the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. GRUBB8 explained that the bill provides there shall be no appeal in cases where the
          amount recovered is less than $20. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT regarded the bill as a step in the right direction. It would relieve the
          upper courts to keep out of them these petty cases. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS thought this bill ought not to pass. Proper testimony is very apt to be ruled
          out in Justices court, and in many other ways great hardships may grow out of such a bill
          if passed into a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER spoke in favor of the passage of this bill. It would have the effect of making
          men more careful in bringing the class of suits referred to. They would employ good
          attorneys, and litigation in small cases would more frequently be stopped in the
          justice's court. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR insisted that such a bill as this should not be passed, it being a practical
          denial of justice to poor men. This brings up a question as to whether a poor man shall
          have his rights as against the man of means, and under the operation of the provisions of
          this bill the rich man would win his suit in almost every case. </p>
        <p> Mr. MENZIES opposed the cutting off all appeal in such cases, and so favored the report
          of the committee.</p>
        <p> Mr. URMSTON, regarding this bill as limiting justices to cases under $20, should oppose
          the bill.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The report was concurred in by--yeas 23, nays 21. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. POINDEXTER his bill [S. 374] to alter the charter of Clarkesville,
            was read the second time, with a committee report recommending that it lie on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. POINDEXTER moved to amend by a substitute, which was agreed to. He explained its
            object, and the bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE the bill [S. 442--Mr. Reeve's) concerning general
            elections if the constitutional amendment, No. 3, be ratified by the people, was read
            the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. VIEHE said: The first section re-enacts the law of 1852, except that this bill
            provides the general election shall be held on the day fixed by the constitution instead
            of the second Tuesday in October. The second section provides that all acts required to
            be done at the October election shall be done at the elections held under the act, so
            that whether the constitutional amendment be ratified or not this bill will be of force
            and effect.</p>

          <p> The bill [H. R. 228] to enable the superintendent of public instruction and the
            auditor of Adams county to correct an error in the school accounts of said county;
            and--</p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 303] to legalize the acts of officers of Tell City, were read the
            second time and severally passed to the third reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 493] to prevent breechy animals from running at large, was read the
            second time, with a committee report that it lie on the table, which was concurred in. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 55--Mr. Garrigus'] to legalize the incorporation of the Kokomo
            Building association was read the second time and ordered engrossed for the third
            reading.</p>
          <p> The bill [S. 59--Mr. Grubb's] to amend section 22 of the town incorporation
            act of June 11, 1852, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS said the same bill was passed two years ago, bat the sections it amended
            being decided unconstitutional, this act became void. The only purpose is to give towns
            the right to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors by requiring a license, and to
            establish police regulations in towns. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR moved to indefinitely postpone the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE regarded this as a good bill. It allows towns to enforce an additional
            license fee for the retailing of intoxicating liquors. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE explained further: When a man is entitled under the State laws to a license
            to retail intoxicating liquors, this bill will give the power to towns to restrain and
            regulate the vendor by charging an additional license not exceeding the amount required
            by the State law. The motion to indefinitely postpone the bill was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER offered an amendment limiting the tax to be imposed by towns to $50, which
            was rejected by--yeas 7, nays 27. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 62, Mr. Comstock's] to make stockholders liable for double the
            amount of their stock, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT had seen the necessity of a bill of this character and hoped it would
            pass, The bill was ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. KENT the bill [F. 333, Mr. Donham's] to require the muzzling

        <p> The minutes were not read.</p>
        <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, felt impelled by a duty he owed to the State, to say that day
          after day this House had been filled with men lobbying for pet measures to the great
          annoyance of the House, and that voices in the lobby had voted to swell the yeas and nays
          in order to carry favorite measures. He offered a resolution that hereafter during this
          session no gentleman shall be allowed to remain on the floor of the House or within the
          cloak or anterooms, except members of the House or Senate, or the officers or employes
          thereof, or reporters or members of the press, and the doorkeeper is hereby instructed to
          strictly enforce this order. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS had not been troubled with this kind of a nightmare, and did not like to hear
          talk about members being directed here in their votes; nor would he admit that any man
          comes here as a moral trainer of this House. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAILEY did not understand that this resolution intended to assert that any member had
          been corrupted, and was in favor of the resolutions. He said the hum of voices was so loud
          that no business could be done satisfactorily, because members, especially in the rear of
          the hall, could not hear. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER referred to a rule of the House which would correct these evils, and which
          should be enforced. It was time now for action, and not for talking. There was a large
          amount of business on his table to dispose of.</p>
        <p> The <orgName>committee on claims</orgName> returned the bill [H. R. 420] for the relief
          of Alex Ingles and others, recommending its passage. Also the claim of the Rosenthral car
          company, recommening passage.</p>
        <p> Mr HANDY submitted a minority report setting forth that inasmuch as a special committe
          had heretofore reported adversely upon the same claim, he was compelled to recommend that
          the claim be rejected. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. DAILY the claim and report were laid on the table. He also entered a
          motion to reconsider the vote on yesterday, whereby the House concurred in the report of
          the <orgName>committee on claims</orgName> upon the claim of R. G. Manis. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, also entered his motion to reconsider the vote by which the

        <p> Mr. ALLEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he voted against
          the bill because of its inequality, and because of its unjust provisions. The bill would
          impose upon the citizens of his township an unjust burden, and if for no other reason, he
          would vote against the bill. He voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. CALDWELL, explaining, said he was willing to go as far as anyone on the floor to
          procure a fair and honest reduction of fees and salaries. He had hoped that a fee and
          salary bill would have been reported to this House, distant day the Legislature would have
          the power to pass a salary law, grading the salary to each officer according to the
          population in each county, thereby defining what amount of pay such officer shall receive,
          and believing farther that if this bill becomes a law it will greatly cripple the
          administration of justice in this State, and deprive the people of that capacity in
          official position which the public service demands, he should vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER, in explanation, said he could not vote for this bill because of its unjust
          inequalities. The House rescinded its own action on the salary of the Auditor of State,
          and the bill now allows salary and fees amounting to over $10,000 more than the
          Governor's salary. That of Superintendent of Public Instruction--the most
          important office in the State, except that of Governor--is cut down to only $2,000. The
          bill leaves less than $600 for the pay of the services of many of the clerks of the small
          counties, and he was anxious to vote for a just reduction of salaries, but as this bill is
          not such a measure he voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. REED, in explanation of his vote, said the bill in its present form ought not to
          become a law, because of the inequality between the salaries of county officers. It
          discriminates unjustly against county clerks. Believing, however, that the Senate would
          amend It he voted "aye" simply to give that opportunity.</p>
        <p> Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, in explanation of his vote, said: This bill did not suit him.
          Many of its provisions are objectionable, but believing the people demand some action upon
          the subject he would vote "aye" for the reason that no hope can be
          entertained of a better bill being presented at this late date of the session. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER, when his name was called, in explanation said: He did not endorse the bill,
          but he believed it would be amended in the Senate, he therefore voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, in explanation of his vote, said: He would rather be right than to be a
          representative or a Democrat, and believing this bill was wrong, he voted
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. THORNBURG explaining said: He did not feel as though he could endorse this bill and
          asked to be excused from voting. Objection being made he voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. Tulley, in explanation, said: Believing <pb n="212" xml:id="VAA8558-17-214"/> that it
          was imperatively demanded of this General Assembly to pass some act of relief to the
          people, from the enormous burdens placed upon them by the exhorbitant taxation of fees and
          salaries now paid to officers, yet knowing this bill is unjust in many of its provisions,
          and does great injustice to many of the State and county officers, with the hope that the
          Senate may correct the wrong, and thus secure a fair bill to all, he voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. VANPELT, when his name was called, said he thought this bill cuts the county clerk
          and treasurer too low, but hoping it may be amended in the Senate, he voted
          "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON, when his name was called, in explaining, said: There was too much inequality
          in this bill, in proportion to the work done; he, therefore, voted
          "no."</p>
        <p> Mr. WILLARD, in explanation of his vote, said: He voted for this bill because it was the
          best thing that could be had now, and because he thought it the duty of this (General
          Assembly to pass a bill for a reduction in fees and salaries. He voted
          'aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. Works when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he had no right to
          transfer the responsibility that rests upon him to the Senate, by saying that he would
          vote for this bill with the hope that the Senate would amend it, and make it right. He
          knew the bill was wrong, therefore he voted "no." </p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. </p>

        <p>The reading of the secretary's minutes of Saturday's proceedings was
          dispensed with after a correction (on motion by Mr. HARRIS) inserting the motion made [by
          Mr. Benz] Saturday morning that all senators have leave of absence till Monday week at 2
          o'clock p. m. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE offered a resolution which was adopted, declaring the action of the Senate in
          granting leave of absence to the whole Senate to be unconstitutional, and ordering the
          same to be expunged from the journal. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER offered a joint resolution authorizing a recovery of the lands reclaimed by
          the drainage of Beaver and English Lakes and the Kankakee and Calumet rivers. He said: It
          is supposed that there are many thousand acres of State lands lying in the region of
          Beaver and English lakes and the Kankakee and Calumet rivers, which have been reclaimed by
          drainage and of which the State has no record. The purpose of the joint resolution is to
          provide for the survey of these lands in order that they may be placed in the market. </p>
        <p>The joint resolution was adopted by--yeas 37, nays 0. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the governor
          to surrender to the owner any claim and evidence thereof, on file in his office, in
          relation to the Mbrgan raid. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, the fee and salary bill [H. R. 344] was read the first time, and
          referred to the committee on fees and salaries, with instructions to report to-morrow at
          10 o'clock, and, on his further motion, 100 copies were ordered printed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE, the special committee thereon reported back the bill [S. 278] to
          regulate the practice of medicine and surgery, and the business of apothecary, with a
          favorable report, which was concurred in.</p>
        <p> Mr. HEFRON moved to strike from the first section all after the enacting clause. He
          objected to attempting to regulate the whole subject of pharmacy and the practice of
          medicine at once, much preferring to try only to regulate the practice of medicine. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE asserted that this bill has caused as much criticism as any bill before either
          House this session, and has been pretty generally agreed upon by all concerned. Why there
          is objection to restraining the dealing out of the deadliest material known to be in
          existence is something he could not understand. The bill is liberal enough, and this
          section particularly should not be stricken out. Of the two, it is best to require
          knowledge of the one who dispenses, rather than the one who prescribes. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL regarded the amendment as intended to kill the bill. He thought there should
          be some kind of legislation on this subject, but was uncertain as to whether or not this
          bill was acceptable to the medical profession and the people generally. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN thought the connecting of druggists and pharmacists with this bill would kill
          it, though he admitted such legislation la necessary. It were better, he thought, to have
          separate bills for each subject. This provision is too stringent for the country trade,
          and for that reason only would prefer to see the amendment adopted.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHAFFER would prefer this subject be legislated on rather than the one referring to
          the practice of medicine, for it is far more important to the people. But it can do no
          harm to legislate on the two subjects proposed in this bill, because the druggist and the
          physician are in innately connected. He hoped the amendment would not be concurred. There
          is no other way so easy to get rid of the harm produced by the thousands of vicious
          nostrums now vended by druggists. This bill will meet the wants of the profession and the
          wishes of the people. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON would rather see all relating to physicians stricken from this bill than that
          the amendment should pass. The result of this amendment would be to multiply the already
          too numerous drug stores, because the physician incompetent to obtain a license to
          practice would go to selling drugs most naturally. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE directed attention to the careful wording of the section. Where so simple and
          so liberal a provision will make human life <pb n="215" xml:id="VAA8558-17-217"/> safe,
          are senators willing to say it shall not be incorporated in the bill? The bill is
          carefully guarded, is broad in its scope, and is deserving the favorable votes of all,
          because no bill yet presented, nor all the bills together, affords so much protection to
          human life as this one bill. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. COFFEY felt sure that for want of time this bill could not be properly matured, and
          he therefore made an ineffectual motion--yeas 11, nays 30--that the bill be indefinitely
          postponed. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to substitute for this one his bill, S.149 on the same subject.</p>
        <p> The amendment was rejected.</p>
        <p> The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clook.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> On motion by Mr. WOOLLEN, section 2 was amended providing that any one may carry on
            such business it he keeps a licensed employe to compound and deal out drugs and
            medicines for sale. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES regarded the meat in this bill to be in section 5, which proposes to get up
            a medical oligarchy in Indianapolis--a sort of medical ring which would govern the whole
            State. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE individually desired that every section in this bill should be fairly
            considered. He proposed it upon consultation with no one--no medical man had any
            dictation in it. In connection, with the rest of the bill, it can be shown that there is
            no ring in it; there can be no ring, and there can be nothing unfair about it; no
            conflict, and no rivalries between the different schools can exist under it. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN desired to see the word "allopathic" eliminated from the
            section. His school was called "regular," and he desired that word
            substituted for "allopathic." We have the privilege of treating cases
            as we may desire; we are simply physicians; others may be what they please. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERB0THAM favored some such measure, believing tho people suffered more from
            quackery than anything else, but he desired to see the proviso allowing traveling
            expenses,stricken out, because that clause was so often made to cover a multitude of
            extras, </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved an amendment by way of a substitute for section five, authorizing the
            circuit, judge of the largest county in the congressional district, to appoint the five
            members of the examining board, to be selected from the various schools He said it was
            wrong to require all the applicants for examination to come up to Indianapolis, as the
            bill under consideration would. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER favored a county board. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped the substitute would be adopted, because there were good reasons why
            applicants for examination should not be compelled to come up to Indianapolis. He
            thought it unfair to build up a medical aristocracy in Indianapolis, and he believed in
            distributing these offices </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE referred to a great complaint that the medical colleges sell their diplomas.
            Under this bill no one is compelled to come to Indianapolis except new students, and the
            expense need not be a quarter of what it would be otherwise. If 25 come here a year it
            will be a larger number than he expects.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHAFFER had no serious objection to the section. The expense of a State board
            would be but a trifle more than the expense of a Congressional board; but the beauty of
            a State board would consist in the uniformity of standard, of qualification which would
            be required. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The substitute was adopted by--yeas 32, nays 12.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT reported the provisions of the seventh section as too severe, and he moved
            to strike it out. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN moved a substitute for section 7, making the penalty a
            "misdemeanor" instead of a "felony," which was
            adopted by--yeas 29, nays 10. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. STREIGHT, the word "intentional" was stricken out of
            section 13. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. GARRIGUS, section 16 was amended by adding thereto these words;
            "Physicians of all schools of medicine shall have equal rights and privileges
            under this act, in all respects." </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to strike out the clause requiring a minute description of the
            licensed physician.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE saw no good reason why a physician should not have a good personal
            description preserved on the records of the board of examiners, in case it should become
            necessary to use it. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. DONHAM moved to amend by providing that each physician shall write his
            prescriptions in English as far as possible.</p>
          <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD regarded this as perhaps the very worst piece of legislation ever brought
            into this hall. It is in conflict with the constitution. The only argument he had heard
            in its favor is that good doctors must be protected from quacks? Why not legislate in
            favor of good blacksmiths, or good farmers or good grocerymen as against quacks. All the
            laws that can be piled on the statute books cam not protect the people against quacks.
            Sound medical men, well educated medical men, in any large numbers, are not asking this
            kind of legislation. It is the quack who is asking for this bill, which proposes the
            worst kind of class legislation. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLEN assured senators that this is not a selfish matter on the part of
            physicians. Quacks do not affect regular physicians. This bill is for the protection of
            the people, and he thought that well understood.</p>
          <p> Under the operation of the previous question demanded by Mr. WOOLEN the bill was
            passed the second reading as amended, and ordered to be engrossed.</p>
          <p> A message from the governor announced his acceptance of the resignation of Hon. Wm.
            HEILMAN, late senator from the county of Vanderburg. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL the bill <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_340">[H. R. 340]</ref> to
            fix the number of senators and representatives in the General Assembly of Indiana and to
            apportion the same among the several counties of the State, was taken up, under the
            operation of the previous question demanded by Mr. Burrell, and read the second time. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT made an ineffectual motion--yeas 17, nays 30--to adjourn. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAVIS moved to amend the bill by way of substitute--striking out from the first
            section, and inserting new matter. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved the adoption of the substitute, and demanded the previous question,
            on the seconding of which, the yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Harris and Kahlo,
            and, being taken, resulted--yeas 26, nays 21. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE, in explanation, when his name was called, stated that he agreed with the
            senator from Vanderburg [Mr. Heilman], who said he would not go home till 11 to-night,
            to pair with him; not if he filed his resignation to-day, Mr. V. agreed not to vote on
            any political measure. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE, when his named was called, announced his pair with the senator from

        <p>Also, the bill [H. R. 116] prohibiting sale of property on execution for less than

        <p>Mr. MAJOR was opposed to the selling of property for less than the appraised value. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS said that the bill failed to reach the point the author intended, and therefore
          the committee reported that the bill be indefinitely postponed. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said the House could not afford to put out a law upon the
          statute book, as it would be nugatory. </p>
        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
        <p> Also the bill [H. R. 353] defining what is a legal newspaper was an unfavorable report. </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLEY said he wanted the law to show distinctly what a newspaper was, and he asked
          the House to reverse the decision of the committee, and pass the bill.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER said this bill proposes to legalize the newspapers that have one-half of
          their matter printed in other States. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said the committee could not recommend the passage of the bill
          because they thought there was no legal question involved. The report was rejected and the
          bill was ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON introduced a bill [H. R. 646]changing the name of the Marion criminal circuit
          court to the Marion criminal court, which was read the first time and passed to the second

        <p>Mr. SAINT moved for a reconsideration of the vote whereby the House concurred in the
          report to indefinitely postpone the bill [H. R. 520]--nine jurors may render a

        <p>Mr. WATSON hoped the report would not be concurred in.</p>
        <p> Mr. SAINT would like to see this law applied to civil cases, and he was willing to allow
          three-fourths of a jury to bring in a verdict. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess was opposed to the bill and in favor of the report. He had heard no

        <p>Mr. DRAKE thought perhaps it was time to make a change in these old laws.</p>
        <p> The report of the committee was then rejected.</p>

          the third time, Mr. Dailey explaining its provisions. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER objected to the bill, because there was too much machinery, and it would cost
          too much. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS was in favor of the bill, because it explained what it wanted, and he hoped
          the bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH believed this was a good bill, and hoped it would pass </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT said he thought this bill would save a good deal of litigation, and did not see

          <p>Mr. EDWINS called up his bill [H. R. 560] for the relief of John J. Justin, trustee; it
            was read the third time, and passed the House by--yeas 70, nays 3. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH called up his bill [H. R. 3] for the assessment of real estate in the year
            1879, and every five years thereafter. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD said there was one serious objection to the bill, that of the assessment of
            real estate in 1879. We were apt to go too far the other way, and, in the present
            financial depression, it would likely work a wrong. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON favored a reassessment. The county needs to come back to a specie payment
            basis on our real estate as well as in other things. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS thought it might be hardship as tar as Indianapolis was concerned, but he
            aid not think it was so in other parts of the State. Seventeen dollars and fifty cents
            was the average value of land and improvements, and he did not think that was high. He
            thought there was no excuse for appraising lands now. They would be appraised in 1880,
            and if you reappraise now yon make a deficiency in the revenue for 1880. </p>
          <p>Mr. BARKER did not see why land should not be reappraised. There was a general demand
            for it, and he believed it was right. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said, in a question like this the House ought to have some confidence in
            the judgment of members of the committee on ways and means. If you decrease the levy we
            have made, you drive the State in debt, or you close up your benevolent institutions.
            The decision of that committee ought to have some weight. He hoped the bill would not
            pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said let the assessment come one year sooner; it will cost no more. It
            necessarily follows that if you reduce valuation, the revenue goes down; but as the
            valuation goes down your levy must go up. In his county there were no cities, but the
            farm land was appraised at $39 per acre, which is more than they could possibly sell it
            for. The man who has his means invested in real estate pays the most tax, and he was in
            favor of an equalization of this matter.</p>
          <p> Mr. HART said he was a farmer, and he did not think that the farmers in bis county
            wanted a reappraisement now. He thought the land was valued lower in proportion to other
            species of property, and there was no reason for a reappraisement of property in 1879. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT said men should pay according to what they were worth. The farmers in his
            county demand a reappraisement. </p>
          <p>Mr. BROWN, of Stenben, hoped the bill would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. BLACKLEY thought the appraisement in the country was right, and he saw no reason
            for a reappraisement in 1879. </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY hoped the bill would not pass. </p>

          <p>Mr. DRAKE considered this a bill to license quackery. It requires only 16 weeks before
            a man can practice medicine. He should vote against it. </p>
          <p>Mr. SCHOLL said a diploma was a prima facie evidence that the holder had prepared
            himself for the practice of medicine. That diploma has to be issued by a regularly
            chartered medical college. This was a plain, practical bill, and he would vote for it. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER came here instructed to use his influence for the passage of any bill that
            will relieve the people from that class of men called, quack doctors. This was a step in
            the right direction, and he hoped this bill would be passed. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRYANT felt the necessity of passing some such a bill, but it should be most
            carefully considered. If we make a start, we should start in the right direction. This
            bill does injustice to a large class, for the student of 20 months can get license to
            practice, while the man who has practiced medicine for four years and 11 months will,
            under this bill, have to set aside. He hoped this bill may not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. CONFER said there was some difficulty in getting at this in the proper respect.
            This bill does not meet the requirement of the people. He could not support the
            bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. HUBBARD would rather employ a man who had a large experience, than a man with no
            experience, and with one or more diplomas. He thought a little catnip and dough pills
            would do more good than strong medicine. He was opposed to the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. GORDON was sure that as science advances, human life would be longer preserved. He
            was willing that this bill should pass, because it was probably the best one we could
            get, and he should vote for its passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS was here to elevate the practice of medicines, and he had introduced this
            bill with that purpose, and had submitted it to an association of physicians from all
            parts of the State who had assembled in this city and considered this bill section by
            section and endorsed it almost unanimously. It was a step in the right direction, and in
            two years more it could be added to or amended if it was found necessary. </p>

        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS, in explanation of his vote, said: He found in the National platform a
          declaration that the National party are in favor of a fair and equitable apportionment
          which shall secure a fair and un trammeled expression of the political sentiment of the
          people. On an examination of the election returns of 1876 and 1878 he finds that at
          neither election has the Democratic party cast 50 per cent. of the votes. He finds, also,
          on examining the senatorial apportionment as made in the substitute adopted for this bill
          that 60 per cent. is given to the Democracy, leaving 40 per cent. to be divided between
          the National and Republican party, and the apportionment for members of the House of
          Representatives is very nearly the same as the estimate for senators. He thought it an
          unfair bill, and therefore voted "no," </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said he had noticed that if a grind-stone has too
          much grit on one side it wears unevenly and becomes "one-sided.". So
          with political parties. When one has been in power a long time, it becomes
          "one-sided" and any change is beneficial. The Republicans have had
          control a long time and has too much grit on one side and is worn "out of
          round." The Democrats have a very narrow margin--too narrow to walk on firmly in
          effecting a change, and are dependent on help. This bill does not suit him, but it is the
          best we can get with the help we have. He wished to take advantage of the help while it is
          willing, and he voted for the bill because he wanted a change, and this is the best we can
          get now. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER, when his name was called in explanation of his vote said, he did not
          consider the bill fair, for several reasons; the principal one being that it placed him in
          a Democratic district [laughter] and he had no doubt there are other members in the same
          position. Upon these grounds, and others, he voted "no." </p>
        <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded; and so the bill passed the Senate.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Mr. MENZIES moved to dispense with the regular order of business, and take up the bill
            <ref target="#HB_1879_01_09_112">[H. R. 112]</ref> for the appointment of the Trustees
          of the Benevolent Institutions of the State; that it be put on its passage now and on

          and under its operations the motion to take the bill was agreed to, by yeas 26, nays 23,
          and the bill was read the third time. </p>
        <p>On the further motion of Mr. MENZIES, under another demand for the previous question, the
          bill was passed the Senate by--yeas 26, nays 23, a similar vote to the one on the passage

          nays 5. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DICE, his bill [S. 392] to legalize certain acts of the circuit court in
          his district, was read the second time with a report thereon recommending indefinite
          postponement. He resisted concurrence in the report. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT also favored the bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL opposed its passage.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> On motion by Mr. DICE the report was concurred in, the constitutional restriction was
          dispensed with, and the bill pressed to its final reading and passage by--yeas 38, nays 0. </p>
        <p>Mr HARRIS was not willing the companies should select their own papers, because they
          might select papers with obscure circulation. These insurance companies ought to be made
          to publish their condition. The object is to inform the agent of every company the
          condition of every other company in the State. The law ought to be amended. The principle
          in the bill is right. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES was not bound down to either amending or abolishing the present law. It is
          against just principles to tax one branch of business for another branch. Foreign
          insurance companies, by the present law, have an annual tax levied on them for the support
          of two papers in Indianapolis, Why select two papers here? In the northern part of the
          State the Chicago papers circulate, and in the southern part Cincinnati and Louisville
          papers circulate, more generally than the Indianapolis papers. In his county, not 10
          copies of the Sentinel are taken, and but three copies of the Journal. This odious tax
          rests upon the policy holder in this State, and it is wrong in principle.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE: This insurance steal has occupied the public attention until it hay become
          known under the title or name of "insurance steal." It puts into the
          treasury of two newspapers $10,000 apiece, for which an amount of printing is done
          entirely uncalled for. Bat the Insurance companies are taxed $56,000 which has to be paid
          by the policy holders resident here. This bill ought to be disposed of suddenly. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM was a member of the Senate when the present law passed, and this matter
          of advertising was so covered up he did not know of it, nor did many other members. This
          is an unnecessary and uncalled for expense, and the law ought never to have been on the
          statute books. It is nothing but a sudsidy for two newspapers in Indianapolis. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT also voted for this bill two years ago, but was convinced great abuse had
          grown up under it. He now favored overhauling this matter, which has grown to be a scandal
          and a disgrace. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE wanted to know who are to be benefited by this measure. He would like to see
          this bill thoroughly ventilated. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER voted for this bill two years ago, taking the word of others that it was all
          right. No vote given in the last assembly did he regret so much as giving aid to this
          fraud, gotten up for the benefit of two Indianapolis papers. It is of no benefit to any
          policy holder. It should be repealed.</p>
        <p> The motion was agreed to, and the bill 423 was read the first time, having been referred
          to the <orgName>committee on insurance</orgName> at the time it was introduced, without,
          reading. </p>
        <p>On the further motion of Mr. MENZIES, the constitutional rule was dispensed with, and the
          bill read by title only for the second reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved to amend, by providing for the printing of semi-annual insurance
          statements in one weekly paper in this State. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS offered a substitute, requiring the State auditor to make the publications in
          two newspapers in the State--one of which shall be in Indianapolis--the insurance
          companies to select the medium for advertising. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON was astonished at the outburst of indignation against this law. The principle
          of the law is right, and ought to be maintained. There may be errors in it, but they
          should be corrected. The law permits the printer to make no greater charge against these
          wealthy corporations than as against the heirs of the estate of a deceased citizen, be he
          ever so poor. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE desired to see an amendment to the bill requiring a copy of these statements to
          be filed in the recorder's office of each county. It is an unwarrantable steal to
          require agents to procure license oftener than once a year; it is a fraud on every
          insurance company outside of the State, and is only desired by its beneficiaries and the
          local insurance companies. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>




        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> Mr. COMSTOOK explained this bill only changes the present law by leaving out the
            clause requiring the state auditor to have semi-annual statements of foreign insurance
            companies published in the two daily newspapers of the State. It simply proposes to put
            foreign insurance companies on the same footing with other insurance companies. It is a
            bill in the interest of the people, because every tax levied on insurance companies must
            eventually come off the people. He regarded the publication of these statements as
            unnecessary and productive of no good. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL said the law was intended to protect the public against bogus foreign
            insurance companies. It may be possible it was a mistake in requiring the publication of
            statement in certain newspapers. It may be a mistake in making the price therefor $1 per
            square. The price should probably be cut down one-half, and the law might be amended in
            other particulars. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said this law gives to the Auditor of State an enormous fee, and is
            used to subsidize two daily newspapers of this city, and a great wrong is being done in
            having these statements published, while they are required to be kept on file in every
            clerk's office in the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD: The people are not asking that the Legislature shall not require these
            publications, but it is the foreign insurance companies who are asking it, because they
            do not want to show the people what their condition is.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON opposed the substitute amendment, regarding no requirement on the subject
            as preferable, because the company would procure the publication in any backwoods
            county, in any 6x8 newspaper that will do the work cheapest. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE called attentien to the question before the Senate, which is, when and where
            shall these statements be published. The law now makes a monopoly of the publication
            resting in two papers. No good results to the State by oppressing capital whether it be
            home or foreign. While not liking the substitute he would favor it, believing it the
            best thing that could be done, at this late date, under the circumstances.</p>

          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The substitute was rejected by yeas 13, nays, 30, and the amendment was rejected by
            yeas 22, nays 23.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILSON moved an amendment requiring foreign companies to invest three-fourths of
            their receipts for premiums in this State in good securities therein. </p>
          <pb n="221" xml:id="VAA8558-17-223"/>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES regarded such an amendment in effect as prohibiting foreign insurance
            companies from doing business in this State. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. OLDS it was rejected by yeas 26. nays 20.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOLLEN moved to amend by adding that the semi-annual statements shall be
            published in two Indianapolis dailies, and one paper in each county where doing
            business. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved as a substitute that the company shall publish its statement in one
            weekly newspaper in Indianapolis, and file proof thereof with the auditor of state. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS thought there was more sympathy expressed for foreign insurance companies
            here than has been expressed for the people in the last two months. The pending
            substitute requires the state auditor to work for these companies without pay, and that
            is not right. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES disclaimed that this bill was in the interest of insurance companies,
            foreign or domestic. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER saw no necessity requiring the publication of these statements in news-
            papers at all, as such statements were kept on file in every clerk's office in
            every county in the State. </p>

          <p>Mr. HEFRON favored this amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER regarded the present law as not only a stupendous fraud, but a
            stupendouvilliany. Though not a friend to corporations he opposed the amendment as

        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER thought the Senate bill, which was short, was better than the House bill,
          and, to relieve the House from embarrassment, he moved to recommit the bill to a select
          committee, with instruction to report back the Senate bill as it came from the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD thought if the bill was referred to a committee, that would be the end of it.

          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> Mr. GORDON said in 1869 the Legislature levied a tax for the first time to sustain the
            common schools--the black and white children to be provided for by separate schools. The
            white children had a day school for nine months in the year, while the colored children
            had only two weeks of night school. The bill provides that colored schools shall be
            established only where it is equal. If there are a sufficient number they are to have a
            separate room, or a separate part of the same room. Justice requires that we should give
            this race an equal opportunity for education. </p>
          <p>The bill passed the House by--yeas 60, nays 30.</p>
          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER when his name was called said: He supported the 14th amendment to the
            constitution of the United States in the first vote he ever cast at the election of
            1866. As a member of the House he voted for the ratification of the 15th amendment in
            1869. This bill is simply the logical conclusion to which those two great amendments
            lead. He, therefore, very cheerfully voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: In 1872 as a
            member of the Senate he took an oath to support the constitution of the State and the
            saw in sec. one of article eight of the constitution a provision that the common schools
            should be equally open to all. He knew the poor negro was one of that
            "all" and he immediately introduced a bill similar to the one now
            before the House. That bill was then killed by a Democratic House, but he still stood
            where he stood then. He voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY, when his name was called, in explanation said: He recognized most fully the
            logic of events, and he believed that the day is not far distant when there shall he no
            legal distinction between white and blacks, male or female, when all shall stand on an
            equal platform. He therefore voted "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. HANDY called up his bill [H. R. 456] to require certain gravel, macadamized and
            plank road companies, to whom was relinquished the right of the State in the so-called
            National and Cumberland road, to finish, complete and keep the same in repair within a
            certain time, which was read the third time, and passed the House by--yeas 54, nays 35. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARLAN called up the bill [H. R. 392] establishing a militia of the States, which
            was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr SHANKS said this was a time for economy. This bill calls for an appropriation of
            $50,000. If you want a militia he thought this a good bill, and the appropriation was
            hardly half what our sister State appropriates annually to the support of State militia.
            The fact that the Southern States had their militia organized cost the sacrifice of a
            large number of human lives. He hoped that the people in time of peace would prepare for
            war. Pennsylvania appropriates annually $250,000; New York $250,000; New Jersey $50,000,
            and States adjoining us as follows: Illinois, $100,000; Michigan, $100,000, and Ohio
            $250,000. There are now scattered among the counties in the State over $400,000 of arms
            and equipments, that need caring for the State receives annually in arms $7,500, and
            that will be needless unless we have a military organization. A well-organized militia
            in the State will prevent the very troubles in the State that they were organized to
            subdue. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON--When he was young there were military companies organized, and they drew
            arms. The arms were now all gone--used up for corn-knives and pruning-hooks. He was in
            hopes the bill would not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH did not know any State or country with the population of Indiana that did
            not have a military protection in some shape. We can not maintain civil government
            without the power to maintain the decisions of the courts. It was time our State had
            taken some steps in this direction. We have to legislate for society as it is, and not
            as it should be We are tending toward peace--difficulties are being settled by
            conventions. He would like to see this bill pass.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS thought it was right and proper that this State should provide for a
            militia. It seemed to him the amount appropriated was none too large. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart. did not believe that the people of this State required a
            militia at this time. If the time should come when militia are demanded to sustain the
            laws you will see the beginning of the end of this Government. No army power is needed
            to follow up the constable to protect him in the dis- charge of his duty. It was not
            fair to fasten. such an organization upon the State, because in a few instances the
            people become unmanagable. Fifty thousand dollars this year means $100,000 next. It is
            contrary to the genius of the institutions of our county, and ought to fall dead before
            the House.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD said that the present Governor of the State had seen the need of a
            military organization to preserve the peace of the State. The Sheriff can not control
            these outbreaks with undrilled men. After the riot at Pittsburg, Pa., the people
            everywhere felt the necessity to organize the militia. We have felt the need of it here,
            and this is a good bill, and he hoped that it would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON did not think this bill a necessity now. He was opposed to this bill
            utterly, and he would vote against it. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER had felt very uncertain what to do upon this question. Look back over the
            history and see whether it would have paid to have invested, $50,000 per year since the
            organization of the State to sustain a military organization. He believed there was more
            danger in men carrying arms than in carrying hoes. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill failed to pass the House by--yeas 33, nays 59. </p>
          <p>Mr. HANDY, when his name was called, said he had received petition after petition in
            favor of this measure and would therefore vote "aye." </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. HART called up the bill [H. R. 82] in relation to foreign express companies, which
            was read the third time and passed the House by--yeas 76, nays 2. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD called up his bill [H. R. 351] to authorize justices of the peace to appoint
            persons to act in their stead in certain cases, which was read the third time.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHUTT hoped the bill would pass. As judges had the privilege to appoint a
            substitute he did not see why a justice should not have the same privileges.</p>
          <pb n="223" xml:id="VAA8558-17-225"/>
          <p>Mr. WORKS objected to the bill because it made the bondsmen of the justice liable for

          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to further amend by providing that nothing in this act shall affect
            the present Incumbent in the offices herein named, but such incumbents shall serve out
            their unexpired term. </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER ruled the amendment out of order on the ground that no amendment to the

        <p>Mr. REEVE said he hoped the amendments would not prevail.</p>
        <p> The senator from Crawford [Mr. Benz] had asked no favor this session. Many members had
          been favored with suspension of rules, and their local measures been passed; now, as the
          session has been mainly taken up in passing local measures there is a rank injustice in
          refusing to favor members having such bills who have asked for hearing and not been heard.
          The session is, in. fact, ended. There is no time to consider bills of importance. If the
          people are unwilling that time shall be given for the Legislature to carefully prepare,
          consider and perfect laws then they have no right to complain that no laws or inefficient
          laws are passed. The executive has power to recall the Legislature to perfect legislation,
          and time can then be taken to consider important bills; the remaining time of the session
          had best be used in clearing the calendar of all local measures and leave us to a special
          session without more hindrance, for merely local benefit of individuals. Every member
          whose local law has been passed should blush to refuse leave for like favor to any other
          member asking it. Having secured the passage of their own local bills they should be
          willing other members shall have like favor. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS stated that in the first days of the session he introduced a bill which he
          has been trying to get through the Senate, but like the following of a

        <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, from the <orgName>committee on Finance</orgName>, returned the State
          House appropriation bill [H. R. 637], with a substitute therefor, appropriating $350,000
          for 1879 and $350,000 for 1880, to be paid in installments of $100,000 as maybe needed--no
          more than $50,000 to be paid in any one month, and levying a tax of 2 per cent. for 1879
          and 1880. He said it was an important bill, and as he did not like to interrupt the order
          of business he moved to make it a special order for 2 o'clock. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to print 100 copies and make this bill the special order for 4
          o'clock this afternoon.</p>
        <p> Mr. MENZIES ordinarily would be opposed to undue haste, but the bill is short, its
          provisions clear, and at this late hour it should not be postponed beyond 2
          o'clock this afternoon. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS regarded the bill as one of great simplicity, and thought it a waste of money
          to have it printed. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE examined the substitute bill with care, and declaring it unconstitutional,
          thought its consideration out of order. He moved to non-concur in the report of the

        <p> Mr. MENZIES, from the <orgName>committee of free conference</orgName>, reported an
          agreement on the interest bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">S. 277</ref>. He regarded
          this as the last opportunity to get a reduction in the rate of interest below ten per
          cent. This report proposes a legal rate of six per cent., with the privilege of
          contracting for seven. The great body of the people, regardless of politics, look to this
          Assembly to give them a reduction in the rate of interest. There has been a strong
          pressure to defeat all legislation on the subject this session, and now if this measure is
          defeated we go home to the people repudiating every pledge made on this subject. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS: This is a measure of great importance to the people. There was a time when no
          interest was allowed at all, but we have made progress in this matter and we now put the
          question of the hire of money on the same footing with the hire of other property. There
          ought to be some provision made for the citizens of this State who have their property
          mortgaged, and to that end he would like to see inserted a provision that the borrower may
          renew his loan at any rate not exceeding eight per cent. </p>
        <p> Mr. MENZIES explained that the mortgagee would, give extension rather than take a
          judgment, which, under this bill, would draw but six per cent. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT disliked to see any provision adopted restricting the rate of interest below
          what money can be obtained for. Unfortunately the debtor class is much the largest in this
          State, and this measure will greatly oppress that class. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM opposed concurrence in the report of the conference committee. It is
          supposed there are $40,000,O0O in loans of Eastern capital in this State. Can those thus
          oppressed in this State be relieved by this law? It is preposterous to think so. If this
          measure is passed and this burden is imposed upon the people, those voting for it will be
          buried so deep there will be no resurrection for them.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE--This is not a question of interest, but a question of the rights and
          privileges of the people of the State; the legal rate of interest has all along been 6 per
          cent. A law was placed in the statute book allowing the citizen to examine his judgment as
          to what he may pay for the use of money, not exceeing the rate of 10 per cent., but the
          State has been in the miserable, contemptible, puerile position of allowing a man to pay
          an illimitable sum to Forbear or stay an execution, yet prohibiting him from paying any
          sum he sees fit for money with which to pay off that execution. The Legislature has no
          more power to say that a citizen shall not go into the market to make a special contract
          to meet his own necessities upon one subject any more than another. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON was willing to accept this report as the next best thing that can be obtained,
          having fought as well as he could for a straight 6 per cent. law. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS: You might as well expect water to run up bill as to expect capital to come to
          this State with a 7 per cent. limit, when all States adjoining allow a greater rate to be
          given. Such a measure as the one proposed would be ruinous to the property of the State.
          The majority of the people will be found against it, and he hoped the report of this
          committee will be voted down and the bill heretofore passed the Senate adhered to. In that
          bill those demanding a lower rate were met half way, and yet they insist on still further
          concession. </p>
        <p>The Senate refused to concur in the report of the conference committee by--yeas 22, nays

            was read the third rime and failed to pass by--yeas 23, nays 18--for want of a
            constitutional majority. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 158] in relation to settlements by county boards with school
            officers--shall not be conclusive if the officer be a defaulter--was taken up, with a
            favorable committee report thereon. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE moved a substitute for the committee report, by adding to section 1 these
            words: "Whether received by way of certificate of deposit, bill, draft, note,
            check or any other evidence of indebtednesss " </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE opposed the passage of the bill, declaring it would give more trouble than
            members now dream of--there is a cat in this meal tub. There is a bid in it to every
            treasurer who wants to play the scoundrel, to make mistakes. It is an evil bill, in the
            interest of a few who wish to escape the results of their own wrong and their own
            neglect. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE said this bill has been assailed by a charge that it is in the interest of
            those in this city who desire to make a raid on the treasury. No one in this county knew
            of it till after it was drafted and brought here. The original, as introduced in the
            House by Representative March, contained but the clause. Ours is, perhaps, the only
            State in the Union which has established the rule of a bar to these actions, which rule
            is simply infamous. Instead of this bill being a bill in the interest of those
            contemplating raids on the treasury, it is in the interest of people who have suffered
            by having their funds dishonestly withheld. The proviso to the bill was added by <pb n="226" xml:id="VAA8558-17-228"/> Representative Sleeth, of Rush, not in the interest
            of men who wished to rob the treasury, but in the interest of men in that county who
            have had money improperly taken from them. The bill is not mandatory, but discretionary,
            whether they remit the money overcharged or not. He avowed the purpose of the proviso is
            to reach just such cases as are in Fayette county, and wheresoever else they may be
            found, authorizing county commissioners, where they are satisfied funds are improperly
            charged against an official, to remit the same. The fair rule is to put the State and
            the official on an equal footing. With his amendment to the bill, it should be trusted
            to the honesty and integrity of the boards of county commissioners.</p>
          <p> When he had concluded-- </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM called up the special order, being the bill [H. R. 637] to provide
            means for the construction of the new State House, which was read with the report of the
            committee as described in these reports this a. m. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE offerred a substitute for the report of the committee, levying a tax of three
            cents on each $100 for the year 1879, and a like tax for the year 1880. He said such a
            building as the proposed State House should not be completed under eight years--if
            constructed in much less time, is a 12 month thereafter it would be an unsightly
            structure. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS believed it, a desire of a great majority of the people that the State House
            shall be completed in a seasonable time. This is an opportune time to furnish work for
            laboring men ; a tax of 3 per cent is not a burdensome tax in usual times, and he could
            see no constitutional objection to the report of the committee.</p>
          <p> Mr. TREAT favored the substitute, and desired the State House completed at as early a
            day as practicable. He was conscientiously against any measure for the issuing of bonds,
            being satisfied the constitutional objection urged by the senator from Marshall [Mr.
            Reeve] was well founded. The precedent would be dangerous, unwarrantable and monstrous. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL also favored the substitute as part of the original plan on which it was
            proposed to build the State House. The promise being made that there should be no
            additional expense, as by the way of paying interest, on bonds. The constitutional
            objection was in the way of passing the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE was in favor of building such a State House as would be a credit, for
            centuries to come, but he objected to the large appropriation made in the bill. He was
            willing to vote $500,000, believing that as much as should be expanded in two years. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM believed the amendments proposed by the committee were proper and
            right. Some of the ablest constitutional lawyers in the State have decided these
            measures within the scope and meaning of that instrument, and he hoped these objections
            will not influence members to vote against the report. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON opposed the bill providing for issue of bonds, though not desiring to throw
            anything in the way of the completion of the State House. The act itself declares that
            no money shall be used except that raised by a tax-levy, and this bill is in direct
            conflict with that. An expert has testified this building should not be put up in less
            than seven years, and there is no need of hurrying this work at this time. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT believed the building would be protracted 12 or 15 years it only a 2 per
            cent, levy is made; and in that time many jobs might arise. The work should be proceeded
            within a business manner. It costs some $20,000 for yearly incidental expenses, whether
            the time be short or long, and they can not be curtailed very greatly, until the
            building is completed. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

        <p> Mr. HOPKINS called up Mr Gordon's bill [H. R. 89] touching contempts of court,
          which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD said the bill proposed to limit the amount of time by the judge for contempt
          of court, and also as to the length of time for imprisonment, shall not be for longer term
          than three months. It limits the fine to $500, and in case the fine reaches the sum of
          $50, it gives the right of appeal. He hoped the bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS opposed that part of the bill which would restrict the judge to a $500 fine; it
          seems to him it makes the limit too small, and for that reason he would be compelled to

        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Davis, would never vote for this bill, and hoped it would never become a

        <p>Mr. TULLEY said these little gifts would be an Incentive to mutiny to those who did not

          an asylum for feeble-minded children, which was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbard said such an institution as the one contemplated by this bill is much needed.
          There are over 1,000 of this unfortunate class in our State, who, if not provided for by
          an institution of this kind, are destined to remain as they long have been, not only a
          public charge and a burden to society, but a burthen that hangs with crushing weight upon
          the heart of every parent whose misfortune it is to have an idiotic or feeble minded
          child. There are 50 such institutions in the world, all of which are in the United States.
          It is proposed to locate this institution at the Soldier' Orphans' Home,
          near Knightstown. The present buildings are new and commodious, with about 56 acres of
          ground attached. He trusted the provisions of this bill are so humane that every member on
          this floor will be proud of the opportunity to cast his vote for it. You now have a grand
          privilege of extending a helping hand to these unfortunate wards of the State, and in so
          doing call down upon you the blessing of Him who hath said: " He that giveth a
          cup of water in my name to one these ' little ones' shall receive his
          reward."</p>
        <p>Mr. VANPELT doubted the propriety of opening out an institution of this kind at this time
          and he protested against it. He did not think a fool could be educated anyhow. It would be
          too expensive and he was opposed to it.</p>

          <p>Mr. HUTHSTEINER called up Mr. Gordon's insurance bill [H. R. 380] which was
            read the third time.</p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. MIERS the motion heretofore made to reconsider the vote by which
            the bill was ordered engrossed was laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN on Putnam opposed this bill because the law now in force was much better than
            the one now proposed. He was in favor of semi-annual publication of the condition of the
            companies. He would prefer quarterly publications.</p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS said it seems that some gentlemen believe a man can not be an insurance agent
            and be honest. Although he was not an insurance agent, and had no more interest in such
            companies than any other gentleman on the floor of the House, he believed it was our
            duty to do justice to foreign insurance companies as much as to any citizen of the
            State. It has been said that the law we now have is a good one. He did not think so. He
            believed a more infamous law never found its way into a statute. The state auditor has
            placed such a construction upon the present law that he collects all additional fees and
            puts them into his own pocket, paying nothing into the State treasury. None of the
            safeguards now thrown around these foreign insurance companies are removed by this bill,
            except the single one of requiring them to publish the semi-annual statement. The
            opposition to this bill is only in the interest of the newspapers. It cuts off several
            thousand dollars of their printing, and hence their strong opposition to the bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said there was always with the Legislature two lobbies--the insurance and
            the railroad. The insurance lobby was here now. If a man wants to see if he is insured
            safely he must look at the published statements of the condition of his company. There
            was not but 120 foreign insurance companies in the State, and he atributed that fact to
            the publication of the condition of the companies every six months. If they are in good
            condition they need not be afraid to publish these statements.</p>
          <p>Mr. LINDLEY said the friends of the bill under consideration seem to argue from the
            standpoint that the publication of the statements of foreign insurance companies is to
            be considered in the light of an endowment for the support of certain newspapers instead
            of a means of protection to the people. Such publication furnishes a great safeguard to
            the people from the impositions formerly practiced upon them by the many irresponsible
            agents who have filched so many hard-earned dollars from the people without rendering an
            equivalent. We hear on all hands the cry of "Hard times." the solution
            of which lies largely in the fact that for years we of the West have emptied a large
            part of our hard earned means into the laps of insurance companies of the East. He did
            not think it a hardship to compel these companies to pay back a part of these monies in
            such a manner as to protect ourselves from imposition. </p>

          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER knew large sums of money had been taken from insurance companies
            wrongfully under the present law. All he saw in this bill was that the insurance
            companies wanted to get rid of semi-annual publication of statements. Let us reject this
            bill, and then repeal the objectionable clause in the law of 1877. Under the operations
            of the previous question the bill failed to pass by yeas 10, nays 81. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER, explaining his negative vote, said he believed that under the present law
            our citizens are much better protected from loss by failure of foreign insurance
            companies than they are from insurance companies organized under our laws within our own
            State; <pb n="228" xml:id="VAA8558-17-230"/> but he did not wish to war upon them,
            especially as most of them born in the last 25 years are now sleeping the sleep that
            knows no "waking.' He only asked that the same privileges shall be
            granted to foreign insurance companies that are guaranteed by law to insurance companies
            and all other corporations organized within our own State in the matter of making
            exhibits and advertising (especially when Such privilege does not interfere with the
            revenues of the State,) viz., the right to make their own contracts on the best possible
            terms. He did not believe the interests of the people would suffer thereby,
            notwithstanding the opinion of two leading daily newspapers in this city, who have a
            $16,000 interest to the contrary.</p>

          <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM moved to reconsider the vote on the congressional apportionment bill [H.

            dilatory motions, was agreed to--yeas 56, nays 43--and the bill, under the operations of

          <p> Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. BAKER, in explanation, said: He was in favor of a fair and just apportionment to
            all parties, and so believing could not vote for this bill against his conciousness of
            what is right and wrong. He had no objections to being placed in a Republican district
            if there was any justice in this bill. He did hate to vote against his party, but could
            not sacrifice his convictions as to what is justice in this matter. He would therefore
            ask his Democratic friends to excuse him this time for voting "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. MAJOR in explanation, said: That while he should not support the bill he had
            steadily voted at every stage to bring this House to a vote on the main question,
            because he was unalterably opposed to filibustering. He believed in the right of the
            majority to rule and would hold them responsible for their actions. He therefore voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: He could not
            vote for the passage of this bill, because it was unfair, and he would not shirk his
            individual responsibility upon the Senate by voting to send an imperfect bill to that
            body for amendment. He therefore voted "no." </p>
          <p>The vote was amended as above recorded.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH the bill, [H. R. 560] for the relief of John J. Justice et al.
          late trustee of township, was read the first time. On his further motion the
          constitutional restriction was removed by yeas 38, nays 8, and the bill read the second
          time. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE opposed this bill because it provides for the issuing of a license to every
          official holding public funds, to deposit the public moneys wherever he pleases, and the
          legislature will relieve him of all loss occasioned, by the exercise of unsound judgment,
          or no judgment, or a corrupt judgment. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to indefinitely postpone this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON understood there was a just principle in this bill, and urged careful
          consideration of its provisions that injustice may not be done to any citizen of the
          State. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZ1ES insisted there was nothing right in this bill; if every tax-payer in the
          township were willing, its passage would be a dangerous precedent. He was tired of these
          legalizing and creative bills, and now was a good time to stop. </p>
        <p>Mr. SMITH, in principle, opposed indiscriminate legislation of any kind; but where loss
          has overtaken an officer, through no fraud or misconduct, and relief is sought here, it is
          well enough to grant it. Discrimination should be made in favor of parties who are
          suffering from a great in misfortune. The facts in this case, as stated in the bill and on
          this floor, are these: This man, under the advice of others, placed in a bank--the
          securest place possible--the moneys of the township. That bank failed, and he, being a
          poor man, loses the money. The only question is, whether this Legislature will aid him in
          his misfortune? It is the universal sentiment of the township where the money was lost
          that this restoration may be made to him by the Legislature. The facts in this case he
          [Mr. Smith] had been unacquainted with till a few moments ago, bat he believed in this
          case the Senate should confirm the action of the House by extending the relief asked for
          to this applicant, who he understood to be a poor man. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE believed this kind of legislation to be vicious in its consequences, because if
          these precedents are established we do not know where this thing will end. This bill comes
          in here, and in less than an hour it is endeavored to pass it into a law. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR: The Senate has again resolved itself into an appellate court. Men are
          getting in the habit of appealing from the courts to the General Assembly such legislation
          is disgraceful to the State, and it is a disgrace to put such acts on the statute books. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD favored the passage of this bill. He held no prejudice against legalizing
          legislation or releasing acts. He desired to examine each bill in the spirit of a judge
          deciding a cause. He way entirely opposed to the rule that would say all blunders or
          mistakes shall <pb n="230" xml:id="VAA8558-17-232"/> be legalized, or all responsibility
          of public officers shall be released, but this bill presents an exceptional case. The
          trustee deposited the school fund in a banks, as required by the law and by the advice of
          the county superintendent. The bank collapsed and the money was lost. The burden of this
          loss fails upon the people of one township. The people of that township petition us to
          release the trustee to pay this money. The county or the State does not lose it. The
          trustee is an aged man, and if he is compelled to pay this loss be will be financially
          ruined. The people who bear this loss ask us to grant this release. It should be done. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER knew nothing about the circumstances in this case, and deprecated a hasty
          favorable disposition of it. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE: This may be a dangerous class of legislation, but there are exceptions, and
          some senators say this is a meritorious case. </p>
        <p>The bill was referred to the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>. </p>

          <p>Pending the roll call </p>
          <p>Mr. Dice when his name was called, said he could not vote to concur, because judgment
            will only bear six per cent. into interest--if the creditor compel the lender to bring
            suit to recover his money he should receive interest at the rate of the original
            contract.</p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER in explanation said: Having done all he possibly could to get a six per cent
            law, he would accept this as the best that can be had. </p>
          <p>Mr. HART when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: Believing the
            people demand a six percent, law, but as this seems to be the only thing we can get, he
            would vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK in explanation of his vote said: He had been steadily in favor of a 6 per
            cent. law, and a law declaring that judgments shall bear the same rate of interest as
            the original contract; but considering this the best that can now be obtained, should
            vote ''aye.' </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN when his name was called, said he had done what he could to obtain a 6 per
            cent. law, because his constituency demanded it, yet as this will reduce the present
            rate 2 per cent., he would vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. WITHERBOTHAM in explanation of his vote said: He was in favor of the lowest rate
            that can be obtained, as it is impossible otherwise to renew paper about to mature, and
            pay taxes, and it is with a view to get the cheapest money possible he favored this
            measure. </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to return to the consideration of the general appropriation bill.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. URMSTON made an ineffectual motion--yeas 27, nays 19--to take up the Metropolitan
            Police bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend the motion [Mr. Harris'] by substituting the State
            House bill, which motion was agreed to by consent. </p>
          <p>Mr LANGDON offered a resolution declaring that for more than a year past there has been
            a surplus in the State Treasury of $250,000, etc, and referring the bill H. R. 637 to a
            special committee of three with instructions to report a substitute appropriating
            $20O,000 of said surplus, for 1879, and levying a tax of 2 per cent. for the years 1879
            and 1880, for State House purposes. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE stated there is no surplus in the treasury--the apprehension grows out of the
            way the books are kept. There is but one State in the union that levies a lower tax than
            Indiana. He submitted a mass of figures to show the importance of adopting his amendment
            to this bill proposed yesterday. </p>
          <p>Mr LANDON understood from the monthly statements setting forth that there is a cash
            balance in the treasury, that there is actually there the amounts of cash represented by
            these reports to be there. Running back over a space of two years, according to the
            published statements, there has never been for an hour less than $400,000 in money in
            the public treasury of the State. Of this sum his resolution proposed to devote $200,000
            to the purposes of building the State House. He favored the plan of paying as you go,
            especially when we have a treasury full and overflowing. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE addressed his remarks to the constitutional objection to the bill under
            consideration, regarding it as well founded. </p>
          <p>Mr. TREAT also regarded the proposition to raise money by the issuing of bonds as
            unconstitutional. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS was authorized by the treasurer of state to say that, $200,000 may he
            appropriated and can be paid into the State House fund from time to time this year. He
            offered an amendment increasing the levy from 2 to 3 per cent. for 1879 and for 1880. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT thought it clear that unless this work is prosecuted as it should be, the
            commissioners had batter be instructed to close their office and cover up the
            foundations of the State House. This difference of opinion as to what amount of money is
            in the treasury does not probably amount to much. He hoped the building would be
            proceeded with in a business-like way--not too hasty, and yet not so slow as that it
            shall so out that this great State is not able to build a State House. He would not ask
            for an unreasonable tax to hurry on this building. He moved that the bill and pending
            amendments be referred to a special committee.</p>

        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER a had never dodged any vote, but was willing to, and did go on the record.
          The important measures of this General Assembly had been put through on his motions.
          Nothing but political measures had absorbed the attention of the majority in this House
          thus far, and when he now offered a resolution in opposition to an extra session gentlemen
          get up here and talk about demagoguery. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH: said this looked to him like a tempest in a tea pot and he did not think this
          resolution had anything to do in calling an extra session. He would vote for it under
          protest.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Th House agreed to suspend the rule by yeas 51, nays 30, and Mr. Overmeyer's
          resolution was then read as follows: </p>

              <p> Whereas, There is no necessity for a special session; therefore </p>
              <p>Resolved by the House, the Senate concurring. That it is the duty of the General

        <p>The SPEAKER ruled the resolution out of order, as the subject matter was not within the
          purview of this House. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER and Mr. GOLDEN appealed from the decision of the chair.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The decision of the chair was sustained by yeas 58, nays 37. </p>
        <p>The <orgName> judiciary committee</orgName> returned the bill [H. R. 591] regulating the
          granting of divorce, recommending passage which report was concurred in, and the bill
          ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, submitted the report of the special <orgName>committee of
            conference on the disagreement between the two Houses</orgName>, in the matter of
          interest on the use or forbearance of money. It recommends that the House recede from its
          amendment to the interest bill, <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_277">S. 277</ref>. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH did not think that 8 per cent. was a sufficient reduction. He did not see that
          there was much to be gained by the passage of this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREY said the opposition to the 6 per cent. interest clause came from the
          Republican side of the House. The House committee got all they could in their conference.
          He thought this bill better than the old law. </p>
        <p>Mr. MITCHELL said in this report there was a compromise that was not right. He wanted to
          hold out as he began for a six per cent. law. </p>
        <p>Mr. REED said the question was: Do we prefer this bill reported by the
            <orgName>conference committee</orgName> to the old law? He expressed his preference for
          the bill, and hoped the report would be concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT said the re port emasculated every feature in the bill that recommended it to
          the people. He thought there should be no compromise. and he thought that the House ought
          not to back down, and for one he did not intend to. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAILEY said this was an improvement of the old law. It becomes our duty as
          representatives to do the best we could, and he was in favor of concurring in the report
          of the committee.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The report of the committee was then concurred in by--yeas 76, nays 22. </p>

          representative purposes, with amendments. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. 0VERMEYER, the amendments proposed by the <orgName>conference

        <p> The <orgName>committee on drains and dykes</orgName> returned the bill [S. 17] for the

          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS called up the bill [H. R. 486] for congressional apportionment, which
            failed to pass yesterday for want of a constitutional majority. </p>
          <p>Mr OVERMEYER demanded a call of the House. The call proceeded until--</p>
          <p> Mr. BRIGGS moved that further proceedings under the call be dispensed with. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to lay the motion upon the table, and on that, motion he demanded
            the yens and nays, which, being taken, resulted, yeas 23, nays 59; so the motion was
            rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. Brigg's motion that further proceedings under the call be dispensed With,
            was then agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER (under a unanimous agreement that a half hour should be devoted to the
            discussion of this bill, and then it should go without objection to its final passage),
            said. The passing of this bill now is simply revolutionary, and would allow an
            apportionment of the State every two years, There was never a more ridiculous
            apportionment made than the one proposed in this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON wanted to speak for himself and for no party. He did not think the
            Democratic party had a fair representation in the last apportionment by the Republican
            party. The apportionment proposed in this bill he denounced most infamous. He did not
            expect a worse apportionment than the one made by Republicans years ago, and was sorry
            to have to say that this one is the most unjust of the two. </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON desired to make a personal explanation as well as to sustain his party. He
            defied any one to point a finger to the time or word when he had censured his party for
            this apportionment. Neither the newspapers nor the Democratic party could dig a
            political grave for him. It takes now under the Republican gerrymandering of the State
            53,000 Democrats to elect one congressman and but 23,000 Republicans. This bill was not
            his choice for an apportionment, and he withheld his vote from it until he had obtained
            the promise of senators that the bill would be amended in certain objectionable
            particulars. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER said as to the apportionment bill now under consideration, he did not have
            words of sufficient condemnation to express himself, and he would surrender. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS hoped after this discussion there would be the best of feeling, and if this
            thing goes on much longer he would call for the passage of the military bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said he could not have the boldness to denounce the Democratic party,
            individually or collectively, as infamous, and he was surprised to hear any one denounce
            the Republican party for making an apportionment that requires 53,000 Democrats to elect
            one congressman when this bill takes 60,000 Republicans to elect one congressman. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam would vote for the bill now, believing that the Senate would amend
            it. and for the reason that he wanted a fair redistricting of the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS said it seemed to him that this bill was much more fair than the one of
            1872. Take the two maps together and this bill to-day is white and pure beside the other </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT: It was at first difficult to make up his mind as to this apportionment bill,
            and he did not know but he was getting in favor of irregular lines; but comparad with
            the one now in operation it looked rather favorable. </p>
          <p>The bill then passed the House by--yeas 54, nays 46--as follows:</p>

        <p> On motion by Mr. KAHLO the bill [H. R. 395] for the relief of the estate of John T.
          Bishop and other sureties on the bond of a late township trustee was taken up, and under a
          dispensation or the constitutional restriction--yeas 41, nays 1--the bill was read by
          title only for the second reading. The third time by sections, and passed the Senate by
          yeas 34 nays 7. </p>
        <p>Messrs. HARRIS, URMSTON and COFFEY, explaining their negative votes; While sympathizing
          with those seeking relief, they could not violate the principle which compelled opposition
          to this class of legislation. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. GRUBBS the House substitute for his bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_065">[S. 65]</ref> defining libel, was read. He said the bill as
          originally introduced embraced largely the old common law idea. The substitute proposed by
          the House is too strict, and rigid in its terms. He moved that the Senate refuse to concur
          in the House amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES was clearly of opinion the bill as originally passed the Senase is going as
          far as this tate is prepared to go in this direction at this time. It is unwise now to
          depart from the old common law rule </p>
        <p>The Senate refused to concur in the substitute proposed by the House of Representatives </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE the House amendments to the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_399">[S. 399] </ref>to provide for submitting the constitutional amendments to a vote of the
          people, were read and concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE explained: The House amendments do not materially affect the bill as it passed
          the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the general
          appropriation bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE moved to amend by substituting the bill 286. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES believed from the necessity of circumstances that the General Assembly should
          have from seven to 10 days more to consider the important measures now so near perfected.
          Many members seem to be afraid to avow their sentiments upon this subject, but he was
          willing to assume the responsibility of any vote or action that will bring it about. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS thought there were but two or three bills necessary to be passed, and then the
          State will not suffer, even if the fee and salary bill should not be perfected. He
          insisted on the consideration of the appropriation bills and other necessary measures at
          once, so as to do away with the need of a special session.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS understood this vote will be a test, vote as to whether there shall be a
          special seesion, or whether the Senate will proceed to take up the few important measures
          pending and dispose of them before the session expires by the limitation of time. He was
          not in favor of a special session; did not believe the people of the State want it, but
          insisted on taking up the more important measures and disposing of them, and then working
          to-night, all day to-morrow and to-morrow night as best we can. The general appropriation
          bill will not take long as he understood it. He hoped this would be taken as a test vote,
          so it may be seen who are in favor of a special session.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE replied at length, defending his party friends from any blame that may attach
          because of the necessity for an extra session. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM the bill [H. R. 640] making specific appropriations for the
          purposes therein named, was read the first time and referred to the <orgName>committee on
            finance</orgName>. </p>
        <p>After several ineffectual motions to take up as many different bills, favored by the
          movers thereof--</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. DICE the bill [H. R. 126] touching foreign corporations and providing
            certain acts thereof shall work forfeiture preventing foreign corporations from
            transferring suits from the State to foreign courts, nor <pb n="235" xml:id="VAA8558-17-237"/> commence suits against citizens of this State in the Federal
            courts, was read the first time. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES stated the bill was drawn in conformity with a decision of the supreme
            court;the bill in effect saying if these corporations seek to drag citizens hundreds of
            miles to assert their rights in the courts the companies shall forfeit their right to do
            business in the State. If they do business here they must stand on the same footing with
            citizens of the State and submit their differences with citizens to the decision of our
            State courts. </p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. DICE the constitutional restriction was dispensed with--yeas 46, nays
            2--the bill read by title only for the second reading, read the third time and passed
            the Senate by yeas 47, nays 1. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE explained his negative vote--fearing the bill is left so as to produce a
            conflict of jurisdiction. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON submitted a report from the select committee thereon, returning the State
            House bill[H. R. 639] with amendments appropriating $200,000 for construction purposes,
            to be used in the year 1879--$100,000 before May 1, and $100,000 before August 1, 1879,
            and proposing a tax of 3 per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT understood this draft can be made on the treasury without crippling it.
            Money must be appropriated to carry on this building, or it must be stopped altogether. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved to reduce the proposed levy from "three" to
            "two" cents. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved, as a substitute, an amendment, providing a levy or two cents for 1879
            and three cents for 1880. Whenever the attempt is made to increase taxation, it ought to
            be carefully and judiciously made. He desired to gradually increase the tax, so that, by
            the time the Legislature meets in 1881, $600,000 may have been expended on the work.</p>
          <p> The substitute was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to substitute an amendment which would appropriate $100,000 for 1879,
            $200,000 for 1880, and make the levy "two" per cent. He believed this
            would meet the requirement, of the State House commissioners. The levy proposed will
            produce probably $160,000 for these years. Suppose there is a reassessment; it would
            bring down the revenue, but conceding that the State can not afford to make too large an
            appropriation, he would not make an extravagant appropriation. He was a friend to the
            State House measure now, though doing all he could hist session to defeat the
            commencement of it. This will be all the money the commissioners should ask for. By the
            1st of May there will be derived from revenue $80,000, and by the 1st of November
            $80,000, which, added to the $100,000 he proposed, will make $610,000 for the two years,
            and that is al1 they can conveniently dispose of. The Legislature should not levy more
            than a two cent tax. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON could not understand why senators insist on appropriating but $100,000,
            when it is universally admitted that there is $200,000 lying idle in the treasury. Now,
            while labor and material is cheap,it is proper, and we have resolved that this
            construction should go on. If there is delay, prices will go up. The idle money is
            bringing no interest to the State. Then why not use it where it is so much needed? He
            insisted the best plan is set forth in the amendments reported by the committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT said the first story should be put up this year, the joists put on and
            covered over, so as to keep it protected from the weather, and the lumber should be
            bought, whether anything else is done or not. It will cost $330,000 to carry the work up
            to the joists on the first story. The report contemplates $100,000 from the tax levy and
            $200,O0O from the general fund, and still there would be a shortage of $30,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL demanded the previous question, which was seconded and put under its
            operation, and on a division of the question. the first proposition on the appropriation
            was rejected by yeas 12, nays 34; the second proposition for a levy of 2 per cent. was
            also rejected by yeas 11, nays 36. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON moved to amend by striking out all that part making the expenditure of
            $200,000 in 1879 imperative. He said the State House Commission have a duty to perform,
            and the time as to when this fund shall be expended should be left to them. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENVIES thought this is the time to purchase iron. which is about to rise, and to
            Handicap the contractors would be an unworthy net on the part of the State. This report
            meets the approval of the State House commissioners. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL said there seemed to be an effort here to aid the contractors more than
            they had a right to expect. In two years hence, if this is done, they will ask the
            Legislature to give them still farther advantage.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER hoped the appropriation of $200,000 to be expended this year, will not
            prevail. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

          <p>The amendment [Mr. Urmston's] was rejected by yeas 12, nays 33.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER moved to amend sec. 2 by reducing the amount appropriated for 1879, from
            $200,000 to $100,000.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD opposed delay in building the State House. It should be completed at the
            earliest time that will give the State a substantial structure. He was willing to vote
            money enough to carry out this object, believing that delay will remit in a loss to the
            State and a large expendtiure of money that is not now contemplated. It is estimated
            that four years is required to complete the State House. If it takes a longer time it
            will be because we do not appropriate money enough to speedily construct the building.
            Labor and materials are cheap, cheaper than they will be in the future. The Springfield
            State House is an example of delay. The extra cost to the people of Illinois through
            delay in appropriations of sufficient money to carry on the work exceeded all claims as
            to its cost. The State will save money and get a better building by completing it in the
            next four years.</p>
          <p> The amendment was rejected.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The report of the committee as amended was concurred in by yeas 32, nays 13.</p>
          <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication from the governor
            transmitting the following appointments: For president of the boards of trustees of the
            Institutions the Insane, Deaf and Dumb and Blind--John Fishback, to serve till February
            1,1883. For trustees of the Insane Hospital--B. F. Spann, till February 1, 1883, and R.
            H Tarlton,till February 1,1881. For trustees of the Institution for the Deaf and
            Dumb--F. O. Johnson, till 1 February 1, 1883, and Milton James, till February 1, 1883.
            For trustees of the Blind Asylum--Joseph Ristine, till February 1, 1883, and William V.
            Wiles till February 1, 1881. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved to refer these nominations to the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
              Institutions</orgName>. He said in his opinion the Senate should exercise a sound
            discretion in consenting to such appointments. In general terms he was in favor of the
            Governor appointing and the Senate confirming such appointments, but he made this motion
            in order that he might, when the proper time comes, submit some reasons why some of the
            persona named in the message should be appointed, and why others should not be
            appointed, and <pb n="236" xml:id="VAA8558-17-238"/> for that reason he hoped the motion
            to refer these nominations to the committee would prevail. </p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. MENZIES this motion to refer was laid. on the table by yeas 24, nays

            nominations were confirmed by yeas 30, nays 15. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL--yeas 25, nays 24--the congressional apportionment bill [H. R.
            486] was taken up and read the second time, with the majority and minority reports
            thereon--the former proposing amendments, and the latter deeming it impolitic to
            reapportion the State this year, in view of the new census to be taken next year, under
            which Indiana will be entitled to additional representation in Congress, which will
            require a new apportionment in 1881 by the next General Assembly. The minority report
            closes by recommending the in definite postponement of the bill, or if a new
            apportionment is to be made this session, that a special committee of five be
            appointed--two each from the Democratic and Republican, and one from the National
            party--to adopt a new bill. The report is signed by Messrs. Harris, Comstock, Olds,
            Smith, Taylor and Mercer.</p>

        <p>Mr. SLEETH thought this bill unequal and unjust, as it discriminates in favor of Marion

        <p>Mr. HUBBARD thought it looked like there was a personal spite in this matter somewhere. </p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY said this bill takes the control of the road out of the hands of the company
          and places it under the control of the county commissioners. He thought it was one of the

          <p> Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, called up his bill [H. R. 254] to protect the purity of the
            ballot-box, which was read the third time. He said it was to protect the growing evil of
            influencing elections with money, and to define a method for the printed ballot. The
            object of the present law is to allow a secret ballot, and by a law prescribing the
            method, this can be better secured.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH said no gentleman would go further than he to guard the purity of the
            ballot box. If the tickets shall exceed the width prescribed, the man that votes it will
            be liable to a prosecution therefor under the provision of this bill. It was one of the
            most iniquitous measures he ever saw. The bill prescribes that the paper upon which the
            ballot is printed shall be sized and he did not know what sized paper was, and therefore
            did not know whether his vote would be legal or not.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD: If ever there was a bill calculated to open fraud in elections, it was the
            bill before us to-day. You could never arrive at the certainty of a fair election with
            such a law as this. He did not want to open the door any farther for fraud at the
            elections. He hoped it would not pass.</p>
          <p> Mr. MITCHELL thought the tickets could be printed within an appropriate width, and was
            in favor of the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS said that even if the objection was a technical one it was a good one. Every
            law should be plain and enforced. If the ticket is not to be prescribed in the bill it
            ought not to be encumbered therewith. There were portions of the bill he would like to
            vote for, and others that he could not endorse. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE said this bill was too stringent for the trickster politician, and he sup
            posed it would be. It was to prevent the voter being deceived with the posters or other
            tricks used to defraud the voter. It strikes off the shackles that have so long hung
            around the ballot and makes it free. It would stop the indiscriminate use of money to
            influence voters. </p>

          <p> The <orgName>select committee</orgName> thereon returned the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_207">[S. 207]</ref> for determining and allowing claims with
            the amendments as instructed by the House. The report was concurred in and. the
            amendments ordered engrossed.</p>
          <p> The rules being suspended for the purpose,</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. MIERS the amendments were considered engrossed and the bill read
            the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT said in his judgment there was a cat in the meal tub. He did not like the
            style it got in here. He believed the Legislature fully competent to sit upon the claims
            against the State. He thought the bill ought to be rejected at once.</p>
          <p> Mr. DRAKE thought it was taking the power from the body that ought to pass upon all
            claims against the State. This bill would open the door for fraud and corruption.</p>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, was opposed to the bill. Ever since a commission was
            constituted to sit upon and determine, a president that was not elected he was opposed
            to a commission. Unless we give proper attention to claims here the necessity would come
            for a court of claims. For this reason he objected. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON thought there was more behind it than the friends hold up. A gentleman had
            approached him and asked that if he did not say anything in its favor for his sake not
            to oppose it. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS had failed in the examination of the bill to see any tiling to justify what
            had been said against this bill. It makes the State officers the commissioners of
            claims, and does not cost the State anything. This bill ought to pass. All claims must
            be certified to before the Legislature will allow it. Nothing could be fairer. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON had a slight objection to this bill. It would allow judgments to be piled
            up mountain high, which would never be set aside until there would be an appropriation
            made for that purpose. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said if there was anything covered up in this bill that was
            wrong he would not support it, but he regarded it as one of the important measures
            before the test of worth more to the State than any measure. He regarded it as a bill
            that would prevent fraudulent claims being allowed. </p>
          <p>Mr. CONNER believed there would be large expense attending the operation of such a
            measure, and he should vote against the bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. FANCHER thought that claims against the State ought to be brought before the
            representatives of the State. It would be much easier to lobby a claim through a
            commission of two men than a commission of 100. He believed the bill unjust and ought
            not to be passed.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Under the operations of the previous question the bill failed to pass--yeas 28, nays

          <p>Mr. MITCHELL called up his bill [H. R. 629] repealing the act of March 3, 1877, in
            relation to township elections, which was read the third time and failed to pass--yeas
            36, nays 58. </p>
          <p>Mr. NAVE called up the bill [S. 140] to authorize the surrender of city charters, which
            was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess said there was no law by which a city charter can be dissolved,
            and this law makes this provision. If a city desires to dissolve its charter he thought
            there should be some law to authorize it to do so. </p>
          <p>Mr. BLOCKLEY had never been solicited in this matter, and had never even received
            letters on the subject, and if the citizens of Mount Vernon wanted this bill parsed he
            would have been informed of it without doubt.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.237 in BLR-->
          <p> The bill passed by--yeas 76, nays 15.</p>
          <p> Mr. OSBORNE, of Vermillion, called up the bill [H. R. 439] to legalize certain sales
            and conveyances, made by various county auditors of the State to secure the payment of
            loans made from the common school fund. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS was opposed to legalizing as long as the courts are the place for this
            business. This kind of legislation is dangerous, and we ought not to engage in it. </p>
          <p>Mr. TULLEY could see no objection to this bill, and he hoped it would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH doubted the propriety of passing such a bill.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill failed to pass--yeas 25, nays 62. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER called up his bill [H. R. 75] to limit appeals to the supreme court,when
            the amount in controversy, exclusive of costs, exceeds $200, and must be taken within
            six <pb n="238" xml:id="VAA8558-17-240"/> months from the time the judgment was
            rendered, which was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. TULLEY thought the bill would work hardships in cities and towns. The principle
            involved in a controversy is just as sacred if the amount is less than $200 as if it
            were $1,000. His judgment was this bill ought not to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. FANCHER said the fact that the supreme court is behind is no argument in favor of
            this bill. No man should be prohibited from coming into the supreme court. He thought
            the bill should not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER said this bill was wrong and ought not to pass </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS was opposed to this bill. It was just as important for the settlement of a
            principle where the amount in controversy was small as where it was large. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT said there was another side to this question. If you had a horse killed by
            the railroad, you have to go to the supreme court for redress, and it would work hard to
            the poor man who had not the money to take his case into the supreme court.</p>
          <p> Mr. THAYER: The fact is, that corporations or rich man who can carry their cases to
            the supreme court have the advantage over the poor man who can not pay lawyers'
            fees. He thought the interests of the people were just as safe in the lower courts as in
            the supreme court. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH was opposed to the bill because the poor man is compelled to pay his tax,
            and this bill would close the door of justice against him. He should have as equal
            chance, though his claim does not amount to $200. </p>

            counties before the board of county commissioners and the adjudication of the same,
            which was read the third time.</p>

        <p>It was adopted by yeas 34, nays 13. </p>
        <p>Pending the roll call-- </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE protested against this action, because it declares there is time enough to
          consider the appropriation bill. He believed there is not time to properly consider it,
          and that the attempt is a political measure of certain interested parties to force on the
          statute an unjust and ill considered law and who until now have forced off its
          consideration. Therefore he voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, when his name was called, protested that we have not time to act upon the
          appropriation bills and also pass a fee and salary bill at the regular session, and
          believing that this resolution is moved for the purpose of preventing legislation upon the
          subject of fees and salaries, he voted " no." </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER, also obtained leave to file his protest, knowing that we have not sufficient
          time to act on the appropriation bill, and believing this to be an attempt to prevent
          legislation on fees and salaries. He voted "no." </p>
        <p>These protests, on motion of the senators making them, were severally ordered spread upon
          the journal. </p>
        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above, and accrdingly-- </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 492] an act making appropriations for the expenses of the State
          Government and its institutions, directing the object to which such appropriations shall
          be applied, requiring public accounts to be kept by the fiscal years of the State, and
          repealing inconsistent laws, was read the second time, with a report from the finance
          committee recommending its passage, with amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to concur in the report, of the committee, in lieu of which, on motion
          of Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, it was agreed that each amendment proposed by the commitee should be
          separately considered. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON made an ineffectual motion--yeas 21, nays 25--to strike out the amendment
          allowing the governor a clerk at a salary of $800. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced (at 11 o'clock--on the demand of Mr. Burrell)
          the special order [H. R. 486] the Congressional apportionment bill. </p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS moved to set aside the special order. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.239 in BLR-->
        <p>Mr. BURRELL made an ineffectual motion--yeas 22, nays 27--to lay this motion on the
          table.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The motion to set aside the special order was agreed to by yeas 27. nays 22.</p>
        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the committee amendments to the bill shall be first
          considered, and then the bill will be open for further amendment.</p>
        <p> The committee amendment increasing the salary of the secretary of state's
          deputy from $1,000 to $1,500 being read-- </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES favored the amendment because the people complain only of the burden imposed
          by local taxation; they do not complain of the State tax. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE opposed raising the salaries of State officers in the general appropriation
          bill, as contrary to what is just and right; if they must be increased let it be done in
          an act especially embracing that subject, and that alone. Any increase of salaries in this
          bill is contrary to the fee and salary law of 1875, and should not be permitted. </p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ said that Republican Senators were all the time talking about fees and salaries.
          If they want a fee and salary bill, in the name of God why didn't they introduce
          one long ago? We were here sixty days, and they never said a word about it, and now that
          we are very near adjourning, they don't talk about anything else. He was getting
          tired of it. They have always kept quiet about fees and salaries while they were in power,
          but <pb n="240" xml:id="VAA8558-17-242"/> now the Democrats have the power, they are in
          favor of cutting down fees and salaries. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER favored a reduction of salaries all along the line, and was astonished to see
          his party friends favoring an increase. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON moved to amend by splitting the difference--making the salary $1,200. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, it was rejected. </p>
        <p>Om motion by Mr. STREIGHT, a recess of 10 minutes was taken to allow members an
          opportunity of an introduction to General Robert H. Milroy.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The committee amendment, increasing the salary from $1,000 to $1,500, was rejected by--
          yeas 21, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess until 2 o' clock. </p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication from the governor
            nominating Mrs. Emily A. Roache as manager of the Female Prison and Reformatory. Also
            Finley Bigger, of Rash county, and L. A. Barnett, of Hendrick's county, as
            commissioners of the House of Refuge. Also John P. Earley, of Laport county, and. Robert
            D. Brown, of Dearborn county, each to same, four years; and B. F. Ibach, of Huntington
            county, as trustees for the Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, to serve the two years. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, these nominations were severally confirmed by the Senate.</p>
          <p>The Senate then returned to the consideration of the general appropriation bill [H. R.
            592]. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM then moved that the amendments proposed by the committee on finance be
            adopted as a whole, and demanded the previous question, which was seconded by yeas--27,
            nays 21. Under its operation the report was adopted by--yeas 27, nays 22. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call, in seconding the demand for the previous question. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE submitted the following: As a representative of 60,000 people, whose social,
            political and financial condition are to be affected materially affected, and, in any
            event, a pecuniary burden is being placed on them, which ought to. be made as light as
            possible, and they are entitled to be heard, and by this order of the previous question
            all consideration is cut off, and the vote is forced on senators who have no practical
            knowledge of the provisions of this bill. He protested against the action of the
            majority in forcing action without consideration, under the previous question, as
            tyranical, unjust, in violation of the rights of the people and their representatives,
            as an abuse of parliamentary power, dangerous alike to individual and national liberty
            in its final consequences, and not as an approval or rejection of the bill as a whole or
            a part, but that he may not vote for what ought not to pass He voted "no
            " </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER looked upon this as a most infamous scheme to override the voice of senators
            and prevent a full consideration of how the people's money shall be voted away.
            The first and only section of the bill or report considered shows that in the very
            outset salaries were to be increased. And the committee, finding that the Senate would
            not sustain it in its "fee and salary raising," it now undertakes by a
            "gag" to close the mouths of senators, and put the report through
            under the previous question, which prevents any senator on the floor knowing how much of
            the people's money they are voting away, excepting the seven senators
            constituting the finance committee. He voted "no." </p>
          <p>The above protests were ordered spread upon the journal on motion of their authors. </p>
          <p>Pending the roll call on adopting the amendments reported by the committee on finance
            as a whole (the Senate acting under the operations of the previous question)--</p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE, in explanation of his vote, said it was a burning shame that the
            "gag" law (the previous question) should be demanded on so important a
            question as this on one of the most important matters that has come before the
            Legislature our mouths are shut, they are closed. He knew not how to vote, nor did but
            few senators on the floor know but little about this bill, yet the gag law is placed
            upon their mouths. He voted "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. F0STER, when his name was called, said it looked like the gag law was brought in
            here to stop the mouths of senators because the leaders here was not satisfied with the
            intention of the Senate to consider this bill by sections so it may understand what it
            is doing. It was infamous, a burning shame and a disgrace to the Democratic party to
            permit such a thing to be done. He voted "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. BOWLER in explanation of his vote said he suggested that course to the chairman of
            the finance committee [Mr. Winterbotham] he had confidence in the intelligence of the
            committee, and would vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS when his name was called, said it is proper that senators should have
            opportunity to carefully investigate the provisions of this bill. Judging by the items
            read, this bill proposes an increase of salaries probably 50 per cent., and he would
            like to understand what is in the balance of the bill, therefore he would rein senators
            in the other [Democratic] side of the chamber and vote "no."</p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS in explanation of his vote said: Beleiving every senator should act
            advisably on every question, and as that can not be done by voting for these amendments
            as a whole, he was compelled to vote "no,"</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS, when his name was called said: Two years ago three days were spent on a
            similar bill, and the oppositions were increased rather than diminished, and as the
            session is fast drawing to a close he was justified in voting "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. HART, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: This is
            altogether too important a measure to be put through under the gag law under any
            consideration whatever. He did not think, outside of the committee on finance, there is
            a senator on this floor who understood what he is voting or or against; and to put this
            bill through because we are on the eve of the close of the session is not a justifiable
            excuse for doing so without any consideration at all, and therefore he voted
            "no."</p>
          <p> Mr. KEMP, in explanation of his vote, said he was satisfied the finance committee can
            perfect this appropriation bill better than the whole senate, therefore he had no
            hesitancy in voting "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS, when his name was called, said if these amendments were considered separately
            it will be impossible to pass this bill this session, and believing it better to vote
            for the bill as reported by the committee, and thus pass it, believing a general
            discussion would end in no good, but make a large expense to the State of Indiana, he
            would vote 'aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said: Were he placed in a position where he could
            close the mouths of those acting for others, so as to prevent their considering the
            issues financial, social or political, affecting those for whom they act, and he should
            do so, he should consider himself a miserable, contemptible coward, deserving to be
            kicked out of an organization where the rights of others are decided. He voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. RILEY,when his name was called said: Having entire confidence in the ability of the
            finance committe, he should vote "aye."</p>
          <pb n="241" xml:id="VAA8558-17-243"/>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER, in explanation of his vote, said he could not support this measure from.
            the fact he did not know what the amendment in the report contained. He invariably
            desired to understand what he was voting for, and as he did not know what would be
            involved in an affirmative vote on this question he was compelled to vote
            "no."</p>
          <p> Mr. SHIRK, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: Believing the
            great importance of this bill demanded a full and fair consideration; and believing that
            in many cases the appropriations made in it are entirely too large for the purposes for
            which they are intended, and that a reduction should be made in many of the
            appropriations, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: The people
            complain, with good cause, that the Legislature invariably postpones the consideration
            of the bill appropriating the people's money till the last hours of the
            session, and then it is passed through without one consideration, after thousands of
            dollars being voted away on the say so of seven men. He had confidence in the Senate
            committee, but 100 men in the other House have carefully considered the appropriations
            made in this bill, and as seven men of the committee have seen fit to change the
            amounts, it would be wrong to say these seven men are right and the 100 are wrong. He
            therefore voted, "no," hoping the Senate would consider the various
            appropriations proposed, item by item. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD said: This bill is very important to the people, because hundreds of thousands
            of dollars are taken from their pockets through its provisions. It is bad policy and bad
            leadership to force this important bill through this Senate under the gag of the
            previous question without any scrutiny or debate. We are only agents of the people, and
            if his agent should adjust all bills for two years without examining them at all, he
            should discharge that agent as an unsafe business man. The people, therefore, should
            discharge us for doing the same thing. He has confidence in the finance committee, but
            wanted to know the result of their deliberations. He would feel that he had done a
            dishonest thing, and would go back to his constituents disgraced if he voted in the dark
            to disburse over $1,000,000, without any examination whatever, or without ever hearing
            the bill read. As many Republicans as Democrats voted for this bill in the dark, and the
            blame must be borne equally between them. He voted "No." </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he had the
            honor of assisting in making up this report, and, with a few exceptions, fully concurred
            in the action of the committee; but, believing that every bill which appropriates money
            out of the State treasury should receive a fair and open discussion, and that no money
            should be appropriated from the State treasury until the measure is fully, openly and
            fairly discussed, he voted "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said he was anxious
            to vote for this bill to carry on the Government of the State, but desired to do so with
            that propriety and judgment which would enable him to act with justice to himself and
            the people who sent him here. He had high respect for and great confidence in the
            senators composing the committee, which considered and proposed amendments to this bill,
            but having to be guided by his own judgment in voting, he can not vote for these
            amendments without knowing what is in them. Then, again, senators on this floor, having
            legislative experience, say that large sums of money have been voted away at the close
            of the session, without due consideration. In some cases they have been astonished when
            charged with voting for some appropriation, and would not believe it till they went to
            the journal and found their votes recorded in favor of it. It is the last straw that
            breaks the earners back; therefore, with this experience of legislators who have gone
            before him, in order to keep from voting in total ignorance of the provisions embodied
            in this report, he was neccessarily compelled to vote "no " </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: This bill
            came into the committee's hands but a short time ago, and every moment the
            committee could spare has been given to the careful consideration of this bill, for the
            purpose of presenting it in a shape that would receive the almost unanimous approval of
            the Senate. The committee did not wish to force the bill on the Senate, but day before
            yesterday it was made a special order, when he endeavored to bring it before the Senate;
            but, instead, legalizing acts were called up, and the consequence was, action on this
            bill had been deferred until the present time. He had endeavored to bring this bill
            before the Senate every day since it was reported from the committee, but had been
            unsuccessful till now. Unless this bill is acted upon at this time, and speedily, an
            extra session becomes necessary, and the question turns on this: shall we adopt this
            bill or have an extra session? He made this movement on purpose, on purpose to prevent
            the necessity for an extra session. He voted "no." </p>
          <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded, so the amendments proposed
            to the general appropriation bill by the finance committee were adopted as a whole. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, the bill as a whole was adopted, without a division,
            after an ineffectual motion to amend it, by Mr. HEFRON, that the bill be read and
            considered by sections.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS moved that the constitutional rule, intended to restrain hasty legislation,
            be dispensed with, that the bill may be read the third time now and put on its passage. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion was rejected--yeas 30, nays 17--for want of the two-thirds majority required
            by the constitution, after an ineffectual motion by Mr. REEVE--yeas 18, nays 30--to lay
            the motion [Mr. Harris'] on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM moved that the order of business be dispensed with, that the

          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to amend by taking up the bill [H. R. 344] to regulate fees and
            salaries.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> This motion was agreed to by yeas 27, nays 11, and the fee and salary bill [H. R. 314]
            was taken up. The amendments reported by the Senate committee were read [being largely
            embraced in the bill S. 424--Mr. Briscoe's.] </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE moved that the report be considered by sections.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOLLEN hoped the report will not be concurred in. It is expected by the people
            that we will begin at the beginning and scale down where the salaries are now too high.
            This is a subject that will require a great deal of time, and could best be considered
            before a special committee of five. He made that motion, connected with instructions to
            the committee to report Monday at 10 o'clock. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER opposed the motion. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT favored the reference to a committee. It would be much wiser to engage in
            legislation that will bring about some result. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE also favored reference. [On his motion a short recess was taken, for the

        <p>Mr. HESS had a large number of taxpayers of the city upon a petition asking that this

        <!--P.242 in BLR-->
        <p>The bill then failed to pass, for want of a constitutional majority--yeas 47, nays 39. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBESON called up the bill <ref target="#SB_1879_01_09_039">[S. 39]</ref> authorizing
          railroad companies to extend their lines and change the termini thereof, which was read
          the third time.</p>
        <p> Mr. GORDON thought this bill would trample upon the rights of the people. He was sure
          our railroad law was liberal enough, and he was opposed to extending the power of
          corporations. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD was for the material and substantial good of the people, and if a railroad
          wants to go five miles further, let it go. This bill allows the company to extenh their
          roads in a direct line. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS said he thought this was a good bill, and he hoped it would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS said this bill ought to pass as he thought it was in the interest of the
          people. </p>
        <p>Mr. SCHWEITRER thought the bill should pass. The people of his county wanted such a bill,
          in order that they might build another line of road, thereby securing to them cheaper
          freight on coal, etc. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON did not want to make a captious objection to this bill. The people were not
          asking for this bill, it was the railroads; and the railroads of this State were mostly in
          the hands of foreign corporations. </p>
        <p>Mr. HOPKINS thought it could do no harm, and ought to pass.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill then passed the House by yeas 83,nays 9. </p>

          in the contested election case of Drake vs. Bearss was withdrawn. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, the motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> The amendments of the Senate to the bill [H. R. 637] for the construction of the new
          State House, being read-- </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to concur in the amendments, with an amendment adding an emergency
          clause. He said that the Senate had stricken out all of the House bill after the enacting
          clause and inserted new matter that a levy shall be made for the years 1879 and 1880 of
          three cents on the $100, and that there shall be appropriated from the treasury for the
          year 1879, $200,000, to be used for the erection of the new State House.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS was opposed to taxing the people more now than was necessary. He was <pb n="243" xml:id="VAA8558-17-245"/> in favor of borrowing money at a low rate of interest,
          to bridge over the hard times. </p>
        <p>Mr. STUCKER was opposed to this bill as it passed the House, and he so voted. Now it has
          come back from. the Senate with amendments fixing a levy of three per cent. The hard times
          and heavy taxes now imposed on the people was enough. He thought it time to call a halt,
          and would enter his protest against any and all acts of this House that will add one
          additional cent to the taxes already imposed on the people. He held it to be our duty to
          decrease instead of increasing the taxes. This additional tax is not demanded nor asked
          for by the people. He wanted it understood that he was opposed to this bill, amendments.
          and everything connected with it, and should oppose it to the end, and he hoped the Senate
          amendment would not be concurred in. </p>
        <p>A division of the question was demanded and the emergency clause was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS said this was a cheaper bill than the House bill and he hoped the
          amendments of the Senate would be concurred in. </p>
        <p>Mr. HOPKINS said he thought we ought to adopt the 3 per cent. levy, and pay as you
          go.</p>
        <p> Mr. WILLARD was willing the bill should pass if amended so as to make a 2 per cent. levy
          instead of 3, otherwise he hoped the Senate amendments would not be concurred. in. He was
          opposed to taxing the people any more just now than was actually necessary.</p>
        <p> A demand for a call of the House was made by Mr. WIMMER,and was being taken when Mr.
          MARCH, explaining, said he did not think there was, any necessity of a 3 per cent. tax, or
          for borrowing money either.</p>

        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to concur when so amended as to reduce the levy to two cents on the
          $100.</p>
        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER asked a division of the question. The proposition to strike out
          "three" cents and insert "two" cents was agreed to, by
          consent. </p>
        <p>The question then recurred upon concurence in the Senate amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. 0VERMEYER hoped that the House would not concur in the Senate amendments, in order
          that he might further amend so that moneys that will hereafter come into the State
          treasury may be used in the construction of the new State House. </p>
        <p>Mr. WLLLARD was willing to give $200,000 the first year, but for tear of creating a
          deficiency he was unwilling to appropriate that sum for the next year. He desired the
          building to be put up in such a manner as it will stand for ages without settling.</p>
        <p>Mr. VANPELT was in favor of the 2 per cent. levy, and was also in favor of the
          proposition offered, or proposed to be offered, by Mr. Overmeyer. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS did not think that the people would be willing to appropriate more than
          $450,000 for two years, and he was opposed to appropriating any more, or to open up any
          contingent fund. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD'S motion to concur in the Senate amendments was temporarily laid on
          the table so that-- </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER might submit an amendment that there should be appropriated from the
          general fund in the State treasury the sum of $100,000 to be used for the building of the
          new state house, during the year 1880, to be paid out of any funds not otherwise

          <p>Mr. RODMAN called up the bill [S. 158] concerning married women, which was read the

          <p>Mr. MARCH said this was a well guarded bill, and should be passed without

          <p> Mr. TULLEY said this bill was a radical innovation of the law as it bas stood for
            1,000 years. He thought this was making an advance dangerous to the interests of married
            women. He was in favor of giving them an exemption equal with men--of $1,000. The bill
            ought not to pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD thought this was one of the best women's rights measures yet

          <p> Mr. TULLEY called up the bill [S. 23] to legalize the acts of the town of Huntington,

          <p> Mr. ROOKER called up the bill [S. 136] to regulate the use of human bodies for the
            purposes of dissection, etc, which was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAKE was in favor of this bill. It is necessary to enact a law, by which medical
            students and colleges can get subjects for anatomical purposes; and, unless such a law
            was provided, no one could be assured that the graves of loved ones are protected, from
            body-snatchers. This bill is carefully guarded.</p>

          <p> The bill then passed the House by--yeas 87, nays 7. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT, explaining his negative vote, said: He voted against this bill for the
            reason that it affects principally medical colleges, and he did not believe they will
            observe the law, and the bill will offer many temptations to perjury and other unlawful
            acts. He further believed if it was observed it would transfer grave-snatching from the
            cities, where many unknown bodies can be obtained, to the rural districts, where a grave
            can not be touched without outraging me most sacred feelings of some family in the
            neighborhood. He therefore voted "no."</p>
          <p> On the motion of Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart, the order of business was suspended and the
            bill [89] to promote the science of medicine and surgery, and providing human subjects
            for anatomical and scientific dissection, was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. GORDON could not vote for this bill. He would rather be guilty of the felony than
            take the subjects from the Institution'of the Hospital for the Insane, and
            thought it possi-[ble] <pb n="244" xml:id="VAA8558-17-246"/> [possi]-ble that this law,
            becoming known to the in- mates, might operate unfavorably on their disordered minds. </p>

          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, was satisfied that the provisions of the bill were well
            guarded, and that the bill ought to pass.</p>

          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS, in explanation of his vote, said he was in favor of a good dissecting law,
            or for anything that would elevate the medical profession, but could not vote for a bill
            that makes such discrimination between rich and poor. He voted "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. FAULKNER explaining, said he voted "no" because it takes all poor
            and unfortunate men, and is an inducement for our benevolent institutions to sell all
            the bodies of the poor and unfortunate inmates. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT, in explanation of his vote, said he never would vote for a law that even
            appears to discriminate in favor of one class of people against another. He voted
            "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said this
            medical fraternity would have our bodies anyhow, and we might as well be taken right
            from the death-bed to the dissecting table, as to be taken there from any other place.
            He voted "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT called up Mr. Edwin's bill [H. R. 420] for the relief of Alexander

        <p>Mr. HARRIS: It the sense of the Senate be only to dispose of the important measures in

          <p>The resolution as amended was adopted by yeas 39, nays 1. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL, the bill <ref target="#HJR_1879_01_09_022">[H. R. 22]</ref>
            to provide a homestead, and exempting it from sale on execution--$1,000 in value, real
            or personal, or both--was read the second time with a favorable report of a committee
            thereon.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE moved to amend the report of the committee by substituting new matter for
            the bill--exempting a homestead not exceeding 40 acres of land with the residence and
            outbuildings thereon. He said every law of a class kind hurts the parties it is intended
            to protect, in almost every instance. Adopt, this amendment, and every one having deal
            with the debtor knows what is exempt; otherwise this bill would encouragee gambling. A
            man that trades on an uncertainty gambles to a certain extent, because he charges more
            in order to cover the uncertainty of chances. The right thing to do is to grant a
            homestead, and there let it end. The object is to induce men to purchase a home; to
            encourage saving and industry, and to encourage men to become permanent citizens. Under
            a homestead exemption, every man will be disposed to save every cent and put it into a
            house, and then if he can't make a living let him live within his means. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to refer all bills on this subject to a committee, with instructions
            to bring in a bill to exempt a tract of land not exceeding 40 acres or worth more than
            $1,000 in value, when occupied by the householder as a home for himself and family. Mr.
            H. thought society is best served by encouraging every man to become a land holder, and
            thus interested in all the great interests of the common wealth. The rich man does not
            need any protection of this kind. He believed the true principle is to give every man a
            homestead. If personal property be exempted, the owner may have no credit. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON desired to see these bills printed, and made a motion to that effect. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT saw no necessity for printing these bills. The people prefer a homestead to an
            exemption law. He opposed the amendment, thinking it a discrimination in favor of those
            living in or near the larger cities, and thus unfair and unjust. The debtor should be
            permitted to choose what kind of property he would have exempted. He was willing to vote
            for the bill just as it came from the House, and regarded it as unnecessary to refer it
            to a committee at all. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON was of the opinion an exemption law was the best for Indiana now. A
            homestead would be best for the far West, but for Indiana, where the land is all
            occupied--where tens of thousands own no land, and probably never will--an exemption law
            is preferable. While it is true a homestead law would tend to make more landholders, but
            people will mortgage their homes, and a great majority of the people would not be
            benefited by a homestead. An exemption law from $500 to $1,000 is best, letting the
            debtor say which will be the most useful and profitable to him. This is an important
            piece of legislation, and he favored the motion to print. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK has been extremely anxious for some such legislation. He favored a homestead,
            but the amendment did not satisfy his ideas of what a homestead should be. A homestead
            amounting to $1,000 is not sufficient. To limit the value to that amount would not allow
            improvements on a small ten-acre trust in some places. The homestead should not be of
            less value than $2,000, which would afford a comfortable home. He favored the motion to
            print. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON moved that the bill and amendments lay on the table and 100 copies be
            printed with the bill [S. 248]. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER thought it a useless waste of money to print them all. It is better to
            recommit them first and let the committee agree before the printing is ordered.</p>
          <p> The motion was agreed to. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. COFFEY, the bill [H. R. 261] in relation to hedges or fences along
            public highways, was read the second time with a favorable report of a committee
            thereon, which was concurred in. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER the House resolution, authorizing pay for use of House
            committee rooms, was taken up.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER offered an amendment authorizing pay for Senate committee rooms. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON moved to amend the amendment by requiring a deduction of all sums received
            by the owner for the occupancy of any of said rooms since the hiring of said rooms to
            the Senate committees. </p>
          <p>Messrs. FOWLER, GRUBB8, FOSTER and SARNIGHAUSEN thought that unless the committees have
            been discommoded, the contract price ought not to be cut down. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE suggested the saving in the per diem of Janitors would more than cover the
            contract price of these rooms. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK knew of one occasion, at least, a committee of which he was a member could
            not obtain access to its room. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL considered it too late to cavil about whether the committees have had the
            use of these rooms or not; nothing is left now but to pay the contract price. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON favored the execution of contracts on both sides these rooms were to be
            granted exclusively for the use of committees, and, in plain violation of the contract,
            the rooms were occupied by guests; books and papers were missing, and the committees
            were inconvenienced thereby. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

          <p> The resolution as amended was adopted. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the bill [S. 425] for the laying out of wards in cities of not
            less than 9,000 nor more than l3,000 inhabitants, according to the census of 1878, was
            taken up and the vote by which it was ordered engrossed was reconsidered (on one motion
            by one vote.) </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved to indefinitely postpone this bill. It not only provides that the
            governor shall appoint commissioners to redistrict wards, but declares vacancies. It is
            the most remarkable bill that has been introduced in this Senate. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL demanded a call of the Senate, which being ordered and taken, discovered 37
            members present and answering to their names.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. HARRIS further proceedings under the call were dispensed, with by

        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Mr. SHANK moved ineffectually to lay the resolution on the table--yeas 35, nays 45. </p>
        <p>The resolution was then referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>. </p>

          box, which was read the first time and passed to the second reading. </p>
        <p>Mr. GOLDEN (Mr. Osborne of Elkhart in the chair) offered a resolution of thanks to the
          Speaker for the impartial and faithful manner in which he di charged his duty. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER, was glad of an opportunity to second a motion of this kind and endowed the
          resolution most heartily. </p>
        <p>Mr MIERS offered a resolution authorizing the continuance of the Brevier legislative
          reports, at the same price and the same number of copies furnished every General Assembly
          since 1857, for 17 years. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHANKS, it was referred to a special committee of three, with
          instructions to ascertain the probable cost. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS had never seen a more upright and just discharge of the duties devolving upon
          a speaker of the House of Representatives. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH desired also to bear his testimony to the fair nd impartial manner in which the
          speaker had discharged his duties. </p>
        <p>Mr. KELLEY said no man within his knowledge could have discharged the duties more
          faithfully and impartially, </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS could fully appreciate the duties of the speaker, and to fully appreciate the
          position members need only to occupy the chair a few hours, as he had done. </p>
        <p>Mr. HESS and Mr. REED desired to give voice to the assertion that the speaker had been
          strictly impartial in his rulings.</p>
        <p> Mr. HUBBARD said: "To appreciate the situation, just try it yourself." </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON declared that the speaker had so conducted the business of the session as to
          show that he was honest, capable, and impartial. </p>
        <p>Mr. LINDLEY desired to acknowledge personal kindness, and to bear testimony to the
          efficiency of the speaker. </p>
        <p>Mr. KIRKPATRICK had served the third time with the speaker, and fully appreciated the
          difficulties of the position. </p>
        <p>Mr. WIMMER was convinced the speaker had faithfully performed his duty.</p>
        <p> The resolution was then adopted by a unanimous rising vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON offered a resolution of thanks to the clerks and door-keepers, which was
          adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. CARTER offered a resolution that the testimony taken in the matter of the
          investigation of the Southern prison be placed upon the journa1.</p>
        <p> Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, said that inasmuch as none of the charges had been sustained,
          and as it was unnecessary to incumber the journal, he hoped the resolution would not pass.
          The investigation was searching. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS did not think there was a member on the floor that knew what was in the
          testimony except the committee. There was no reason, as he could see, why this testimony
          should not go upon the journal of this House. </p>
        <p>Mr. COPELAND was only asking that the notes of the clerk be incorporated in the House
          journal. </p>
        <p>Mr. CARTER thought it no more than right that the testimony should be published, as there
          were facts therein that were not known until developed in that testimony. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The resolution was then adopted--affirmative 38, negative 28. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIDSON offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, that a joint committee
          be appointed to wait upon the governor to ascertain whether his excellency has anything
          further to communicate to the House. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER made the committee to consist of Messrs. Davidson, Conner and Briggs on the
          part of the House. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN offered a concurrent resolution for pay for rent of committee rooms, which was
          adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON submitted a protest against the passage of the congressional apportionment
          bill [H. R. 486] which was read. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.247 in BLR-->
        <p>Mr. HUMPHEYS moved that the protest be submitted to a committee of three to ascertain
          whether there was anything therein that should not be spread on the journal or against the
          constitution and the law, which was agreed to by yeas 53, nays 35.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER made the committee to consist of Messrs. Humphreys, Hubbard and Johnson. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The House con current resolution concerning the pay of members of the committee to
          investigate the benevolent institutions was returned from the Senate with amendments
          adding pay for a shorthand reporter, which were concurred in by yeas 78, nays 4. </p>
        <p>Mr. STUCKER, explaining his negative vote, was opposed to this amendment ticking on a
          short-hand reporter for this committee. The committee should write out their own evidence,
          or call on some of the committee clerks of the House, who are under pay. He wanted to know
          how much was to be paid before action should be final on these amendments. He was opposed
          to concurring in the amendments of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD introduced a bill [H. R. 648] <pb n="248" xml:id="VAA8558-17-250"/> to
          provide for the taxation of rolling stock of fast freight companies, which was read the
          first time and passed to the second reading. </p>

          313] to legalize sheriff's, administrator's, guardian's and
          commissioner's sales in certain cases; also the bill [S. 55] to legalize the
          incorporation of the Kokomo Building Loan Fund and Saving Association, were read the
          second time, and severally referred to appropriate committees. </p>
        <p>The House then took a recess until 3 o'clock p. m.</p>
        <p> The Speaker at 3 o'clock again commanding order </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD introduced a concurrent resolution for per diem and mileage of witnesses in
          the State House investigation, making a total of $500.64, which was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMPTON offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, allowing pay to the
          committee visiting the Northern and Southern prisons.</p>
        <p> Mr. BEARSS presented a protest against the language used toward him by the contestor for
          his seat, and entered upon the journal of this House, denying that any votes were
          purchased by money or obtained in any other fraudulent manner. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAVIDSON, from the select joint committee to wait upon the governor, reported that
          his excellency has nothing further to communicate than the annexed proclamation convening
          the Fifty first General Assembly in special session, on Tuesday, March 11,1879, at 9
          o'clock a. m. </p>
        <p>Mr. REED offered a concurrent resolution that the principal clerk be allowed the sum of
          $300 for preparing a calendar of business for the House journal, indexing, etc., etc. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD moved to amend by adding that the assistant clerk shall have the same amount
          for indexing and proof reading of the House journal, which was accepted.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON moved to further amend by striking out "$300" and inserting
          '$200," which was agreed to.</p>
        <p> Mr. STUCKER wanted to be shown the law that allows $300 apiece extra to these clerks. He
          did not think there was any such law. They had their regular per diem of %6 per day, and
          he did not care what the custom had been in years gone by; these extravagances the people
          demanded now should be cut off. He denounced the resolution as wrong, and an outrage upon
          the tax-payers of the State. These gentlemen occupied these positions at $6 per day, and
          that was all he was willing they should have. He should oppose any resolution that
          authorizes the payment of money without warrant of law, and should, therefore, vote
          against concurring in this Senate amendment.</p>
        <p> The resolution, as amended, was then adopted. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS, from the special committee thereon, submitted a report on the protest of
          Mr. Gordon, that the accompanying maps be stricken oat, and, when so done, the protest be
          entered upon the journal. The report was concurred in, upon a division--affirmative 43,
          negative 35. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON submitted a protest against referring his protest to a special committee, and
          the action of said committee in striking out a portion of said protest, and against the
          House concurring therein.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAILEY offered a concurrent resolution that the members be allowed their expense for
          visiting the educational institutions of the State, which was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUTHSTEINER introduced a bill [H. R. 649] to amend section 3 of an act to amend an

          the second reading. </p>

        <p>The Speaker submitted his report for the warrants drawn for the per diem, mileage, etc ,
          of members. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS offered a concurrent resolution , which was adopted, that the Speaker draw
          his warrant for $69.62 for amounts allowed for washing towels, etc., as reported favorably
          by <orgName>committee on claims</orgName>.</p>
        <p> Mr. FAULKNER offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, that the two Houses
          adjourn at 5 o'clock this p. m. sine die. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

          <p>By Mr. Nave, by request, [H. R. 652] to amend sections 15, 19 and 22 of an act to

            had given no distinction to any member on account of political preferment. If he had
            failed in the discharge of hi duty it way the result of his inability to accomplish it.
            He had done what he could to expedite the business of the session and had even tried to
            detain members later than they seemed willing to stay. If in the discharge1 of his

                o'clock a. m., in the Marion county Court House, in the city of
                Indianapolis, in pursuance of the following proclamation by His Excellency, the
                governor of Indiana: </p>
              <p>A proclamation convening the Fifty-first General Assembly in special session, given

              <p>Indianapolis, March 10,1879: </p>
              <p>The Fifty-first General Assembly has consumed the time allotted to its regular
                session and is about to adjourn. Provision has not been made for the expenses of the
                State Government during the ensuing two years. Other important business has not been
                completed. The public welfare, in my opinion, requires a brief special session. </p>
              <p>Therefore, I, James D. Williams, governor of Indiana, hereby call upon the (General
                Assembly of the State of Indiana to convene in special session on Tuesday, March 11,
                A. D. 1879, at 9 o'clock in the forenoon. </p>

          Jefferson. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE: Mr. President, I see there is a quorum present.</p>
        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced all Senators present except Senators Benjamin L.
          Davenport [of Elkhart] A. D. Streight [of Marion] Elijah W. Weir [of Lagrange and Noble]
          and John H. Winterbotham [of Laportel who are absent on leave. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE then offered a resolutlon declaring the officers of the extra session. DANIEL
          D. DALE, Principal Secretary, CHARLES W. WARD, Assistant Secretary and RICHARD HUNCHEON,
          Doorkeeper--as chosen to serve the special session. </p>
        <p>It was adopted by yeas 34, nays 9. Mr. WARD and Mr. HUNCHEON taking the oath of office
            <pb n="6" xml:id="VAA8558-17-256"/> at the hands of Judge Wm. E. Niblack, of the supreme
          court. Mr. DALE being absent was not sworn in.</p>
        <p> On motion of Mr. VIEHE the rules of the regular session were adopted as the rules of the
          special session. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS offered a resolution for the consideration from day to day, till completed, of
          the State House and general and specific appropriation bills, in the order named. He
          thought if the Senate starts in a business way it might get through by the time the fee
          and salary committee is ready to report. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to refer the resolution to a select committee of seven, consisting of
          three Democrats, three Republicans and one National, with instructions to report what
          business should be advanced on the calendar. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE offered a substitute declaring it to be the sense of the Senate that the most
          important bills on the calendar shall have precedence, and to that end a committee of
          seven Democrats, six Republicans and one National shall be appointed by the chair to
          select such measures as shall be advanced on the calendar of business. He said whether it
          take five or twenty days the business of this Legislature should be done. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER thought it inexpedient to delegate the right to a committee to indicate or
          dictate what bills shall be forwarded on the calendar. He favored the taking up of
          business in the regular order, believing senators are better able to judge for themselves
          than to place this matter in the hands of a committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS was very much of the same opinion. He disliked the idea of allowing a few
          members to run the Senate as they may choose.</p>
        <p> Mr. KENT did not think the Senate would be discharging its duty unless it considered
          first the bills indicated in the original resolution, but the Senate itself should be the
          judge as to what business is of first importance, and not a committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON desired to see the most important bills first considered. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER opposed the appointment of a committee to dictate what the Senate shall
          consider first. He indicated a preference for the apportionment and other important
          bills.</p>
        <p> Mr. OLDS desired to see the work of the session soon accomplished, so that members may
          return to their homes; but he was not willing to place such power as the resolution
          contemplates in the hands of a committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER moved as a substitute for the whole matter, that the Senate proceed to the
          consideration of the State House bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES favored this substitute. It is the simplest way to advance the business for
          which this session of the General Assembly has been called. Being anxious to get to work
          at the important measures on the calendar, he was willing to vote for the original
          resolution. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ruled out of order the last offered substitute [Mr.
          Leeper's]. He also ruled that neither the resolution nor the substitute would be
          binding only for to-day, as it otherwise would change a standing rule of the Senate. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.6 of Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p>Under the operations of the previous question, demanded by Mr. COFFEY, the substitute was
          rejected. The motion [Mr. Burrel's] was rejected, as was also the original
          resolution by--yeas 16, nays 27.</p>

        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> On motion by Mr. LEEPER--yeas 40, nays 3--the order of business was suspended, and the
          Senate agreed to proceed to the consideration of the State House bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE, in casting his vote against this motion, when his name was called, explained
          by saying he would like to support the resolution, but in as much as he is informed there
          is a deficit in the treasury, and the appropriation will exceed the tax levy; and inasmuch
          as we must know how the treasury stands before acting advisedly on the subject, he would
          have to vote "no."</p>
        <p> The House amendments to the Senate amendments to the State House bill, [H. R. 639]
          reducing the levy from "three" to "two" per cent., and
          appropriating $100,000 for the year 1880, and also declaring an emergency. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS moved that the Senate do not concur. If only a two cent levy be made it will
          not yield enough for next year, especially if there be any deficit in the treasury as is
          whispered about the Senate this morning. He desired a conference committee be asked
          for.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to reject the emergency clause because it was attached by the House
          after the bill was transmitted to the Senate. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided this a matter the Senate can take no notice of, in the
          absence of official knowledge. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE moved the Senate concur in the House amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES stated that $100,000 will not be in the State treasury in 1880, so that part
          of the bill will be a nullity, and thus in effect reducing the appropriation to $540,000
          for two years. The difference between the two and the three cent levy is about $80,000 or
          $85,000. If senators will consider the price of material now, the advantages of continuing
          this work, and many other things, the people surely will not complain of a three cent
          levy. The general levy is the lowest in the Union, and the people are fearful of having
          this public work extended over a long period of years, because experience shows the
          expenses pile up rapidly.</p>
        <p> [A message from the House of Representatives announced the organisation of that body and
          its readiness to proceed with legislative business.]</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE saw a disposition on the part of members to stop deliberation by springing the
          previous question, and he warned members of the Senate that it would be an outrage upon
          the laws of the State and an outrage on the people to deliberately appropriate money that
          does not exist, and refuse to make provision to raise that money when they know it is not
          in existence and can be brought into existence only in one way. It is proposed to
          appropriate money from the Treasury which there is no means of putting there unless it is
          raised by a tax levy; and then provide in express violation of the constitution, that the
          money shall be borrowed to make up a deficit that is in no sense "a consol
          deficit." </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE demanded the previous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE demanded a call of the Senate, which, being taken, discovered 40 members
          present and answering to their names.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. DICE further proceedings under the call were dispensed with. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The previous question was seconded, and the main question ordered. A division of the
          question being demanded by Mr. KRAMER, the part of the House amendments reducing the tax
          levy from three to two cents was concurred in by--yeas 20, nays 14; and the second part of
          the House amendments, appropriating from the general fund $100,000 for 1880, was rejected
          by--yeas 17, nays 22. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES explaining his negative vote: Believing the money would not be in the
          treasury voted "no" if it were possible for the money to be there he
          would cheerfully vote 'aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE also explaining his negative vote, was opposed to providing extraordinary means
          to put money in the treasury, when there is ample opportunity to provide ordinary <pb n="7" xml:id="VAA8558-17-257"/> means;and believing this would be creating a deficit in
          the treasury he would vote "no." </p>
        <p>The result of the vote was then announced.</p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS a <orgName>committee of conference </orgName>was asked for, and
          the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR makes the committee on the part of the Senate to consist of
          Messrs. Harris and Hefron. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN offered a resolution, which was adopted by consent: That the House be
          informed of the organization of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON gave notice that to-morrow morning he should move to amend the rules of the
          Senate so as to prevent explanations at the time votes are given. </p>
        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> On motion by Mr. KRAMER, the Senate agreed to consider House bills on the third
            reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 158] in relation to settlements made by boards of county commissioners
            with county townships or other officers shall not be binding where the officer is a
            defaulter, was read, together with amendments reported from the <orgName>judiciary
              committee</orgName>, and a substitute therefor heretofore offered by the Senator from
            Decatur [Mr. Moore]. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE regarded this as one of the most important bills of the session, as
            materially affecting the interests of many people in this State. He declared the
            amendments proposed by the committee if adopted would insure even-handed justice on all
            hands. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE was satisfied if the Senate understood the purpose and provisions of this
            bill there would be but little objection to it. He could see no reason in treating a
            settlement as conclusive on an individual and not conclusive as to the State, as is
            proposed in the committee's amendments. Both should be given an equal chance;
            justice should be done by the State under all circumstances and at sill times to her
            humblest citizen. He felt an interest in this bill because he knew of parties who would
            suffer great hardship unless it becomes a law. </p>
          <p> [While Mr. Moore was speaking he was interrupted by a communication from the House of
            Representatives inviting the Senate to a joint convention to near the
            governor's message; which invitation on his motion was accepted. He was again
            interrupted by the appearance of a committee from the House of Representatives
            [Representative Shanks and Briggs] appointed to escort the Senate to the hall of the
            House. Senators repaired to the representative's hall, and when they returned
            Mr. Moore resumed and completed his speech.] </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE insisted this bill would impair the obligations of contract--and would
            constitute the Senate a court of appeals. It authorizes, and, in advance, legalizes
            recklessness and inexcusable oversight in county treasurers and the bill is retroactive.
            Besides the last clause reinstates what is claimed to be stricken out by the substitute,
            and this puts the bill back in its original form. The bill is of this class. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER hoped every Senator would examine the law. He believed the bill was worthy
            of passage. It is not mandatory in its character. This bill has been lobbied against
            more than it deserves. He was not lawyer enough to know whether the bill is exactly
            right, but if it is, it will relieve men who are deserving of relief. It simply means
            that mistakes may be corrected. </p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY hoped the substitute would not be adopted, as It Is substantially the
            original bill as it came from the House, the proviso of which must be absolutely wrong,
            and must have been prepared to meet a certain case in Fayette county. The bill would put
            it into the power of an outgoing and incoming treasurer to practice fraud on the
            tax-payers. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The substitute for the committee report was agreed to by--yeas 21, nays 20--and the
            bill placed on the calendar by consent.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill [H. R. 228] to enable the superintendent of public instruction and the
            auditor of Adams county to reopen accounts, so as to correct an error in the school
            fund, was read the third time and passed the Senate by--yeas 35,nays 1. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.7 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
          <p>The bill [H. R 303] to legalize the acts of trustees of the town of Tell City, in all
            cases since the incorporation of said town, was read the third time and passed the
            Senate by--yeas 33, nays 2. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOSTER, the amendments of the House to his bill [S. 22--New Haven
            legalizing bill] were read and concurred in. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS the House amendments to his bill, [S. 158] concerning married
            women, were read. He moved that the Senate do not concur, and that a <orgName>committee
              on conference</orgName> be asked for. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT doubted the propriety of passing any bill on this subject.</p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON favored the motion--being opposed to the amendments. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES regarded the amendments as directly contradictory to the first section of
            the bill. The motion was agreed to and the PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Hefron in the chair]
            made said committee to consist of Messrs. Harris and Menzies.</p>
          <p> And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

        <p> This being the day and hour for convening the Fifty-first General Assembly of the State
          of Indiana in extra session, by proclamation of the governor, dated March 10, 1870, the
          members of the House of Representatives being assembled in the criminal court, room of the
          Marion County Court House, were called to order by Hon. JOHN GILBERT SHANKLIN, secretary
          of state, who said: Gentlemen, you have been convened in extraordinary session by
          proclamation of the governor. The members, as their names are called, will step forward
          and receive the oath of office at the hands of Chief Justice WM. E. NIBLACK. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON said: Mr. Secretary--Before proceeding: to take the proposed oath, I desire to
          utter my protest against the reorganization of this House, It is, in my opinion, a plain
          violation of the law of parliament which makes the organization of the 9th of January last
          valid and subsisting until the expiration of the term for which the members of the House
          were elected. Of course, I do not object to repeating the oath already taken, for it can
          neither dd to nor detract from its obligation. That, once taken, is obligatory to the end
          of our term. It is, on the other hand, to presume my notion of the same, and assert my
          respect for it, that I now object to this whole proceeding. I believe that this House is
          now fully organized as it was at the last session; and see that we may do in that respect
          will be simply nugatory. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREY: We are not acting under the law of Parliament, but under the law of
          Indiana, and. it has always been our custom here. </p>
        <p>Mr. GORDON: It was a proceeding adopted. in 1859, when no party in the House had a
          majority; and when a faction supposed they could gain a point by a reorganization, it was
            <pb n="7" xml:id="VAA8558-17-258"/> then regarded by the oldest parliamentarians of the
          State as a plain violation of the Law of Parliament: and I have never had a doubt of it
          since, and have not now. I therefore object to the whole proceeding. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS said he thought the House ought to be resworn, as there was not much work
          done during the regular session, and the oath taken at the commencement was about worn
          out. </p>
        <p>The oath was then administered by Judge NIBLACK to members in groups of twenty- five. </p>

        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said from announcements, he supposed these were propositions for the
          organization of the House of Representatives from both the leading political parties, and
          inasmuch as he was not a member of either, he offered a resolution which was read. It
          provides for the organisation of the House of Representatives as it stood during the
          regular session ; For Speaker, HENRY CAUTHORNE, a representative from the county of Knox;
          for principal clerk, WEBSTER DIXON, of Jackson county; for assistant clerk, THOMAS C.
          MAYS, of DeKalb; for doorkeeper, DAVID B. WILSON, of Shelby. </p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN moved to amend by striking out the name of Mr. CAUTHORNE and inserting the name
          of Mr OVERMEYER in lieu. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS obtained leave to enter his protest against the organization of the House by

          nays 37.</p>
        <p> So the amendment was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER desired to call attention to the constitution, and he read article 2
          section 13. He insisted that the only constitutional organization was by election. He,
          therefore, moved that the resolution lie on the table. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken, resulted--yeas 38, nays 55. </p>

          and not voting 36.</p>
        <p> The secretary of state then declared the Hon. HENRY S. CAUTHOURN duly chosen speaker of
          the House of Representatives for the special session. </p>
        <p>Mr. CAUTHORNE after taking the oath of office said he was thankful for the expression of
          confidence. He had no promises to make, but would await until the close of the session,
          and then leave the members of the House to judge how he had performed the duties of the
          chair. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS entered his protest against the election by resolution which was read and
          ordered spread on the Journal.</p>

          be, and the same are hereby adopted as the rules for the special session. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON offered a resolution which was adopted, that the Senate be informed of the

          adjourn sine die on Monday, March 17,1879. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH offered a substitute that the State House and specific appropriation bills be
          completed, and that then this session adjourn.</p>
        <p> The substitute was ruled out by order of the Speaker. </p>

                <p>I regret that I have been compelled to cause you to convene in special session to
                  complete the business which should have been accomplished during the regular
                  session which closed yesterday. In concluding my biennial message, I expressed the
                  hope that, realizing the limited term for which you were convened, you might be
                  able at an early day to consider the matters communicated to you, and that your
                  most important business might not be delayed until the confusion incident to the
                  closing hours of the session should involve you in errors which you would
                  afterwards regret. The present condition of your business justifies the admonition
                  which the experience of many years then had taught me, I presume that I may not
                  officially know what has created this emergency, but the people, whose servants we
                  are, will in due time fix the responsibility where it belongs and administer the
                  chastisement which faithless and incompetent representatives may always expect
                  from. an outraged constituency. During the 59 days ending Saturday last and before
                  the "two days next previous to the final adjournment" had
                  commenced to run, the joint committee on enrolled bills presented to me 18 bills
                  which had originated in the Senate and 12 which had originated in the House of
                  Representatives, these being 30 in all I have signed. They constitute the
                  legislation upon which you must have been judged without the opportunity now
                  afforded you by the exercise of the constitutional power vested in me. An
                  examination of these acts suggests that our modern idea of legislation not only
                  contemplates a special session at the conclusion of each regular session of the
                  General Assembly, but in addition expects that a large part of that time shall be
                  devoted to setting right the errors or town and city officers and other agents of
                  the people, defining existing law's, relieving sureties on official
                  bonds, changing judicial circuits to accommodate personal prejudices against
                  presiding judges, changing the terms and time of holding court in counties to suit
                  the convenience of a select few at the expense of the mass of the people who have
                  become accustomed to the existing calendar; enacting under the forms of general
                  law that which is of necessity local and special and in direct violation of the
                  constitution, and thus, while affording to small localities the temporary relief
                  given by an act of doubtful sufficiency, leave the, measures for which the people
                  of the whole State have long waited to fall into confusion and neglect. Twelve of
                  the acts received and signed may be classified with those described. One
                  undertakes to satisfy and confirm a large part of the omissions of duty incident
                  to the organization and management of the city government to which it applies.
                  Ordinances by number without other description, are accepted as wholesome for the
                  community amenable to that form of law, and ratified and approved, save that by a
                  variance between the title and the body of the act, 10, whose irregularity is by
                  titled promised a cure, are omitted and left to be healed two years hence. By one
                  act you set apart $125,000 for the payment of your expenses, and by another you
                  increased your corps of employes by the addition of two clerks of committees. A
                  superior court constituted for Wayne county by the last General Assembly is
                  abolished, and you have disposed with a part of our expensive machinery for the
                  assessment of taxes in towns and cities. The act requiring that prisoners in jail
                  be put at some useful work is valuable in our populous localities. The act
                  permitting guardians to settle the estates of deceased wards is commendable, and I
                  trust will lead to other needed reforms of that nature. You have enacted a few
                  good and highly important laws. Having agreed to seven of the proposed amendments
                  to the con-[stitution] <pb n="10" xml:id="VAA8558-17-260"/> [con]-stitution, you
                  have provided for their submission to the people at an election to be held in
                  April, 1880. You have passed a law apportioning the counties of the State for
                  purposes of representation in the General Assembly, which has met my entire
                  approval as being just and fair to all affected by it. In my former communication
                  I noted the growing disposition to impose ministerial duties upon the governor in
                  addition to those named in the constitution. By your acts changing the management
                  of the benevolent institutions--the Hospital for the Insane, the Institutes for
                  the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, and the Soldiers' Orphans' Home
                  (now merged with the newly created Asylum for Feeble Minded Children)--you have
                  given to the governor, under advice of the Senate, power to appoint the trustees.
                  Remembering how much your time has been occupied by appeals for office when in
                  your immediate gift, and the vain effort to determine your right to elect, I am
                  satisfied of their wisdom and of the propriety of extending the authority to
                  include the management of the two prisons, which alone remain to threaten your
                  peace of mind.</p>
                <p>I renew my recommendation on the subject of fees and salaries. It is expected
                  that you will pass a law fixing the fees and salaries of your State, county and
                  township officers, giving them a fair compensation for the services, making the
                  law so plain that there can be no misconstruction of any of its points. Such a law
                  I shall cheerfully sanction. </p>
                <p>It is of great and pressing importance that you at once consider and pass a bill
                  for an act making appropriations for the support of the State government during
                  the two years from November 1, 1879. The act now in force was enacted March 6,
                  1877, and was designed to include in itself and become a substitute for all
                  existing laws authorizing the payment of money from the general fund. It has been
                  thus construed and administered. It lacks non of the force of law. By it terms it
                  repeals the law and fragments of laws then in force, which had authorized
                  unexpected drafts upon the treasury, and limited the amounts and objects. Salaries
                  are provided for by it which had before been paid out of miscellaneous
                  appropriations, and did note appear upon the face of the acts of appropriation. </p>
                <p>In this connections I may say that in making provision for the administration of
                  the office which I now have the honor to hold, you may not deal justly by its
                  important and increasing business when you adjust your appropriations to those who
                  are for the time being in its service. The provision which you may make will apply
                  to and affect the next administration of the office quite as much as the present
                  incumbent. The system of business which prevails has been perfected by years of
                  experience and painstaking care, and deserves at least an examination, before it
                  is condemned as useless, or degraded by being placed upon a level with branches of
                  the public service for an entirely different character.</p>
                <p>The bill for an act making appropriations for specific objects services immediate
                  consideration. An appropriation for improvements at the Southern prison is a
                  matter of great importance. The addition to the building of the Hospital for the
                  Insane to be used as the department for "women" has ben erected
                  during the past four years, at a cost of $600,000, and awaits an appropriation to
                  complete and furnish it for the accommodation of the hundreds who needs its care
                  and protection in their pitiable condition. I trust that you will not fail to make
                  a sufficient appropriation, say $62,000, to pay the indebtedness of the Sate Board
                  of Agriculture. The State has already acquired an interest in its land to the
                  amount of $25,000, but it is only in the nature of second mortgage. I recommend
                  that you make the appropriation in order to save the State' interest, as
                  well as the State Boards--the State to be the owner in fee simple until such time
                  as the property can be sold to advantage, and then , after reimbursing the State,
                  should there be anything left, that it be given to the State Board. When in 1855,
                  the State University was in danger of losing its endowment by a judgment obtained
                  by the trustees of Vincennes University against the State defending for persons
                  who had purchased lands supposed to belong to it, the State very generously
                  assumed the whole amount, being nearly $70,000, and has paid it with a large
                  amount of interest on the bonds issued for the purpose. Now, if the State could
                  afford to make a donation of that amount to one university, she can surely afford
                  to appropriate the money required to ave the property of the farmers and mechanics
                  of the whole State, especially as the State will become the owner of the property.
                  I sincerely hope that you will at once complete your consideration of the bill
                  providing means to continue the work the new State House, and enact it into a law.
                  The slight disagreements as to the manner of raising the money can be speedily
                  reconciled by a full and free consultation, when all shall come to realize the
                  advantages of an immediate prosecution of the work in a time so favorable to
                  permanence and cheapness, The subject of expert evidence, to which I called your
                  attention in my former communication, has received an early and marked
                  illustration in the attempt of architects who testified before your committee of
                  investigation in to the New State House matters to procure an allowance at the
                  rate of $20 per day, for the attendance as witnesses, and that, too, after some of
                  them had been afforded their education at the public expense, I renew and press
                  upon you the recommendation that you remedy this evil, and that you put it beyond
                  the power of courts to allow, or witnesses to demand and receive such unreasonable
                  fees. </p>
                <p>I again urge that you repeal the law authorizing each county to send two students
                  to each university free of charge, and that you require all students alike to pay
                  a reasonable tuition fee.</p>
                <p>My recommendation upon the subject of executive clemence has been brought to your
                  notice again by the printed copies of the bienial report for 1877 and 1878. I
                  desire your careful and deliberate judgment upon the facts thus fully communicated
                  to you, and if, in your opinion it is not wise to make the change authorized by
                  the constitution, I will be glad if the care bestowed upon that branch of the
                  business of this office may commend it to your approbation. </p>
                <p>As suggested in my proclamation, I believe that your session under this call
                  should be brief, and I assume that it will be your pleasure to insure that
                  desirable result by a prompt, diligent and harmonious disposition of the measures
                  of public interest which I have enumerated. </p>

        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced his appointment of the standing committees of the
          regular session to serve as such for the special session. He also reappointed the pages of
          last session. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOODS offered a joint resolution requesting the Legislature of Illinois to remove the
          dam at Momence, Illinois, across the Kankakee river, and to permit her citizens and the
          citizens of Indiana to cut a channel through the rock above the said dam, and thereby
          enable the citizens of Indiana to successfully drain and reclaim a vast area of wet lands
          [about 800,000 acres] bordering the Kankakee river. He read an argument in favor of the
          passage of his resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON regarded it as a question whether the Momence dam was the impediment which
          causes the overflow of so many acres of land in this State. If it is worth while for the
          General Assembly to legislate on this subject, it should be brought forward in a different
          shape, he proposed work involves a vast expenditure of money. He favored any method by
          which this vast tract of land could be reclaimed. </p>
        <p>Mr. TREAT considered the resolution not what it should be. In his opinion the proper way
          would be to ascertain the facts by the making of an actual survey, and it it be found that
          the dam is an impediment, then this Legislature could understandingly take some steps of
          this kind. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK regarded this as an important resolution, and moved that a committee of
          three be appointed to examine and report on the subject, desiring not to be appointed
          thereon himself. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD thought it useless to survey first and then petition. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped the committee would take immediate steps to push this work forward. It
          is a little less than a disgrace to the State to allow so large a tract of land to lie
          under water, when it could, so easily be drained. </p>
        <p>The motion to refer was agreed to, and the PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Kent in the chair] made
          said committee to consist of Messrs. Wood, Langdon and Leeper. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOSTER offered a resolution directing the chairmen of committees not to employ clerks
          at this special session. </p>

        <p>On motion of Mr. BENZ it was laid on the table by--yeas 31, nays 11. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS offered a resolution requiring the secretary of the Senate to keep on hand a
          sufficient quantity of lithograph letter-heads and envelopes for the use of the Senate,
          which was adopted by--yeas 24, nays 14. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK introduced a bill [S. 444] to provide for the organization and support, of an
          asylum for the feeble minded children, and to repeal the act on the same subject approved
          on the 7th of this month, was read the first time, and referred to the <orgName>Committee
            on Benevolent and Reformatory Institutions</orgName>. He paid it was only to supply an
          emergency clause to the act referred to. </p>
        <p>The resolution [H. R. 29] allowing pay to principal and a assistant clerks of both
          Houses--$200 each--for indexing, etc., the journals, was read and laid on the table.</p>
        <p> The resolution [H. R. 21] requesting Senators and Representatives in Congress to procure
          the enactment of a law making an appropriation of $82,286.31 to pay Morgan raid claims,
          being read--</p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON declared the resolution could not hurt the State, and was but an act of
          justice to people in the southern portion of the State, and he saw no necessity for
          reference to a committee. The facts were well understood; it would not take a dollar from
          the State treasury, but was only to reimburse our own citizens who suffered by this raid.
          He urged the passage of the resolution now. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT also favored the passage of the resolution. </p>
        <p>Mr. REILEY regarding these claims as just, desired to see favorable action taken without
          delay. </p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ represents one of the counties which had three miles destroyed in the Morgan
          raid, and had horses taken by troops on both sides; and he thought it but right that the
          United States should pay the damage.</p>

          <p> Mr. SHIRK, from the <orgName>committee on benevolent institutions</orgName>, returned
            his bill, [S. 444] introduced this morning, to fix an emergency clause to the act
            creating an asylum for feeble minded, approved on the 7th of this month, with a
            favorable report thereon. The report was concurred in, and on his further motion, the
            constitutional restriction to prevent hasty legislation was dispensed with, by yeas 35,
            nays 0; the bill was read the second and third times, and passed, by yeas 31, nays
            8.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK the House amendments to his bill [S. 280] supplementary to
            the public library act of February 16,1852, reducing the tax from
            "two" to "one" cent, was concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS, from the <orgName>committee of conference</orgName>on the State House bill
            [H. R. 637], reported an agreement, appropriating $100,000 for 1880, to come from any
            moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, etc. He said the tax levy for 1879
            would be two cents. The bill appropriates for 1879 $100,000, and it also appropriates
            for 1880 $100,000, if there is so much in the treasury unappropriated, and the State
            officers may borrow money to pay existing loans as such loans may fall due. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE desired to preserve the Integrity and credit of the State. He moved the bill
            be laid on the table till a statement shall come from the Treasurer showing how much
            surplus money will be in the State Treasury at the end of this and the next fiscal year
            under the existing tax levy.</p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said all the information sought by this motion will be found on page 14 of
            the Auditor's last printed report.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT aid not see any difficulty in the way of passing this bill now, and he
            hoped that would be done--the Senate having yielded almost everything asked for by the
            House of Representatives. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON was willing to rely upon the published estimates of the State auditor, and
            insisted upon instant concurrence in the report of the committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE insisted that the State treasurer expects a deficiency in the treasury made
            up from actual data in the office. Then how can this Legislature make an appropriation
            out of funds where there will be atf200,000 deficiency? He desired to provide against
            the increase of extraordinary power by the State officers to procure means with which to
            carry on the Government. </p>

          <p> Mr. LANGDON understood there was no limitation on the State officers as to how much
            the length of time or rate of interest on loans they may make, and consequently he was
            opposed to the passage of this measure unless amended in this particular.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. DICE, the bill and report was laid on the table, and 100 copies
            ordered printed. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 179] to prevent the manufacture and sale of adulterated commercial

          <p>The bill [S. 51--Mr. Grubbs'] to amend section 22 of the town incorporation
            act of June 11, 1852, was read the third time, </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS explained the provisions of his bill, it allows towns to regulate the sale
            of intoxicating liquors, by re-enacting substantially the law of 1877.</p>
          <p>Mr. TRAYLOR opposed the bill. It would be the means of creating large indebtedness in
            towns, and would be a good bill in the interest of drug stores. It is impossible to do
            away with the use of intoxicating liquors by legislative enactment. This bill would
            probably prevent the retailing of light wines in towns; and instead of a man taking a
            drink of light wines he would take a jug of whisky home with him. The use of light wines
            is not injurious. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS favored the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. GRUBBS believed in regulating the sale of liquor in every possible way as long as
            the State licenses it. The law has operated well and he believed it ought to be placed
            on the statute book again. For that reason he introduced this bill. </p>

        <p> By direction of the House the speaker appointed as a conference committee on the part of

        <p>Mr. WIMMER offered a resolution that so much of the resolution, passed by the House on

        <p> Mr. THAYER called up his bill [H. R. 416] giving circuit courts jurisdiction by
          affidavit (with information) over felonies, which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER believed It would be a very great saving of money in every county, and would
          meet the approval of the people generally.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, believed the provisions of this bill would save time and money and
          work no injustice to any person. He believed that felonies may be as well prosecuted on
          information derived through township courts, viz: Justices of the Peace, as upon
          indictments from grand juries, before which one aide of the testimony only is taken, </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON said the bill he introduced, and now engrossed, was a much better bill than
          the one now before the House. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS thought Mr. Watson's bill, H. R. 32, was the better bill, and asked
          that it be read for information. It provides that felonies may be prosecuted in the
          circuit and criminal courts by affidavit and information for felony, when no grand jury is
          in session, when an indictment has been found by grand jury, and has been quashed, and
          where appeals to the supreme court have been reversed on account of defects in the
          indictment. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER was satisfied that this was a better bill, and he moved to take up Mr.
          Watson's bill, H. R. 32, in on the same subject, which was agreed to, and the
          bill [H. R. 416] was laid on the table.</p>

              <p>Whereas, The House of Representatives of the Fifty-first General Assembly of the
                State of Indiana have had at the regular session, just closed, besides the ordinary
                duties pertaining to that body, the duties imposed by the election of United States
                senator, the apportionment of the State into legislative and congressional
                districts, the investigation of the charges against the board of State House
                commissioners and against the board of benevolent institutions; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, The members of said House of Representatives of all political parties
                eschewing partisan considerations to an extent unprecedented in former legislative
                bodies of this State, have labored unceasingly almost to secure daily legislation as
                the interests of their constituents and the State demand; and,</p>
              <p> Whereas, They have passed and forwarded to the other branch of the department near
                100 important bills, and acted on a large number received from that body; and
                because it, is no fault, neglect or lack of duty on the part of the House that no
                greater amount of legislation has been accomplished; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, The governor, James D. Williams, in what, purports to be a message, and
                communicated, second-handed, to this House on yesterday so far forgot the dignity of
                and respect due to a co-ordinate branch of the State Government as to rebuke and
                criticise its doings in the regular session of this House just past, and to attempt
                to bring it into disrepute and public ridicule by undignified and undeserved
                criticism of its proceedings; and, </p>
              <p>Whereas, no amount of pandering to a vulgar prejudice against public servants by
                one branch of the State Government will restore the confidence that the people are
                fast losing in that deparment of said Government,</p>
              <p> Therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, that said pretended

                people themselves, and</p>
              <p> Resolved further, That the speaker of the House appoint a committee of five

        <p> Mr. THOMPSON, explaining, said he thought the governor's message was not quite
          respectful,and wholly lacks the dignity of a state paper but I can not agree to any action
          of this house looking to an undignified retort upon the executive. It is our duty to
          preserve our character as a sincere body representing the people. We can not do this by
          condescending to censure what of itself will stand as a monument to the
          governor's discrimination, ability and fitness to fill the office, which ought to
          reflect the refinement and culture of the State. It seemed to him that the governor has
          not done <pb n="15" xml:id="VAA8558-17-265"/> any serious damage to any one. He voted

        <p>Mr. TULLEY insisted there was no injustice in this bill, and it could take away the
          rights of no man. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said if there was apiece of real estate sold by the sheriff, and
          the party from whom the land was taken desires to recover back, through the courts, his
          land, this Legislature ought not to attempt to step in and interfere in that right. He
          thought the Legislature could not and would not attempt it. </p>

          <p> Mr. WATSON called up the bill [S. 194] defining who shall be competent witnessess,
            which was read the third time </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAKE was satisfied that some of the provisions of this bill would work injustice
            to the medical profession. It was not right to require a man who had spent a lifetime to
            acquire a profession to testify for the same price as witnesses in ordinary cases. He
            could not vote for the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said there were hardships in every class of life, and he did not see where it
            would work injustice. The physician's knowledge was valuable and so was the
            farmers. The farmer could be an expert, and he could not see where you could draw the
            line. If you exempt a physician you must exempt everybody else. He hoped the bill would
            pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD would support the latter portion, but the former portion, that which allows
            husband and wife to testify against each other, he was opposed to. It was a license for
            perjury, and this was an aggressive crime, and these bills would take away some of the
            safeguards attempted to be thrown around the prevention of this crime. He was compelled
            to vote against the bill as it now stood. </p>
          <p> Mr. ALLEN of Putnam, should vote for this bill because it allows the wife to go into
            court and testify against a brutal husband. He was opposed to any distinction before the

          <p>Mr. WATSON said the old law would not allow a party interested in a suit to testify.
            The theory of the law now is to allow every- one in possession of facts concerning the
            case, high or low, rich or poor, to testify. The bill then passed the House by yeas 63,

            on the bill [H. R. 637] for the construction of the new State House. The committee
            agreed to a 2 per cent. tax, and to authorize the governor, auditor and treasurer of
            state to borrow money on the credit of the State, for the purpose of paying any existing
            loans, as such loans may fall due, and to appropriate $100,000 during the year 1880, to
            be used for the building of the State House, to be paid out of any money in said fund
            not otherwise appropriated. </p>

          <p>The SPEAKER, in his turn, by request, called up the bill [S. 258] to legalize the acts
            of the board of county commissioners of Allen county, and the acts of the Common Council
            of Fort Wayne, etc., was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. FLEMING, being in too feeble health to address the House, the clerk read from his
            pen as follows: At my earnest solicitation the speaker has called up this bill. I am not
            in sufficient health to address the House upon the subject. This bill is of the greatest
            importance to Fort Wayne, and the citizens are anxiously awaiting its passage. Some six
            years ago the City Council of Fort Wayne considered it for the best interests of the
            city to annex certain lands lying adjacent to the city. Under the law it was necessary
            for a majority of the Council to sign a petition to the county commissioners that they
            would permit such annexation. A resolution embracing such petition was unanimously
            passed by the Council. A copy of this resolution, properly certified to by the city
            clerk, was presented to the commissioners by the city attorney. Thereupon the
            commissioners granted. the petition, and the lands became a part of the city. As is
            represented to me--and I be-[lieve] <pb n="16" xml:id="VAA8558-17-266"/> [be]-lieve it
            to be true--the people owning these lands were perfectly willing to have them annexed.
            For six years they have contentedly paid city taxes, and have had the benefit of city
            improvements. In fact, these lands now constituted some of the best portions of the
            city. The streets and sidewalks thereon have been paved and properly built. The people
            have the advantage of the fire alarm telegraph and of all improvements belonging to the
            best portions of the city. The defect sought to be cured by this bill is the non-signing
            of the petitioners to the commissioners by a majority of the Council, as the law
            directs. There has as yet been no litigation concerning these lands, nor is there
            present prospect of any such thing, yet my people are very anxious to have the matter
            settled beyond controversy, and I hope the House will see fit to pass the bill. </p>

          <p>Mr. WATSON offered a resolution, which was adopted, that as n number of bills passed

          <p> Mr. HEFRON made an ineffectual motion--yeas 20, nays 24--to reconsider the vote of
            last Saturday by which the committee amendment to increase the salary of deputy
            secretary of state from $1,000 to $1,500, was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. W1LSON moved to amend by striking out the committee amendment increasing the
            auditor of state's salary from 81,500 to 82,000.</p>
          <p> Mr. GRUBBS insisted that no salary can be fixed in an appropriation bill. He admitted
            81,500 is not enough as a salary for the auditor of state, but the salary is fixed at
            81,500 by a law passed by a Democratic Legislature, and this Legislature has no right to
            appropriate a single dollar more as a salary for that officer, and every dollar that
            officer draws for salary above 81,500 would be wrongfully and unlawfully taken. He
            believed in standing by the law. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES referred to the general appropriation bill passed by a Republican House of
            Representatives two years ago, allowing a salary of $2,500 for the auditor of state.
            Each Legislature is a law to itself, and if we vote to appropriate $2,500 to an officer
            of the State, that officer would have a right to it. He did not believe $1,000 was
            salary enough for the gallant old soldier now in that office, who followed the flag of
            our country through two wars. It is niggardly to ask a man to bring his family here and
            take charge of that responsible office for $1,500. It Is not the Intention of the law
            that an officer shall leave another employment for a meager salary, but it is expected
            he can return to private life with money accumulated while in office. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE admired the war record of the present auditor of state, but is it right and
            proper, from that tact alone, to increase his salary in this questionable way, when the
            law Bays his nominal salary shall be but $1,500? The real salary is $6,000, or more, as
            the outgoing auditor will say. Mr. D. believed the courts would not allow the auditor to
            draw more than $1,500 from the State treasury, even if a larger salary be named in this
            appropriation bill. He deprecated the attempt to drag politics into this question. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS regarded this as no time to increase fees and salaries. The people are not
            demanding an increase of salaries. These offices are striven after, with the salaries
            attached to them, and he objected to any increase. He also objected to lugging in this
            debate, allusion to the military record of any official for the purpose of influencing
            members. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD asked if this is not a political measure why do senators on the other side
            vote together on this question ? </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD was opposed to reducing the salary of the auditor of state below the amount
            now fixed by law. The officer is not paid now half as much as the majority of county
            officers receive for less services. We must pay the State officers a living salary.
            Unless the State pays its officers a living salary it invites incompetency and
            dishonesty in the public service. The people want and should have a reduction of
            salaries where it can be done without consummating a wrong to the officers and the
            State. The people, we hear so much talked of here are not crazy, but reasonable upon
            this subject, and we should handle it without partisan bias.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOSTER insisted Democrats promised to stand by a reduction of salaries; and there
            is where he will be found first, last and all the time. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER regarded it as the office of the appropriation bill to pay the fees and
            salaries allowed in the statute.</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON regretted the direction this discussion has taken. In the consideration of
            this bill the question of fees and salaries should not be discussed ft the salary of a
            State officer is too low it is not our fault. Our duty in this bill is to appropriate
            the money to pay the salary as fixed by law. When the question comes up la proper shape
            he would vote for an increase in the salary of this officer. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE said his sentiments were expressed in the remarks just made: and for the
            additional reason there may soon be a bill reported from the<orgName> fee and salary
              committee</orgName>, be moved to postpone the consideration of this bill till day
            after to-morrow. If the salary is but $1,500, as fixed by law, there is no reason in
            putting in the appropriation bill a larger amount. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Messrs. OLDS, FOSTER and KRAMER opposed the motion to postpone, which was rejected by

            auditor's clerks in the land and insurance departments from $1,000 to $1,200
            each. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored the motion. Good clerks can be had now for $1,000 a year; $1,500
            two years ago is no better than 81,000 now. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM understood it took men peculiarly qualities. to nil these positions.
            He paid $1,200 a year for a reasonably fair bookkeeper, and did not believe that too
            much.</p>

            whole by stealing anything about the positions they could find to steal. He claimed to
            be a Jeffersonian Democrat- one who believes in advocating and practicing those
            principles which, carried out in the administration of government, will best preserve
            the public order, confer the roost good upon the greatest number, and leave the largest
            personal liberty consistent with the public order. Anything more or less than this is
            not Democracy. Anything more or less is not Republicanism. Any partisan who is not in
            favor of this is not an American in sentiment, but an imperialist, and ought not to take
            part in a free government, the question is, shall we maintain the dignity and honor of
            the State? Democracy requires that we should maintain it. To do so our State offices
            must be filled by competent men--in integrity, ability and dignity--paid a compensation
            equal to their services and to enable them to maintain the dignity of their office,
            their official position and associations, and of the State. Then, by such penal laws as
            may be necessary we should make it dangerous for them to do or be other than the State
            and the people require them to be, as officials in duties and dignity. </p>

        <p> The reading of the minutes was dispensed with.</p>
        <p> The SPEAKER announced the first thing in order was a vote on the passage of the bill [H.
          R. 620] to provide for a general system of common schools. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said while this is a codification of the school law, this Legislature would
          be responsible for the passage of the act, and he desired unanimous consent to amend so as
          to reduce the levy for a special school tax to 20 cents instead of 50 cents on the $100,
          and to reduce the poll tax from $1 to 50 cents. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER thought the reduction proposed was too low. He would favor a levy of 30 or 35
          cents. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON was also in favor of a reduction.</p>
        <p> Mr. REED: Where there are debts for school houses, the trustees should be allowed to
          levy a tax that would enable the debt to be paid. He thought it would be unwise to limit
          the levy to 20 cents--it was too low. </p>
        <p>Mr. STUCKER would like to vote for this bill, but could not do so unless the amendments
          were adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER was glad the bill was in the shape it was, because, if this bill is defeated,
          the law would stand as it is now, and he should object to the amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. STEVENS said in his part of the State they could not get along with less than a levy
          of 40 cents on the $100.</p>
        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER moved to recommit the bill and amendments. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS said this bill does not change a word in the law as it now is. It simply puts
          the different acts together, and if the House undertook to amend this he was fearful of
          destroying the object of the codification. He thought the bill ought to pass just as it
          is. He hoped the motion to recommit would not be insisted upon. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH thought the best way would be to recommit this bill. While he was in favor of
          lowering the tax, yet in many places where fine school houses are commenced they will need
          the tax as it now stands. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH thought if this bill becomes a law to day, and to-morrow some other bill
          passes that amends the school law in some particular section, that law could not be found,
          as it would be smothered up in this bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, was in favor of recommitting the bill to a select committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON wanted to mature the bill before it should be passed.</p>
        <p> Mr. TULLEY said it was well understood that the school law was now badly scattered, and
          he was afraid that if these amendments were considered we would be unable to agree, and
          this codification would be destroyed. He hoped the bill would pass as it is, and was
          opposed to recommitting the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER was in favor of the bill as it is, and thought it, ought not to be recommitted. </p>
        <p>The bill was then recommitted to a select committee of five.</p>
        <p> Subsequently the SPEAKER made that committee to consist of Messrs. Overmeyer, March.
          Baker, Humpreys and Miers.</p>
        <p> Mr. DAVIDSON, from the <orgName>committee on agriculture</orgName>, returned the bill
          [H. R 635] regulating the running at large of domestic animals, recommending its passage.
          The House refused to concur in the report. </p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed, which was agreed to. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. WORKS the House took up the report of the committee on the
          investigation of the office of auditor of state. </p>
        <p>The majority report was submitted and read recommending the adoption of the following
          resolution: That the attorney general be instructed to commence an action for the recovery
          of all the moneys that may have been received by Mr. E. Henderson, while auditor of state,
          that may in the opinion of the attorney general be entitled, and to prosecute such action
          to final judgment, if possible, in such manner as to obtain a judicial construction of the
          statutes relative to the proportion or amount of moneys received from insurance companies
          to which the State is entitled. </p>
        <p>The minority of the committee submitted a lengthy report recommending the adoption of the
          following resolution: </p>
        <!--Resolution-->
        <!--P.19 of Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <floatingText>

              <p>Resolved, That the attorney general be instructed to ascertain what amount of fees
                have been collected by the said Henderson and not paid into the treasury, and upon
                failure of said Henderson to pay said amount into the <pb n="20" xml:id="VAA8558-17-270"/> treasury within 30 days, that the attorney general bring
                suit therefor on his own official bond as auditor of state. </p>
            </div>

        <p>Then came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> The House concurred in the amendment of the Senate to the House amendments to the bill
            [S. 125] for the punishment of persons in possession of stolen property, by inserting:
            in the second section after the word "stolen" in the fifth line the
            words "in any other State and been brought into this State." </p>
          <p>The unfinished business at the adjournment for dinner--viz., the consideration of the
            majority and minority reports of the committee appointed to investigate the office of
            auditor of state--was resumed. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS said this was an important question to the State and to Mr Henderson. The
            amount in controversy is something over $13,000. The minority report shows there has
            been collected, extra fees under the act of 1877, over $8,000 in one year and over
            $16,000 since the law took effect. The question is whether Mr. Henderson should account
            for 75 per cent. of these fees to the State. The minority report concludes that he is
            bound to account for this amount. The majority holds that he is not indebted to the
            State for the fees, but recommends that he be sued for the amount,. This seems to be
            inconsistent, and if Mr. Henderson owes the State nothing this House would do him an
            injustice to order that such suit be brought. He called the attention of the House to
            the amount that has been paid to this office for salary, deputy and clerks and office
            expenses, and insurance fees, $22,644. This being true we should not pay him more than
            the statute allows him. As to the law, the minority of the committee are supported in
            their position by Attorney Generals Woollen and Buskirk, and Mr. Henderson himself, who
            issued a circular to the companies, in which he claimed the right to collect these extra
            fees, and that he had no discretion in the matter because the law was one to raise
            revenue for the State. In addition to the fees charged Mr. Henderson has used postage
            stamps amounting to about $600, furnished by the State, to send out the certificates of
            the agents of the companies,and instead of accounting to the State for the money
            collected has converted the same to his own use. It can hardly be claimed that any
            construction of the statute would allow him this money, and all of the committee agree
            that he should pay it over to the State. An effort is being made by parties interested
            in this matter to have both of these reports laid on the. table, thereby smothering the
            whole matter. This would be wrong. This question should be fairly met and one or the
            other of these reports adopted.</p>
          <p> Mr. SAINT said he voted for the resolution to investigate the accounts of the auditor
            of state. We have the reports from the committee and they do not agree, but recommend
            that a suit be brought by the attorney general in order to settle a disputed question.
            In view of the fact that the committee can not agree this House should lay both reports
            upon the table and adopt the resolution recommended in the report of the majority, and
            therefore he moved to lay the majority and minority reports upon the table, and that the
            resolution of the majority be adopted. </p>
          <p>The motion was ruled out of order, </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said this investigation committee was raised by an almost unanimous vote,
            but on the very next day a resolution was introduced for a reconsideration, and with a
            view to refer the whole matter to the attorney general. A fair and. thorough
            investigation was proceeded with, as both the voluminous and exhaustive reports will
            show. The majority of the committee had taken the pains to furnish the opinion of the
            attorney general and also the opinion of Mr. Henderson, all of which fully decides that
            these fees are properly collected as a part of the revenue of the State, and 75 per
            cent. of them must be now due to the State. He wanted to know what the majority of this
            House meant after this thorough investigation, developing the facts that there is
            $13,000 due the State, by making a motion to lay both reports on the table. There was
            not an ungentlemanly word or insinuation in either report against the ex- auditor, He
            thought perhaps thy committee had done their work too welt to suit the majority. If the
            House desired to treat the minority of the committee with contempt, let it move to lay
            the report under the table rather than on the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD moved to lay both reports upon the table.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH demanded a division of the question.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The first question being on the motion to lay the minority report on the table, it was
            rejected by yeas 29, nays 53. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The majority report was laid on the table by yeas 55, nays 29. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. MIERS said the only difference between these two reports is the construction of a
            statute. The minority and majority agree that Mr. Henderson never at any time disguised
            or attempted in any way to conceal the fact, that he charged and retained all of said
            fees, claiming that he was entitled to do so by a fair construction of said statute, and
            that Mr. Henderson. upon request, furnished the committee with all of the facts desired.
            The majority and minority of the committee agree that construction of the statute is
            difficult, and the majority of the committee say that they have come to the conclusion
            that a fair construction of the statute would give the auditor all of said fees, while
            the minority say that with considerable difficulty they have come to the conclusion that
            the auditor should pay into the treasury 75 per cent. thereof. There being therefore
            nothing that reflects on Mr. Henderson's integrity as a man, or as a just and
            upright officer, but simply a question of law, he was sorry that the matter of adopting
            or rejecting either the majority or minority report had been forced upon the House. He
            thought the House ought to be very slow to adopt reports or resolutions like the one
            under consideration, lest a very great injustice might be done by placing one of the
            citizens of the State in the light of having done a dishonest act, when they only meant
            to give their judgment as to a proper construction of a statute. He therefore thought it
            would have been much wiser to have instructed the attorney general to bring suit for the
            recovery of the money in controversy. Then there might have been a determination of the
            legal question, the only one in controversy, without doing violence to any citizen.
            Under the operation of the previous question, the minority report was adopted by yeas
            58, nays 30.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD offer a concurrent resolution that this General Assembly will adjourn sine
            die on Monday, March 24,1879. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS moved to amend, by adding "if we are ready to do so." </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH offered a substitute that thia General Assembly, before taking up matters of
            general legislation, proceed at once to perfect and pass the general and specific
            appropriation bill and the state House bill, and no other business shall be taken up
            until they are finally disposed of, and that, upon their passage, we immediately adjourn
            sine die. </p>

          <p>The following numbered Senate bills were read the first time, and passed to the second

        <p>On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK the Senate proceeded with the unfinished business of yesterday,
          viz.: the consideration of the amendments proposed by the Senate committee on finance to
          the general appropriation bill [H. R. 592]. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

        <p>The amendment increasing the appropriation to the State prison south from $70,000 to
          $75,000 was agreed to by yeas 36, nays 10. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM stated reasons for this increase: The amount named is the lowest
          possible limit. The directors of the prisons should not be encouraged to incur
          indebtedness, etc., etc. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The amendment increasing the appropriation for the House of Refuge for Boys, from $40,000
          to $45,000 was rejected by yeas 21, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Mr. RAGAN understood there was a saving on the last appropriation for the House of Refuge
          of some $10,000, which was covered back in the State treasury, but he favored this
          amendment because it is only $1,000 more than was used by that institution. </p>
        <p>Messrs. WINTERBOTHAM and FOWLER were satisfied this amendment should, be adopted. This
          institution is growing probably as rapidly as any other of the State's wards. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT opposed this increase to the House of Refuge. </p>

        <p>Mr. SHIRK favoring this item. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, seated the institution was in debt some $1,300 now. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS was opposed to squandering the public money, and while willing to vote for
          necessary supplies did not believe this increase to the Reformatory advisable. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS, the $3,000 for the Normal school was reduced to $2,000.</p>
        <p> Mr. DICE moved to strike out the committee amendment adding $2,000 to the $2,000
          appropriated in the bill for the Purdue University being read. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES brought up the question as to whether the connection of the State with these
          educational institutions should not be severed. If the State has a right under the
          constitution to appropriate money to these institutions let it be done generously and not
          doled out in this pitiful way our form of Government knows no class and why should it take
          money from the people by the enforcement of taxation and appropriate it to the support of
          a school for any particular caste for the diffusion of technology and scientific
          agriculture anymore than for any other particular avocation or profession. The question
          is; Have we a right, under the organic laws of the State, to give a dollar to such an
          Institution? These precedents are being established at almost every General Assembly and
          there will be no end to this thing. Try this institution on its endowment fund of $15,000
          per annum and see if that will not sustain it. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE read article 8 of the State constitution, thinking that clause should remove
          all doubt, but that the trainers of that organic law had in their minds just such schools
          as the Purdue University, the State Normal and the University of Bloomington. He spoke at
          length in favor of bestowing upon these institutions the fostering care of the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICK believed the people were fostering too many educational institutions. In 1873
            <pb n="23" xml:id="VAA8558-17-273"/> there were $60,000 appropriated for the Purdue
          University, and he appealed to the records to show that every year since its organization
          Purdue has had appropriations from the State treasury, while that institution was located
          with the distinct understanding it should not be a charge upon the State. He wanted to
          know where this thing should stop? It is not the duty of the State to provide for the
          maintenance of an institution for the education of any particular class. It must stop some
          where, and the proper stopping place is with a proper system of common schools. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER: As Purdue University is the only State institution which makes any
          profession to work in the interest of agriculture, he felt it a duty to stand by Purdue.
          He saw no good reason in retrograding or going backward', and if we wipe out
          Purdue it will be only a question of time when there will be no farmers occupying seats on
          this floor where there are now 31 lawyers, and comparatively few representatives of the
          agricultural community. He wanted to see the agricultural Interests better cultivated but
          so long as you listen to the sirew songs of these professional lawyers, so long the
          agricultural community must occupy the background it is the agricultural interest that
          pays the most taxes, and it is for the interest of the State to stand by Purdue
          University. He desired to see the farmer elevated. The wealth or this country has to start
          from the soil, and why now stop the only institution that represents the oldest art known
          to man? Commerce and manufacture might be stricken down, but educated agriculture can
          reproduce them all. Agriculture is the fountain of all political power--the guardian of
          liberty--and if the fountain is impure the stream must be foul. Elevate the farmer--give
          him hope for elevation and reward--and it will be found to add to the interest of the
          State and the entire country. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRISCOE had a much higher opinion of agricultural interests than many others,
          regarding it as the first in the land But that interest is not regarded in Purdue
          University, for its principal agricultural officer does not exist. The Board has abolished
          the superintendent of the agricultural department--that official is wiped out. A person to
          learn any branch of industry must have a competent tutor, and there is no tutor now in
          Purdue for the farmer boys. Ninety-three thousand dollars has been appropriated in the
          last six years to that institution, and now why is the paltry sum of $2,000 asked for? How
          much good will that do the great farming interest of the State? </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT: Experience has shown the common school system elevates the lower level, but is
          it not necessary for a farmer to understand chemistry. Intelligence and brains always go
          to the front, and as there is not one common school tea-her in 50 that can teach
          chemistry, should the farmer boy not be permitted to go to some school where he can learn
          the higher knowledge that will enable him to pursue the occupation of farming in an
          intelligent way. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT could see but two questions involved in this discussions: First, the duty of
          the State, and next, the propriety of making the appropriations for such objects. The
          State should not undertake to do for the few what she can not do for the many. But for the
          reason that with one other appropriation it is expected this institution will be
          self-sustaining, he should vote for the sum asked for now, while not committing himself to
          the principle of keeping up the higher branches of education in this State. Then came the
          recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON was aware, in opposing this appropriation, he was antagonizing very
            respectable classes; but this university is sailing under the nag of an agricultural
            college, while, upon close examination, but little agriculture will be found in it. Only
            five students are engaged in that particular study. The landholder knows that this
            institution is there, that taxes are paid for its support, and that is about all the
            farmers of Indian a know about it. If this institution was of sufficient practicable
            benefit to the farmers of this State, he would not oppose an appropriation of $25,000 if
            necessary.</p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER held it expedient and right for the State to help support these institutions
            designed to educate farmers, lawyers and teachers. An agricultural school is needed in
            this State, because farming should be made attractive and remunerative. This college
            bids fair, in the near future, to become a self-sustaining institution, and he did not
            thinly the people would complain if this small pittance is appropriated. </p>
          <p>Mr. HART referred to the fact that men are quitting the business of farming, and
            lawyers and doctors are becoming thicker with every passing year; consequently it is the
            duty of the State to encourage institutions devoted to the advancement of agricultural
            interests, and to encourage everything that will tend to elevate the farming community,
            and thus in the speediest manner possible put this country upon a prosperous footing
            again. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON declared mat so much had been said, and so well said, but little was left
            for him to say in favor of making appropriations to Purdue University. He went on to
            show that the State of Indiana is under moral as well as legal obligation to maintain
            this institution and give to it moral and pecuniary support. Though having no
            oppportunity, while still in its infancy, to make any great showing, yet if the increase
            already indicated, goes on, it will outstrip, within a few years, the oldest
            institutions in the land. </p>

        <p> Mr. SCHWEITZER insisted that Mr. Wild- man's term should be investigated as
          well as that of Mr. Henderson's. If there is any fraud, we want to find it out. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought if the members of the minority desired to do what was right they
          should have proceeded to the investigation of the office during Mr. Wildman's
          term.</p>
        <p> Mr. OVERMEYER, as a member of that committee, was willing to proceed with any
          investigation that was necessary and right. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLEY thought the four years prior to Mr. Henderson's term should be
          investigated. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMPTON offered a concurrent resolution that this special session adjourn sine die on
          Saturday, March 22, 1879 at 10 o'clock a. m. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. ARNOLD, of Blackford, the resolution was laid on the table by yeas 44,
          nays 40. </p>
        <p>Mr. 0VERMEYER introduced a bill [H. R. 668] to establish a board of pardons, which was
          read the first time and passed to the second reading. The following described bills were
          read the second time and referred to appropriate committees: </p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor of Daviess bill [H. R. 657] to amend the practice act. Also Mr.
          Herod's bill [H. R. 658] to amend an act authorizing insurance companies to
          reinsure their risks, and close business. Also Mr. Conner's bill [H. R. 859] for
          the protection of the consumers of milk. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD, from the <orgName>committee on cities and towns</orgName>, returned the bill
          [S. 131] for the election of a Police Judge, with amendments, and when amended,
          recommended its passage. The report was rejected. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. ENGLISH, the bill was laid on the table. He moved further to
          reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that motion on the table. The latter motion was
          agreed to. </p>
        <p>The bill, [S. 83] providing for the election of justices of the peace; also, the bill,
          [S. 79] to secure more efficient work and material in performances of contracts for public
          works, etc.; also, the bill, [S. 62] to secure dues from private corporations; also, the
          bill, [S. 59] to amend the act for the incorporation of towns etc., were read the second
          time and referred to appropriate committees.</p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. HEROD the bill, [S.21] to establish city courts in cities having a
          population of 6,000 inhabitants, was taken from the table and placed upon the files. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALDEN called up Mr. Schweitzer's bill, [H. R. 115] to amend the act for the
          observance of the Sabbath. </p>
        <p>Mr. SCHWEITZER said it only changes the present law so as to allow barbers to shave their
          customers on Sunday. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill finally passed the House by yeas 52, nays 27. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam, called up his bill; [H. R. 638] legalising the proceedings of the
          board of State House commissioners, which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS did not think we ought to tie down the plans for the erection of the new State
          House, so as to prevent a change when the fact might be developed that a change was
          necessary. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNER could not vote for this bill because the question of the insufficiency of the
          bonds had been mooted, and the Legislature ought not to act hasty in the matter of
          legalizing the acts of those commissioners. </p>
        <p>Mr. VANPELT said this was one of the bills that he hoped would pass, because when you
          begin to change the plans you enlarge the ex-expense, and instead of $2,000,000 the State
          House may cost $4,000,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. HESS hoped this bill would not pass. We ought not to say that the bond is sufficient
          when we know nothing about it. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN thought this bill only legalized what had been done by the State House
          commissioners, and would prevent law suits. He did not see any good reason why this bill
          should not pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnum: It was for the interest of the State and the only opposition he had
          heard come from contractors. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->

        <p>Mr. CONNER moved ineffectually to recommit; with instructions to strike out the
          legalizing section. The bill then failed to pass the House for want of a constitutional
          majority by yeas 48, nays 33. </p>
        <p>Mr. ARNOLD of Blackford's name being <pb n="25" xml:id="VAA8558-17-275"/> called
          in the order of the call for bringing up bills--Mr. SHANKS said he had been railed home,
          but had left word that he desired to call up the bill [H. R. 368] for the relief of Geo.
          M. Winchell and other sureties of Jos. D. Brearley, a defaulting trustee of Center
          township, Grant county, which was read the third time.</p>
        <p> Mr. TULLY thought the Legislature could not pass a law interfering with private
          contracts. He had understood that many citizens of Grant county were protesting against
          the passage of this bill, and he hoped the bill would not pass. </p>

        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> Mr. ARNOLD, of Wabash, called up his bill [H. R. 442] to amend the common school law so
          that when a person has been transferred for education, purposes to a township, town, or
          city in an adjoining county, the trustee of the township from which such transfer has been
          made shall pay to the trustee of the township to which such transfer has been made,
          immediately after the receipt of the school revenues from the county treasurer, was read
          the third time and passed by yeas 56, nays 25. </p>
        <p>Mr. BAKER called up Mr. Huthsteiner's bill [H. R. 428] prescribing the duties of
          county boards--two commissioners can do business. The county shall be divided into three
          districts, as near equal as possible commissioners to be elected by the resident voters of
          each district, which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Osborne, of Elkhart, in the chair) said the bill simply changes the law
          by allowing the commissioners to be elected by the voters of the district they represent
          only. </p>
        <p>Mr. DAILEY could not see any good that would come from the passage of this bill, and as
          it would increase expenses he did not think the bill ought to pass, </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought there were several objections, in that there could not be a fair
          division of the counties where the townships were of a number not divisible by 3. </p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH said it would work an injustice to Marion county.</p>
        <p> Mr. CALDWELL could not see any advantage in the change, and thought it would make
          rouble, and therefore was opposed to its passage. </p>

          <p>Mr. BEARSS introduced a bill [H. R. 669] to amend sections 19 and 20 of an act for the
            opening, vacation, and changing of highways, which was read the first time and passed to
            the second reading. </p>
          <p>Mr. 0VERMEYER, from the select committee thereon, returned the common school
            codification bill [H. R. 630] with amendments, and when so amended recommended its
            passage. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the bill as it come from the committtee was nearly perfect, and if
            it could be as much more improved by another recommitment he would move to recommit it
            again. He fully approved of it now and he hoped it would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM thought the teachers should not be required to spend two or three days
            in attending institutes, without paying them for it,; nor should there be a
            day's work deducted therefrom because they do not attend. He thought the
            trustees,of the several townships of the county were better qualified to elect the
            county superitendents than were the county commissioners. He was opposed to the report. </p>

        <p>Mr. REEVE introduced a bill (S. 455] to provide for insuring property belonging to the

          motion was agreed to and the Senate amendments to the bill were ordered engrossed for the

        <p>Leaves of absence were severally asked and obtained for seven or eight senators,
          whereupon--</p>
        <p> Mr. LEEPER offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourn it be till Monday.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS, without wishing to reflect on members, deprecated the granting of leaves of
          absences, opposed the resolution, and urged dispatch of business in order that the session
          may speedily be brought to a close. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES thought it hardly generous for the senator who has the privilege of going
          home from this chamber to his household and family at all hours of the day, and who has
          never been removed from his house one night this year, to reflect upon others who can not
          enjoy those privileges. It being evident, since last night when senators commenced going
          away, and this morning while others are making preparations to go, that there would be
          nothing done Monday morning, he had accepted an invitation to visit with a gentleman
          outside of Indianapolis over Sunday, bat he would not stand in the way of finishing the
          work of this session, and so withdrew his request for leave of absence. Several other
          senators who were granted the same also withdrew their leaves of absence. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER asked and obtained leave to withdraw his resolution, saying that he offer- ed
          it. because so many leaves of absence were being granted it was evident the Senate would
          be left without a quorum this after- noon, </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. KENT the Senate agreed to proceed to the consideration of House bills

          become laws because not presented to the governor for his signature within the time
          prescribed by the constitution. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 661] to legalize certain acts of commissioners of Clinton county in the
          purchase of a certain tract of land at sheriff's sale (similar to the bill H. R.

        <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the constitutional rule was suspended--yeas 35, nays 1--and the
          bill read the second time by title only, the third time by sections, and passed by yeas
          34, nays 7. He said the bill should have been drawn so as to permit the County
          Commissioners to settle these accounts, but since the decease of the principal the only
          other recourse is by way of this bill; no money relief being involved, it is right, and
          should be passed. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 663] to amend the charter of Evansville so as to admit of a change to the

          <p> Mr. PETERSON said this is another of those bills passed both Houses last session, but
            which failed to receive the governor's signature. He moved that the

          <p>The House concurrent resolution for paying expenses of witnesses, etc., in the matter
            of the State House Investigating Committee, amounting to $515.64, with a favorable
            report from the Finance Committee, was read.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT moved to strike out the names of the parties who instigated this
            prosecution.</p>
          <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM understood this investigation was instigated by the House of
            Representatives.</p>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR: This being a matter brought about, by the House of Representatives, he
            opposed any change in the resolution. He would vote against any cutting down by one
            House of any expense incurred by the other. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE opposed the resolution. While believing it to be the duty of this branch to
            concur with the other in all legitimate business of legislation, no expense should be
            incurred in following up street rumors, for that is beneath the dignity of a
            deliberative body. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR thought the fact that the State House Commissioners came out of the
            investigation fully sustained, was worth ten times more money than it has cost. The
            people will have more confidence in the future acts of these gentlemen than they would
            otherwise have had.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT insisted there never was any reasonable cause for this investigation. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES thought the adoption of the amendment would be making a very bad precedent.
            The amendment was rejected, and the resolution was adopted. </p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. TAYLOR the resolution was laid on the table. The joint resolution [H.
            R. 35] for the publication of the new interest law--2,000 copies to be distributed in
            each county then the governor to proclaim the act in full force and effect, was

            time. On his further motion the constitutional rule was dispensed with--yeas 34, nays
            0--the bill read the third time and passed by--yeas 34, nays 1. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOSTER the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on
            the second reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 53--Mr. Woollen's] to amend section 94 of the property assessment
            act of December 21, 1872, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS favored its passage. </p>
          <p>It was ordered engrossed for the third reading. The bill [S. 89--Mr.
            Winterbotham's] for the repeal of the savings bank law coming up with a
            committee report recommending indefinite postponement </p>
          <pb n="28" xml:id="VAA8558-17-278"/>

          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM hoped the report would not be concurred in. Under the present law the
            poor may be robbed of their hard earnings, and it ought not to remain on the statute
            books, for there is no protection under it to the depositors. He moved to amend the
            report by appropriately insert the words "that the bill do pass"
            instead of the recommendation for indefinite postponement.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE also hoped that the report would not be concurred in. He regarded these
            savings bank and national banks as a curse to the earth, and things that ought to be
            wiped out of existence.</p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY favored indefinite postponement. Gentlemen in favor of national banks desire
            this law repealed, and wished to see saving banks stricken down. If this were passed
            into a law, what will be the result? In every county where there is a savings bank that
            institution would proceed to wind up its affairs and collect their outstanding claims,
            institute suit against perhaps one-half of the citizens, foreclose mortgages upon their
            real estate, and thus result in injury to these localities by bringing distress to many.
            If they are forced to proceed to collect their paper through process of law, judgments
            will be obtained, executions will issue, lands will be levied upon and sold at a
            sacrifice, and in many instances the property of the debtors will not sell for enough to
            satisfy the debt, and as a result depositors will have to lose their money.</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE: The history of savings banks in the past few years in the United States
            justifies the statement that there should be either an unconditional prohibition of all
            savings banks, or else that kind of legislation enacted for the protection of depositors
            which it is almost impossible to enforce. Shall we permit these things to stand without
            further protection? The metropolitan press have been burdened with cries for the
            protection of the people from these savings banks for years, and to-day
            ninteen-twentieths of such institutions are in the hands of receivers. As soon as
            savings banks are wiped out the general Government will afford facilities for the poor
            to save their money in small sums where the security is undoubted.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE thought every man who had the good of the people at heart at least should
            approve the amendment. How many thousand times have the confidence of the people been
            betrayed by these savings banks? If this act be repealed much weeping and wailing will
            be saved to the poor people of the State. He characterized national banks as a great
            political swindle, and spoke in favor of the pending amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said not one of the savings banks known to him confines itself to the
            law. When aid and comfort is given to such a law as is not on our statute book we enable
            these men to take money from the poor and divert it to their own use. Their managers are
            not responsible for a dollar. This bill gives them ample time to close up their
            business, and it should speedily become a law. </p>

          <p>Mr. REEVE called attention to the fact that all except two of the savings banks in this
            State have violated the provisions of their charters, if not in some other way, at least
            in the one things of loaning money outside of the county in which the institutions is
            located.</p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER referred to the fact that savings banks have been a success in the East; and
            in the State of New York, where they are operated under a law almost precisely like the
            one in Indiana. If our law is weak in any particular, it ought to be amended. As for his
            county, not a single man, woman, child or newspaper is in favor of winding up these
            banks, as far as he had heard; and he would oppose this bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT insisted the savings bank system has been beneficial as well as injurious.
            It has taught many to be saving: but, having come upon too troublesome times, losses had
            to follow, on account of shrinkage. It has been utterly impossible to handle large or
            small sums with safety. The worst thing this Legislature can do is pour out arguments of
            distrust in the ears of the people; and to pass a law to wipe these institutions out of
            existence would be a mistake. Instead of tending to break down confidence, the effort
            should be to build it up. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER said the banks in his town are managed by responsible men who have the
            confidence of the citizens there, and he was well satisfied not one dollar would be lost
            by any depositor so long as they are in the hands of the present managers; and he
            objected to such banks as these being made scape goats for others in other places which
            have been badly managed.</p>
          <p>Mr. COFFEY was not special advocate of savings banks, but he thought it impolitic and
            unwise at this time to repeal this law, as it would result in great evil to many
            localities in this State. In most of these banks depositors are not likely to lose much
            if any money by their mismanagement.</p>
          <p>The Senate then adjourned.</p>

        <!--P. 29 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL called up his bill [H. R. 642] to legalize the incorporation of the town of
          Walton, which was read the third time and passed the House by yeas 71, nays 5.</p>
        <p> Mr. CARTER called up the bill [S. 374] to alter and amend the charter of the town of
          Clarksville, etc., which was read the third time and failed to pass the House by yeas 33,
          nays 41. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and also moved to lay the motion to
          reconsider on the table.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The motion to lay on the table failed by yeas 20, nays 53.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The motion to reconsider was then agreed to by--yeas 57, nays 19.</p>
        <p> On the motion of Mr. JOHNSON the bill was recommitted to the <orgName>committee on
            cities and towns</orgName> with instructions to insert an emergency clause. </p>
        <p>Amendments were also submitted by Messrs. Willard and Overmeyer which, by consent went to
          the same committee. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMPTON called up Mr. Willard's bill [H. R. 643] to amend section 58 of an
          act to repeal all general laws now in force for the incorporation of cities--taxes may be
          assessed and collected on personal property of all persons residing within one mile of the
          corporation lines of any city where the parties may be engaged in business inside the city
          limits.</p>
        <p> Mr BEARSS was opposed to the bill because it reaches outside of the corporation to tax
          personal property for city purposes </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS and Mr. MIERS thought this bill was clearly wrong, and ought not to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. VAN PELT said it would be unfair to lax persons outside the city limits who were
          unprotected by the city fire department and had not the advantages of other city
          improvements. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill failed to pass the House by yeas 3, nays 70.</p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said he did not believe
          in taxing the property of a man who lived a mile outside the city, simply from the tact
          that the man did business in the city.</p>
        <p> Mr. FAULKNER,when his name was called in explanation of his vote, said : As he did not
          believe in these slick-haired gentlemen reaching out all over the State to tax us farmers
          to help keep up their city style. He voted "No." </p>
        <p>Mr. CONFER called up Mr. Garroutte's bill [H. R. 604] requiring all regular
          passenger trains on railroads to stop at all stations of incorporated towns or clues,
          which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARROUTTE said this was a bill in which his constituents were very much interested.
          It was great inconvenience to parties living in smaller towns when going home to be
          compelled to ride by their stations from four tonight or 10 miles, or be compelled to wait
          as many hours after their business is completed for the train designated to stop at the
          station nearest their homes. He hoped the bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS said: This bill proposes to fine a railroad company if it fails to stop its
          trains at certain towns on the line of its road. This, he thought, could not be done. The
          constitution provides that the person prosecuted shall have the right to meet the
          witnesses face to lace. How would you bring a corporation race to face with a witness? The
          statute provides that the defendant shall be arrested. The sheriff could hardly arrest a
          corporation. If the company should fail to pay the fine it could not he imprisoned. The
          statute also provides that upon the trial of a defendant he shall be present in person,
          unless some responsible person will become responsible for any fine that may be imposed,
          if no responsible person should appear, as required, the company could not be tried ;
          therefore the bill, if passed, could have no effect, and therefore no such law should be
          placed on the statute book. </p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS was in favor of railroad trains stopping at all stations and at all times. The
          roads were built for the accommodation of the public. He was surprised to see gentlemen on
          this floor always favoring corporations as against individuals. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill failed to pass the House of Representatives by--yeas 30, nays 38. </p>
        <p>It being near 12 o'clock, a motion was made that when the House adjourns it
          adjourns till Monday afternoon, which gave rise to considerable discussion. When the
          question came to a vote, the yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken
          discovered no quorum present. A call of the House followed and was continued in the vain
          endeavor to bring in a quorum till near two o'clock--the doors being kept locked
          for a portion of the time and the doorkeepers sent after absentees. Members reported as
          under arrest by the doorkeeper were excused, further proceedings under the call were
          dispensed with on the appearance of a quorum and at ten minutes after two
          o'clock--</p>
        <p> The House adjourned till Monday morning at nine o'clock.</p>

        <p> The minutes of Saturday's proceedings were not read.</p>
        <p> Indefinite leave of absence was granted Mr. REEVE on account of the dangerous illness of
          his sister. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL his bill [S. 427] to amend sections 1 and 2 of the act
          regulating public warehouses--by striking from sec. 1 the words "for one year
          thereafter," so as to keep the record for future use, and amending sec. 2 so that
          more than one building or room may ; be used under a single permit--was read the second
          time and ordered engrossed for the third reading. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BENZ the bill [S 426--Mr. Poindexter's] to amend sec. 3 of the
          act concerning the organization of voluntary associations so as to prevent voluntary
          associations from making any distinction on account of nativity, complexion or religious
          or political belief, in the dispensation of charity was read the second time and ordered
          engrossed.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK, his bill [S. 429] to legalize certain acts of the town of
          Washington, Wayne county, and the election held thereon in 1878, was read the second time
          and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. LEEPER, his bill [S. 253] defining the manner in which certain lands and
          properties in cities and towns may be taxed for corporation purposes--plats used for
          agricultural purposes shall not be taxed for city or town purposes a greater per cent.
          than in civil townships--was read the second time and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM his bill, [S. 89] to repeal the act creating savings banks,
          was taken up, but before it was read-- </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to indefinitely postpone it.</p>
        <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM believed before another session of the Legislature convenes every
          savings bank in the State would be in bankruptcy, and this Legislature will be blamed for
          not taking action on this matter, so as to save much suffering to the poor laborers and
          servant girls who have trusted and will trust these institutions with their hard earned
          savings. He appealed to the Senate not to postpone this bill, but on the contrary to
          perfect and pass it into a law. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 8, nays 28. </p>
        <p>Mr. COFFEY regarded the bill as very defective. He moved its reference to the
            <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM reminded the Senate that this bill was in the hands of the
            <orgName>committee on banks</orgName> one month and four days, which he considered ample
          time. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER favored the motion to refer. He denied any design on the part of the
            <orgName>committee on banks </orgName>to smother this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT regarded this as an unfavorable time to rush this measure through. He
          favored the reference to a committee and a full consideration of the bill before it is put
          upon the final vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM insisted there was no better time than now to take definite action on
          this bill; he desired it to be perfected and put on its passage without further delay.</p>
        <p> Mr. LEEPER made an ineffectual demand for the previous question. </p>
        <p>The motion to refer was rejected by--yeas 13, nays 25. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to substitute for the committee report an amendment to the bill
          allowing two years time for savings banks to wind up their business. Under the operations
          of the previous question demanded by him, this substitute was adopted by--yeas 32, nays 2. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON was opposed to this scheme from beginning to end. He believed it fraught with
          disaster to the best interests of the State. Savings banks are founded for the purpose of
          encouraging Industry, and of creating hope in the breast of those whose savings are small.
          The savings banks system is comparatively new in this State, yet millions of money have
          been taken from where it otherwise would have been wasted, and directed into the channels
          of trade, at the same time benefiting those who, on saving small sums, have been induced
          by these institutions to entrust money to their care. To require within 21 months that
          these hundreds <pb n="31" xml:id="VAA8558-17-281"/> of thousands of dollars shall be
          called in would crowd the State with confusion, and result in the bankruptcy of many. </p>
        <p>Mr. CADWALLADER also believed the passage of this bill would be detrimental to the
          interests of the State, and therefore opposed it. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS believed the bill would work disaster in the winding up of some 20 odd savings
          banks in this State. </p>
        <p>Mr KRAMER would rather modify the savings bank law than to abolish it, as is proposed in
          this bill. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The motion to adopt the bill was rejected by yeas 19, nays 20. </p>
        <p>Mr. HART offered a resolution giving precedence to the general and specific, fee and
          salary and apportionment bills priority, and as soon as they are passed declaring that
          "we will adjourn." </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER offered as a substitute a concurrent resolution that this General Assembly
          will adjourn sine die on Monday next at meridian.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL made an ineffectual motion--yeas 62, nays 27--to lay the substitute on the
          table. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.31 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to add a proviso, "that the general and specific appropriation
          bills and the congressional apportionment bill, the fee and salary bill and the
          metropolitan police bill shall have been passed by the Senate and House of
          Representatives," which was rejected, on motion by Mr. Grubbs--yeas 26, nays 23. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to add a proviso, "that the general and specific
          appropriation, fee and salary bill, and congressional apportion merit bills shall have
          passed the Senate and House of Representatives." </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Under the operation of the previous question, demanded by Mr. BURRELL, and a division of
          the propositions in the proviso, demanded by Mr. FOWLER, the general and specific
          appropriation division of the amendment was agreed to by--yeas 33, nays 7; the fee and
          salary division was also agreed to by yeas 34, nays 5; and the congressional apportion
          meat bill division of the amendment was also agreed to by--yeas 20, nays 17.</p>
        <p> The amendment, as a whole, was adopted by yeas 20, nays 16; and the substitute, as
          amended was also adopted. </p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. HARRIS the general appropriation bill [H. R. 592] was taken up and read
          as amended by the Senate for the third reading, pending the reading of which </p>
        <p>Came the recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> Mr. LEEPER made an ineffectual motion to recommit the bill with instructions to reduce
            the appropriation for current repairs on the Asylum for the Insane.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend so as to make the
            salary of the Adjutant General $825.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM this motion to recommit was rejected by--yeas 22, nays
            21. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE introduced a bill [S. 456] to provide for the government and discipline of
            the State prison (similar to the bill S. 27--see these reports Feb. 15 a. m., 17 p. m.
            and 18 a. m. which passed both Houses last session, but failed to receive the signature
            of the Governor because not presented within the time prescribed by the constitution),
            which was read the first time.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES moved to amend the bill by adding to section 20 a declaration that the
            warden selected on the llth of this month by the board of directors of the Northern
            prison, declared elected at the last session of this General Assembly, shall hold the
            office of warden for four years. He said those having the custody of law breakers should
            not be allowed to remain in the relation of breakers of the law themselves, and
            consequently this question ought to be speedily settled. He moved the bill and amendment
            be referred to a special committee of five lawyers (declining to serve on such committee
            himself), for the question is purely a matter of law. with instructions to report as
            soon as possible, in order that this disgraceful thing now going on in the northern end
            of the State may be settled, as to who shall or who shall not have charge of the
            Northern penitentiary for the next three or four years. If the parties now in possession
            have a right to it, let them have it, and avoid having a penal institution dragged into
            court and an unseemly and disgraceful wrangle going on for years.</p>
          <p> Mr. STREIGHT, being a friend of the bill hoped the amendment would not prevail, The
            question of law may come up at some other time, and he wanted the board of directors to
            be the managers and indeed and truly the board of control of the prisons. He objected to
            the principle of putting the wardens of the prisons under the control of the directors, </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT knew of no better way of settling this difficulty than by the amendment
            proposed. The directors have the power of electing a warden only as granted them by the
            Legislature, and the same authority can deprive them of that power. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES said his amendment simply legalizes the acts of the recently elected
            directors. This Legislature has the power to take this unseemly rivalry out of the
            courts. With a State penal institution now in possession, as one side contends, of
            law-breakers themselves, we would be neglectful of a plain duty, being in session, if we
            do not settle this dispute, and settle it speedily.</p>
          <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said this bill had passed both Houses and given universal
            satisfaction, and would now have been a law if it had gone before the governor within
            the time prescribed by the constitution, and to day he [Mr. Winterbotham] would not
            cross a "t" or dot an "i" in it. To legislate here
            now for or against one party or the other would be wrong. If the bill was a proper one
            last session it is a proper one now. He favored the original bill, and would vote
            against it if changed for or against either of these contending parties. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON said the bill as now introduced has a modification providing that a warden
            may be removed by the directors for cause; and that clause obviates one objection. He
            contended that it is proper to adopt such measures as will speedily quiet this trouble
            in a public institution, which he hoped would be passed upon and settled outside of the
            courts.</p>
          <p> The motion to refer to a special committee was agreed to, and the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
            made the committee to consist of Messrs. Viehe, Langdon, Kent, Dice and Urmston. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. POINDEXTER his bill S. 426 (described early in these reports this
            morning) was taken up, and under a dispensation of the constitutional restriction, was
            read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. P0INDEXTER explained that the board of county commissioners being authorized to
            pay 25 cents a day for the support of children in orphan asylums, this bill is simply
            for the purpose of authorizing the same to associations organized expressly to take care
            of colored children; that colored children, under such circumstances, shall be entitled
            to 25 cents a clay, the same as white children.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS made a similar explanation of the provisions of the bill.</p>
          <pb n="32" xml:id="VAA8558-17-282"/>
          <p> Mr. TAYLOR said it has been found practicable in some parts of the State to organize
            separate Orphan Asylums for colored children, and this bill simply proposes to place
            such on equal footing under the law with Asylums for white children. </p>

          <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved that the Senate resolve itself into a committee of the whole for the
            consideration of this bill. It is one that should be considered deliberately,
            dispassionately and carefully. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE moved to postpone the further consideration of this bill until to-morrow
            afternoon at 2 o'clock, and make it the special order for that, hour. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS favored this motion. Such an important measure as this should be carefully
            considered, and members should have time to compare this bill with the existing law.</p>
          <p> The motion to postpone [Mr. Moore's] was agreed to.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. STREIGHT, the <orgName>committee on finance</orgName> had leave and
            did report the specific appropriation bill H. R. 610. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON moved to take up the bill [H. R. 59] to allow appeals from county

          <p>Mr. BURRELL made an ineffectual motion to take up the contested election case of
            Sansberry vs. Smith (the sitting senator from the counties of Delaware and Madison). </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS, the Senate proceeded to consider the report of the
              <orgName>committee on finance</orgName>, on the specific appropriation bill [H. R.
            646]. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to strike out the item appropriating $62,000 for the purchase of
            the State Fair Grounds. He believed there were real estate speculators enough in
            Indianapolis, and thought there was no necessity for the State going into that business.
            Two years ago the State Board asked for $25,000, saying that would be the last, and now
            they ask for $62,000 more. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said this appropriation was recommended on the understanding that the
            ground would be sold under a first mortgage, the State now holding a second mortgage to
            secure the $25,000 referred to. It is only a question of policy whether the State will
            lose the $25,000, already in it., or pay this $62,000 and take the grounds, now valued
            at $80,000. </p>
          <p>Mr MENZIES inquired whether, as a business proposition, it would not be better to lose
            the $25,000, and sever all connection with it? </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS recited the history of this case. Prior to 1860 the State Fair was held on
            ground belonging to the State. Then the State Board of Agriculture purchased the 36 or
            40 acres of ground referred to. The exposition building was put up by subscriptions nude
            by the citizens of Indianapolis, the railroads, etc. The exposition was not a success,
            and the State Board became involved in debt. Two years ago the State Board obtained an
            appropriation from the State treasury of $25,000. There was a time when this 36 acres of
            ground was supposed to be worth $5,000 or $6,000 per acre. The State has advanced
            $25,000, has encouraged the agricultural interests of the State, and now the question
            is: Had the State better continue to encourage the interests of agriculture by
            purchasing this ground at a cost $62,000 or lose the $25,000 already invested in it?
            When the loan was made some two or three years ago this property was appraised at
            $180,000 the loan was one third of the appraised value. An appraisement made two years
            ago by 13 business men, put the value at from $180,000 to $255,000. Others say it is now
            worth as an investment from $1,500 to $2,500 an acre. Twelve appraisers aggregate
            $81,000 as the present value of this property. The first mortgage is $60,000 principal,
            and about $2,000 interest is due. This ground would subdivide five lots to the acre,
            which at $10 a foot would be $2,000 an acre. It lays high, the street railroad runs to
            it, and $2,000 an acre would be marvelously cheap. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT: There are on that ground buildings that would not be put up for less than
            $50,000. To his mind the State Fair was worth more to the State every year than the
            amount of money involved. The State can make this investment without a prospect of loss,
            and the State Board of Agriculture would be saved the expense of making new arrangements
            all around. We hope for more prosperous times, for better days, and this is no time for
            the State to show a cold shoulder to this great agricultural interest. By making this
            appropriation the State will save to the Board of Agriculture buildings to-day worth
            probably $50,000. It is as clear as the sun at noonday that this property is worth not
            only the money now asked for, but all it is mortgaged for besides. It is worth to-day at
            least $80,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER insisted the interest, of the State has been greatly advanced by this
            Board, and if this appropriation is not made it may terminate the work of that Board.
            When agriculture suffers every other interest suffers. He believed the State would not
            lose any money by this appropriation, and at the same time it would aid the greatest of
            all worldly interests--a something handed down by God Himself to man. Whenever anything
            here detrimental to that interest he will be found raising his voice against it. Because
            it is in an embarrassed condition are we to take a step backward and strike down the
            only institution in the State friendly to the farming community? If the State
            don't advance this $62,000 her $25,000 already in there will be lost. The State
            can lose nothing if it takes this ground; but should it prove a little sacrifice, is it
            not worth the effort? </p>
          <p>If the State board have made some mistakes in the tight times of the past it was not
            done knowingly. The Board of Agriculture has been the means of improving the
            agricultural interests of the State very greatly, and he urged senators to vote in favor
            of the appropriation. </p>
          <p>The Senate then adjourned. </p>

            which was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. SLEETH said this bill diverts the money received from these traveling shows for
            licenses from the treasury of the Agricultural society to the county treasury.</p>
          <p> Mr. VANPELT said that agricultural societies were hard up generally, and ought to be
            encouraged. He hoped the bill would not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD thought it was but very little difference which way the money went, to the
            Agricultural society or to the county treasury, so that these shows were compelled to pa
            a tax for their performances. It taxes a large class of performances that were never
            taxed before, and he thought it was a good bill, an he hoped it would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIMMER, would be willing to vote for the bill, provided, in counties where there

          <p> Mr. DAILEY called up his bill [H. R. 270] for the protection of the ballot box and

          <p>Mr. DAVIS called up Mr. Johnson's bill [H. R. 601] to prohibit the keeping of
            saloons or other houses, sheds or booths, for the purpose of persons congregating
            together for the purpose of drinking spirituous or malt liquors, which was read the
            third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON had never been connected with any temperance society, but he was willing to
            lay down the proposition that everything that is an injury to society is a nuisance. If
            there is a man here who can show that a saloon is an advantage to community he would
            like to have him do so, for he assumed that a saloon is no advantage to anyone but the
            man that keeps it, and the mayors and marshals of cities and towns. If the school fund
            is benefited by it the court and poor house expenses are increased. The cause of nearly
            all the crime committed can be traced to a saloon. Young men from the country as well as
            the town are decoyed into saloons, and are there robbed.</p>
          <pb n="34" xml:id="VAA8558-17-284"/>
          <p> Mr. WORKS saw one objection to this bill. The repealing clause is too broad. It would
            have the effect to repeal all the law we now have on the subject of selling intoxicating
            liquors. This bill would allow any person to sell liquors anywhere except in a saloon,
            and to any person, without violating the law. He was in favor of the principle of the
            bill, and believed it was wrong to legalize the sale of Intoxicating liquors in any way.
            With a proper amendment of the repealing clause he could support the bill heartily. </p>

          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD, when his name was called, said he believed there was but one reason for

        <p> The minutes of yesterday were not read. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BRISCOE, the bill [H. R. 456] authorizing boards of commissioners to
          grant relief to certain citizens, was read the first time and referred to the
            <orgName>committee on fees and salaries</orgName>. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHAFFER,the bill [H. R. 377] to regulate the practice of medicine,
          midwifery and surgery, was read the first time and referred to a special committee of
          three which the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made to consist of Messrs. Shaffer, Woollen and
          Mercer. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE moved that the bill [S. 456] for the government of the State prisons be read
          the second time. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM moved to amend by taking up the specific appropriation bill [H. R. 640.] </p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. BURRELL--yeas 26, nays 17--the Senate agreed to consider the contested
          election case of James W. Sansberry versus Marcus C. Smith, the sitting senator from the
          counties of Delaware and Madison.</p>
        <p> The report of the majority of the <orgName>committee on elections</orgName>, declaring
          in favor of the contestee [Mr. Smith--signed by Messrs. Viehe, Coffey, Taylor and Wllson]
          was first read; afterward the report of the minority of the committee arguing in favor of
          the contestor [Mr. Sansberry--signed by Messrs. Burrell and Reiley.] </p>
        <p>Messrs. BURRELL and VIEHE each spoke in favor of their respective reports.</p>
        <p> Mr. KENT made a few remarks favoring the majority report--referring incidentally to a
          jest spoken in the presence of a newspaper man, through which it obtained publicity, that
          Mr. K. had said Mr. Smith must go. Recognizing the fact that a majority of votes in the
          district were cast for Mr. Smith, Mr. K. should vote for Mr. S. to retain his seat. </p>

        <!--P.35 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p>The minority report was rejected by yeas 7, nays 39. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER, explaing, said: Believing that when a law was enacted it meant something when
          referring to elections as well as anything else, he would vote "no." </p>
        <p> Mr. HART, when his name was called, said, while a pretty strong partizan, and regretting
          there was not a Democrat, in Mr. Smith's place, for we have felt the need of one
          [laughter], yet, unless convinced there had been fraud in his election, or the will of the
          people had been set aside, he would not vote to displace him. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said, believing that
          where County Commissioners do not establish new precincts the old precinct is the legal
          precinct, he should have to vote "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD, in explanation, said he should act upon the facts in this case and apply the
          rules of law to them, just as a judge would do. He had listened to these reports
          attentively and saw no case made that would authorize him to vote for the removal of Mr.
          Smith. The question of Democrat or Republican should not weigh anything in the scales of
          justice. The law in a case like this is very plain. No lawyer can be mistaken about it.
          The courts of nearly all the States have settled what statutes are mandatory and what are
          directory in election cases. The statutes violated in this case are plainly directory in
          their scope, and does not render the election void. There is no fraud or coercion charged.
          Every elector voted his sentiments freely and untrammeled. In the absence of fraud or
          coercion the violation of a directory statute does not, make the election void. The will
          and choice of the people can not be set aside on the ground of a technical violation of
          the law. He voted "no." </p>
        <p>The result was announced as above.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The majority report was adopted by yeas 38, nays 8. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. WINTERBOTHAM the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the specific
          appropriation bill [H. S. 640], the question being on the motion [Mr.
          Sarnighausen's] made yesterday afternoon to strike out the amendment proposed by
          the <orgName>committee on finance</orgName>, appropriating $62,000 for the purchase of the
          State fair grounds.</p>
        <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN: It has been said <pb n="36" xml:id="VAA8558-17-286"/> the State should
          foster the agricultural interest; but if that, means the State shall make good all
          financial shortcomings of the State Board of Agriculture, he should say
          "no." For one he had very little confidence in the financial management
          of this board, and desired not to make the State liable for its acts. The State has always
          been the loser when embarking in such ventures. If the State buys this ground, then the
          State fairs must be had always at the city of Indianapolis, and if not, other cities may
          have a chance to obtain the fair. He was fully satisfied the State would be a loser in
          this as in other like speculations. </p>
        <p>Mr. KRAMER become satisfied, on inquiry, that it would be a great investment for the
          State to purchase the fair grounds in fee simple, especially as the board proposes to deed
          to the State all its property. The grounds alone, have been estimated at this time to be
          worth from $75,000 to $85,000. If this ground is not purchased, the $25,000 heretofore put
          in them by the State will be lost; and if it is bought, the State will get all back. He
          thought as a business proposition it is a good one and that the people would be satisfied
          with it. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON was opposed to the State engaging in real estate speculation, and argued that
          "it would be doing great injustice to the people to appropriate so large a sum at
          this time for such a purpose. If it be a good speculation why do not hundreds of men in
          the State put forward their money in aid of this Board and take advantage of this great
          chance to make a good bargain?" It is very evident that it would not be safe for
          the State to appropriate the sum asked for now. It the State must do something for this
          Board let her carry the indebtedness for one or two years longer, and in that rime there
          may be some other way opened by which the State can get her money back. </p>
        <p>Mr. WIER opposed mixing the State up with this indebtedness--believing it to be all
          wrong. As he understood this matter, the people of Indianapolis are largely to blame for
          the embarrassment of the State Board of Agriculture: and the city of Indianapolis or
          Marion county should purchase these grounds, having more interest therein than the State
          has He opposed taxing the people of the State to pay for fair grounds for the benefit of
          the people of Marion county. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE doubted the propriety of investing that much, money in this property and
          Inquired whether tins debt can be carried two years by paying the interest? </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON regarded the only question to be whether it would be better for the State to
          purchase these grounds and thereby save the $25,000 invested or whether she would lose
          more than $25.000 by making this purchase. The bonded debt that has priority over the
          State's claim is $60,000 and the records show no other. Now can the state save
          her $25,000 by taking the ground for $62,000, taking as true the statements made on this
          floor by the Senator from Marion yesterday, this property is well worth from $80,000 to
          $100,000, and this would be a good investment for the State. There are many reasons why
          this property will increase in value rather than decrease. If the State intends to do
          anything at all now is the time to do it. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS reminded senators that two years ago they were told those grounds were worth
          from $l80,000 to $225,000, and that the grant made by the State was in the nature of a
          loan. We are now met by the argument that the State must pay $62,000, or lose what has
          already been invested, because the property is not worth anymore than the incumbrance upon
          it. Having been deceived in its value heretofore, he was disposed to believe now that the
          ground is not worth as much as the appropriation asked for. He was of the opinion that
          Marion county should buy these grounds, and not the State, believing but few of the people
          at large desired the State to make such an Investment. He did not believe if this amount
          be invested. that the State would be done with it, for when once purchased the argument
          would be made that all improvements become part of the realty, and the State must make all
          that may be required in the future. He opposed making any further appropriation, believing
          it better to lose the $25,000 which was obtained by deceiving the Legislature as to the
          value of the ground than to put this sum of money into it. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLEN thought there was misapprehensiun in regard to the intention of the finance
          committee in recommending this appropriation. The intention was to leave this sum in the
          hands of the governor to protect the State's interest in this matter. The debt is
          due on the first day of January. 1881, bearing interest at 8 per cent. If this
          appropriation is not made and the interest not paid, the State will lose the $25,000
          already advanced; but as it stands the State can probably make $10,000 or $15,000 by
          buying this ground, even though it should not be worth more than $50,000, which is
          probably too low an estimate. He suggested it to be the duty of the State to establish a
          third prison for those not hardened in crime, and these grounds and buildings would be an
          appropriate place for such an institution--the best location in the State. Under these
          circumstances he favored the appropriation.</p>
        <p> Mr. GARRIGUS felt favorably disposed to this appropriation if it can be legally done;
          but he thought the spirit of the law would prohibit it. He read from the constitution,
          sec. six, art. 10. a clause prohibiting the assuming of the debt of any corporation, etc.,
          by the State. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE thought this thing should be looked be looked at from a purely business point of
          view, as there was no difficulty in the constitutional question just referred to. Many
          things should be considered in the ratification of this purchase. He thought Indianapolis
          has not acted in good faith towards the state board or the people of the State, in not
          paying the subscription of her citizens toward the erection of the exposition building. If
          the purchase is made, he desired an amendment requiring of the state board a just yearly
          rental value for the use of the grounds. If the appropriation is not made there should be
          steps taken to provide for the payment of the interest, but the former plan is probably
          the best, all things considered. </p>
        <p>Mr. HART would be far from encouraging the Legislature in any wild speculation, but as
          the State has already placed $25,000 in these grounds, it resolves itself into a business
          proposition. Then the State Fairs have been of great value to the people of the State,
          affording an opportunity for the concentration of the best stock in the State; and these
          fairs have induced a healthy rivalry in the keeping of better stock than heretofore. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD favored the greatest good to the greatest number. The farming class exceeds in
          number ail the other business men of the State. The business of agriculture towers above
          all other avocations in comparison: The farming class pays the bulk of all the revenues to
          support the State Government and all the institutions of the State; The State has already
          paid $25,000. This will be lost unless we make this appropriation. It will be a safe
          investment to make, and will also be a just <pb n="37" xml:id="VAA8558-17-287"/>
          recognition of the rights and demands of the farming population of the State.</p>

            bill [H. R. 115]; but on motion by Mr. STREIGHT--yeas 27 nays 18--the general

          <p> The fee and salary bill being the special order for this hour--Mr. STREIGHT moved to

            nays 23. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK moved as a substitute for section 21 an appropriation of $9,500, to pay
            the interest on the first mortgage on the State fairgrounds. It seemed idle talk to fix
            the value of that ground at $100,000. It is worth just what it will bring. If the
            $62,000 is voted this year, more will be asked every year to come. </p>
          <p>Mr. RAGAN states that this board had been self-sustaining down to 1863, when it had
            accumulated this ground, and had a surplus of several thousand dollars beside. From that
            time to last fall the exhibitions have been a failure. Last fall the board saved $5,000.
            As a matter of justice to the agricultural interest and the saving of the grounds from
            being swept into the hands of a foreign corporation, it was surely best to make the
            appropriation for this purpose. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER moved to reject the substitute. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON favored the substitute as being decidedly the best policy. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN moved to add a proviso that the State Board agree to sell all its property
            in the State for $62,000 at the next meeting of the General Assembly, which was accepted

          <p>Mr. HARRIS offered an amendment appropriating to a Cincinnati firm $1,310.50, balance
            for heating apparatus for the State Normal school, received by the board in February,
            1876. It was rejected by--yeas 20, nays 28. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved an amendment that this sum of $1,310.50 be appropriated to this
            Cincinnati firm, contingent on the certificate of certain officials that the claim is
            just. He made several short speeches in favor of it. </p>
          <p>The amendment, was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR offered an amendment, which was agreed to, embracing eight claims amounting
            in the aggregate to $2,263, for swamp laud ditching, when the State officers shall
            certify them to be just. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to amend the bill by allowing the State Librarian $100 for extra
            services in removing the State Library, which was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr HARRIS also moved to amend the bill by allowing $612.00 for the statutes furnished

        <p>Mr. SHANKS moved ineffectually--yeas 33, nays 49--to lay the resolution on the table. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend by striking out the proviso. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS said he was opposed to the adoption of the resolution. Men never work well
          under restraints; work thus done is carelessly done for fear of the expiration of time, or
          not done at ail for fear of a want of time. So if you limit a man in the time in which to
            <pb n="38" xml:id="VAA8558-17-288"/> make a speech, you simply compel him to make a fool
          of himself. Again, this House has passed a large number of bills that are now in the
          Senate not acted on, or even read the first time, and probably will not be if this
          resolution is passed, as they are not named in the resolution. These bills have been
          neglected in the Senate, and unnecessarily so. If the General Assembly adjourns, as
          proposed by this resolution, the acts when published will show that the only bills passed
          by the Legislature will be Senate bills passed by the House; while House bills lie on the
          Senate table lost by neglect. The bills passed by the House are many of them very
          valuable, at least the presumption is that they are all good bills. The State has paid the
          expense so far, and it is not just to now waste the work and lose the benefit of their
          passage and this on a resolution from the Senate where this neglect lies. He insisted the

        <p>Mr. SAINT was opposed to passing any resolution fixing a time to adjourn. He thought
          these resolutions were entered as buncomb. It would be time for this session to adjourn
          when the work for winch it was convened shall be finished. If we set next Monday to
          adjourn the time will be taken up between now and then with dilatory motions to defeat the
          passage of a fee and salary bill. "</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD desired to fix a time to adjourn, and work to that end. </p>
        <p>Mr. AD WINS said it was the county officers who were clamoring for the adjournment, lest
          their fees and salaries should be reduced, and he had pledged his people to vote for a
          reduction of fees and salaries and to redistrict the State for Congressional and
          legislative purposes, and when that was done he was ready to go Home. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON said we were here to do the business of the State, and as soon as we dispose
          of that business it was then time to adjourn. If there is anything to do go to work at it
          like men, and not consume the time with posing buncomb resolutions. </p>

        <p>Mr. BAKER when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: that so long as

        <p>Mr. LEHMAN thought this bill was not in consonance with the feeling of the people of the

        <p>Mr. FAULKNER said that inasmuch as we have had a good deal of gas this morning and as he

          <p> Mr. HUMPHREYS, from the <orgName>committee on ways and means</orgName>, returned the
            bill [S. 308] supplemental, and amendatory of act entitled an act for a uniform
            assessment of property,. with a recommendation that the bill do pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. REED said: For the publication of the delinquent list there ought to be allowed a
            reasonable compensation. It was well known that printing offices had to keep on hand a
            certain amount of material in the way of brass rule, borders, quads, etc., which were
            costly, and were used in the country offices for nothing else. He thought 30 cents per
            description was little enough. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought there was no doubt but certain material named by the gentleman from
            Miami (Mr. REED,) has to be kept on hand by the printer to be used in the publication of
            the delinquent tax list, but still he thought that 20 cents for each description was
            sufficient. In many counties where there was competition the publication had been made
            for even less than 20 cents, while in other counties the full amount allowed by law (50
            cents for each description) had been charged and paid. In one instance he had seen a
            charge of $21.00 made for publishing 42 lots by number, where it only took four and
            a-half lines for the entire publication. Taking the description of factional tracts
            together with other descriptions, including the description of lots, which was very
            short, he thought the amount was enough, and that the bill should pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN was willing that 25 cents should be allowed, but was not willing to allow any
            more</p>
          <pb n="39" xml:id="VAA8558-17-289"/>
          <p>Mr. KELLEY had published several of the delinquent lists, and he thought, as we must
            come down to bed-rock, that 20 cents per description was enough. </p>

            constitute the board of pardons. No pardons, reprieves or remission of fines shall be

        <p> The minutes were not read.</p>
        <p> Mr. BENZ, by request, introduced a bill [S. 457] to fix the time of holding courts in
          the Second Judical district--the counties of Warrick, Spencer and Perry--which was read
          the first time and referred to the <orgName>committee on organization of
          courts</orgName>.</p>
        <p> On motion of Mr. LEEPER his bill [S. 253] to declare that town plats less than 10 acres
          used for agricultural purposes shall not be taxed for town or city purposes at a greater
          rate than in the civil townships, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN hoped this bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZ1ES explained: This bill is similar to the present law, except it fixes the rate
          of percentage according to the rate in the township. It will make plain the ambiguity of
          the statutes, </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER also said this bill is simply explanatory of the law of 1877. It provides that
          lands inside of the corporation shall be taxed just as if they were not taken in. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 0. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. BRISCOE the bill [H. R. 466]; authorizing county commissioners to make
          appropriations to certain citizens therein named--to liquidate any indebtedness or
          liability on the 25th of May, 1874, in aid of the construction of any railroad now
          completed and operated through such county--was read the second time. He explained its
          reference to a road built through the county of Grant, and made an appeal in behalf of the
          bill, declaring it nothing more than right and just that these parties should be relieved. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL thought this bill was carrying the matter a little too far. It is unfair to
          tax the people of the whole county for the benefit of one or two townships.</p>
        <p> Mr. GRUBBS regarded the bill as just and right.</p>

        <p>Mr. WILSON moved $4,000 as a substitute. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN said this substitute would be manifestly unjust. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER referred to the faat that only about half a dozen States in the union pay
          their governors over $5,000, and he thought that enough.</p>

        <p> Mr. TAYLOR moved to vote ample compensation for every officer, but he opposed this
          increase. </p>
        <p>Mr. DICE referred to the fact that in the general appropriation bill the
          governor's clerk was stricken out, and consequently the Secretary will have extra
          duties to perform. </p>
        <p>This motion for increase was rejected. </p>

        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, the chairman of the special committee reporting this bill, explained that
          section 5 requiring the clerk of the printing bureau to fully and properly index and
          prepare the Senate and House journals and superintend their printing and proof-reading,
          would insure this work being done in a far better manner than ever before and save to the

          <p>Mr. OLDS moved to strike out the clerk's fee of $1 from the losing party in

          <p>Mr. DICE favored this motion.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS opposed reducing the docket lees. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT understood this fee is in direct opposition to the spirit of the constitution,
            and he doubted the propriety of taxing the unsuccessful litigant by the State. The
            payment of regular costs of the suit should be enough to demand of the losing party. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD regarded this as a direct; tax for the purpose of raising revenue, and saw no
            constitutional objection to it. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK thought the law would justify such a tax. </p>

          <p> Subsequently Mr Harris made an ineffectual motion to increase this fee from $1 to $2. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT moved to increase the fee for issuing executions from 75 cents to $1. This is
            a work of considerable importance. Responsibilities attach to it, and sometimes the
            sheriff's return covers several pages. One dollar is not enough,but the fee
            ought to be at east that sum. Let the reduction come on unimportant work.</p>
          <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN thought 75 cents is not enough enough for this work. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK said the clerk receives large fees for the greater portion of the service,
            and the course pursued here will not bring about; any reduction in a clerk's
            fees, taken as a whole.</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOLLEN explained the committee did not reduce on all the fees, but the intention
            was to make the reduction average from 10 to 15 per cent.</p>

            believed this bill would reduce the clerk's fees from 25 to 20 per cent., which
            was too great a decrease for the smaller counties </p>

            entering action on allot the dockets used by the clerk 10 cents each, not including bar
            docket." </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. COMSTOCK, the following fees of the clerk are to be paid out of the
            County Treasury upon the order of the Judge of the proper court: "For issuing
            and filing: each subpena for the grand jury, including all witnesses; for administering
            the oath to the grand jury; and for the certificate of allowances made by the court at
            each term." On his further motion, the clerk's fees for attending the
            Board of Canvassers are to be paid out of the County Treasury on the order of the Board
            of Commisioners. </p>
          <p>The item "For entering on the order book: each order and minute of the
            proceedings of the court during term, and reading the same including the title of the
            cause, 10 cents," having been read--on motion by Mr. WINTERBOTHAM the following
            words were added thereto: 'For each 100 words thereof, four figures counting as
            one word: provided, that it the words in any entry be less than 200 words, for such
            entry 20 cents.1' On his further motion the item "For entering
            satisfaction of record of any judgment against a party to be made upon the judgment
            docket, 5 cts.," was changed so as to read: "For entering satisfaction
            of record, 5 cents." </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LANGDON, the item "for filing, docketing and recording a
            transcript of a judgment to become a lien on real estate, and entering satisfaction of
            same, $1," was changed so as to read: "For recording a transcript of a
            judgment to become a lien on real estate, 10 cents for each 100 words, four figures
            counting as one word; for filing said transcript, 10 cents: for docketing the same, 10
            cents, and for entering satisfaction thereof, 10 cents."</p>
          <pb n="42" xml:id="VAA8558-17-292"/>
          <p>On motion by Mr. KENT, the fee for docketing each cause, for each docket, was increased
            from five to 10 cents. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, a proviso was added, "that in all cases where suits
            are dismissed no docket fees shall be taxed." </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved to strike out the section (numbered 20) allowing the clerk 82 a day
            for attendance on court in person or by deputy, because that official gets paid by fees
            for every stroke of the pen and every act performed while in or out of court. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS thought in justice this section ought to be stricken out, as the clerk
            gets fees for every specific act. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion to strike out was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 14. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved an additional section (to be numbered 22 1/2) viz: "The
            clerks shall index all of the order "books, judgment dockets fee books records
            of all wills, probate records and all other records in his office, for which he shall be
            allowed two cents for each entry, to be paid out of the county treasury, upon an
            allowance made by the board of commissioners." </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS had carefully compared this bill with the present law and declared it
            would increase the fees rather than decrease them as the people desire. </p>

          and the bill ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, introduced a bill [H. R. 684] to authorize the redemption of
          certain lands sold for taxes, which was read the first time. On his further motion the

          title and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. MIERS introduced a bill [H. R. 685] to legalize the acts of the board of trustees of
          the town of Elliottsville, Monroe county, which was read the first time and on his further
          motion the constitutional rule was suspended--yeas 70, nays 11--the bill read the second

          nays 1. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. VAWTER introduced a bill [H. R. 686] to amend section 3 of an act to incorporate the

        <p>Mr. SHANKS called up his bill [H. R. 683] for the more speedy publication of the acts of
          the 51st regular and special session, which was read the third time, and passed the House
          by yeas 77, nays 0. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 253] defining the manner in which certain lands and other property within
          the limits of a city, etc., may be taxed, was read the first time. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>On the motion of Mr. PERRY the constitutional rule was suspended--yeas 72, nays 22--the
          bill read the second time by title, considered engrossed, and read the third time by
          sections. </p>
        <p>Mr. TULLY and Mr. HEROD thought this bill was just and ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam was opposed to this bill, because he did not think small tracts
          should be taken into the city and city taxes imposed thereon. </p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN moved that the bill be recommitted to a select comittee of three with
          instructions to strike out "ten" acres and insert
          "five," </p>
        <p>The motion was agreed to and the SPEAKER made the committee to consist of of Messrs.
          Owen, Tully and Herod. </p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH called up his bill [H. R. 565] limiting taxation in incorporated towns having
          less than 25 free holders residing therein, which was read the third time and passed the
          House by yeas 65, nays 8. </p>
        <p>The special committee thereon returned the bill [S. 253] with amendments as instructed
          striking out "10" acres and inserting "5" acres. The
          report of the committee was concurred in, the amendment considered engrossed and the bill
          finally passed the House by yeas 61, nays 19. </p>
        <p>Mr. FLODDER called up the bill [S. 392] legalizing the practice of circuit courts in
          certain cases, etc., which was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. NAVE said the object of this bill was to legalize judgments rendered by default of
          the first day of the term. It had been the practice of some of the courts to make a
          summons returnable on the first day of the term.. The right of the court to render such
          judgments on the first day of the term had been questioned, and this bill was to prevent
          these judgments from being disturbed. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill finally passed by--yeas 66, nays 11. </p>
        <p>Mr. GALBRAITH called up the bill [S. 216] to amend the act defining embezzlement, which
          was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said this was a bill that had been before the committee, and
          they had submitted amendments, and he did not know how the bill came here without these
          committee amendments, unless they had been laid on the table. He thought, however, the
          bill would not accomplish the object the author intended. </p>
        <p>Mr. THAYER said he thought there was an urgent demand throughout the State for a law of
          this kind.</p>
        <p> Mr. TULLEY moved that the bill be recommitted to a special committee with instructions
          to strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the bill H. R. 393 on the same
          subject. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN hoped that the Senate bill would be passed. To refer it now would virtually
          kill the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD thought there could hardly be fixed a penalty too severe for the man who would
          steal his employer's money. He was a worse thief than the man that robbed you at
          night. It was stealing his confidence as well as his money, and such men ought to be in
          the penitentiary. He was strongly in favor of the passage of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT preferred the bill H. R. 393 (Mr. Bailey's) and was opposed to the
          Senate bill. </p>
        <p>The House refused to recommit, and the bill S. 392 finally passed the House by yeas 84,
          nays 4. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS introduced a bill [H. R. 687] to authorize a loan for the payment of the
          temporary loan debt heretofore incurred, which was read the first time. On his further
          motion the constitutional restriction was suspended--yeas 92, nays 2--and the bill read a
          second time by title only. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER thought the bill was not as carefully drawn as it should have been. He
          would like to know when the loan was to be made, and just how much was to be borrowed. the
          bill ought to go to a committee to be perfected. And on his motion it was referred to the
            <orgName>committee on ways and means</orgName>. </p>

          <p> Mr. WORKS called up his bill [H. R. 678] to regulate the taxing of insurance

            third time and passed the house by yeas 75, nays 3. </p>
          <p>Mr. GAROUTTE called up the bill [S. 303] to amend section two of an act to enable
            farmers and other citizens of this State to form voluntary associations for insurance
            purposes,which was read the third time.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. JOHNSON and Mr. GAROUTTE said the only difference between this bill and the old
            law is that this bill allows insurance against lightning as well as fire, which was a
            very small difference. The bill then passed the House by yeas 82, nays 0. </p>
          <p>Mr. GINZ called up the bill [S. 338] for the protection of wild game, which was read
            the third time </p>
          <p>Mr. M1ERS would like to see every section of the bill stricken out, except the enacting
            clause, and he did not care what became of that. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD would like to protect the small birds especially. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS was in favor of the bill and would like to see it pass.</p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS hoped the bill might be killed. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAVIDSON said the farming community needed some protection in that line and he
            hoped the bill would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS moved to recommit the bill to a special committee of three for amendment. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. DAVIDSON moved to lay the motion to recommit on the table, which was agreed to yeas
            49, nays 36. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought if we wanted a law to protect game, this was, perhaps, the best one
            we could get. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT said if he had his way, there should not be another bird killed for four
            years. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. HART thought if birds were a nuisance to the farmer, he ought to have the privilege
            to kill them on his own premises. The bill then passed the House by yeas 60, nays 28. </p>
          <p>The Senate concurrent resolution, authorizing the State librarian to distribute the

          <p> Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, called up his bill [H. R. 638] to legalize the acts of the new
            State House commissioners, which heretofore failed for want of a constitutional
            majority. It was read for information, and again failed to pass the House by yeas 30,
            nays 59. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded VOte-->
          <p>Mr. DAVIDSON called up his bill [H. R. 467] to amend section 18 of an act regulating
            descents and the apportionment of estates, which was read the third time and finally
            passed the House by yeas 53, nays 30. </p>
          <p>Mr. GOLDEN called up his bill [H. R. 286] to amend the act prescribing the duties of
            coroners, (to abolish coroner's jurors) which was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAKE thought the finding of a verdict as to the cause of any person's
            death was too dangerous a matter to put in the hands of one man. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS said this bill done away with the expense of coroner's jurors, and he
            thought one man could do as well as a dozen. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT thought, this a serious matter,and it seemed to him to open too great a
            temptation to cover up crime to put this in the hands of one man. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS was in favor of the passage of this bill, because he thought it would save

          <p>Mr. SHANKS, from the special committee thereon, returned the bill [H. R. 570]
            concerning tax to vend foreign merchandise or exhibit any caravan, menagerie, circus,
            rope dancing, poppet shows, etc., with amendments and when so amended that the bill do
            pass. It is an exact copy of the law that has been upon the statute books since 1852. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.43 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
          <p>Mr. COPELAND objected strongly against charging bankers 100 license per annum for
            selling their customers drafts, or cashing their drafts at par; while every lawyer,
            doctor or merchant was allowed to buy all the notes they might have money to purchase
            without a license. The law was enacted in 1852, when there was considerable business
            done buying gold, silver, and money issued by free banks denominated as uncurrent money.
            But now when gold, silver, greenbacks and National bank currency are all at par, the
            enactment of such a law would simply apply to all private banks, as no State law could
            be enacted that would compel National banks to pay any license. He therefore objected to
            this unjust discrimination. The House some three weeks ago voted down the same
            proposition--70 to 12--and it has been revived with a view of amending the old law so as
            to include concert saloons, which the House should readily agree to, but should not pass
            a bill so unjust to the private banks of this State. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAILEY said if the poor man who goes around the country with a pack on his back
            shall be compelled to obtain a license, the man who speculates upon the misfortunes-in
            shaving notes--of his fellow man should also be compelled to pay a license. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said: it was hardly fair to levy a tax upon a corporation organized under
            the laws of the State, while an organization of the same kind, nuder a charter of the
            United States can not be taxed by the State. He thought this bill would make an unjust
            discrimination. </p>
          <p>Mr. WATSON objected to taxing a bank which is doing a legitimate business, and allow
            the curb-stone broker to do business without paying license. </p>
          <p>Mr. ARNOLD, of Wabash, said: Banking is a necessary part of the business of the
            country, and their legitimate business is the buying <pb n="44" xml:id="VAA8558-17-294"/> and selling of exchange. This they must do in competition with other banks, and also
            in competition with express companies, who carry currency, and also with the postoffice
            in the money-order business. This bill proposes to tax the exchange business of the
            banks,and thus place them at a disadvantage with the competition by express companies
            and the postoffices, which are not, and can not be taxed by this bill. It will in this
            way injure the legitimate bankers. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD said this bill was intended tax shows, theaters, etc., by the county, and
            that the Agricultural society should have the benefit of the money so collected. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess, would be compelled to vote against the bill on account of the
            mistakes in spelling and engrossment,and he moved that the bill be recommitted for
            correction.</p>
          <p> The motion to recommit was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD offered a concurrent resolution, that inasmuch as Dr. W. H. Hester's
            character was assailed in the examination of the conduct of the affairs of the Hospital
            for the Insane, that he be allowed to appear before said committee with counsel and to
            cross-examine each and every witness.</p>
          <p> The resolution was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. VAN VALZAH introduced a bill [H. R. 688] to establish a militia or the State of
            Indiana, which was read the first time and passed to the second reading. </p>

        <p> Pending the roll call-- </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS, in explanation of his vote, said: For the reason that the counties he
          represents are placed in a district where 39,883 are required to elect a congressman,
          while in other districts only 32,000 are required, thus practically disfranchising 7,000
          of the votes he had the honor to represent, he should vote "no."</p>
        <p> Mr. GRUBBS, when his name was called, protested against the passage of this bill,
          believing this not the time for a congressional apportionment under law or precedent, and
          that it is entirely unfair, because it will give, under the vote in 1878, the Democratic
          party, with 194,000 voters, 11 representatives, while for the 220,072 votes against the
          Democratic party it will give but two Republican representatives. If the Democratic party
          is willing to stand by the record they make upon this bill we are satisfied and shall
          appeal to the common sense and fairness of the people of Indiana. He voted
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON, when his name was called, said, believing this bill complies with the letter
          and the spirit of the constitution; that respect has been had to the contiguity of
          territory, and to population, as nearly so as can be conveniently made; and that it is
          reasonable and fair to political opponents; as based upon the vote of 1876, which is the
          only proper and fair vote to take as a basis, it will give to the Republicans six
          districts and to the Democrats seven; and taking into consideration the fact that it has
          always been a cardinal principle with the Republican party that the minority have no
          rights it was bound to respect, he did not believe it has any right to complain, and so he
          should vote "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT, in explanation of his vote, said: This bill is eminently fair--as fair to the
          Republicans as they could possibly ask--and from the fact that it wipes out a deep, dark
          and damnable infamy, which has been on the statute book since the Republican party has
          been in power in this State, he took great pleasure in voting 'aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES, when his name was called, said: It will not do for Republican senators to
          say they are opposed to apportioning the States for congressional purposes, because the
          last man of them voted for a resolution this morning declaring in favor of a congressional
          apportionment based on the vote of 1878; and thus they stand committed on the records of
            <pb n="46" xml:id="VAA8558-17-296"/> the Senate as in favor of a congressional
          apportionment at this time. This objection is an after-thought tramped up for the purpose
          of wiggling out, when it becomes patent that they have to take their own medicine. It
          won't do for gentlemen who stand committed by that foul blot on the statute books
          of 1873 which, like the blood on the hand of the guilty Macbeth, the waters of the world
          will never wash it out. He voted "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE,when his name was called, said: As this bill was disclosed to him it makes six
          Republican and seven Democratic districts. If this be true the Republicans have no reason
          to complain, until they go back over the history of Indiana legislation since the last
          apportionment was made, which has been execrated by everybody, even Republicans in every
          State, and give some satisfactory reason why, during all these years, they have never
          changed it, and made it, just and equal, as they now claim it, should be made. They are
          receiving more justice than they themselves administered. In the face of their persistent
          refusal to correct that which was a shame to the State, and a gerrymander which should
          make any political party blush, their pleas and appeals to let this matter go now,
          certainly sinks almost to the level of the ridiculous. Trusting to hear nothing more of
          this kind from Republicans now, or in any canvass hereafter, he voted
          ''aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER, when his name was called, said he had no great cause for complaint in regard
          to the congressional apportionment as far as his district is concerned. Having heretofore
          been in a hopelessly large Democratic district, this bill magnanimously gives us a small
          show; so he felt not so ungrateful as far as that matter is concerned. But he was reminded
          of a story told by the senator from Marshall in regard to the boy with a piece of bread
          and butter, who said the butter was good and the bread was good, but he didn't
          like the way the damned thing was spread; [Laughter.] so he [Mr. Shaffer] didn't
          like the way this apportionment bill is spread all over the State, therefore he voted
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: This is not just
          such a bill as he would like to see passed, but as the session is drawing to a close, and
          as we must take this or the one now on the statute book, and as this, in regard to
          population and the arrangement of territory, is so far superior to the present law, he
          voted "aye." </p>
        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded, and so the bill passed. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. BENZ moved to take up the fee and salary bill [H. R. 314]. Mr. KENT moved, as a
          substitute, to take up the State Prison bill [S. 456]. Mr. HARRIS moved, as a substitute
          for all, to take up the specific 'appropriation bill [H. R. 640), which was
          rejected by--yeas 23, nays 26. The motion to take up the prison bill was also rejected
          by-- yeas 20, nays 29; and then the Senate agreed to proceed with the consideration of the
          Senate committee's substitute for the fee and salary bill [H. R. 344].</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. SHIRK the vote of yesterday, by which section 6 was adopted, was
          reconsidered, and the salary of the clerk in the insurance department of the
          auditor's office was reduced from $1,500 to $1,200. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON, in reading the morning paper, noticed that an amendment was made yesterday to
          section 16, by which the county clerk's fees for entering each order was
          increased about 100 per cent. or more. He moved to reconsider the vote by which the

          <p>Mr. WOOD made an ineffectual motion to reinstate the section numbered 20, which was
            stricken out yesterday--yeas 16, nays 28, </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER moved ineffectually to so amend as that county auditors shall receive pay
            for filing assessment lists and appraisers' returns.</p>
          <p> Mr. BURRELL moved to amend by allowing county auditors a fee for filing assessment
            lists, appraisers' returns, county orders redeemed, and any receipt or voucher. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR moved as a substitute to strike out the allowance of two cents for every
            paper and voucher filed by the county auditor.</p>
          <p> Mr. KENT favored the amendment, but opposed the substitute. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON favored the substitute. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER said the auditor of one of the counties he represents gets $2,000 a year,
            and would not give it up if the salary were but $1,000. He opposed the amendment, as
            well as the other propositions to increase these fees. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL opposed the substitute, and spoke in favor of his amendment.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The substitute was rejected, by yeas 23, nays 23--the Lieutenant Governor giving the
            casting vote. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. REEVE a, clause in section 25 was made to read "but the
            Auditor shall not be paid any fees for services in such cases where the county is the
            losing party and the costs are taxed against the county in favor of the successful
            party." </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK made an ineffectual motion to reduce the the for the management of the
            permanent school fund from one to one-half per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to strike out the clause requiring county auditors to pay for ail the
            stationery used in their offices except books and blanks. He said this provision is a
            preposterous piece of nonsense, and ought to be stricken out." </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS insisted the section ought to stand as the committee left it. </p>
          <p>The motion was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT moved to amend so as to pay the auditor for making out and delivering to the
            assessor the list of lands, lots and plats, and for the list of road tax furnished by
            the township trustee. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER protested against raising the fees higher than fixed in this bill. This bill
            now allows the auditor two cents for each paper filed, which is an allowance not
            contained in the law of '75. The fees of county treasurer in this State are not
            too high and should not be reduced. </p>
          <pb n="47" xml:id="VAA8558-17-297"/>
          <p> On motion by Mr. REEVE the following was substituted for section 26:
            "Auditors shall furnish all blanks and stationery for affidavits or other
            documents for parties in which he receives a specific fee for the service rendered in
            using such blanks or stationery. Provided that the county shall furnish all books
            stationery and blanks required in doing the public business petaining to the
            auditor's office.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. FOSTER the House amendments to his city water works bill [S. 103]
            requiring a majority of all votes cast, &amp;c., were amended by adding a proviso

          <p>Mr. March offered a concurrent resolution, which was adopted, instructing our senators
            and requesting our representatives to use their influence to amend the National banking
            law, in relation to the jurisdiction of the courts over controversies between banking
            associations located in any State or territory. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER offered a concurrent resolution that thia General Assembly will adjourn
            sine die on Saturday, March 22,1879 at 12 o'clock noon. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said: We have now had nine days of the special session, at a cost to the
            people of about $1,500 per day. We have come as near to the accomplishment of nothing as
            could well be done in the time. All real work that is of any importance to the State,
            which we have done during the special session, could have been done in one day. The
            specific appropriation bill is on its third reading in the Senate, and could be massed
            and sent to the House now at any time within 20 minutes. In two hours the bill could be
            finally disposed of and if we can not complete the fee and salary bill to-day it will be
            because there is no very strong desire to complete it. Why, then, should we set here
            longer than until noon on Saturday? If all the political bills, in which Democrats feel
            an interest, have not been disposed of, shall the whole people continue to pay for
            keeping the Legislature in session simply because such political bills may be labored on
            farther? The people did not expect that we would hold a special session at all, and
            there was no necessity for the wasting of the regular session in such manner as to
            require a special session. The appropriation bills might easily have been completed at
            the regular session, and on any one day of this special session these bills might have
            been finished. It is evident to every member that the usefulness of this General
            Assembly is at an end. General business is neglected, and only political measures
            attract attention. Politics have been the bane of this Assembly. The business of the
            people has from the first been thrust aside, in order that the business of the
            Democratic party be finished. When committees should have met, a Democratic caucus
            intervened. When measures of importance to the people should have been considered, the
            Democracy interfered with political gerrymanders in a dozen shapes. </p>
          <p>Mr. MIERS moved to amend by inserting Monday noon instead of Saturday noon. He said:
            The gentleman from Jennings (Mr. Overmeyer) says we have had political legislation
            enough. I am glad to see the gentleman from Jennings satisfied with political
            legislation for once in his life; he has more capacity for that kind of legislation than
            any other gentleman I know of- I think we have had about enough; we only lack one more
            act, and that is to pass the Congressional apportionment bill, and thereby wipe from our
            statute books the odious gerrymander made by the Republican party, backed up and agged
            on by the gentleman from Jennings. As to the adjournment on Saturday, or at a very early
            day, the gentleman from Jennings, nor any gentleman on this floor, is no more anxious
            than I am, as much as I would like for many of the important measures,that have passed
            the House and gone to the other end of the capitol, to become laws; if we had made a fee
            and salary bill I would vote with the gentleman from Jennings to adjourn on Saturday or
            even now, but believing that by Monday we can pass a fee and salary bill, and believing
            that we had as well pass a resolution that we are opposed to a fee and salary bill as to
            pass a resolution to adjourn on Saturday and offer the amendment. The people are as much
            interested in the subject of fees and salaries as any other subject before this House,
            and if gentlemen on this floor had used as much judgment as they did zeal and made a fee
            bill that the Senate could have acted upon instead of getting up a new one, we might now
            have a fee bill. I said when that bill passed. this House it was so unjust that the
            Senate <pb n="48" xml:id="VAA8558-17-298"/> would have to prepare a new bill, as they
            have since had to do. The Senate is now at work on the fee bill, and to adjourn on
            Saturday is to lose all the work done on that subject. We can make a good fee bill by
            Monday and can not make one if we adjourn on Saturday. For that reason I am opposed to
            the adjournment on Saturday. I am not willing to lose a good part of the work done in 71
            days in order to save two days, and gentlemen who vote for the resolution to adjourn
            before next Monday put themselves on the record as opposed to a fee bill. When the
            Senate sends us a fee bill let us pass it if we can; if we can't, let us
            appoint a conference committee and make a good fee bill as soon as we can and quit
            playing the demagogue and act like men. </p>
          <p> Mr. ENGLISH moved that the resolution and amendment be postponed until Saturday at 2
            o'clock p. m, </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS said the time ought not to be taken up by introducing and discussing
            resolutions to fix a time to adjourn. We ought to wait until necessary legislation
            required by the people is enacted, and when that is done we can resolve in half an hour
            to adjourn at a time fixed. As no bills under the constitution can be presented to the
            governor for his signature within two days of the end of the session, we should wait
            until the fee and salary bill and other bills absolutely required shall pass, and then
            fix the time two days thereafter to adjourn. We will do this within the next four or
            five days, and we can then return to our people with some degree of credit to ourselves
            and satisfaction to our constituents. </p>
          <p>Mr. HESS said he thought our constituents would be satisfied if we went home at once.
            He thought all the important legislation required could be completed before 12
            o'clock to-night, and the did not see any use of us staying here any
            longer.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS said he had endeavored to be consistent upon this question of adjournment.
            He had voted against all of the resolutions fixing the time for adjournment in advance.
            This is a political measure,as much as anything that has been before the House. Every
            political caucus that is held is sure to be followed by this kind of bumcombe
            resolutions, introduced for the purpose of giving members of that party an opportunity
            to make a record to to please their constituents. What this House should do is to pass
            the important bills that are now before it, and those to be received from the Senate,
            and then it will be time enough to resolve to adjourn, and it should be done without
            delay. This resolution, if adopted, would prevent the passage of any bills after 12
            o'clock to-night, and would cut off the most important legislation that has
            been before us. We should not hesitate to vote the proposition down. </p>

          <body>
            <div type="resolution">
              <p>Whereas, Repeated effort has demonstrated that an equitable and practicable fee and
                salary bill can not be enacted into a law under the present constitution, and can
                only be done by special enactments relating to different localities; and </p>
              <p>Whereas,The proposed constitutional amendment now submitted to the electors of this
                State will, if adopted, admit of such legislation, and the power to prevent
                practical legislation on this subject is in their hands; and </p>
              <p>Whereas, It is evident that this body can not agree upon a fee and salary law that
                will act fairly and equitably to the people and the officers throughout the State
                because of difference in judgment as to what can and what ought to be done; and </p>
              <p>Whereas, Any change in the law now is likely to be followed by entire change two
                years hence, in view of the probable adoption of said constitutional amendment as to
                fees and salaries, under which confusion will follow likely to create more evils
                than any present change will cure; therefore,</p>
              <p> Resolved, That the further consideration of bill No. 344, now pending;, and all
                other consideration of the subject of fees and salaries be indefinitely postponed.

        <p>Mr. REEVE said every attempt to amend the fee and salary act only makes more confusion.
          Any bill of this kind can not help but be an inequitable one. If the people want an
          equitable fee and salary bill let them ratify the proposed constitutional amendment, which
          will probably be done. If a fee and salary bill be passed this session the officers would
          hardly get used to it before it would be tore up two years hence. At that time another fee
          and salary bill will be enacted and there will be more confusion. He submitted in all
          candor that this subject ought to be postponed till after the people act on the proposed
          constitutional amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK was not willing, after having spent so much time upon this subject, to
          indefinitely postpone it. He hoped this Legislature would go ahead and do the best that
          can be done with it. </p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ was afraid if this Legislature goes home without a fee and salary bill, some
          members would take it so hard it would make them sick. [Laughter.] So he favored this
          motion. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES thought the way the Senate has been proceeding, reducing does not reduce. The
          whole symmetry of the bill has been destroyed. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN said the resolution expresses the same opinion he has long ago
          entertained. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER thought it useless to waste more time on the fee and salary bill, as the
          disposition is such no agreement looks possible. In order to remove the disease the cause
          must be displaced. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK--yeas 37, nays 8--the resolution was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. HART the Senate resumed the consideration of the Senate
          committee's amendments to the Fee and Salary bill [H. R. 344]. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the section relative to
          the fees of county auditors was adopted.</p>
        <p> Mr. KENT declared it utterly impossible to pass an equitable and just fee and salary
          bill under the present constitution. He opposed the opening up of this question as to
          auditor's fees again. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE regarded it as injustice to the auditors of the largest counties to require the
          handling of the many papers and vouchers coming into their possession without
          compensation, as it was understood the object of this motion to be.</p>
        <p> Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN reminded senators that the county auditor has to do more work without
          compensation than all the other county officials put together. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS insisted the section, as passed yesterday, is an increase in the fees of
          county auditors, to which he was unalterably opposed.</p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. TRAYLOR, instead of lines 25 and 26 in the committee amendment, the
          following words were substituted: ''For serving each person on a
          subpoena or a summons, as required by law, 35 cents," and for each copy, when
          required, 25 cents. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT contended that sheriffs should be allowed 50 cents a day for boarding prisoners.
          He made a motion to that effect, which was rejected. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. TRAYLOR, the fee for making a certificate of sale on execution or
          decrees,was increased from 50 cents to $1. </p>

            illegal fees charged, with cost of suit, and accepted a proviso suggested by Mr. REEVE
            in these words: "No officer shall be liable for any unlawful sum charged or
            taken by his deputy unless he know of and refuse to correct the same, and such deputy
            shall be liable as an officer to prosecution for such taking." </p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER offered an amendment making the per diem of county commissioners $3 for
            each day's attendance. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to make the per diem $4.50. He said these men are custodians of the
            public funds in every county, and their services ought to be worth the sum he named. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM regarded this office as the most important in the county, and
            contended county commissioners should be paid liberally.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHAFFER did not believe there was one county commissioner in 25 who could make $3
            a day on his farm. </p>
          <p>The motion to increase the per diem was rejected, as was also the amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE and Mr. HARRIS moved to add to the last section these words: "If it
            be found necessary and so entered by record to employ any person to render any service
            as contemplated in this act as a public necessity, the contract for such employment
            shall be spread on record in said court. And for said services ; rendered the claimant
            shall file his account in said court 10 days before the beginning of the term, and any
            tax payer shall have the right to contest the claim." </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS desired when the County Board makes a contract it should be placed on
            record, so any tax-payer may examine it. He referred to an employment made by the
            commissioners of this county, of his suggestion, which produced considerable
            dissatisfaction for want of some such satisfactory provision as this.</p>
          <p> The motion to amend was agreed to </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to add an additional section in the following words: </p>
          <p>"The mine inspector, in addition to the fees now allowed by law, shall receive
            the sum of $200 per annum, to be paid as the salary of other State officers are
            paid."</p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. OLDS it was rejected by yeas 37, nays 9. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to reconsider the vote by which section 30 was adopted, in order that a
            clause may be inserted to punish officers for overcharging; otherwise the law of
            extortion is wiped out, and every public officer can charge any fee he may please. </p>

          <p>Mr. BURRELL made an ineffectual motion yeas--12, nays 33--to lay this motion to
            reconsider on the table.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. REEVE, section 30 was amended by reinstating before the amendment
            made this morning by Mr. Viehe these words: "deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
            and on conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum. not exceeding $100." </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK moved to reduce the pay of members of the General Assembly to $5 a day while
            in actual attendance--mileage five cents. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER offered a substitute, allowing as mileage, actual traveling expenses, and no
            more. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE came not here to reduce all fees I and salaries, but only to reduce where
            reduction was demanded; and no demand has come up for a reduction of the pay of
            assemblymen.</p>
          <p> Mr. DICE early in the regular session introduced a bill for the reduction of pay of
            members; but it was indefinitely postponed, not withstanding the fact that members come
            up here pledged to a reduction of fees and salaries. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS opposed a reduction in the pay of members of the General Assembly. On the
            contrary, although Ins time is about up, he would rather see an inc ease than a
            decrease. All attempts to reduce the salary he regarded as for buncombe, without
            desiring to impugn any one's motives. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER insisted we should not fix an estimate upon our services; that estimate has
            already been placed on them by the people. </p>

          <p>The motion [Mr. Shirk's] was also rejected by yeas 35, nays 11. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL offered an additional section, "that no judge of any court in this
            State shall make any allowance to any officer or person named in this act except as in
            this act provided." It was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to add a section allowing salaries to the trustees of the asylum for
            feeble minded children of $400 each, out of which they are to pay traveling expenses. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER opposed raising this salary two hundred or any other hundred dollars. Those
            gentlemen accepted the office at the salary provided in the law, and the way is open for
            them to resign if they can not serve at the compensation named in the statute. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM predicted that would he one of the most disagreeable institutions in
            the State to manage, and he favored giving the trustees the increase proposed. The
            salary should not, be so low that only those living in the immediate neighborhood can
            accept of the positions.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHIRK would not make any special opposition to the amendment. No objection was
            made to the sum named in the bid when it was on its passage. He preferred a larger sum
            but did not put it in for fear of endangering its passage. Inasmuch as is is not in the
            act is is better to let the salary stand as fixed heretofore. </p>

          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved to take up the specific appropriation bill [H. R. 640.] </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE opposed the motion. This bill is usually very properly held back till the
            closing hours of the session that any items belonging therein may be included. </p>

          <p> Pending the roll call-- </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN explained his negative vote, because of the appropriation of $62,000
            to purchase the State fair grounds in the city of Indianapolis. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER, when his name was called, regretted being compelled to vote for this
            $62,000 appropriation for the State Fair-grounds, but rather than vote against the whole
            bill he would do so. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES, in explanation of his vote, said, believing the bill should fail rather
            than $62,000 of the people's money be wrongfully appropriated he should vote
            no.</p>
          <p> Mr. OLDS, when his name was called, said he was anxious an appropriation bill should
            be passed, but disliked to have to include in the affirmative vote the authority to
            purchase the State Fair-grounds. He voted "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was announced as above, and so the bill passed the Senate. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved to take up the bill [H. R. 687] to authorize a temporary loan. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS thought this motion was sufficiently embraced in the State House bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES said it was due to the State officers that action be taken on this bill
            one way or the other without delay. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to; and the bill H. R. 687 was read the first time. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON moved for a dispensation of the constitutional restriction that the bill may
            be read the second and third times now and put on its passage.</p>
          <p> The motion was rejected by yeas 31, nays 12 for want of a constitutional majority. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON offered a concurrent resolution that this General Assembly adjourn without
            day on Monday, the 24th day of March, at 6 o'clock p.m. He moved its adoption,
            demanded the yeas and nays on that motion, and also demanded the previous question. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr HARRIS further proceedings under the call was dispensed with. </p>
          <p>On demand of Mr. BURRELL a call of the Senate was ordered, and, being taken, discovered
            46 members present and answering to their names.</p>
          <p> The demand [Mr. Langdon's] for the previous question was seconded by yeas 32,
            nays 12. </p>
          <p>The main question was ordered, and under the operation of the previous question the
            resolution was adopted by yeas 25, nays 16.</p>
          <p> Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER, in explanation of his vote, said he apprehended no member was more anxious
            to go home than he, but as the specific bill had but just been passed and the fee and
            salary bill is not completed here, he was unwilling to vote for this resolution now. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, said there was no member would be more personally
            hurt by staying here than he, but he thought it a dereliction of duty to go home without
            disposing of the calender. He thought it would be gross injustice to leave so many House
            bills and other important measures without action, and therefore voted no. </p>
          <p> Mr. V1EHE, when his name was called, said he was extremely anxious to go home, but
            being satisfied it is impossible to present the fee and salary and specific
            appropriation bills to the governor in the time prescribed by the constitution and
            adjourn on Monday, he would have to vote "no."</p>
          <p> Mr. WOOD, when his name was called, said it would not be treating the House right to
            adjourn with so few of its bills passed and so many on the Senate files, and he should
            vote "no," for that and other reasons already stated.</p>
          <p> Mr. FOWLER, just as the vote was being announced, said: Understanding from the junior
            senator from Marion [Mr. Harris] that the treasurer of state has gone home with the
            opinion that he can get along without the loan bill being passed, he would change his
            vote from "no" to "aye."</p>
          <p> The vote was announced as above, and so the resolution was adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL moved to take up the bill [H. R. 671] appropriating $25,000 for the
            expenses of this special session of the General Assembly, pending which motion--</p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

          to separate billiard, card, pool and other amusements from saloons where intoxicating
          liquors are sold, when the fact is he was not in the house, and he desired that the

          should be taken again. </p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD said the title of the bill was the best part of it. There were the same
            provisions in this bill that the House had decided against some days ago. So far as the
            purchasing of votes is concered, we were sufficiently protected now. The trouble was
            that the law was not enforced. He was also opposed to the clause that would compel the
            printing of the name of the party ticket at the head. He hoped the bill would not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said the bill provides that when the party name is printed,
            at. the head of the ticket, the ticket should not have any other name thereon than
            members of that party. It was to prevent deception and fraud. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought it was very much such a bill as was passed upon a few days ago. He
            was here to say that every man should have the right to vote for whom he pleased. If the
            election board can determine the intention of the voter, that intention should be
            carried out. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill then failed to pass the House by yeas 34, nays 54. </p>
          <p>Mr. NAVE called up Mr. Overmeyer's bill [H. R. 331] limiting taxation by
            township and school trustees not to exceed 10 cents on the $100 for special school,which
            was read the third' time. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. OVERMEYER, the bill was recommitted to a special committee of
            three with instructions to insert such amendments as he read and submitted, </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Humphreys in the <pb n="54" xml:id="VAA8558-17-304"/> chair) made the
            committee to consist of Messrs, Overmeyer, Nave and Conner. </p>
          <p>The committee by Mr. OVERMEYER reported immediately that they had complied with the
            instruction of the House and recommended the passage of the bill. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The report was concurred in and the bill finally passed the House by yeas 63, nays 10. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER offered an amendment to the title and said he supposed the title was
            amended by consent. </p>
          <p>The SPEAKER. (Mr. Humphreys in the chair.) I have so ordered it, and you can not go
            back on that. [Laughter.] </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. MESSICK called again for a vote on the bill [H. R. 658] concerning insurance
            companies, which failed this morning for want of a constitutional majority, and it
            finally passed the House by yeas 56, nays 23. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Vermillion, called up Mr. Fancher's bill [H. R. 418] to amend
            section 28 of the common school law, which was read a third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, thought the provision in the bill allowing the patrons of the
            school to select the teacher was a good one, and he was in favor of this provision.</p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS said there was nothing in the bill but what every fair-minded man could
            subscribe to. The law simply proposed that the trustees could not employ a teacher in
            the face of a majority of the patrons of the school, and he therefore favored the
            passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER said that the teacher selected by a majority of the patrons should have no
            more pay than if he were selected by the trustees. He hoped the present law would not be
            changed, and he opposed the passage of this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. BAKER and Mr. M1TCHELL were opposed to the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. REED looked upon this bill as a step backwards. A majority of the patrons can under
            the present law say who shall not teach their school, and as a whole the bill was a bad
            one, and should not pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. FANCHER moved that the bill be referred to a special committee of three, with
            instructions to amend, and report in the morning. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to,and the SPEAKER made the committee to consist of Messrs.
            Fancher, Allen and Baker. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER, at the request of Mr. Stevens, called up the bill [S. 21] to establish
            city courts in cities having a population of 6,000 inhabitants, which was read the third
            time. </p>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Under the operations of the previous question the motion was agreed to by yeas 54, nays
            38. </p>

        <p> On motion by Mr. DAVENPORT the reading of the minutes of yesterday's
          proceedings were dispensed with and the bill [H. R. 114] to legalize certain building,
          loan and saving institutions was read the second time, the constitutional restrictions
          dispensed with, the bill read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0. </p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. CADWALLADER the bill [H. R. 623] to legalize the sale and conveyance of
          certain real estate by the Randolph County Auditor, was read the first, second and third
          times, under a dispensation, and finally passed by yeas 40, nays 0. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>On motion by Mr. TRAYLOR the bill [H. R. 168] to authorize cities and towns to issue
          bonds for the purpose of funding their indebtedness--so as to reduce the rate interest on
          existing obligations, was read the second and third time, under a suspension of the
          constitutional provision, and passed the Senate by yeas 43, nays 0. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS, stating the agreement was not such as he desired, but feeling like the merits
          of his bill are such that it. ought not to be defeated, he moved to concur in a conference
          report now submitted by himself on his bill [S. 158] to remove all legal disabilities of
          married women, which report recommends the adoption of a new section, viz: "A
          married woman shall not mortgage or in any manner encumber her separate property acquired
          by descent, device or gift, as a security for the debts or liability of her husband or any
          other person." </p>
        <p> Mr. TAYLOR opposed concurrence in the report because it, would compel a married woman to
          join her husband and sell her real estate outright in order to raise money for any
          necessary purpose. A law that will compel a person to do an illegal act in order to
          accomplish something that is right, is not a good law; in other words, if a married woman
          desires to borrow a sum of money at a reasonable rate of interest, for any special
          need--to cancel a mortgage on the family home, for instance she would have to do it under
          this bill by an indirect proceeding. She would have to join her husband in a deed to a
          third party, the third party to convey it back to the husband., and then that husband has
          the right to do with it just as he pleases. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES admitted the full force of this argument, and stated that the conference
          committee, on the part. of the Senate, contended for the position assumed by the senator
          from Dubois [Mr. Traylor]. The object of the bill is not only to disenthral women from
          legal disabilities, but it offers additional protection to the business community ; and
          recognizing the fact that there is a demand all over the State for legislation on the
          subject, and not wishing to lose the main features of the bill--regarding them as
          permanent to the amendment--the committee agreed to the House amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS had taken great interest ill this measure, and it was with great reluctance,
          as a member of the conference committee, that he had consented to this amendment, The
          opposition to it, however, is based principally on technical grounds, as he did not think
          it is in reality very greatly objectionable and why? Because, if a woman owning real
          property wants to help her husband to money, she mortgages her realty; while, if this
          amendment shall become a law, she will simply join her husband in conveying it to a third
          party. He believed it far better that this amendment should be adopted than the entire
          bill, which he hoped the majority of the Senate thinks is rigtt, should fail to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS believed the bill, if enacted a law, would allow worthless husbands to squander
          the property which their wives acquired by inheritance. He believed the present law, as
          construed by the supreme court, to be right. If a contractor is not able to hold his own
          in a contract with a married woman, the General Assembly ought not to legislate in his
          favor as against the married woman, and for the benefit of the contractor. He opposed
          concurrence in the committee report.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE said this question of advancing woman's rights has gone too far to be
          laughed down. As to her separate property and her earnings, she should be as a femme sole.
          As to the disposition of her real property, her hus-[band] <pb n="56" xml:id="VAA8558-17-306"/> [hus]-band should join with her, and, if he refuses, he should
          have the privilege of calling for a decree of court, under which, if favorable, she might
          proceed without him. That would give her all the protection she should ash; for. This bill
          is a pioneer movement in the right direction. All pioneer movements are surrounded with
          uncertainty. We must trust the next Legislature to erase the evils that may be found in
          such measures. He favored concurrence in the report. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS was unalterably opposed to this amendment, but, favoring the principle in the
          bill, and being unwilling to sacrifice the good in it on account of this objectionable
          clause, he favored concurrence. </p>
        <p>The report was concurred in by yeas 31, 15.</p>
        <p>0n motion by Mr. WOOD, the bill [H. R. 620] to provide for a general system of common
          schools--by far the longest bill of either session--about one inch or more in thickness of
          foolscap paper--being a codification of all the laws on the subject--was taken up, and
          read the first time (in probably less than one minute by the watch.) and referred to the
            <orgName>committee on education</orgName>.</p>

        <p>Pending the roll call--Mr. BENZ, in explanation of his vote, said: The bill would give
          the clerk in his county but $475 and the sheriff $350, and as he was not in favor of
          cutting the throats of his county officers he could not sup- port this bill, therefore he
          voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, reminded the Senate that from first to last he had
          insisted the remedy for the evils desired to be corrected by a bill of this kind is in the
          hands of the people, and can only be accomplished by their adopting the constitutional
          amendment authorizing special legislation on the subject of fees and salaries. To disturb
          the present law would bring confusion upon the county officers, and then two years hence
          the law would be torn up again; and so, regarding this as an element of evil, he voted
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: When he
          introduced the proposed constitutional amendment in relation to fees and salaries two
          years ago he was of opinion, as now, that there never could be framed a good fee and
          salary bill, doing justice to officers and giving satisfaction to the people, as long as
          the present constitutional provision is in force--as long as there has to be the same fees
          and salaries taxed in the larger as in the smaller counties. We passed a fee and salary
          bill in 1871 and repealed it in 1873. We passed another in 1873 and repealed it in 1875.
          That was amended in 1877, and now the present, law will be repealed, and this bill which
          is now being enacted will be again repealed in 1881. He could see no use in tampering with
          the present law, and for these reasons voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said he voted for the
          proposed constitutional amendment in the hope it would be ratified by the people before
          this Legislature would adjourn, so that a fee and salary bill could be passed that would
          do justice to every county in the State. That not being the case, and considering that
          this bill would operate unequally and unjustly in the different counties of the State he
          could not give it support, and therefore voted "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, in explanation, when his name was called, said: Knowing this bill cuts
          county auditors, something less than 20 per cent., excepting in counties above 20,000, and
          believing the sheriffs' and clerks' fees are reduced about 15 per cent.,
          which is just what ought to be done, and knowing that nearly all of us faithfully promised
          the people to do something looking to a reduction of fees and salaries, irrespective of
          the proposed constitutional amendment, he felt it not only incumbent upon him but a great
          pleasure to vote "aye " </p>
        <p>Mr. COFFEY, being called on to vote after the roll call was completed, said: Believing
          that this Legislature ought not to pass a fee and salary bill; believing it better to
          postpone legislation upon this question until the proposed constitutional amendment upon
          this subject is submitted to the people for action thereon; believing the constitutional
          amendment will be ratified by the people; and further, believing that under our present
          constitution it is impossible to make a the bill which will be just and fair in its
          operations in all the counties throughout the State; and believing this bill is unjust and
          unfair in its provisions, he therefore voted "no."</p>
        <p> The result was then announced as above, seconded, and so the fee and salary bill passed
          the Senate.</p>
        <p> Mr. FOSTER, from the <orgName>committee of conference</orgName> on his city water works
          bill [S. 103], reported an amendment agreed upon, which is intended to protect the rights
          of owners of private water power. The report was concurred in. </p>

          <p>On motion of Mr. VIEHE, his bill [S. 195] to provide for the redemption of real estate
            sold on execution, and to provide for deeds of conveyance in such cases, was read, as
            was also a majority and minority report recommending the adoption of a substitute. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to concur in the minority report, and proceeded to picture the superior
            provisions of the substitute over the original bill. This is one of the most important
            bills of the session. The law on this subject probably affects more property in the
            State adversely than any other law in force on the statute book. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE desired to answer some objections to his original bill, the provisions of
            which are mostly taken from the laws of New York and Illinois; and also to point out
            some defects in the substitute.</p>
          <pb n="57" xml:id="VAA8558-17-307"/>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said it was apparent some amendment ought to be made to the present
            redemption law, which evidently was made to cover some special cases; and like such kind
            of legislation, after serving its purpose, is usually not of much value. </p>
          <p>The minority report was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. COMSTOCK offered an amendment to the majority report, to apply where the rental
            value exceeds a $100 a year, providing for the appointment of a receiver where the party
            in possession is not responsible, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE opposed the amendment, thinking it would so load down the bill that its
            consideration might as well be stopped if the amendment be adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON also opposed this amendment. This is no time for so stringent a law--and
            one which would oppress those least able to bear up under its operations. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE moved to amend so that each person redeeming shall be subrogated to all the
            rights of the original judgment plaintiff, &amp;c. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE insisted tins amendment would destroy the harmony and consistency of the
            bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE contended that his amendment did not interfere with the harmony or symmetry
            of the bill. </p>
          <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
          <p> Mr. BRISCOE moved to extend the time of redemption from one to two years. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE objected. </p>
          <p>The motion was lost. </p>
          <p>On Mr. MENZIES' motion a proviso was added to section 3, "that
            nothing herein shall apply to any mortgagee or junior judgment 'creditor not
            made a party to the proceedings under which, the property was sold." </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. HARRIS, under the operations of the previous question demanded by him,
            the bill was considered as engrossed, read the third time, and passed the Senate by yeas

        <p> Prayer service by the Rev. F. M. Role, of the Rochester M. E. church.</p>
        <p> The reading of the journal was omitted. </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER introduced a bill [H. R. 697] designating what counties shall constitute the
          fifth, sixth and seventh judicial circuits, which was read the first time and passed to
          the second reading.</p>
        <p> Mr. JOHNSON, in offering the minority report on his bill [H. R. 601] to prohibit the
          keeping of saloons, etc., said owing to the unprecedented and unparliamentary action of
          the gentleman temporarily in the chair, he was placed in rather an awkward position. It
          has been the parliamentary rule, when a bill was referred to a select committee, to put it
          in the hands of its friends for perfection. But in this case the majority of the committee
          were the enemies of the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN presented a majority report, setting forth at some length its reasons for the
          conclusions which it arrived at, viz.: that the bill lie on the table. Signed by Messrs.
          Lehman, Briggs and Taylor, of Daviess. </p>
        <p>The minority report was read, striking out all after the enacting clause, and inserting
          new matter.</p>
        <p> Mr. JOHNSON hoped the House would vote direct upon the adoption of the minority report.
          He had drafted the bill in good faith for the benefit of the people.</p>
        <p> Mr. LEHMAN believed every member had his mind made up as to how he would vote upon the
          question. He was opposed to the adoption of the minority report, and claimed that the
          present, while perhaps not a perfect law, was the best we could get now, and should not be
          changed. If this bill becomes a law he though; it would take out of the school fund about
          $200,000 per annum, and would virtually make whisky free, and he was opposed to free
          whisky. </p>
        <p>Mr. Allen, of Putnam, said: We have had free whisky license, local option and prohibition
          laws, and whisky has been drank all the same under the operation of these different laws.
          He believed oar present law was as good as any that had been tried, and as a rule, he
          found that it was best to let well enough alone. Therefore, he would oppose any effort to
          change it for a law that was doubtful and expensive. The present law brings a revenue for
          the benefit of our schools. He might be opposed to the education of his children with
          means derived from this source, and others might be; if so, let the money be used, as
          suggested in some of the bills introduced in this body, on the public roads. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON thought this was a proper law and embodied the principles he had long
          cherished, and he hoped, the bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS would vote for a bill that would make it criminally wrong to sell his neighbor
          whisky. But to simply declare a saloon a nuisance, it was too mild a form to suit him. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said a large proportion of the expense of paupers, criminal prosecutions,
          etc., resulted from the fact that money earned by hard labor was too frequently spent for
          liquor by the head of the family on his way home with his week's wages in his
          pocket. He submitted in support of this statement the following figures: </p>

        <p>Number of saloons in the State, 2,306; number of convicts, 1,126. In the counties of
          Marion, Vanderburg, Allen and Vigo, there were 895 saloons and 410 convicts, while in
          Hendricks, Henry, Randolph and Monroe counties, there are no saloons and but 32 convicts. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. CALDWELL demanded the previous question, and under its operations the minority report
          was rejected by yeas 44, nays 48. </p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--Mr. BRIGGS, in explanation, said he was opposed to this bill for
          the reason that under it any person could sell liquor as he pleased so he did not allow it
          to be drank on his premises. He could peddle it about the country in a wagon and sell it
          by drink or quart without liability, if he did not sell any to minors. Besides this it
          will take <pb n="58" xml:id="VAA8558-17-308"/> from the School Fund over $200,000 without
          any corresponding benefit. In fact, this bill means free whisky and he therefore voted
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, in explanation said: Believing this bill to be in
          the interest of good morals he voted "aye." </p>
        <p>The majority report was then adopted and the bill was laid on the table. </p>
        <p>Majority and minority reports upon the bill [H. R. 982] regulating the sale of
          intoxicating liquors--local option--were submitted, the former recommending laying the
          bill on the table, and the latter recommending its passage. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH said: This bill gives communities, which are powerless under the existing law
          to protect themselves, the right and power to exclude saloons from their limits, when they
          don't, want them. When men once close their eyes to so monstrous an evil, and
          steel their hearts against the urgent appeals of all the better class of society, such are
          never wanting in expedients to justify them for indorsing a traffic that not only their
          judgment, but every honest and decent impulse of their nature tells them is wrong. He a
          demanded support of this bill on the very principle of self-government, the right of the
          people to regulate and control their own affairs--not only a cardinal, but a much boasted
          article of faith of the Democratic party--if not of all others. </p>
        <p>Whenever a bill is offered to protect society from a traffic that robs thousands of
          innocent women and children of the bread of life; of that which a natural appetite craves
          and ought to have--then comes the cry of sumptuary laws. Is it any infraction of the
          principle of free government to curb the appetite of whisky-drinkers, it thereby we can
          supply a greater number of more worthy people with the food that natural appetite craves?
          Our rule is, the greatest good to the greatest number. We believe a man had better take
          the 30 cents a day he spends for drink, and buy a few oranges, a spring chicken, or some
          little luxury for his sick wife; or hire a wash girl to help the mother of his children in
          her arduous duties, than spend it for that which injures him. There are more
          fights--neighborhood quarrels--more crimes and murders in one year a whisky community,
          where saloons are plenty, than in 10 years where the people are temperate. Take, for
          example, the town of Newcastle, Henry county, where for 30 years there was no saloon,
          seldom a tight, no court expenses to speak of, not enough poverty hardly to keep that
          excellent virtue we call charity, in healthy existence; but but since they have got
          saloons they have had three murders in as many years. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN said as he believed that local option meant local fights and feuds, he
          therefore moved to lay the bill and reports on the table. </p>

        <p> So the minority report was adopted. </p>
        <p>Mr. FLEMING submitted the report of the conference committee on the bill [S. 103] to
          authorize the construction of water works. (See Senate reports to day noon.) The report
          was concurred in. </p>
        <p>The House then proceeded to the consideration of the Senate amendments to the specific
          appropriation bill and refused to concur in the first Senate amendment striking out of the
          original bill an appropriation of $25,000 for furnishing the new building for the insane.;
          and also the Senate' addition to the second item of $40,000 for furnishing the
          same. </p>
        <p>The House also refused to concur in the items appropriating $12,000 for improvements in
          the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb,and the item of $94,000 to complete the new Insane
          Hospital.</p>
        <p> The item appropriating $62,000 for the purchase of the Indiana State Fair Ground being
          read-- </p>
        <p>Mr. HUBBARD doubted the propriety of sending out $62,000 now to save the $25,000 loaned
          to the society some years ago, and was unwilling to concur in this amendment.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHANKS favored this appropriation of $62,000 to pay the first mortgage on the State
          agricultural fair grounds. The society owns 36 acres of ground in the city of
          Indianapolis, with buildings that cost the society over $l25,000, the land itself being
          worth more than this proposed appropriation. There is a prior lien of $60,000, with $2,000
          interest. Subsequent to this is a lien of the State for $25,000 on the same ground. The
          society can not meet its interests the first of which falls due in April, 1879. The debt
          is open to suit when the interest falls due and is unpaid. Thus the property may be lost
          to the society and to the State before another Legislature meets. Our manufacturing
          interests are in their infancy, but they will be the better sustained as the agricultural
          interests are fostered. </p>
        <p>Mr. Willard said that this appropriation was not truly an appropriation but an
          investment, and regarding it in that light it is better to make the appropriation than to
          let the State fair go down. It is a good investment as a business proposition, for it
          gives if $162,000 for property worth $120,000. Other States have their State fairs, and
          for the great State of Indiana to step backward in this matter would be a shame to this
          Legislature. All other interests have had protection. We have had legalizing bills by the
          dozen; we have had medical bills and mining bills; but now that the farmers of this State
          demand something at our hands men rise against it. He trusted, in behalf of the
          agricultural and mechanical interests of this State, that this appropriation would be
          made. </p>
        <p>Mr. HANDY claimed to represent one of the finest agricultural count es in the State, and
          insisted that it is a duty, recognized by surrounding States, to foster annual
          agricultural exhibitions. He referred to the history of the State Board of Agriculture in
          the past, and to its proposition to make to the State, for $62,000, a deed to the
          exposition grounds of 36 acres,. the costly buildings thereon and in addition, all its
          other property, including about three acres of unincumbered land lying in the city of
          Indianapolis, with perhaps $5,000 or $6,000. Now this institution comes to this
          Legislature <pb n="59" xml:id="VAA8558-17-309"/> like a child to its parents, and proposes
          to give its all if the State will pay its debt. The question is, will you accept it, and
          thus say to our sister States that still we have an Agricultural Board in Indiana; that
          still we recognize the agricultural interest as being the basis upon which all the other
          great institutions of the State rest. In conclusion he appealed to members who feel an
          interest in this great institution to separate us not; give us a nucleus around which, we
          may rally once a year and meet and greet each other. He implored gentleman in the name of
          toiling men--especially the farmers--of this State to loan to Indiana's treasury
          the amount of $25,000, and also save the State from dishonor, and let us go home to our
          constituents with the encouraging word that their acts are appeciated by this Legislature. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS made a few remarks in opposition to the purchase of the Fair Grounds by the
          State. </p>
        <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM: I would not say one word or cast one vote in opposition to the farming
          and laboring classes of the great State of Indiana. But he was opposed to this reckless
          and extravagant expenditure of the people's money under the pretext of protecting
          the "sacred interests" of the farming community. He was reared on a
          farm, and still follows that noble and much exalted business. Those he represents were not
          demanding that this $62,000 of the hard earnings of the people shall be invested in any
          obscure enterprise like the one under consideration. He was bitterly opposed to this
          wasteful expenditure, and the people who toil from early morn till late at night do not
          demand that we should waste their hard earnings in the manner proposed by the Senate
          amendment. </p>
        <p>The House took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
          <p> Messrs. HEED, CONNER, THAYER, HESS, TAYLOR, of Daviess, SAINT, BAKKER, and CALDWELL,
            spoke in favor of the proposition to purchase he State Fair grounds. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, wanted to consider the question in the light of public policy.
            The extreme limit; of the valuation of this property according to appraisement of
            resident citizens was but $80,000. He asserted that the State could better subserve the
            agricultural interests by appropriating a sum of money year after year to enlarge the
            premiums. The State of Michigan and other States had appropriated $25,000, $30,000 or
            even $40,000 per annum to enlarge the premiums; and it was also customary for these
            States to hold their State fairs in different parts of the State. Nearly every county
            had fair grounds ample to accommodate the State fair, and in this way materially
            encouraged the agricultural interests in different portions of the State. He would not
            cut off these agricultural associations, but thought the agricultural interests of the
            State could be better subserved by following the example of these States than to
            appropriate this amount of money, and tie it up in the purchase of real estate, and at a
            price too so far above its true value. Then the central part of the State ought not to
            have the entire benefit of tins money. </p>
          <p>The House adopted amendments to this item, that no pan of the $62,000 shall be paid
            unless an absolute title fee from all liens be vested in the State; and that the State
            Board shall have free use of the grounds for annual fairs till otherwise ordered,
            conditioned on keeping the grounds and buildings in good condition. </p>
          <p>Mr. DAILEY moved to strike out $62,000 and insert $9,000 or so much as was needed to
            pay the interest on the indebtedness and to protect the interest of the State.</p>

          large foreign insurance company. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZIES opposed the amendment, </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS hoped the resolution would pass as it came from the House; preferring if any
          change is made the appointee shall be a friend to Home rather than foreign Insurance
          companies. This plan of preparing legislation is the best ever devised, and the resolution
          looks in the right direction. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE declared all legislation fostering <pb n="61" xml:id="VAA8558-17-311"/> home
          companies is a fallacy. The moment legislation is had antagonistic to foreign companies
          that moment capital will be repelled from the State and her interests will inevitably
          suffer.</p>
        <p> The amendment was rejected. The House resolution was adopted.</p>
        <p> The House concurrent resolution for instruction and request to Indiana Congressmen to
          use their best efforts to procure an amendment to the law so that banking associations
          shall be subject to the regular rules of law In the courts, both State and national was
          adopted. </p>
        <p>The House concurrent resolution directing a joint committee to examine and report what
          the State should pay to Marion county for use of gas, etc., at this session was adopted;
          and the presiding officer [Mr. Burrell] named the committee on finance as such committee
          on the part of the Senate. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE introduced a bill [S. 458] to provide for a revision of the laws of the State
          of Indiana, by a commission of five competent lawyers, 10 be appointed by the judges of
          the supreme court; the codification to be completed before the 1st day of September next,
          so as to be stereotyped under the supervision of the printing bureau, strongly bound, and
          sold at the price of $30 or both volumes. It was read the first time, and referred to the
            <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>, with instructions to report to-morrow morning. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. TRUSLER, the bill [H. R. 589] to authorize the payment of indebtedness
          by a township in Union county was read the first time and placed on the calendar. </p>
        <p>Mr. BENZ offered a joint resolution authorizing the governor to transfer all papers
          relating to the Morgan raid claims to the custody of the Adjutant General, who shall
          surrender to the owner any claim or evidence thereof on demand, which was read the first
          time. </p>
        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burrell) announced the consideration of the Exemption bill [H.
          R. 22], the question being on the substitute pending at the time of the adjournment, on
          Saturday afternoon. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE insisted, if his substitute was ejected, members will find out they have missed
          an opportunity to do the people of the State great service. If the homestead be limited in
          value there will be no effort to increase its value beyond that limit; but if a homestead
          unlimited in value is given, the effort will be to surround the home with all possible
          comforts and conveniences, and the result is it elevates the honor of the inmates; it
          stimulates them to accumulate taxable property, and all the higher elements and better
          motives are stimulated and cultivated. The State, instead of being studded with little
          homesteads held below a small value for fear they will be swept away, should present on
          every hand beautiful and cultivated residences whose inmates are constantly trying to
          still further beautify them. If such a homestead law be adopted it alone would relieve
          this Legislature of all its mistakes and from all its faults. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT believed the people of Indiana want a fair exemption law, but can not afford to
          have a homestead law. He was not sure but $1,000 is too much, though time may develop that
          is about the correct figure. The substitute would operate unjustly and unfairly especially
          in or near cities, where a man could bid defiance to his creditors and yet live like a
          prince. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS offered as a substitute for the whole subject matter, a bill similar to the
          bill S. 248--for a homestead of the value of $700 and personalty to the value of $300.
          This he believed to be the best that can be obtained at this session. </p>
        <p>The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>[On motion of Mr. WOOD the House amendments to the Wabash Canal land patent bill [S.
            18] was concurred in.]</p>
          <p> Mr. HEFRON preferred the exemption bill as it came from the House. If the purpose is
            to grant relief to men of small means who have families to support, an exemption law is
            far better, as he proceeded to show. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON: The public good is better subserved by exempting a certain portion of a
            man's earnings than by having it consumed by process of court, following upon
            financial misfortune. The public good is best subserved by having capital fixed in
            homesteads and in tools, which in the hands of labor, will produce wealth. He favored a
            homestead to a reasonable limit, and an exemption of the tools of the laborer.</p>
          <p> Mr. TRAYLOR opposed the substitute: The people are not demanding such legislation, it
            is only advocated by a few persons; and instead of operating for the good of poor
            people, it will have the contrary effect. </p>
          <p> Mr. KENT would vote against; the substitute, in the hope of getting something
            better.</p>
          <p> Mr. URMSTON was in favor of a fair exemption, but did not believe a homestead law is
            demanded by the people.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE regarding this substitute as class legislation, and contravening a
            constitutional provision requiring exemptions; protested against its adotpion.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The substitute [Mr. Harris'] was adopted by--yeas 27, nays 15. The bill as
            amended was react the third time. </p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE contended this bill was in violation of section. 22 of the bill of rights.
            There is no authority to exempt anything but specific property, which the statute itself
            must describe, that there may be no inequality. Then this bill does not repeal the law
            now in force exempting $300. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said it would not do to argue that a homestead law is unconstitutional, and
            made a few remarks in favor of his bill.</p>
          <p> Mr. HART, being, a poor man's friend, and regarding this bill as unequal in
            its bearings, was opposed to it. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT desired an exemption larger than $300, and--</p>
          <p>Mr. MAJOR said this is a measure in which he took a great deal of interest, but as this
            bill is unjust and unequal because it allows a man land worth $1,000, while a man with
            no land is allowed but $300, and thus it discriminates in favor of the strong against
            the weak; therefore he opposed it.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHIRK desired a much more liberal homestead law passed, but believing this as good
            as can be obtained, would vote for it. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT and Mr. WINTERBOTHAM also favored a liberal exemption and a liberal
            homestead law, but did not consider this bill either. </p>

          <p> The bill [H. R. 5] to amend section 1 of the act regulating the number of grand
            jurors,was indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 11] to amend the act authorizing County Commissioners to construct
            gravel or other roads, was read the second time. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 17] to repeal the railroad aid act, with a majority report for
            indefinite postponement, and a minority report favoring its passage, being read--</p>
          <p> Mr. SHAFFER favored indefinite postponement of this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend the minority report by allowing promised aid to be voted. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN believing this railroad aid law, for the most part a swindle, has long
            enough disgraced the statute book of Indiana, <pb n="62" xml:id="VAA8558-17-312"/> and
            he favored concurrence in the minority report.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT referred to the fact that local indebetness was increasing at a fearful
            rate. He hoped the minority report would be concurred in. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE referred to the fact there was no law compelling townships to aid
            railroads. If this law was repealed it would prevent two townships in his county from
            enjoying railroad advantages. He desired the law to remain as it, now stands. </p>
          <p>Mr. KENT also spoke in favor of concurrence to the minority report. The people should
            have an opportunity to determine for themselves this matter. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD was sure the standard railroads and not the tanners were asking a repeal of
            this aid law. He who votes in favor of its repeal votes in favor of a great and grand
            monopoly and against healthy competitions between railroads. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM thought it strange when almost every town, township and county is
            embarrassed that senators will advocate the creation of further indebtedness to grind
            down the people. The greatest railroad center in the world--the city of Chicago--never
            voted a dollar in aid of any road running into it.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZIES regarded it as inexpedient to keep this law on the statute book, and spoke
            in favor of its repeal. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. LANGDON the bill, reports and amendments, was referred to the
              <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>, with instructions to amend the bill as
            recommended by the minority report, and return the bill to-morrow morning.</p>

            the two Houses, to-wit: On the specific appropriation bill, Messrs. Cadwallader and
            Leeper: on the fee and salary bill, Messrs. Kent and Moore.</p>
          <p> Mr. LANGDON objected to action on messages from the House before they are read and
            considered by the Senate. </p>

            House also refused to concur in the other Senate items.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD moved ineffectually to amend, by adding the sum of $1,974.12 to Ruben P.
            Main, for indebtedness made by State Prison South. </p>
          <p>The claim of $10 for summoning witnesses for the committee visiting the Southern

          <p>Mr. VAN VALZAH moved to amend by adding $1,000 for the State Normal School, which was
            ruled out of order. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRYANT called up his motion to reconsider the vote by which the House concurred in
            the Senate amendments appropriating $62,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. DRAKE was in favor of a reconsideration. He was against appropriating so large an
            amount, but was willing to bridge over by paying up the Interest. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS and Mr. LEHMAN said they would vote for the reconsideration with the
            understanding that an appropriation shall be made sufficient to protect the interest of
            the State until 1881. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 59, nays 35. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH, in explanation, said he had voted for this amendment, but believing that the
            money could be better appropriated, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT, in explanation of his vote, said he thought the interests of the State would
            suffer it not protected in this way, and he therefore voted "no." </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart moved to strike out the item appropriating the money to purchase
            the State fair grounds, and insert for the use of the State Board of agriculture
            $10,000, one moiety thereof to be paid on the 1st of June, 1879, and the other moiety on
            the 1st of June, 1880, and the Auditor of State is hereby instructed to draw his
            warrants for said amounts at said dates, to be paid out of any money in the treasury not
            otherwise appropriated. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said it was just a question whether we should put $10,000 more to the
            $25,000 already appropriated, making $35,000. He was opposed to it.</p>
          <p> Mr. JOHNSON If we intend to continue the State fairs we should protect these grounds.
            He thought, as a business transaction, the best thing the State could do would be to
            purchase this ground. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS had been out to see this ground and had made inquires of competent judges as
            to the value, and found that $75,000 is all it is worth, and he understood that the
            interest of Eastern capitalists in this ground could be purchased to-day for $45,000. If
            we appropriate $10,000 to protect this ground for two years it is as much as we can
            afford to do.</p>
          <p> Mr. STUCKER was opposed to appropriating $62,000 for the purchase of the State fair
            grounds, and thought the State could not afford to engage in this kind of a speculation.
            It was of no benefit to any person except the people of Indianapolis. If the property is
            as valuable as is stated he is sure some speculators would have taken hold of it before
            this time. He did not think the grounds would, bring $40,000 to-day, and he did not
            believe the man could be found who would give the amount proposed by the Senate
            amendment for the whole concern. The State had better lose the $25,000 already invested
            than to spend twice the amount to save it. He thought the farming community of the State
            would be benefited more by dividing this $62,000 among the different county agricultural
            societies than by appropriating so large an amount in one spot. If we intend to
            legislate in the interest of rings, the amendment is in the right direc-[tion] <pb n="63" xml:id="VAA8558-17-313"/> [direc]-tion, and it looked as though there was a
            ring at the head of this whole matter. The people are asking for a reduction of
            expenses, and not such extravagant appropriations, and the people will hold us
            responsible for the way we spend their money. He also opposed the Senate amendments of
            $1,310.50 to the Normal School, for old ditching claims, etc., etc. </p>

          <p>The amendment was then agreed to by yeas 51, nays 29. </p>

          <p> Mr. OVERMEYER said he did not think the proviso in the resolution was appropriate now,
            inasmuch as the adjournment had been fixed to such a remote day. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS, Mr. SHUTT, Mr. OSBORNE and others thought the proviso had better remain. </p>

          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved ineffectually--yeas 39, nays 48--to reconsider the vote by which

          <p> The House then took up the consideration of the bill [H. R. 344] on fees and salaries,
            with the Senate amendments thereto, which were read. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, moved that the House concur in the Senate amendments. He made
            this motion in the hope that the House would not concur. </p>
          <p>This motion was rejected. </p>
          <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, offered a resolution for a reduction of all fees and salaries
            now in force at least 25 per cent. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD would not, be willing to reduce all fees 25 per cent.; for example, he
            thought the recorders' fees ought not to be reduced. </p>
          <p>The resolution was adopted. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. DALTON a <orgName>committee of conference</orgName> was ordered on

            House by yeas 75, nays 1.</p>
          <p> Mr. FANCHER called up his bill [H. R. 418] to amend sections 26 and 28 of the school
            law which was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. VANPELT did not think this was a very good bill. He said this was throwing cat
            fights in every school district. </p>
          <p>Mr. HART thought there were no persons so well calculated to select the teacher as the
            patrons of the school.</p>
          <p> Mr. BLOCKLEY hailed the provisions of this bill as most wholesome, and there had been
            five schools broken up in his part of the State by refusing the patrons of the school
            the right to select the teacher. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, did not suppose but every trustee would be glad to see this bill
            pass, and he was in favor of it. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT had been the victim of a successful contest for teacher of a school, and some
            feeling was created at that time which had not yet been forgotten, </p>
          <p>Mr. EDWINS believed that it was right and proper to give the selection of a teacher to
            the patrons of a school. He was opposed to the one-man power, and hoped the bill would
            pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. WIMMER favored the passage of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. KESTER thought this law was better than the old law. The parent and guardian are
            the best judges as to who should teach their children or wards, and he hoped the bill
            would pass. </p>
          <p>Mr. KELLY hoped this bill would become a law, as he thought the majority of the patrons
            should select the teacher. </p>
          <p>Mr. M1TCH LL thought this bill would make a wholesome law. He believed in the elective
            franchise in this as well as in other matters. </p>
          <pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-17-314"/>

          <p>Mr. HUBBARD endorsed the bill heartily, as he believed it gives the women the right to
            vote, and he regarded it as a step in the right direction. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER objected, because it allowed only parents and guardians or patrons of the
            school a vote in the selection of a teacher. To tax a roan for school purpose, and then
            to say, because he had no children, he shall have no voice in the election, was taxation
            without representation. </p>
          <p>Mr. FANCHER insisted that the power to elect a teacher should be vested in the parent
            or guardian, as provided in this bill. For building school houses or other school
            purposes ail the tax-payers have a vote. He thought the bill just and proper, and ought
            to pass. </p>
          <p>Under the operations of the previous question the bill passed the House by yeas 53,
            nays 30. </p>

        <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE his bill [S. 458] to provide for a revision, codification and
          publication of the laws of this State, was read the second time, with a committee
          substitute reducing the number of revisers from five to three, extending the time for its
          completion to September, 1880, and providing only for a revision to be submitted to the
          next General Assembly. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. VIEHE this subject was made the special order for 3 o'clock p.
          m. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. KAHLO the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on the
          second reading:. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 20], providing for the establishment of a State Bureau of statistics and
          geology--the governor to appoint bi-annually a chief who is an expert in the science of
          geology and chemistry at a salary of $1,500, was read the second time with committee
          amendments, reducing the salary to $1,200 and the annual expense from $3.000 to $2,000.
          The amendments were concurred in, and ordered engrossed. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 38] to amend sec. 6 of the act concerning enclosures,trespassing animals
          and partition fences, was indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 361] authorizing sheriffs to administer oaths in all matters pretaining
          to the duties of their office, was also indefinitely postponed. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 390] to legalize elections of township trustees in the April election of
          1878 was read the second time, with a majority report recommending passage, and a minority
          report recommending indefinite postponement. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON thought this bill ought to pass, in order to settit vexed questions, and
          prevent litigation. </p>
        <p>Mr. MENZlES said the supreme court has decided that the township trustees elected in 1878
          were not eligible, if they had held two terms before, and this was a bold attempt to upset
          that decision. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE also opposed the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE insisted the bill was only intended to legalize the election of those trustees
          qualified to hold the office, and he desired an opportunity to so amend it.</p>
        <p> Mr. LANGDON coincided with the opinion of the minority of the <orgName>judiciary
            committee </orgName>that this bill ought to be indefinitely postponed, and with the
          views expressed by the senators from Posey and Vanderburg [Messrs. Menzies and Viehe]
          which he amplified. </p>
        <p>Mr. KENT: On account of the seeming discrepency between the acts of 1877 on this subject
          there is a difference of opinion between <pb n="66" xml:id="VAA8558-17-316"/> lawyers,
          though the decision of the supreme court is undoubtedly correct according to the statutes;
          yet this bill is right; it can do no harm to anybody, and should be passed. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE held if this bill becomes a law it will not affect cases already filed, as the
          courts can not be ousted of jurisdiction by a curative statute. It is unjust to
          indefinitely postpone this bill, without putting in it the provision he referred to a few
          minutes ago. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS thought this proposition should be kicked out as soon as possible. </p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 455] to transfer to the United States the title of the State of Indiana
          to the Antietam National Cemetery, was read the second time.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 59] providing for appeals from County Commissioners in cases of
          annexation of Territory, and cities and towns against the will of the owner, was read the

          estates--sections 65 and 66--was read the second time, with committee amendments thereto. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE said this was a bill to avoid difficulties under the present law and to
          facilitate the adjustment of claims against estates, and he argued in favor of its
          propriety and necessity. </p>

            with gas was read the second time. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 82] in relation to foreign express companies was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL explained the objest of the bill to be to place express companies in a
            position where they can punish embezzling employes, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to take up the bill [S. 456] for the government of the State prisons,
            that the Legislature may do its duty to the people of the State by quieting threatened
            litigation with reference to the management of these institutions. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD said this thing had got to be an outrageous scandal in his part of the State,
            and he was surprised to see so many senators unwilling to remove that scandal. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER thought this bill ought to be taken up and discussed. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. OLDS, the motion to take up this bill was laid on the table by yeas
            25, nays 19. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order,
            being the committee's substitute for his bill [S. 458] for a revision of the
            statute laws of the State of Indiana. The report of the committee was concurred in. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.66 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
          <p>Mr. REEVE said this substitute bill was similar to the law under which the revision was
            made in 1843, except there was but one commissioner then, while this bill provides for
            three. On his further motion the constitutional rule was dispensed with--yeas 34, nays
            12--and the bill read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. LANGDON regretted that he would have to vote against this bill, because it proposes
            no compensation to the revisors. The State has been cursed with an inadequate revision
            of her laws since 1852. The bill ought to set forth a specific and liberal compensation
            for the revisors; otherwise there will be three gentlemen pursuing the next Legislature,
            and probably many following, with a claim for maybe $5,000 or $6,000 apiece on account
            of this work.</p>
          <p> Mr. HARRIS said every one admitted there should be a revision of the statutes that can
            be relied on. Indiana needs such a work. The objection raised by the senator [Mr.
            Langdon] is an unusual one. He favored the passage of this measure, and if $500 is not
            enough for them they ought to be allowed more. The poorest paymasters in the world pays
            beforehand. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas 33, nays 10.</p>

            railways to use public highways, streets, etc., was read the second time.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 453] to amend section 2 of the supervisor of highways'act of
            March 5,1877. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER stating that a similar bill has already passed and received the signature
            of the governor, on his motion it was indefinitely postponed.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 377] to regulate the practice of medicine, midwifery and surgery, was
            read the second time with committee amendments. </p>
          <p> Mr. WILSON moved that the bill and report be indefinitely postponed. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHAFFER, hoped the motion would not prevail. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER offered a bill on this subject two years ago, and also at this session, and
            being in favor of legislation on this subject, while this one does not fully meet his
            notion, he was willing to accept it rather than none. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE had a few serious objections to this bill. It is in the interest of only one
            school. It allows quacks that have been run into this out of other States to continue in
            practice, etc, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON did not expect a perfect bill at once, but as the people are expecting
            legislation on this subject this bill proposes a liberal and fair enactment.</p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT thought one of the most foolish of the many foolish things done by this
            Legislature would be to pass a medical bill at this stage of the session when we have
            neither the time nor inclination to give such <pb n="67" xml:id="VAA8558-17-317"/> a
            measure proper consideration. Certainly we should not throw the control of the medical
            profession into the hands of any one school. It is a great deal better to make haste
            slowly in this direction. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER thought the Senate has occupied time enough in the discussion of medical
            bills. He demanded the previous question.</p>
          <p> Mr. WILSON made an ineffectual motion yeas 18, nays 23-to indefinitely postpone the
            bill and committee report. </p>

          <p>Mr. REEVE, when casting his negative vote, expressed himself against the propriety of
            taking up his bill at this time. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 179] to prevent the manufacture and sale of adulterated commercial
            fertilizers was read the second time.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 414] for the relief of Patrick Hollegan was read the second time.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 132] to provide for issuing letters testamentary and letters of
            administration was read the second time.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 383] to legalize the Kokomo Gaslight and Coke company was read the
            second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE objected to this bill, because it proposes to legalize everything the company
            has done, as he understood the reading. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 131] to amend sec. 77 of the general practice act, was read the second
            time. </p>
          <p>Mr. OLDS did not believe in passing bills overturning and unsettling practices so long
            established. He moved to indefinitely postpone this bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS said justice could be barred for an indefinite length of time owing to the
            crowded state of the docket under the present practice. Such a practice is not known in
            many other States. He favored the passage of this bill. </p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE said the bill would, afford great relief to the practice of the State, and
            he trusted it would not be treated cavalierly. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE pronounced this as a most iniquitous bill, and he was surprised attorneys
            would sneak in favor of it. </p>
          <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 174] for the repeal of the provoke law, was read the second time, with
            a committee report recommending its indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS moved, to concur in the report. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT hoped the report would not be concurred in. He considered the law a
            disgrace to the statute book. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER heartily concurred in the remarks of the senior senator from Marion [Mr.
            Streight]. This provoke law furnishes a large amount of work for lawyers: It multiplies
            litigation, and takes bread from the mouths of hungry children. No State in the Union
            has a like odious law on the statute books. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON conceded there is an obnoxious feature in this law--the part which refers to
            the attempt to provoke. Where an assault is made the assaulting party should be
            punished. He knew of small boys and women being prosecuted for attempting to provoke
            full-grown men. He hoped the law would be modified as to correct this abuse.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZ1ES recognized the fact that thia was a mean, cowardly law, and offered a
            premium on cowardice. He hoped the Senate would join the House in repealing it.</p>
          <p> Mr. OLDS moved to amend the report by changing the recommendation to a favorable
            one.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE thought the provoke law had done more good in preventing assaults than any
            other one on the statute books. He had no doubt it prevents over 2,000 breaches of the
            peace in the State every year. There has been no libel law, and good men bad no
            protection except this. Senators, when calling this a coward's law do not
            reflect that it is the only law we hays for the protection of brave men from the foul
            months of scallawags, poltroons and cowards. Brave men obey the law in its smallest
            elements as well as in the greatest. Only cowards violate law. The law will tolerate no
            breach of the peace; it regards no words as a provocation for a blow. A brave man may
            stand by and hear his wife or daughter insulted by the veriest scoundrel that walks the
            street, and if he should knock the black-guard down or be guilty of the slightest
            infraction of the peace and be prosecuted therefor he has only the sympathy of the jury
            to rely on for protection--they must violate their oaths or find him guilty. Without
            this law on the statute books men who are law-abiding have no protection against the
            foulest insults of those who are utterly irresponsible, and who the law can reach in no
            way under the provisions of the statute, which is sought by this bill to be repealed. </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. ROBESON called up the bill [S. 118] authorizing the appointment of a receiver by the
          court, or judge in vacation, in actions to vacate a fraudulent purchase, between parties
          jointly interested, where property is in danger of being lost by mortgagee, for the

          by yeas 70. nays 2. </p>
        <p>Mr. BEARSS called up his bill [H. R. 669] to <pb n="68" xml:id="VAA8558-17-318"/>amend
          sections 19 and 20 of an act to provide for the opening, vacating and change of highways,
          etc., which was read the third time, and passed the House by yeas 56, nays 30. </p>
        <p>Mr. RODMAN called up the bill [S. 57] for the establishment of workhouses, which was read
          the third time . </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, said this was a bill that ought not to pass, as it would bring
          convict labor in competition with labor on the streets in such cities as Indianapolis. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONNOR contended this measure would save to each county a very large expense. He
          thought the bill a good one, and hoped it would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. ROBINSON thought it would be a very great saving to our poor people in the way of
          taxes; in Marion county especially.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH said this bill originally applied only to Marion county, but now it applied
          to every county in the State. It was a good bill, and ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. EDWINS explained the provisions of the bill are such that counties may or may not
          avail themselves of its benefits. He was, therefore, in favor of the passage or this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON thought every one ought to vote against this bill. It looked to him like
          building a penitentiary in every county, and he did not see that it would benefit any one.
          If you take prisoners out in the country it would take two men to watch one, and could not
          benefit any but large cities. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD said if it was solely for Marion county he was willing that it should go to a
          committee,and be so amended, but if it is to extend all over the State he was opposed to
          it. Competition in labor was now so low that he was opposed to bringing convict labor in
          competition any further with free labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. OWEN thought this was a good bill. It was like taking bitters--you can take it or let
          it alone, as you please. In counties where they need it they ought to have it, and was in
          favor of its passage </p>
        <p>Mr. FANCHER said this bill was a good one, and ought to pass. By establishing a county
          work house you can make convicts work out their fine, when otherwise, though they may be
          able, they prefer to lie idly in jail during the term of their sentence.</p>
        <p> Mr. TULLEY thought a work house could be made self-sustaining. This bill is strictly
          guarded, and it seemed to him there is nothing in it to be scared about. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS said the houses that this bill authorizes to be built would not cost less
          than $2,000 each. If the bill could be amended so as to confine it to counties of 20,000
          or more inhabitants he would not object to it. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH thought this bill was a good one. </p>
        <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM was opposed to the bill because there was too much machinery about it, and
          because it allows a one-horse penitentiary to be established in every county in the State,
          and it was too expensive. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE, of Elkhart, said it was discretionary with the county boards, and the
          question was, could we trust the county boards with this discretionary power? He thought
          we could </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON objected to this bill, on the ground of public policy. This bill provides
          for turning all the labor on our public works into the hands of thieves, vagrants,
          criminals and tramps. It brings up the question squarely, who shall have work--the
          condemned criminals or the honest men who are out of employment and out of the necessaries
          of life? This bill proposes to shift the expense of keeping our prisoners from the
          commonwealth to the honest poor laborers of our State, by giving the cream of all the
          public work to the convicted thieves and scalawags, who never work at all except when
          forced to do so. In the matter of living, the rich need no laws. The industrious poor
          should be protected and encouraged, and all the labor of our public works should be given
          to honest citizens instead of giving it to law-breakers, and he would vote for no law that
          discriminates against the honest laborer in favor of condemned criminals. If this bill
          affected the county of Marion and city of Indianapolis alone he might support it, but he
          way opposed to the erection of criminal workhouses in every county. It was a great mistake
          to take a day's work from the reputable poor and give it in the hand's
          of law breakers. </p>
        <p>Mr. LINDLEY favored a protective tariff for American labor, but would not carry that
          proposition so far as to perpetrate an outrage on the masses for the benefit of a few of
          the lower class. He did not think honest men ought to be taxed to keep idle men in jail,
          when a work house might make them earn their own bread. He favored the passage of the
          bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. CARTER could see nothing to be gained by the passage of this bill. If we give the
          commissioners power to erect these work houses they will be very likely to erect them, and
          for that reason he was opposed to the passage of the bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. HEROD said there is not a "single solitary" one of these convicts
          whose labor will come in contact with any free labor. The convicts live in luxury in the
          jail at the expense of the tax-payer. It was a good bill, and he hoped the House would
          pass it. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill then finally passed the House by yeas 63, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER submitted the report of the special committee of the House to investigate
          the office of attorney general during the terms of J. C Denny and C. A. Buskirk. It is a
          voluminous document, largely devoted to a discussion of the construction of the law by
          which the office should be governed. The report concludes with the statement that the
          committcee has not had time to make anything like a complete examination of the books and
          accounts of the office, and the left it with the House to consider some plan for the
          recovery of the money due the State. All the members signed the report. </p>
        <p>Mr. FAULKNER stated that in a conversation with the deputy attorney general he was told
          that the deputy charged the county from which he made collections $10 per day and
          expenses, and a still further charge of 15 per cent for all moneys collected for the
          State, and the attorney general gets 15 per cent. more, making 30 per cent. and $10 per
          day and expenses of the deputy.</p>
        <p> Mr. OWEN moved that the report be adopted, and the committee allowed to continue their
          investigation.</p>
        <p> Mr. KEITH, said the committee had seen enough to say to this House that the half had,
          not been told. As it stands, it is confusion worse confounded, and ought to be
          straightened out. He believed the amount illegally retained during the two terms
          investigated to be fully $75,000. </p>
        <p>Mr. SNODDY said after we have this information he would like to see this rat hole
          stopped. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN offered a resolution that the attorney general proceed to the collection of
          all illegal fees overcharged by General Denny and ex-Attorney General Buskirk, as shown by
          the report of the committee, and that the present deputy Donehay be at once dismissed. </p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE offered a substitute that the committee be instructed to continue a
          consideration of the subject and report to the House the best method to be pursued to
          recover <pb n="69" xml:id="VAA8558-17-319"/> the money or punish the officials, and to
          submit such method by resolution or bill upon the subject. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. HEROD the report was recived, 500 copies ordered printed and Mr.
          Osborne's substitute was adopted. Then came a recess until 2 o'clock p.
          m.</p>
        <div type="section">
          <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION. </head>
          <p>Mr. ENGLISH introduced a bill [H. R. 698] authorizing the common council and board of
            aldermen in all cities having a voting population of 16,000 or more, to ordain and
            enforce ordinances, which was read the first time and passed to the second reading.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS introduced a bill [H. R. 699] to amend section 9 of an act prescribing the
            duties of the attorney general, which was read the first time. </p>
          <p>Mr. ROBINSON called up Mr. Osborne's of Elkhart, bill [H. R. 499] to amend
            section 336 of the general practice act, which was read the third time and passed the
            House by yeas 69, nays 5. </p>

          <p>Mr. ROOKER called up his bill [H. R. 557] making it the duty of the governor of the
            State in certain cases to have the business of any public officer investigated, which
            was read the third time, and finally passed the House by yeas 63, nays 8.</p>
          <p> Mr. SAINT called up his bill [H. R. 520] the concurrence and agreement, of any nine
            members of a jury of 12 men shall be sufficient to enable them to return a verdict in
            civil cases, which was read the third time and passed the House--yeas 61, nays 14.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> Mr. SCHOLL called up the bill [S. 197] to protect the ballot box, and to procure a
            fair election, which was read the third time and passed the House by yeas 72, nays 3. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. SCHWEITZER called up his bill [H. R. 576] authorizing notaries public to solemnize
            the marriage contract, which was read the third time, and finally passed the House by
            yeas 59, nays 15. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON, for Mr. Shields, called up Mr. Edwins' bill [H. R. 214] to
            regulate the fare on railroads, which was read the third time.</p>
          <p> Mr. EDWINS, explaining, said this bill was to make the fare uniform all over the
            State. There were some roads chartered by the State which, under that charter, can not
            charge more than three cents per mile, while others could charge more. </p>
          <p>The bill failed for want of a constitutional majority--yeas 46, nays 29. </p>
          <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS, from the conference committee on the specific appropriation bill [H. R.
            640], reported an agreement. </p>
          <p>Mr. REED moved that the House concur in report of the conference committee. The Senate
            recedes from its amendments in appropriating $81,00O, and the House recedes from its
            previous action to the extent of only $12,300. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said it was not competent now to strike out any part of this report
            unless you want to kill the bill or appoint a new <orgName>committee of
              conference</orgName>. Unless you agree in the entire proposition you destroy the work
            of the committee, and have the bill in the same shape it was before you appointed the
            conference committee. </p>
          <p>The report of the committee was then concurred in without a division. </p>
          <p>The Senate amendments to the bill [H. R. 22] for a homestead exemption were read. </p>
          <p>Mr. CONNER offered an amendment, which was adopted, that if such homestead shall be
            sold the proceeds shall be exempt to the amount of S700 for three months, and if the
            amount be invested in a homestead, it shall be entitled to the same exemption as the
            original homestead. The provisions of the homestead exemption as herein provided shall
            not affect contracts or obligations existing at the date of the notice and record of
            such homestead exemption. </p>
          <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam was opposed to this amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS thought the amendment was absurd and would work disadvantageously. </p>
          <p> Mr. WATSON said the theory of the law was to exempt a particular thing. </p>
          <p> Mr. WILLARD thought this amendment was necessary to preserve the homestead. The bill
            would not encourage homestead possessions, but rather the contrary, unless the amendment
            be adopted. </p>
          <p>Mr. OWEN thought we ought to vote for the amendment, as it was indispensable to a good
            homestead law. </p>
          <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER moved to amend by striking out "not to exceed half an
            acre" and insert "a tract or parcel of land," and to strike
            out section 6, which allows a $300 exemption of personal property. </p>
          <p>Mr. SAINT was opposed to concurring in the Senate amendment because the recording:
            clause was an insult to the class of people you were trying to protect. Give them the
            $1,000 without any restraint whatever. </p>
          <p>Mr. WATSON favored the Senate amendment because he thought it was right. This law can
            not bring relief to the debtor class. He wished that it could. </p>
          <p>Mr. THOMPSON: As the law now stands we have an exemption of $300, and he did not see
            any reason why we could not make an accumulative exemption. He could vote for the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER hoped the House would stand by the bill they had passed, and ask the Senate
            respectfully to secede to its amendments. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH said no man should take the money owing to another and invest it in a way
            that will cover it up. He would give an exemption of $500 and allow the claimant to
            designate just how it shall be invested.</p>
          <p> Mr. WORKS said this kind of a law ought to be uniform, and apply to everybody alike. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRIGGS said this bill provides that if a man have real estate, he can have $700 of
            that real estate exempt, and can also have $300 of his personal property exempt, making
            in all $1,000. On the other hand, the man who does not own real estate can have but $300
            in all exempt. This is a discrimination he could not aid. Give the people an exemption
            of $500 or 81,000, and let that amount be chosen by the one to be benefited. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On the motion of Mr. FAULKNER the previous question was ordered, and under its

        <p> The reading of the minutes was omitted. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr FOWLER the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on their
          final reading.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 414] for the relief of Patrick Hallegan was read the third time and
          passed by yeas 36, nays 6. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILSON, explaining: If the facts in this bill were true, no one would vote more
          willingly for it than he, but believing not a word of it is true, he would have to vote
          "no." This is but still another evidence of the necessity for a court of
          claims in which justice can be done to all concerned. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded  Vote-->
        <p>The bill [H. R. 455] to facilitate and authorize the transfer to the United States the
          interest of the State of Indiana to the Antietam National cemetery in the county of
          Washington, State of Maryland, was read the third time and passed by yeas 35, nays 2. </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 642] to legalize the incorporation of Walton, Cass county, and an
          election held therein, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (on motion of Mr. Harris) appointed Messrs. Harris and Tarleton a
            <orgName>conference committee</orgName>on the part of the Senate on the disagreement
          between the Houses on the exemption bill [H. R. 22].</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 11] to authorize county commissioners to issue bonds to an unlimited
          amount, to raise money for construction of roads, and to provide for the payment thereof
          by taxing lands adjacent to the roads, being read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER explained the great benefit this bill would be to the counties in his
          district. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS counseled not too great haste in the matter. He doubted the propriety of such
          a measure, and opposed the principle embodied in it, which has brought about disaster in
          the State of Indiana. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER replied that the law has given general satisfaction so far, and contended the
          hands of the people should not be tied as to how far they may tax themselves for such
          improvements. </p>
        <p>Mr. HART insisted that more safeguards should be thrown around this system of
          legislation, instead of increasing the evil, as this bill proposes to do. </p>
        <p>Messrs. WINTERBOTHAM and GARRIGUS also opposed the bill.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p> The bill failed to pass by yeas 6, nays 34.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 20] for the establishment of a bureau of statistics and geology way read
          the third time, with the Senate amendments reducing the salary of the chief to $1,200 and
          the expenses to $2,00O a year.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE favored this measure--no State should be without such a statute. </p>
        <p>Messrs. FOWLER and MENZIES contended the Senate amendment allowing the chief to examine
          places where laborers are worked is a nullity. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE insisted the law is already ample to enforce the provisions referred to. </p>
        <p>Mr. COMSTOCK also thought the objection untenable. As the law is now there will be an
          absolute saving to the State by the passage of this bill of $2,000 annually. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON opposed creating this new department, because he believed it unnecessary to
          the welfare of the people; though on general principles he would favor the gathering of
          such information from every practicable source. When Indiana is as old as Massachusetts,
          which has the best statistical department in the Union, it will be time to sustain a much
          more extensive bureau than is proprosed in this bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN admitted this bill is not as full as it ought to be, but the first step
          can be taken now, and two years hence it can be enlarged. He referred to several
          governors' messages recommending the passage of such an act as is proposed in
          this bill. Such a bureau would facilitate very greatly the growth of the State, and he
          hoped the bill would pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. HART doubted the propriety of establishing this new department in the State
          Government at this time. </p>

        <p> The bill [H. R. 38] to amend section six of the act of June 4,1852, concerning
          enclosures, partition fences and trespassing animals failed to pass by yeas 13, nays
          29.</p>
        <pb n="71" xml:id="VAA8558-17-321"/>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 82] in relation to foreign express companies, was read the third
          time.</p>
        <p> Mr. BURRELL explained it was to allow express companies to more readily punish
          embezzling employes.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS was afraid the provisions of the bill may create trouble. On his motion it
          was referred to a special committee of three. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS moved for a suspension of the order of business to enable him to introduce a
          bill supplemental to the act of March 15,1879, concerning the removal of or bringing suit
          by foreign corporations against citizens of this State. He explained it was amending the
          law passed this month by providing f hat after the violation of the said act by said
          companies the contracts or property by them acquired thereafter shall be void. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE said the bill S. 111, which has been on the Senate files since the 17th. of
          January, will accomplish all desired by this new bill.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <!--P.71 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p> Mr. MENZIES opposed the motion to suspend the rules for the introduction of this new
          bill. The law it proposes to amend was passed after due consideration, and should not be
          amended as proposed, in order to drag people from every part of the State to courts in
          Indianapolis and Evansville, for the benefit of resident attorneys in those cities. The
          motion to suspend the order of business that the bill may be introduced was rejected by
          yeas 13, nays 26. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE moved to take up the bill S. 111 to enable companies to hold and convey real
          estate in this State, etc., and put it on its passage. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. STREIGHT this motion was laid on the table.</p>
        <p> Then came the recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <p>The bill [H. R. 383] to legalize the incorporation of the Kokomo Gas Light and Coke
            company was read the third time and passed by yeas 32, nays 5. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 338] for the relief of George N. Winchell and others, security for a
            defaulting township trustee, was read the third time.. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE explained the justness of this measure. </p>

          <p>The bill [H. R. 263] to amend the fish law was read the third time and passed, by yeas
            32, nays 10. </p>
          <p>Mr. LEEPER explained its only object was to suspend the operations of the fish law
            during the months of March and April as far as the Kankakee river is concerned.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p> The bill [H. R. 179] to prevent the manufacture and sale of adulterated commercial
            fertilizers was read the third time and passed by yeas 40, nays 1. </p>
          <p>Mr. P0INDEXTER hoped the bill would pass, it being a step in the right direction. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill [H. R. 687] to authorize a State loan to pay off a temporary loan heretofore
            made--$510,000 April 1 and $200,000 December 1--was read the third time and passed by
            yeas 30, nays 14.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 377] to regulate the practice of medicine, midwifery and surgery,
            being read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to refer the bill to a special committee of three, with instructions to
            substitute the bill S. 278, and report immediately, for the reason that this bill does
            not regulate the sale of proprietary medicines, and is greatly inferior in many other
            respects. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE opposed the motion, fearing it would kill the only bill on this subject that
            can be passed. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN appealed to the Senate to enact this measure as it is now--it can be
            perfected by the next General Assembly.</p>
          <p> Mr. SHAFFER much preferred the bill, [S. 278] but seeing no chance to pass it, he
            would give his influence to this as the next best. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE had no personal ends to serve, but from his knowledge of medicine, believing
            the results of this bill would be ultimately evil, he urged the Senate, in the interests
            of the people, to agree to his motion. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON said, as far as he was advised, the physicians in his county--some 30 or
            40--are opposed to legislation on this subject.</p>

          <p> The bill [H. R. 132] for issuing letters testamentary and letters of administration,
            was read the third time and passed by yeas 36, nays 1. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 17] to repeal the county and township railroad aid act, was read the
            third time with amendments by the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>. </p>
          <p>Mr. VIEHE moved to indefinitely postpone the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE assured this Senate the bill now was well guarded and an important measure-
            to the people of of the State.</p>
          <p> Mr. TRAYLOR favored the motion. The people are not asking the repeal of this law, but
            self-interest is moving those favoring this repealing measure. Some cities went too far
            in making a railroad bond debt before the 2 per cent. restriction was enacted; but since
            then the law does not hurt any one. If the people are never burdened till burdened under
            the provisions of this law they will never be injured in that way. He hoped the motion
            would prevail. </p>
          <p>Mr. TRUSLER also hoped the motion will prevail. He had heard no complaint of the
            present law. No State can prosper without the benefit of railroads. If the people want a
            railroad, and are willing to pay for it, he saw no necessity for interfering with them. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD regarded this law above others as in favor of the fanning community of the
            State. Under the statute there can be no abuse because indebtedness is limited to 2 per
            cent. He was willing to trust the people. They have passed through an ordeal of hard
            times that few have seen in this century, and they will act judiciously and we can
            safely trust them. </p>

          <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to by yeas 31, nays 15. </p>

            each for preparing, indexing and proof reading the House journals, with an amendment by

          <p>Mr. LANGDON reminded the senators that this matter was poovided for in the fee and
            salary bill, and on his motion the resolution and report was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>The House message informing the Senate of its refusal to concur in the Senate

          <p> Mr. HARRIS moved that the House be requested to grant a <orgName>committee of
              conference</orgName> on this bill and that said committee on the part of the Senate be
            appointed now. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. COFFEY made an ineffectual motion--yeas 18, nays 28--to lay this motion on the
            table. </p>
          <p>The motion for a <orgName>conference committee</orgName> was agreed to, and the
            LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR appointed as such committee on the part of the Senate Messrs.
            Comstock and Coffey--Mr. Harris expressing a wish not to be placed thereon. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE offered a resolution to replace on the files a copy of the bill [H. R. 158]
            in relation to the settlement by county commissioners with county and township officers;
            the original of which has disappeared.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE contended this contemplated action could not replace the bill on the files.
            There is no evidence that a copy of the original bill is not here; neither is there a
            copy of the substitute, nor copies of the committee reports thereon. The Senate can not
            assume that the original is lost, and evidence to substantiate that statement must be
            produced. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE said this bill came to the Senate about six weeks ago, when a busy lobby
            appeared on this floor in opposition to it, since which time if has been spirited away
            by foul means. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the resolution was referred to a select committee of three--
            Messrs. Moore, Shirk and Coffey with instructions to ascertain where the original bill
            is, and if that can not be done, whether or not a correct copy is attached to the
            resolution, and report to-morrow morning. </p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate an invitation from the Alumni
            association and citizens of Bloomington to witness the exercises of the approaching
            semi-centennial commencement of the State University, June 9,10 and 11.</p>
          <p> Mr. TREAT regarded it as a matter of congratulation that the State possesses a
            university about to celebrate its semi-centennial. The invitation being brief and
            referring to an important event, he moved it be spread on the records of the Senate, and
            that the invitation be accepted. </p>
          <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            authorize assessment without view--was read the third time and failed to pass by yeas

            (fully described in these reports of January 14, a. m.) was read the third time and
            failed to pass--yeas 22, nays 19--for want of a constitutional majority. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. HARRIS the bill [H. R. 620] comprising a codification of the school
            laws, was taken up. The bill was read by title only. The amendments pro- posed by the
            Senate committee on education were read. The bill was then read--a few lines in a
            place--amid much merry-making for about five and a half minutes--which was considered
            the second reading of the bill. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER protested against this kind of proceedings. </p>
          <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN moved to concur in the committee amendments.</p>
          <p> Mr. OLDS did not believe it right to put this bill through in this way at this late
            hour (6:15 o'clock) beyond the reach of amendment. </p>
          <p>Mr. URMSTON always desired to have some knowledge of what he was voting on, but he i
            had no idea of what is in this report. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS also would like to know what such an immense mass of manuscript contains
            before voting upon it. He characterized this proceeding as indecent haste. There are new
            features in the bill, and every senator ought to know what they are before voting upon
            them. </p>

            his motion the bill, as it came from the house, was taken up, read the first time, and

        <p>Mr. BRIGGS said there are two bills pending before the Assembly that ought to be passed
          before the adjournment. The people demand the passage of a fee and salary bill. One is now
          before the <orgName>conference committee</orgName> which will reasonably reduce fees and
          salaries and save to the people the cost of this session. <pb n="73" xml:id="VAA8558-17-323"/> The bill revising and amending the school law will probably
          pass the Senate to-day, with amendments, that will save the people $100,000. There is a
          homestead bill about completed. It will take the next three days to perfect these bills,
          and pass them. If we adjourn Saturday we only have until to-morrow evening to pass these
          bills, and if we fail to pass these bills we will not do the people or ourselves justice.
          Let us get these bills passed within the next three days , and then take up this
          resolution to adjourn. We can do this and adjourn Monday next.</p>

        <p>Mr. LEHMAN was in favor of this adjournment next Saturday. He was as anxious as any one
          to pass a fee and salary bill, but all this could be accomplished if the House was
          willing. If you set your stake the House will then work to it. An adjournment on Saturday
          will save to the people at least $3,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH said we were sent here to do our duty, and while there is any prospect of
          bringing to a satisfactory termination important measures we ought to stay here until that
          is done. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, thought that we ought not to adjourn until the business of
          legislation shall have been accomplished. He will willing to agree to the adjournment on
          Monday, because he thought in that time we could take all the action necessary upon the
          important measures now pending. </p>
        <p>Mr. DRAKE thought if we agree to adjourn on Saturday the fee and salary bill will go
          where the woodbine twineth.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said all the effort to adjourn seems to develop the fact to be that the
          majority of this House does not intend to adjourn until the constitutional limit. If we
          can not pass a fee and salary bill by Saturday we can not pass one at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON said the very men that desire to prevent the passage of these important bills
          before us are the very men that are urging an early adjournment. We should go to work and
          complete the business and not take up the time of the House in the vain effort to pass
          buncomb resolutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD said if we had fixed a determinate day for an adjournment, we would have
          worked to that day, and would have had the business complete, and more than likely ready
          to go home before this time. The course we are pursuing is likely to make this Legislature
          odious to the people He was willing to pass a fee and salary bill, but let us fix a time
          to adjourn. </p>
        <p>Mr. THOMPSON: The question is, will we labor two days longer and complete the work, or
          will we adjourn and leave important matters unfinished? He was in favor of the resolution
          to adjourn on Monday, and of working to that adjournment.</p>
        <p>Mr. CUNNINGHAM in voting for an adjournment on Saturday was satisfied his people would
          sustain him.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. WIMMER moved ineffectually--yeas 30, nays 59--that the further consideration of the
          resolution be postponed until to-morrow at 2 o'clock p.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. DAILEY moved ineffectually to add provided that the fee and salary bill and the
          schoolbook bill shall have passed.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Mr. ALLEN'S amendment fixing the time for Monday at noon was then agreed to by
          yeas 49, nays 40.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: He was not to be
          frightened from his position in favor of an early adjournment by this cry of "
          county officers' lobby." "By their fruit ye shall know
          them." And he thought his position upon this fee and salary question was pretty
          well established. He had introduced the first bill introduced in this House providing for
          a reduction of fees and salaries of county officers, and had voted for the fee and salary
          bill which passed the House, and was to-day opposed to adjourning without the passage of a
          fee and salary bill. He favored and adjournment Saturday because he was fully confident
          that if the Assembly really wanted to pass a bill at all they could and would easily pass
          one by that time. He thought the time ample for that purpose. He had been consistently in
          favor of an early adjournment in the interests of a tax-ridden people, and had so voted
          upon every proposition to that effect, and on the first day of the session had introduced
          a resolution providing for an early adjournment, which was defeated. He voted "
          no.".</p>
        <p> The resolution, as amended, was then adopted.</p>

        <p>Mr. EDWINS called up his railroad fare bill, H. R. 214, that heretofore failed to pass
          for want of a constitutional majority, which was again put upon its passage, and failed to
          pass by yeas 33, nays 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. SHANK called up his motion to reconsider the motion by which the bill [S. 21] to
          amend sections 1, 5, and 7 of an act establishing city courts in cities having a
          population of 6,000 inhabitants, was indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. STEVENS said he believed the House did not understand the provisions of this bill. It
          had been stated that it is a bill to create city judges, but this was a mistake. The bill
          seeks only to amend the act of 1875. It gives no additional power to create city judges,
          and he hoped the House would reconsider the vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN hoped the House would not reconsider the vote by which the bill was not
          indefinitely postponed.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH was willing that the motion, by which the bill was indefinitely postponed,
          should be reconsidered, as he had had a conference with the author of the bill and he was
          willing the bill should be amended.</p>
        <p>Mr. MIERS was opposed to this bill, because in his judgement, it created a new office,
          which he thought was useless. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER was in favor of the bill with the amendments proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS would oppose reconsideration on the ground that he was opposed to the
          amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. OSBORNE of Elkhart had no objection to the bill so far as he knew.</p>

        <p>The motion to reconsider was then agreed to.</p>
        <p>MR. ENGLISH moved that the bill be referred to a special committee with instructions to
          amend.</p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS moved that the committee be instructed to strike out all after the enacting
          clause and insert that the act establishing city courts in cities having a population of
          6,000 inhabitants be and the same is hereby repealed.</p>

          <p>Mr. SLEETH moved to amend by adding: "Provided further, That the attorney
            general shall not be entitled to any fees or commissions for moneys collected from the
            United States," to which objection was made, when--</p>

          <p> Mr. SLEETH, from the special committee thereon, returned the bill with the amendment,

        <p>On motion by Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN the Senate resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R.
          620] to provide for a general system of common schools. He said two years ago the
          Legislature authorized the superintendent of public instruction to arrange the laws on the
          subject of corn men schools in a convenient form, which has been submitted in the shape of
          this bill. Several amendments were made in the House of Representatives, and the Senate
            <orgName>committee on education</orgName> have also made some amendments. The House took
          the election of school superintendent from the township trustees and gave it to the county
          commissioners, but the Senate amendment has changed this again, which leaves it as the law
          now is. </p>
        <p>Mr. GRUBBS moved to reconsider the vote of last night by which the report of the
          committee was concurred in, in order that the committee amendments may be perfected. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS thought in several particulars the bill should be improved. Last night the
          great haste in which this bill was put through precluded proper consideration.</p>
        <p> The motion to reconsider was agreed to.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. GRUBBS section 32 was amended by limiting the examine on fee to $1. </p>
        <p>Mr. GARRIGUS moved, ineffectually, to strike out the proviso to section 32 allowing
          school boards in cities to license teachers.</p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON desired to see the proviso remain as placed by the committee.</p>
        <p> Mr. MENZIES moved to amend by adding a proviso to section 45, that school furniture
          shall not be changed or removed, or shall any school building be refurnished with new
          furniture oftener than once in 10 years, nor shall text books (in cities as well) be
          changed oftener than once in 10 years, unless by unanimous consent of all the members of
          the school board. He knew of whole families made millionairs by profits derived from the
          sale of text books in the common schools, so often have they been changed in the last 20
          or 25 years.</p>
        <p> Mr. LANGDON said discoveries were rapidly being made that are and should be incorporated
          in school text books, and to cut that off by this amendment is an innovation that should
          not be allowed. </p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT and Mr. HEFRON favored the amendment.</p>
        <p> It was agreed to. </p>
        <p>On motion of Mr. COMSTOCK, the forfeit of one day's wages for absence from
          institutes, was stricken out. </p>
        <p>Mr. HART moved to strike out all relating to county superintendents visiting schools,
          which was rejected on motion by Mr. FOWLER. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON moved to amend so as to make the employment of teachers dependent upon a
          decision of the patrons of the school at a regular school meeting. </p>
        <p>Mr. SARNIGHAUSEN reminded senators that this system has been tried and found to bring
          about great confusion and often litigation. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER has had experience in this master and favored the amendment. Under the
          present system confusion and dissatisfaction is continually brought about by the trustees
          imposing upon the, districts teachers not satisfactory to the patrons of the school. </p>
        <p>Mr. URMSTON objected to having trustees dictating what persons shall teach the common
          schools.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE said this plan had been tried and found to be productive of neighborhood
          quarrels. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR referred to the provisions of the law which prevents the dismissal of
          teachers unless for sufficient cause; and regarded that as a difficult matter in many
          cases where the teacher is obnoxious to the patrons of the school. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON favored leaving in the hands of the people the government of their own affairs
          as far as it can be done. Teachers should not be employed in total disregard of the wishes
          of the patrons of the school. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER opposed the amendment while conceding the fact that the wishes of <pb n="76" xml:id="VAA8558-17-326"/> the patrons should be consulted; But this government is one of
          delegated, power, and the power of selecting teachers should be delegated to the trustees
          because what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and the
          people can not act for themselves in all matters. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD believed this amendment proposes the best kind of Democratic doctrine. There has
          more township trouble grown up out of this question than any other, and this is the best
          way to bring about harmony and peace.</p>
        <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>
        <p> Mr. COFFEY made an ineffectual motion to reconsider the vote by which the committee
          amendments were concurred in so he might move to reduce the per diem of county
          superintendents from $4 to $3. </p>
        <p>The amendments were ordered engrossed.</p>
        <p> Mr. HARRIS moved that the Senate amendments be considered as engrossed, in order that
          the bill might be read the third time now, and put upon its passage.</p>
        <p> Mr. FOSTER (replying to any inquiry from the chair) said this bill has not been read the
          second time as every Senator on the floor knows. It was pretended, to be read. It was read
          in about one or two minutes, and then that enormous bill was considered as read the second
          time; whereupon, at the time, he protested against such proceedings.</p>
        <p> The motion [Mr. Harris'] was agreed to. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said as many members were dissatisfied with the reading given that bill
          yesterday; it is but fair it should now be read distinctly, that every senator may have an
          opportunity of understanding it. </p>
        <p>The bill, H. R. 620, was then ordered read the third time, pending the reading on
          which--</p>
        <p> Came the usual recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The reading of the bill [H. R. 620] having been completed Mr. OLDS facetiously inquired
            whether the sections [there are over 160] were numbered correctly. He did not hear the
            sections read consecutively. It was passed by the Senate by yeas 38, nays 6. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE from the select committee on the lost bill [H. R. 158] in relation to
            settlements of county commissioners with county, township and school officers, returned
            the same with a majority report, embracing amendments, and a minority report
            recommending indefinite postponement. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE rose to a point of order: that the special committee appointed on yesterday
            to inquire if this bill was lost, has not reported; that there is no evidence that the
            bill is lost, and if lost, only a copy with all its attachments, as it was when lost,
            can be filed; that the bill having been passed by the House and amended in the Senate,
            and lost from the files if lost. If a copy of the bill is to be obtained from the House,
            it must come certified as a copy at the time it was lost; if introduced here as a new
            bill it is not a lost bill, and it can only be done by unanimous consent, and such
            consent has not been given nor asked; it cannot be introduced here as a new bill and
            also as a lost bill that has passed the House and been amended in the Senate. Objection
            was made to its introduction, unless in the condition when it passed from the files; no
            unanimous consent has been asked or granted. </p>
          <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Urmston in the chair) overruled the point of order.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE appealed from the decision of the chair--pending which--</p>
          <p>Mr. KENT from the <orgName>joint committee of conference </orgName>on the disagreements
            between the two Houses on the fee and salary bill, [H. R. 344] submitted a report
            embracing a compromise. He said there was a fair reduction on all of the offices--on
            clerks and sheriffs about 20 per cent. from the fee bill of 1875. The county
            treasurers' salary is reduced from $1,000 to $800, but he gets 6 per cent.
            instead of five for collecting delinquent taxes. While not entirely satisfied with it,

          <p> Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p> Mr. FOSTER (in explanation) did not think this bill was a reduction--he was satisfied
            it was not, because county officials, who have been here as thick as flies, have their
            faces wreathed in smiles. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER, when his name was called, said he could not tell whether this measure
            proposes a reduction or an increase, and he apprehended no senator, aside from the two
            on the committee, knew any more about it than he; but acting solely on the report of the
            committee, he should vote "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS, when his name was called, pointed out a few discrepancies he noticed
            during the reading of the report. He could not vote for concurrence.</p>
          <p> Mr. KENT, in explanation, said he would like to have seen the report more fully
            discussed. He voted for concurrence, although believing the reduction to be too great,
            because the committee did the very best they could. </p>
          <p>Mr. SHIRK, when his name was called, said he had been in favor of reduction from the
            highest to the lowest, and should vote against concurrence, believing this bill, instead
            of reducing, in many instances, increases the salaries. He thought it would be found
            that the only reduction was in the clerk's office. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT, in explanation of his vote, said he believed the people demanded a
            reduction of fees and salaries. The committee promise it does reduce, and, believing
            this is the only bill that can be obtained this session, and whatever reduction we get
            will be so much of a relief to the people, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN, when his name was called, said he had spent a great deal of hard labor on
            this bill, and, not wishing to vote against it, being assured it does make a reduction
            of fees and salaries, he voted "aye." </p>
          <p> Mr. KRAMER, when the roll was finished understanding if the report is not concurred in
            the bill can not be amended, he changed his vote from "no" to
            "aye." </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. So the report was concurred in.</p>
          <p> Mr. COMSTOCK, from the <orgName>committee of conference</orgName> on the bill [H. R.
            20] to establish a bureau of statistics, submitted a report thereon; the Senate to
            recede from its amendments relating to inspections, the salary of the chief to be
            reduced, etc. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEFRON opposed concurrence in the report. </p>
          <pb n="77" xml:id="VAA8558-17-327"/>
          <p> The report was concurred in by yeas 30, nays 14. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WILSON, the pending appeal [Mr. Reeve's] was laid on the
            table by yeas 26, nays I1?.</p>
          <p> Mr. REEVE spoke in favor of concurring in the report of the minority. </p>
          <p>Mr. MOORE stated the only two points in this bill: That settlements of county boards
            With officers shall not be conclusive; and that where officers have paid over funds with
            which they are not justly chargeable, the county commissioners are authorized to remit
            such money. Where any injustice could be done to the State, county or township by this
            bill he could not conceive. In concluding, he demanded the previous question, winch
            being seconded, under its operations the minority report was rejected by yeas 8, nays
            36, and the majority report was concurred in. On his further motion the bill H. R. 158
            was read the second time. </p>
          <p>On motion of Mr. TRUSLER, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on
            the second reading: </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 589] to authorize the township trustee of Union township, Union county,
            to pay indebtedness incurred by a former trustee; the bill [H. R. 549] to amend section
            5 of s the act to facilitate the transaction of business in courts, with reference to
            special judges; the bill [H. R. 608] for the relief of Aaron Combs et al., security of a
            defaulting trustee,were severally read the second time.</p>
          <p> The bill [H. R. 467] to amend section 18 of the act regulating descents and the
            apportionment of estates, being read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES explained: Widows having inherited properly by first marriage after a
            subsequent marriage, if the children be of age, may alienate her interest by joining
            them in a deed. He made an ineffectual motion to have the bill read the third time and
            put on its passage. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 32] in relation to prosecution of felonies by affidavit or information
            was read the second time. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 477] to define and punish the crime of burglary and house breaking, was
            read the second time and referred to the <orgName>committee on the Judiciary</orgName>. </p>
          <p>The bill [H. R. 310] to allow sheriffs and constables to it follow defendants into an
            adjoining county and make a legal arrest: the bill [H. R. 192] to legalize the
            incorporation and all official acts of each and every officer of Butler, DeKalb county;
            the bill [H. R. 286] to amend an amendatory act concerning the duties of coroners, the
            bill [H. R. 115] to amend sec. 1. of the act for the protection of the Sabbath; the bill
            [H. R. 290] to amend sec. 1 of the act concerning the running at large of animals; the
            bill [H. R. 560] for relief of John J. Justice et al., securities for a defaulting
            township trustee; the bill [H.R. 420] for the relief of Alex Ingalls and others,
            securities of a defaulting trustee; the bill [H. R. 621] to legalize the levy of taxes
            by the city of Kendallville, were severally read the second time. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the Senate agreed to proceed to the consideration of Senate
            bills on the second reading, </p>
          <p>Mr. HARRIS, from the <orgName>committee of conference</orgName>, on the disagreement
            between the two Houses on the exemption and homestead bill, [H. R. 22] reported an
            agreement for an exemption of $500, and on the question of a homestead reporting it
            could not agree. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. REEVE the report was laid on the table, the committee discharged, the
            chair authorized to appoint another <orgName>committee of conference</orgName>, and
            request the House to do the same. </p>
          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made the Senate committee to consist of Messrs. Grubbs and
            Fowler. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOWLER moved to take up the bill, [S. 456] for the government of the State
            prisons.</p>
          <p> Mr. MENZ1ES humorously called upon the senator from Laporte [Mr. Winterbotham] to
            father his child--and take again under his parental care the prison bill he so gallantly
            fought for but a few weeks ago. </p>
          <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM replied that he could forego all the good in his prison bill, while
            knowing it would be used for a foul and base purpose. He had been misrepresented in this
            matter, and took occasion to say, among other things, that in no instance had he been
            actuated by impure or selfish motives. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOLLEN moved to substitute the board of health bill, [S. 179.] </p>
          <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. STUCKER called up his bill [H. R. 229] to amend section 9 of an act touching the

          requires the guardian to show an itemized statement or report of their ward's
          estates; to show to whom money is loaned, and upon what security. It is intended to save
          wards' estates, and save guardians' bondsmen. If this bill passes no
          guardian can convert wards'estate to his own benefit without the sureties knowing
          it, and the court will be better enabled to protect the ward. The bill then passed the

              <opener>
                <salute>Hon. C. R. Faulkner, chairman special committee House of
                  Representatives:</salute>
              </opener>
              <p>Sir--Last night I read the report of your committee. As you are aware, I have been
                unable to meet with the committee on account of the sickness of my wife and two
                little daughters. So far as your report shows small discrepancies to exist in
                certain counties, I hope to be able to explain them when I can personally examine
                the accounts, but your report, so far as it relates to me, seems devoted mainly to
                certain fees retained by my asssistants and myself. On that subject the law being
                loosely and awkwardly drawn, I took the opinion in writing or one of the best
                lawyers in the State--then governor--and 1 think such fees were retained in
                accordance with it. I desire that the courts may decide the question. If they hold I
                am liable for what was retained by assistants and myself it would probably amount to
                more than my bond. My situation for paying is just this: I have mortgaged all I have
                to my surety, hardly sufficient to idemnify. I have nothing else, haying come back
                here poorer by about $4,000 than when I went to Indianapolis four years ago. I then
                left a law practice worth over $5,000 a year, and so far since my return have had an
                equally good business, probably better. If the courts decide I owe anything I am
                willing to devote the balance of my life to work to pay it off, to show that I did
                not wish to steal anything from the State. It may be proper for me to add that while
                you will see I could have done so to large amounts, I actually had to borrow money
                to pay in part the freight on my household furniture to get back here. Do not
                understand me as finding fault with the committee, only I beg respectfully to
                dissent from its views of the law upon the subject of the fees of the assistants and
                myself. Please submit this to the House.</p>

        <p>The report of the<orgName> conference committee</orgName> on the fee and salary bill [H.
          R. 344] was concurred in. It makes a general reduction of from 15 to 25 per cent. </p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN of Putnam desired to express his disapproval of the reduction of
          jurors' fees, while the salaries of judges remain as they were, viz:, $2,500 per
          year. He did not approve of the reduction. It was the laboring and business men of the
          county who were summoned to appear and act as jurors, and the amount allowed in this
          report ($1.50 per day) will not more than pay their board while attending court.</p>

            school revenue, for the payment of indebtedness created for school building purposes,

          <p> Mr. VAWTER called up Mr. Stevens' bill [H. R. 160] to amend section 27 of an
            act regulating descents, which was read the third time. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>Mr. STEVENS, explaining, said this bill amends section 27 so as to entitle the widow of
            a deceased husband one-third of his personal property after the payment of his debts. As
            the law now stands the husband may take advantage of his widow. He may have left 850,000
            in personal property, and if by will his property has been secured to other parties the
            widow can hold but $500. This is unjust. When we deprive the good wives of our State of
            all participation in the making of our laws, by which the rights of property is
            determined, we should be just and generous. He hoped the bill would pass. </p>

            certain practice in the various courts, including mayor's courts, etc. It
            provides that where a trial is had before any mayor or justices of the peace for the

          <p>Mr. WORKS called up the bill [S. 432] to amend section 10 of an act to establish a
            House of Refuge, etc., which was read the third time--infants admitted between the ages
            of 7 and 18 years--and finally passed the House by yeas 79, nays 0.</p>
          <p> The SPEAKER, being at the foot of the roll call, at the request of Mr. English, called
            up the bill [H. R. 698] authorizing the Common Council and Board of Aldermen in all
            cities having a voting population of 16,000 or more, to ordain and enforce ordinances to
            provide for the regulating and licensing of certain trades, occupations, etc, which was
            read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD said he was against a law that would tax a real estate agent and not tax or
            license a doctor or a lawyer. He regarded <pb n="79" xml:id="VAA8558-17-329"/> the bill
            as establishing a monopoly from one end of it to the other. It is dangerous, and ought
            not to pass.</p>

          <p> Mr. SHANKS called up his bill [H. R. 389] that the wife, widow and minor child shall
            be entitled in the order named to the same rights of exemption of personal and real
            property, owned by the late husband or father, as the case may be, living, or if dead,
            having at the time of his decease been a resident householder, from sale or execution or
            other final process from a court, based upon or growing out of the tort or torts of the
            husband, late husband or father, that is, at the time such exemption is demanded,
            allowed by law to the debtor under legal proceeding, for the collections of any
            liability growing out of or founded upon a contract: expressed or implied, which was
            read the third time and passed the House by--yeas 65, nays 8.</p>
          <p> Mr. BRYANT called up his bill [H. R. 624] to amend sections 103 and 101 of an act to
            provide for a general system of common schools, etc., which was read the third time. </p>
          <p>On the motion of Mr. WORKS the bill was laid on the table. </p>
          <p>Mr. JOHNSON introduced a bill, [H. R. 701] regulating the salaries of judges and
            members of the General Assembly, which was read the first time and passed to the second
            reading.</p>
          <p> The bill, [S. 12] concerning the trial of civil causes in the circuit and superior
            courts, was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD opposed the passage of the bill from the fact that he had experience in the
            Kentucky courts where such a law was In force, and knew its defects. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS thought this was a good bill, and as the administration of justice in
            Kentucky did not cost more than one-third of what it does in other States, he thought
            their example might be followed in this, at least. </p>
          <p>Mr. Herod was also inclined to indorse this bill, and hoped the House would pass it. </p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH was of the opinion that thia bill should pass, as it was a great
            improvement, and it would save much time, expense and wind.</p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH thought it would compel the lawyers to argue the case twice or three times
            over, when once ought to be enough. He would vote against the bill. </p>

        <p> Mr. WINTERBOTHAM, from the <orgName>committee on finance</orgName>, reported a
          concurrent resolution for pay to Marion county of $1,118 for coal, gas, water, etc., used
          by the House and Senate during the regular and special session. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL regarded this claim as unjust and improper. </p>
        <p>Mr. WOOD was surprised to see this bill brought in at this time of the session. He
          thought the sum too great. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON was willing to trust the justness and fairness of the people of the State in
          this matter. The Legislature has had the use of these rooms, consumed the gas, water and
          coal, and it is only right that the people at large should pay for it. </p>
        <p>Mr. LANGDON did not think the opponents of this resolution knew what they were talking
          about. All the county of Marion offered the State was two rooms. It is as little as the
          State can do to pay for the gas, coal and water, as she would have to do if she occupied
          her own building. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM said there was no reason in asking Marion county to furnish coal, gas
          and water for the Legislature without cost to the State. </p>

        <p>Under the operations of the previous question, demanded by Mr. TRUSLER, the resolution
          was adopted by yeas 36, nays 8. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK asked leave to change his vote from. "no" to
          "aye," on the adoption of the report of the conference committee
          yesterday on the fee and salary bill. </p>
        <p>Objection being made--</p>
        <p>Mr. KENT moved that the Senator have leave to change his vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER said if leave be granted the senator, he also would change his vote from
          "aye" to "no." </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The yeas and nays on the motion for leave to change the vote, were demanded by Messrs,
          TRAYLOR and SHAFFER, and being ordered they were taken. [The tallies showed yeas 32, nays
          10.] </p>
        <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
        <p>Mr. SHIRK in explanation, when his name was called said, the Senate was required to vote
          upon the report of the conference committee on the fee and salary bill without members
          knowing what was in it. At the time, he desired the report should be laid on the table
          that opportunity might be afforded to examine it. Since then he was more favorably
          disposed toward it, and while it does nec suit him in many particulars, still he desired
          to change his vote from "no" to "aye." </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said, he came up here
          very desirous to help enact a fee and salary bill. This bill reported by the conference
          committee was thrust upon the Senate without giving an opportunity to investigate its
          provisions, but as far as he can learn if there had been an opportunity to investigate it,
          he should have voted as he did vote against it believing it will not meet the expectations
          of the people.</p>
        <p> When the roll-call was completed--</p>
        <p>The LIEUTEANT GOVEROR ruled, inasmuch as objection was made to the proposed change in the
          vote cast yesterday by the senator from Henry, [Mr. Shirk] he can not have it altered upon
          the record. </p>
        <p>Mr. LEEPER, rising to a personal explanation, said he voted on yesterday in favor of
          concurring in the report of the joint conference committee on the fee and salary bill
          under a misapprehension of its character. He asked for unanimous consent to change his
          vote from "aye" to "no," because he now understands
          the bill as adopted by the committee of conference and concurred in by the Senate
          increases the fees of officers in the larger counties, while it diminishes them in the
          smaller counties, which is just the very thing he did not want to do. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR and others objected.</p>
        <p> On motion by Mr. MENZIES the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on the
          third reading, Mr. REEVES making an ineffectual motion to substitute Senate bills on
          second reading.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 467] to amend section 18 of the act regulating descents and the
          apportionment of estates was read the third time.</p>
        <pb n="81" xml:id="VAA8558-17-331"/>
        <p> Mr. MENZIES explained this bill as he did yesterday.</p>
        <p> Mr. TRAYLOR believed this bill would provoke litigation between brothers and sisters. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE suggested if widows would make conveyance of the realty before a subsequent
          marriage there would be no need for the bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS regarded this as a wholesome measure, and believed it ought to prevail. </p>
        <p>Mr. OLDS thought it would but tend to make confusion, and ought not to pass. </p>

        <!--P.81 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
        <p>The bill was passed by ayes 30, nays 9.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 549] to amend section 5 of an act to provide for the more speedy trial
          of causes, with reference to the compensation of called judges, was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE pointed out objections to the bill. He could not conceive of any possible state
          of facts that would render such a bill necessary. </p>
        <p>Mr. BURRELL said the object of the bill was to deduct the per diem of a special judge
          from the salary of the regular judge. While not satisfied with the bill in some
          particulars, he favored it as being the best that could be passed this session.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 608] for the relief of Aaron Coombs and others, security on the bond of a
          defaulting township trustee in Center township, Greene county, was read the third time and
          passed by yeas 28, nays 11. </p>
        <p>Mr. HEFRON, explaining: The tax payers of the township are asking that the bill be
          passed.</p>

        <p>The bill [H. R. 589] to authorize a township trustee of Union township, Union county, to
          pay certain indebtedness incurred by a former trustee, was read the third time and passed,
          by yeas 35, nays 3. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRUSLER explaining its provisions and urging its passage in a short speech.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 310] to allow sheriffs and constables to follow defendants with a State
          warrant into an adjoining county and make arrest was read the third time and passed, by
          yeas 37, nays 0.</p>
        <p> The bill [H. R. 560] for the relief of John J. Justice and others, securities on the
          bond of a defaulting trustee of Madison county, being read the third time--</p>
        <p> Mr. SMITH explained the bill. The money was deposited in a bank which failed, though
          previous to depositing it the trustee had tried to loan it. It belonged to the township,
          and almost every tax payer in that township has petitioned this Legislature for relief in
          the matter, and he hoped the bill would pass. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>The bill finally passed by yeas 31, nays 6. </p>
        <p>Mr. TRAYLOR, when his name was called, addressing the chair as "your
          honor," and senators as 'gentlemen of the jury," voted
          "no," with the suggestion that if every senator represented a defaulting
          trustee who should be relieved in this way, what would become of the State of Indiana? </p>
        <p>The bill [H. R. 115] to amend section 1 of an act for the protection of the Sabbath--so
          as to allow barbers to shave customers on the Lord's day--being read a third
          time--</p>
        <p>Mr. SHAFFER opposed the bill, not believing there should be special legislation in favor
          of barbers as a class, any more than for any other particular business. </p>
        <p>Mr. FOWLER could see no impropriety in passing the bill. It will not interfere with the
          Sabbath, or any one desiring to attend public worship. It is almost an absolute necessity
          that the bill should pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. KAHLO hoped the bill would not pass.</p>
        <p> Mr. SHIRK also hoped the bill would not pass. There is no more reason why a barber
          should pursue his usual avocation on Sunday than any other class. It would be granting a
          special privilege that is denied to others.</p>
        <p> Mr. FOSTER favored the bill. Under the present law a great many barber shops keep open.
          Those able to pay fines keep open, while the poorer barbers do not.</p>
        <p> Mr. REEVE made a humorous speech in support of the bill.</p>
        <p> Mr. KRAMER thought this bill ought to pass. The principal result of the present law is
          to bring about malicious prosecutions. For this and other reasons it should be amended. </p>
        <p>Mr. WINTERBOTHAM was born in the old State of Connecticut, where they once had the blue
          laws. Yet in that State they have never got close enough to prevent a barber shop from
          being open on Sunday. </p>
        <p>Mr. VIEHE thought this bill ought to pass. </p>
        <p>Mr. WIER saw no more impropriety in allowing barber shops to be kept open than allowing
          livery stable owners to keep their stock running on Sunday. </p>

          or void--purchaser to have only 10 per cent. damages and legal interest--which was read
          the first time. He moved for a dispensation of the constitutional provision, that the bill

            amount of exemption $600 instead of $1,00O, as in the original bill. The report was

          <p>Mr. REEVE, from the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>, returned the bill
            introduced this morning [S. 460] relating to tax sales where the same is illegal or
            void, and on his motion the constitutional rule was dispensed with and the bill was
            passed through the several readings, but was lost on the final vote--yeas 19, nays 21. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. MOORE, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of House bills on the

          <p>The bill [H. R. 158] in relation to settlements made between county commissioners and
            county, township or school officers, was read the third time, and, under the operations

          <p>The bill [H. R. 477] defining burglary, burglarious trespass and house breaking was
            read the third tune, </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE explained: This bill is substantially as it came from the House, although a
            substitute therefor, House breaking in the night time is declared to be burglary; in the
            day time burglarious trespass.</p>

          <p> The bill [H. R. 290] to amend section one of the act concerning the running at large
            of animals in townships, was read the third time. </p>
          <p>Mr. DICE thought this bill would be impracticable ia its operations, as it admits of
            stock on one side of a railroad running at large and will not admit of that, on the
            other side of the track. </p>
          <p>Mr. BURRELL regarded this as drawing it down pretty line. If there is a stream cutting
            off one corner of a township it, would allow those on one side to enjoy certain rights,
            those on the other side may not. </p>
          <p>Mr. WOOD explained: The county commissioners, under this bill, may grant privileges to
            a part of a township, divided by a railroad or a river--it simply extends the power of
            county commissioners to regulate the running at large of stock in a part of a township,
            instead of in a whole township, as now. </p>

            attorney's fees in notes, etc., which motion was laid on the table by yeas 28,
            nays 9. </p>

          <p> The bill [S. 91--Mr. Moore's] to amend section 456 of the general practice
            act, the plaintiff as often as he direct may have a reappraisement at any time before
            the return of execution, was read the second time, and under a dispensation of the
            constitutional restriction the third time, and passed by--yeas 28, nays 9. </p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>The bill [S. 147--Mr. Grubbs'] to amend sec. 3 of the act to provide for the
            inspection of petroleum oil for illuminating purposes, was read the second time, and
            under a dispensation the third time, and passed by yeas 41, nays 1. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE moved again to take up the bill H. R. 58, but the presiding officer [Mr.
            Kent in the chair] decided the motion out of order, it having been laid on the table but
            a few minutes ago. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT introduced a bill [S. 461] to amend sec. 1 of the act touching foreign
            corporations, restricting their bringing suits against citizens of Indiana, which was
            read the first time.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <p>On motion by Mr. DICE, the bill was rejected--yeas 29, nays 11. </p>
          <p>Mr. MENZIES moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and lay that motion on the
            table.</p>
          <p> The latter motion was agreed to. </p>
          <p>The bill [S. 262--Mr. Wilson's] to amend sec. 2 of the act in relation to
            county auditors--concerning their bond--was read the second time. </p>
          <p>Mr. WILSON urged the necessity of the immediate passage of this bill. The present bond
            required of county auditors is insufficient. He moved for a dispensation of the
            constitutional restriction that the bill may be pressed to its final passage now. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR also thought this a measure that ought to be pressed, as the bond of $2,000
            is uniform in the largest as well as in the smallest county of the State. </p>
          <p>Mr. KRAMER could see no necessity for requiring a heavy bond of the county
            auditor--there should be no bond higher than $15,000. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE explained the bond under this bill should be only equal to the largest amount
            of money in the hands of the treasurer at one time. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT favored the passage of the bill.</p>

        <p>The bill [S. 71] authorizing justices of the peace to require additional replevin bail in
          cases where insufficient bail has been taken, etc., was read the third time. </p>
        <p>Mr. WATSON was opposed to the passage of this bill. Where the defendant is not in fault
          it places upon him additional cost. It is the duty of the justice to see that the bail is
          good, and by failing to do so he involves the defendant in additional expense and
          litigation. The remedy would be to issue the execution upon the affidavit of the
          plaintiff. </p>
        <p>Mr. BRIGGS was in favor of the bill. It would have a tendency to compel the defendant to
          procure bail that was sufficient. </p>
        <p>Mr. MARCH paid the defendant was the man responsible for the bail, and it was the
          intention of this bill to hold him responsible during the stay that he gets. </p>

          <p>The Senate amendments to the bill [H. R. 158] in relation to settlements made by boards
            of county commissioners with county, township and school officers, being read-- </p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS insisted that if this bill is passed, it would open the door for endless
            litigation. It should be a general law, and not an act intended to apply to but one or
            two cases, and he objected to it because it would allow either party to open
            investigation by suit of the other. </p>
          <p>Mr. MARCH said if there were no defaulting county officers in the State this bill would
            not hurt any one. No man in Indianapolis had spoken to him with reference to it before
            it had been introduced. It was introduced to prevent fraud, and not in any particular
            local interest. </p>
          <p>Mr. THAYER thought this bill was gotten up to fit some particular case. As a business
            principle he believed that when a settlement had been made it should stand unless fraud
            could be proven. As he understood it he was opposed to it. </p>
          <p>Mr. WORKS thought this was a bill in which, the whole Stats was interested, and he
            wanted this law to apply to his county. If a man had defrauded his county that man ought
            to be made to pay back the money so fraudulently taken. He thought it was competent to
            pass a bill by which the county could receive back any money fraudulently taken from it. </p>
          <p>Mr. HEROD thought that this Senate amendment was put in to fit a certain case in which
            certain parties desire to cover up fraud. </p>
          <p>Mr. TAYLOR of Daviess,could not see any good and valid reason to oppose this bill. He
            did not caro whether Democrats or Republicans were angeled, he wanted all to disgorge
            Who had fraudulently taken the public funds. </p>

                  1875. [Acts Reg. Sess. 1875, p. 5.) </p>
                <p>To the Hon. H. S. Cauthorn, Speaper of the House of Representatives:</p>
                <p> The undersigned, Exum Saint, Charles S. Hubbard and J. H. Thornburg, on the part
                  of the House committee to Investigate the charges again Patrick H. Jameson,
                  president of the board of benevolent institutions, and against Dr. Everts,
                  superintendent of the Hospital for the Insane, beg leave to submit the following
                  report:</p>
                <p> First--As to the matters and specifications set forth in charge first, above set
                  out, we say that the testimony does not show any illegal expenditure of money by
                  Dr. Jameson, received for work and labor and products and earnings of the
                  Institute for the Blind, or of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, but as far as
                  said charge relates to the Hospital for the Insane, and affects Drs. Everts and
                  Jameson in connection therewith, we are of the opinion that, although their manner
                  of accounting for money received, and for work and labor performed, and for the
                  products and earnings of the farm connected with said hospital, is much the same
                  as that of previous managements; and, although the testimony does not show that
                  any of the money or proceeds derived from the sources above mentioned have been
                  misappropriated or misapplied, yet the books and accounts of this institution are
                  kept in such a manner that said funds are not kept separate and distinct, so as to
                  show the amount received from the various sources, and how and in what manner
                  accounted for, as they should be. We think there should be a full and strict
                  account kept of each fund, that the books should show in detail the amount
                  received from the earnings of the hospital, from labor, from the different farm
                  product", etc., and show how, when and by whom expended. </p>
                <p>Charge two against Dr. Jameson (not affecting Dr. Everts)--that he received
                  additional pay as a member of the provisional board, etc.</p>
                <p> As to the second clurrg0 against Dr. Jameson, and not affecting Dr. Everts,
                  which is that said Jameson received a large sum of money for pay as a member of
                  the provisional board contrary to law, we say that said charge is not sustained by
                  the evidence.</p>
                <p> The testimony shows that Dr. Jameson received $40O per year as treasurer of the
                  provisional board for his services in drawing and paying out the sum of $225,000
                  in the construction of the new Hospital for the Insane. While the law does not
                  specifically authorize said board to appoint a treasurer for the disbursement of
                  so large a fund, yet it does provide for the salary of certain other officers and
                  agents, provided the board see proper to appoint them, and it nowhere prohibits
                  the appointment of a treasurer or limits the board in providing the necessary
                  means for carrying out the purpose for winch the board was created. If the board,
                  which is an entire different body from the board of commissioners of Insane
                  Asylum, although composed in part of the same men, deemed the magnitude of the
                  work sufficient to justify the creation of the office of treasurer at a salary of
                  $400 per annum, and had confidence in one of their number for that place, we do
                  not feel justified in censuring them for their action when there is no law
                  forbidding the exercise of such power on their part. It will be further remembered
                  that the board was comprised of such men as Governors Williams, Hendricks,
                  Jameson, etc., who, with the exception of one member, served without pay.</p>
                <p> We will say, however, that in view of the fact that the law only authorized the
                  payment of S300 to the secretary of the board, that amount might more properly
                  have been taken as the compensation for the treasurer. And as a further reason for
                  our opinion in this case we mention that the testimony does not bring out any
                  fraud or intention to defraud the State. </p>
                <p>Charge three against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge two against Dr. Everts
                  employment of relatives, charged to be in violation of the act of February
                  25,1875. (Acts Reg. Sess., '75, p. 108.) </p>
                <p>As to the specifications in this charge, we say that, as far as they relate to
                  the employment of Miss Churchman, Miss Maclntire and Mrs. Everts, they are
                  sustained by the evidence, and, while there is a difference of opin-[ion] <pb n="85" xml:id="VAA8558-17-335"/>[opin]-ion among legal gentlemen as to the
                  legality of such employment, and though there is no evidence (or, if any, very
                  slight) that the State was in any way the loser thereby, yet we are of the opinion
                  that it was contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the law, and that the
                  custom is greatly against public policy and the interest or the public service.
                  However, Attorneys General Buskirk and Woollen hold that such employment is legal. </p>
                <p>As to the employment of young Everts, Thomas and another person, relatives of
                  some of the members of the board, in the painting and construction of the new
                  Asylum for women, we fail to find any law forbidding it in letter or spirit, and
                  are sustained in this opinion by eminent legal authority.</p>
                <p> And there was not sufficient evidence to convince us that the State was in any
                  way the loser thereby.</p>
                <p> Charge four against Dr. Jameson [not affecting Dr. Everts]--that he has received
                  as president of the boards of benevolent institutions salary in excess of the $500
                  provided by the act of March 12, 1875. </p>
                <p>This charge is made against Dr. Jameson only, and the act he is charged with
                  violating is superseded, or in effect repealed, by the act of the special session
                  of the Legislature of 1877, page 6, section 11, which provides that the president
                  of the benevolent institutions shall receive the sum of $300 per annum for each of
                  the three institutions under his control, and the testimony does not show more
                  than that amount of salary paid to him during any one year for services as
                  president of said board. Therefore we think the charge is not sustained. </p>
                <p>Charge five against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to Charge three against Dr.
                  Everts--employment of extravagant and useless labor.</p>
                <p> This charge against said Jameson, corresponding to the third charge against Dr.
                  Everts, is sustained as to both or as to either of them, only in this, viz: the un
                  contradicted testimony of one or two witnesses that Miss _____ was employed and
                  occupied solely in sewing and fancy work for the family of said Dr. Everts for the
                  space of years, at the expense of the State. This being admitted by the failure of
                  the defense to offer any evidence contradicting it, we must, say that we do not
                  think the obligation of the State to support the superintendent and his family can
                  be extended to the employment of a seamstress or servants in a private capacity,
                  and that the payment for such services by the State was unlawful. </p>
                <p>Charge six against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge one against Dr.
                  Everts--accepting gifts from tradesmen furnishing goods, etc., to the asylums,
                  whereby they were influenced and rendered partial.</p>
                <p> This charge against Dr. Jameson corresponds to the first charge against Dr.
                  Everts, and, in our opinion, is unsustained by the testimony.</p>
                <p> There was some testimony, and we believe not denied, that three cans of fruit
                  were presented to Dr. Jameson by a tradesman of whom he made part of his
                  purchases. It was also shown that a box of tea at one time, two or three dozen
                  oranges and some other small items had been given and sent to Mrs. and Dr. Everts
                  in trifling quantities and at divers times by parties who were furnishing supplies
                  to the Asylum; also, a box of cigars when the legislative committee were visiting
                  there on one or two occasions; but neither the amount or value of these presents,
                  nor the manner of the transaction, nor even the testimony itself, show anything
                  illegal or improper either in the giving or accepting. </p>
                <p>Charge seven against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge four against Dr.
                  Everts-- purchases at exhorbitant prices.</p>
                <p> As to this charge against said Jameson, which corresponds to the fourth change
                  against Dr. Everts, we say that the evidence does not sustain the charge, but
                  that, on the other hand, the preponderance of testimony was to the effect that
                  said Jameson was a cautious and discreet buyer, generally purchasing where lie
                  could get, the best bargain; and not paying for goods or supplies any more than
                  the market price. </p>
                <p>The charge, however, in relation to Dr. Everts was sustained in particular
                  instances, but not in general; it should be stated, however, that they were so
                  sustained upon the uncontradicted testimony of the prosecution. Whether the
                  defendant was unable to disprove them, or neglected to do so, is not for us to
                  say. It was shown that he purchased a large bill of clothing from Heitkam
                  &amp; Co. at their own prices, and without making any personal examination of
                  said goods at the time they were purchased. It was further shown that he had often
                  purchased large bills of goods of the same firm, but it did not appear but what
                  lie had exercised reasonable care in their selection, except on the occasion
                  referred to.</p>
                <p> While the evidence was not specific as to any other particular instances of want
                  of care on the part of said Everts in the purchase of goods or supplies, yet we
                  are of the opinion that there was an occasional lack of skill and watchfulness in
                  the last year or two in the pus chase of goods and supplies.</p>
                <p> Charge eight against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to same number against Dr.
                  Everts making certificate of insanity before a board of inquest, and reccing into
                  the Asylum a sane person (Gordon Grimth), to prevent criminal prosecution, etc. </p>
                <p>In the matter of the inquest set forth in this charge we would simply say that
                  innocence is presume until the contrary is proven; that where no self-interest or
                  other impelling motive is shown, the evidence,to convict a man ' of even
                  fair or average standing in society, of certifying to the insanity of a sane man,
                  ought to be susceptible of no explanation, and reconcilable with no theory but
                  that cf his guilt. Such was not the testimony. There was not even a preponderance,
                  if we judge evidence by its value, against the accused or against Dr. Everts. </p>
                <p>Charge nine against Dr. Jameson, not affecting Dr. Evarts--that Dr. Jameson,
                  while ex- officio member of the provisional board for building the new Asylum for
                  Insane Women drew sums of money aggregating $225,000 ($300,000), and placed it on
                  deposit to his own credit, and received interest thereon which he applied to his
                  private use, and refuses to account therefor. </p>
                <p>This charge affects only Dr. Jameson, and we are of the opinion that if said
                  money, appropriated for the construction of the new female department of the
                  Asylum,had remained in the treasury and been drawn out by the provisional board or
                  its agent as became necessary to pay contractors, employes, materialmen, etc , no
                  interest would have been realized. It is in evidence that said money was drawn
                  out, in manner and amounts as set forth in said charge, by said Jameson as
                  treasurer of said board upon the order of said board, and deposited in certain
                  banks of this city on interest; and that said interest amounted to $1,819, out of
                  which the compensation of said treasurer was paid, and a balance of $419 placed to
                  the credit of said fund, which last amount the State would not have received had
                  said appropriation remained in the treasury and drawn out as needed. </p>
                <p>While we may not in words justify this action, yet in view of the fad t hat the
                  State is not shown to be the loser thereby, and the matter was approved by a board
                  of men of <pb n="86" xml:id="VAA8558-17-336"/> such high character of both
                  political parties, we can not censure the accused, and until we can be shown what
                  particular law has been violated, we can not say that the charge is sustained. </p>
                <p>As to the legality of said Jameson receiving the salary of treasurer of said
                  board,and which was deducted from said interest, we have given our opinion under
                  charge.</p>
                <p> Charge 10 against Dr. Jameson (corresponding to charge seven against Dr.
                  Everts)publishing false statements and statistics for the purpose of deceiving,
                  etc.</p>
                <p> About all the testimony adduced on this subject or charge was the report
                  submitted to the regular session of the General Assembly for the expenditures of
                  the Blind Asylum for the year 1878, which showed that the cost of subsistence per
                  capita, for each mouth in the year, estimating upon the basis of 50 weeks in the
                  year, was $6.27, while the evidence showed that the pupils were kept in said
                  institution but 40 weeks in the year. The only effect of this record is to mislead
                  as to the actual cost per month for subsisting each pupil in said institution,
                  there being no evidence to show that any of the money for the support of said
                  Blind Asylum had been unaccounted for or misappropriated. We are of the opinion
                  that the proper plan would be for said reports to disclose the actual cost of
                  subsisting each inmate for the actual time he or she may have been provided for in
                  said institution. There being no further evidence as to false or improper entries,
                  or showing in said reports, we dismiss this charge with the finding and
                  recommendation above made. </p>
                <p>Charge 11 against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge five against Dr. Everts--
                  permitting incurable patients to remain in the Insane Asylum, receiving money on
                  account of such incurables, and discharging curable patients as incurable. </p>
                <p>As to this charge, we do not find from the evidence that incurable patients have
                  been permitted to remain in said Hospital to the exclusion or detriment of curable
                  patients. There is evidence, however, of donations to the Asylum by the relatives
                  of inmates therein, but the defendants claim, that they have accounted for all
                  such money, and their reports show that money has often been so received and how
                  the same was expended. As to further findings on this subject, see that part of
                  our report under charge No. 2 of this report. </p>
                <p>There was testimony, un contradicted by the defense, that one Gavin paid the
                  superintendent, Dr. Everts, the sum of $300, whereas his report of the donations
                  to the Hospital shows only $200 paid by said Gavin; and there was the further
                  testimony that one Goodwin (we believe that was she name) had donated the sum of
                  ------, whereas the evidence of accused and the report of said Everts show the
                  payment of $75 or $100 less than that amount.</p>
                <p> As a portion of said payments were made, or at least one of them, only last
                  fall, it may be that a future report may account for the difference, but your
                  committee have reported the facts as they found them.</p>
                <p> Charge 12 against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge nine against Dr.
                  Everts--keeping boobs in a loose and uncertain manner.</p>
                <p> As to that part of this charge which relates to the keeping and manner of
                  keeping the books of the Asylum in such a way as is calculated to deceive the
                  public or mislead them, we affirm that the charge is not sustained by the
                  evidence. And as to whether they have been kept in a business-like manner as they
                  should be, or not, we refer to the opinion expressed under charge first against
                  Dr. Jameson, corresponding to sixth against Dr. Everts. </p>
                <p>We will say here that we have made no personal examination of the books, and our
                  opinion is based upon the testimony, on admission of accused, and a casual
                  reference to said books, or a portion of them, and the expert testimony. We can
                  not say further, unless time and opportunity had been accorded the accused to
                  bring in their entire books and accounts and explain them, which was denied
                  because time was too short.</p>
                <p> Charge thirteen against Dr. Jameson, (not affecting Dr. Everts)--suffering and
                  approving purchases for the Blind Asylum from Churchman, its superintendent </p>
                <p>As to this charge, which only affects Mr. Jameson, we have to say that. there
                  only ap-. pears to have been two or three small bills purchased of said Churchman,
                  and the practice thou discontinued. It does not appear that the State lost
                  anything by these transactions. We certainly should condemn such purchases were
                  they in vogue, or had been to any considerable extent.</p>
                <p>Charge 14 against Dr. Jameson, corresponding to charge 10 against Dr.
                  Everts--general charge of irregularities and abuses.</p>
                <p> Under this general charge there was no evidence adduced, in fact, no attempt on
                  the part of the prosecution to connect either Drs. Jameson or Everts personally
                  and directly with any of the charges preferred but only as they were accountable
                  for neglect of duty and bad conduct of subordinate officers and attendants. </p>
                <p>The point upon which the prosecution mainly relies in support of this charge is
                  the alleged neglect of duty, malpractice or professional ignorance of Dr. Hester,
                  an assistant physician, in the treat me 111 of one Mrs. Williams who died at the
                  hospital; in this, that the said Hester either ignorantly or purposely made an
                  improper and false diagnosis of the malady of this patient, and treated her for
                  troubles arising from uterine disorders, when in fact she was suffering from
                  nervous prostration, debility, etc., incident to pregnancy, and prescribed for her
                  accordingly,which said treatment,together with certain unusual hardships imposed
                  upon her by the order of said Hester, notably pushing the rubber, brought about a
                  miscarriage, from the effects of which, and inattention when in labor, she died.
                  From certain testimony, introduced by both parties, it was shown that this patient
                  had, on her first commitment to the hospital, been treated by Hester for 10
                  months; that she was of a stupid, listless and unobservant disposition, and would
                  remain standing against the wall or in a sitting posture, entirely unconcered and
                  indifferent as to what was taking place around her, for an indefinite space of
                  time, unless compelled by the attendants to change her position. That she
                  simulated the usual symptoms of pregnancy, even to the swollen condition or
                  appearance of the parts; was greatly constipated, unless something was constantly
                  given to prevent it, and had no appetite for food. It was further shown that under
                  pretense of trying to improve her by change of scene and surroundings, and
                  frequent enjoyment of fresh air and sunlight, her husband obtained leave to take
                  her into the city to live, and it is shown that she was returned to the hospital,
                  after about two weeks, with but little apparent improvement, and it is further
                  shown by the landlady, who furnished them a room during her said stay in the city,
                  that she and her husband occupied the same bed. Here the testimony diverges; the
                  witnesses for the prosecution claiming that upon her return she was subjected to
                  unusual hardship; that the attendants were n required by Dr. Hester to keep her
                  constantly ai some exercise, principally pushing the "rubber"
                  that is <pb n="87" xml:id="VAA8558-17-337"/> used to polish the oiled floor of the
                  ward; that this work was by tar too heavy for her; that her treatment, i. e., her
                  medicine, was such as to aggravate the troubles incident to pregnancy, which
                  condition of the patient was apparent to them a few weeks after her recommitment;
                  that about seven months after she came back she was unexpectedly discovered to be
                  far advanced in travail, and nearly exhausted with her unassisted labors; that the
                  accused was notified, but failed to respond until called the second time; that
                  after the accouchement she was so unskillfully treated as to greatly increase the
                  perils of her situation, which contued to grow worse until death relieved her. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, the accused himself testifies, and he is corroborated by the
                  evidence of one or two others in many respects, that when Mrs. Williams returned
                  to the hospital, and, for that matter, when she left with her husband, her mental
                  and physical condition was such as to preclude all suspicion or thought of any man
                  having sexual intercourse with her; that her symptoms and apparent condition were
                  almost the same as before she left (and in this he is corroborated by Dr. Parvin);
                  that, having failed to make much improvement by his former treatment, he abandoned
                  it in a great measure, using occasionally a tonic and some preparations to produce
                  a laxity of the bowels; and, for the purpose of diverting her attention, and
                  preventing her proneness to listlessness and stupidity, he directed the attendants
                  to keep her reasonably occupied with the rubber or other devices. He avers that,
                  under the circumstances, he never suspected pregnancy, neither did either of the
                  attendants, who are the main witnesses against him (the two who were in charge of
                  said patient) ever communicate their suspicions to him, and it was their duty, no
                  says, to inform him of any change that may or ought to take place. He denies that
                  he was called more than once, and that he then responded as promptly as he could,
                  and 'within three minutes of being so notified, and in this he is
                  corroborated by at least one other witness. He further says in relation to the
                  unexpected confinement of said patient, that if said attendants had been attending
                  to their duty, he would have been called at a much earlier stage of this trouble.
                  He further says that he did all in his power to alleviate the condition of said
                  patient, and prescribe just such treatment after the bringing forth of said
                  foetus, as the symptoms of said patient seemed to demand. And he avers that he
                  left nothing undone that his experience and the usual practice in such cases
                  suggested should be done to insure her recovery, if the same was possible. He
                  further testifies, and a this he is borne out by the evidence of Dr. Everts and
                  others that there was no attempt at concealment of this transaction either on his
                  part or that of the officers and attendants of said institution, further than was
                  customary to prevent the inmates from learning that anything unusual had taken
                  place, and that much is necessary on account of their natural and proverbial
                  tendency to excitement and misconstruction of everything that they do not readily
                  understand, or that will afford them an opportunity to create a sensation.</p>
                <p> Now in this connection your committee would mention a few facts that may be of
                  value in determining the value of the testimony. They concede that while the
                  interest of Drs. Everts and Hester should be kept in view in deciding what weight
                  should be given to their evidence, yet in very many of the main points of their
                  testimony they were corroborated by a number or witnesses, mostly from the Insane
                  Hospital, who certainly know that the accused no longer have any power to retain
                  them in the employment they now have, as there has already been, or is about to
                  be, an entire change in the management of the institution, and the declaration by
                  some of them that they came voluntarily, without subpoena, to testify for the
                  accused, because they thought he was being unjustly assailed and the victim of
                  spite and revenge, ought rather to strengthen than weaken their testimony. While
                  on the other hand, there was not a material witness against Dr. Hester that did
                  not acknowledge there was a bad feeling on their part against him, which was very
                  evident, from their willingness to testify and their proneness to step aside and
                  give him a thrust that savored more of jealousy than a desire to do even-handed
                  justice. And one very significant fact of more than ordinary importance in this
                  connection, is that the very witnesses whose evidence is intended to sustain this
                  charge, both repeatedly swore that up to within the last 18 months, and during the
                  long years of his connection with said institution, Dr. Hester had been uniformly
                  kind, patient and attentive to the inmates under his charge, and, though strict in
                  the enforcement of discipline among the attendants, yet courteous and just to them
                  they could not recall an instance of bad treatment or lack of duty on his part
                  until the time before mentioned. </p>
                <p>Your committee feel at a loss just how to ex plain the fact that a man who, upon
                  the testimony of both sides, had been so entirely devoted to the interests of the
                  institution and the welfare of the inmates during a period that ante-dates in its
                  commencement even the beginning of Dr. Everts' term of office could
                  suddenly, and within the last 18 months, commence a system of cruelty to those
                  under his charge that has no equal in the annals of the most uncivilized and
                  barbarous tribes. Just how far this testimony of these female attendants can be
                  explained by the fact that Dr. Hester, who was very popular up to the time
                  referred to, introduced in the Hospital a lady to assist him in his arduous
                  duties, and for whom he yet retains a deserved partiality, we do not pretend to
                  say; but we do insist that the charges of criminal neglect and malpractice in
                  three or tour cases by Dr. Hester are so inconsistent with his former character
                  for years, as shown by the witnesses for the prosecution, that when taken in
                  connection with the testimony of Dr. Everts that he was the most attentive and
                  devoted officer in the discharge of duty that he ever knew, and well qualified for
                  his place, and the additional testimony of Dr. Jameson and others to the same
                  effect, that it would be violating all rules of evidence and establishing a
                  precedent whereby the character and reputation of almost every officer in charge
                  of a large number of inmates of any public institution might be irretrieveably
                  blasted were we to say that said charge was sustained by the evidence. We will
                  say, however, that the failure of the officers of the hospital to discover the
                  pregnancy of Mrs. Williams, notwithstanding the circumstances tending to mislead,
                  and the fact that the attendants were in a measure to blame, is, in our opinion, a
                  case of inexcusable neglect, and in that far affects, of course, the whole
                  management of the Institution. But we feel in duty bound to add that Dr. Hester,
                  for want of time, was denied any opportunity of offering evidence in his own
                  defense, which fact should go far in preventing an arbitrary judgment or verdict
                  against him. It will not do to say that he was protected because he was allowed to
                  testify, for when on the stand he was the witnesss of Dr Everts and exam-[ined]
                    <pb n="88" xml:id="VAA8558-17-338"/> [exam]-ined by counsel interested only in
                  the defense of said Everts, and allowed to answer only such questions as said
                  counsel asked, being himself without counsel. How far he or Dr. Everts are
                  excusable for not discovering the condition of Mrs. Williams on account of a rule
                  obtaining in almost all similar institutions prohibiting personal and critical
                  examination of females simulating pregnacy we do not pretend to say. It is said
                  that such a rule is in the interest of public policy, in this, that otherwise the
                  officers would sometimes be exposed to unjust criticism, their motives and conduct
                  very liable to be misconstrued by a class who are ever ready to seize upon the
                  most trifling circumstance to create a sensation, thereby imperiling the
                  reputation of the institution and endangering its efficiency; but we maintain with
                  the number of females now to be found who are skilled in medicine, and especially
                  familiar with the disorders of their sex, that a board might be created in every
                  asylum that could safely and with propriety investigate every case necessary to be
                  examined without detriment to the welfare of the institutions and its patrons, and
                  we would recommend something of that kind. </p>
                <p>There was some evidence as to the confinement during the whole of one day of a
                  feeble female patient in a bed room where there were two beds, and without fire in
                  the winter time. Dr. Hester had no chance to defend on this point, and there were
                  grave doubts from the testimony of the prosecution whether the officers, the
                  attendants, or the patient herself, was most to blame. We say that the charge is
                  unsustained on this point. The case of Mrs. Knapp, who suicided by hanging, is
                  adduced as another case of neglect on the part of Hester and Everts, but the
                  testimony does not sustain the charge. </p>
                <p>The only other case considered of sufficient importance upon which to condemn a
                  management of over 600 crazy people and 140 subordinates and attendants during a
                  period of 12 years, is the inexcusable tantalizing of a nervous and flighty
                  patient by the name of Mrs. Wheedon, which charge is also unsustained by the
                  evidence of prosecution alone.</p>
                <p> We close our report with the following general finding, supplemented by a few
                  observations suggested by the investigation:</p>
                <p> We are of the opinion that the discipline in the Insane Hospital for the last
                  year or 18 months has been generally bad. How far that may be attributed to the
                  prospect of a change of management to suit the political turn of affairs we can
                  not say, but that the addition of one or two persons to the care and supervision
                  of some of the female wards--which the management had a right to make, and did
                  make about a year and a half ago--proved to be a serious disturbing element, which
                  we think the management might have suppressed by a timely removal of the unruly
                  ones, as we think; but this not being done, the bad feeling extended until for
                  some time past there has been an unfortunate lack of harmony, respect for each
                  other and laxity of discipline that should not exist in an institution where a
                  common desire and unity of purpose and effort; is necessary to promote the
                  efficiency of the Institution and the welfare of an unfortunate class of our
                  fellow-citizens. </p>
                <p>It is our opinion, however, that the accused, Drs. Everts and Jameson, have ever
                  had sincerely at heart the welfare of this great and important public charity, and
                  that, in a general way, have zealously striven to promote its efficiency, increase
                  its usefulness, and make it the equal of any similar institution in the country.
                  That they may have failed in particular instances to do the best we do not deny,
                  but against that should be placed the magnitude of their responsibility, the
                  character of the people with which they have had to deal, and the long period
                  covered by their term of service--and we, perhaps, should refer to the fact that
                  for two or three years past, in addition to their ordinary duties, they have had
                  on their hands the construction of the new Asylum for Women, which must
                  necessarily have engrossed much of the time that could illy be spared from the
                  duties of the Asylum proper. We are of the opinion further, that with the most
                  sensitive and sympathetic natures long continued service in these positions and
                  long familiarity with physical and mental infirmities tends to breed indifference
                  and blunt the sensibilities in regard to the wants and requirements of that class
                  of people, and while we make no recommendation on that point, we submit whether or
                  not a change of management ought not occur every few years, and for fear we might
                  not all agree on that point we express no further opinion. </p>
                <p>We now submit this tedious report with the remark that the defendants or accused
                  should go acquit on any charge where they had not the opportunity to offer
                  testimony in defense, and we are sorry to say that time did not permit a full and
                  fair investigation on both sides, for each of them insist that they were cut off
                  without a full and fair opportunity to make their case. However, as to many of the
                  charges preferred, we think we have had sufficient evidence on which to base a
                  correct opinion. </p>

                <p>Your committee was appointed to investigate certain charges of irregularities
                  against Dr. P. H. Jameson, president of the board of benevolent institutions, and
                  Orpheus Everts, superintendent of the Hospital for the Insane. After as careful a
                  consideration of the subject, as could possibly be given in the limited time
                  allotted for that purpose, we find the evidence adduced on behalf of the parties
                  concerned shows the following state of facts, clearly and beyond any doubt or
                  question: </p>
                <p>We find charge first sustained against Patrick H. Jameson in this: that he, the
                  said Patrick H. Jameson, permitted and was directly instrumental in allowing money
                  to be used unlawfully and without warrant of law, and in violation of act of March
                  10,1875, namely: that moneys received for the farm products and the products of
                  the green-house were never turned into the treasury as the law directs, but
                  expended in such manner as the management of the Insane Asylum saw fit, in direct
                  contravention of all law on the subject,. without giving an itemized statement of
                  how such moneys were expended. We also find that this same charge against Orpheus
                  Everts has been sustained. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="section">
                <head rend="center">CHARGE SECOND.</head>
                <p> We further find that Patrick H. Jameson received extra salary as treasurer of
                  the provisional board of commissioners for the new building for the Insane
                  Hospital to the amount of $1,400, which, in the opinion of your committee, was
                  entirely without warrant of law, and we believe the proper steps should be taken
                  to cover the same back into the treasury. Such an office is unknown to the
                  law.</p>
                <p> The law of 1875 fixed said Patrick H. Jameson's salary, as president of
                  all the boards, at $500. The appropriation bill of 1877 (acts special session,
                  pages 5, 7) fixed it at $300 for each institution, or $900 in all; but we fail to
                  find any law where it authorizes the provisional <pb n="89" xml:id="VAA8558-17-339"/> board, or, in fact, any board, to create the office of
                  treasurer and pay him the sum of $400 extra per year for his services as treasurer
                  of said board. The plea is, however, set up that this $400 was derived from the
                  interest on the ($300,000 taken out of the treasury to build the new Hospital for
                  the Insane, but your committee is of the opinion that $900 was sufficient for the
                  services of said president, and that the $1,400 derived from such interest should
                  be covered back into the treasury of the State, where it properly and legally
                  belongs.</p>

                  yet the evidence was so conflicting we are unable to come to any definite

                  Dr. inverts and his family, and we can not justify such a practice, no matter in

                  &amp; Co., and although the goods were purchased in wholesale quantities, that
                  if a more careful system of purchasing had been followed, a better class of goods
                  could have been obtained at a much less rate, thereby saving considerable sums of
                  money to the State. We find that the clothing was bought by order, and left to the

                  such carelessness on the part of Dr. Everts, and neglect in not better protecting
                  the State's interest, should meet from this Assembly the censure it
                  justly deserves.</p>

                  had no means of knowing whether incurable patients were maintained in the hospital

                  impossible to find in what manner the institution funds, gathered from the various

                <p> That Dr. Jameson had goods purchased of W, H. Churchman, superintendent of the
                  Blind Asylum. We find that such goods were purchased to a small amount, but very
                  properly stopped by order of Dr. Jameson.</p>
                <p> We find in the general charge in relation to cruelty and neglect to the inmates
                  of the Insane Asylum, that as a general charge this has not been sustained: but we
                  find that in exceptional cases the charge has been more than sustained, notably in
                  the case of Mrs. Knapp who was neglected in her room until the hanged herself;
                  also a Mrs. McDowel, who under the same circumstances, committed ti. like deed,
                  and in the case of Mrs. Ashland, who was left, on a cold winter day, locked in a
                  room without fire or food, and of Mrs. Mary Harris, who was sick from April to
                  July, and who received no treatment, and who died from this neglect in the early
                  part of August; and in the case of Mrs. Williams, than which a greater case of
                  professional ignorance or criminal neglect, to put it in its mildest form;, was
                  never display ed by any professional man than by Dr. W. W. Hester, first assistant
                  physician,in his treatment of this case. We find this poor demented woman, an
                  inmate of the Insane Hospital for about eight or 1c months, under the care of Dr.
                  Hester, who treated her for suppressed menses, with what is known as
                  Hooper's female pill and a bitter tonic. Getting some better she went
                  home for two weeks. Returning at the end of that time, we find from the evidence
                  of three credible witnesses, that she was again placed under the same treatment,
                  and continued taking said pills, until she had taken 150 of the same. The menses
                  never returned. The woman kept getting larger weekly, according to Dr.
                  Hester's own evidence, and the attendants about the hospital called the
                  attention of Dr. Hester to her case, intimating that the woman was <pb n="90" xml:id="VAA8558-17-340"/> enceinte. He still ordered the pills, which experts,
                  Drs. Theophilus Parvin and T. B&gt; Harvey, as well as Dr. Walker and Woodburn, say
                  would most probably have produced an abortion, and the evidence shows that Dr.
                  Hester compelled this poor, demented, impregnated patient to pull a 30-pound
                  rubber over the floor, despite her continued desire to lie down, and her continued
                  compliant of "beating down pains."</p>
                <p>We further find that even after the birth of the child, Dr. Hester continued an
                  unheard of and unprofessional practice in carrying off the foetus and afterbirth,
                  together with the bedclothing, to his dispensary, where he let it remain until it
                  was discovered by its offensive odor. That he then placed the foetus in pickle and
                  threw the afterbirth in the water closet, and afterward tired to burn the sheet,
                  like a person who had committed a great crime and was trying to hide his guilt.
                  Your committee have failed to find any cause for such conduct, or of such neglect
                  and cruelty as this unfortunate created received, who was utterly incapable of
                  helping herself. We do not know nor can we conceive of any cause why a medical
                  officer of a public institution should stoop to the more than reprehensible
                  practice of burning the bedclothing of a woman who had been delivered a child. </p>
                <p>Your committee further find that Dr. Everts after having been notified of the
                  fact, did not perform his duty by immediately discharging Dr. Hester for being
                  guilty of such improper conduct, and that Dr. Everts is justly censurable for
                  continuing him in office, and this approving his conduct. </p>
                <p>We further find that the Asylum for the Insane has been in a state of
                  demoralization for a number of years last past; the attendants and the officers
                  continually clashing and forming "rings," thereby tending to
                  demoralize the institution and destoy its efficiency. We find that no record of
                  prescription is kept, and would recommend that a registry of all prescriptions be
                  kept in the dispensary of the hospital. That unruly and meddlesome attendants be
                  discharged. That the present medical officers, proven culpable, be discharged and
                  a careful scrutiny be hereafter maintained by both the board of directors and the
                  superintendent over the medical officers and other attendants, and see that said
                  attendants treat the poor unfortunate people under their charge with that humanity
                  and professional care that should actuate every one worthy the name of man </p>

          <p>Mr. FANCHER objected to the House concurring in the report of the conference committee

            the teacher, after it had already been decided by the House, by a large majority, that
            they preferred that the patrons of the district should select the teacher, and after the
            Senate had concurred therein. It was, in fact, allowing two or three men, by force of
            circumstances, to control the entire House and Senate, they well knowing the desire of
            the members to pass the bill, and, in order to do it, the House must concur in their

          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to amend the report of the committee, by striking out all after the
            enacting clause, and inserting new matter. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. GARRIGUS this amendment was indefinitely postponed (before it was
            read). </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE made an ineffectual motion--yeas 8, nays 28--to lay the report on the table.
            He then moved to recommit the bill and report, with instructions to report at 4
            o'clock. </p>
          <p>Mr. STREIGHT could not support this measure at this late day, without time for
            consideration--affecting as it does property to the value of millions of dollars. He
            would be glad to see some good ditching measure adopted, but could not give this one his
            support. </p>
          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS insisted this substitute is a well guarded measure, carefully compiled by
            the committee. It is a subject of general interest in the north part of the State, and
            only seeks to amend several sections in the law of 1875--giving the right of appeal,
            allowing supervision of township trustees, and other beneficial measures. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE opposed the motion to recommit. He believed this one of the most important
            of all the ditching laws presented this session. It will prevent a large amount of
            vicious legislation, and should certainly be passed. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE pointed out several evil features in this bill. His constituency are
            anathematizing all such measures as this. They want ditches opened in the same manner as
            public highways. </p>
          <p>Mr. BRISCOE said this bill prevented going beyond the land benefitted by the ditch. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE regarded that as the cat in this meal tub. These ditchers have gone 15 miles
            from the ditch and claimed benefits at $10 an acre to land which the owners were willing
            to sell for $8 an acre. This bill strikes down every right to property; and now when the
            time has passed in which a bill can be passed, to attempt to foist such a measure upon
            the people is unjust, improper and ought to be infamous </p>
          <p>Mr. WEIR but this morning learned his bill was defeated in the House under the
            impression that this bill had become a law. The substitute unites the various amendments
            proposed to the law of 1875, including the one he desired, and he hoped the bill would
            pass.</p>

          <p>Mr. GARRIGUS moved to suspend the constitutional restriction that the bill may be read
            the third time now, and on that motion he demanded the previous question, which was
            seconded, and under its operation the Senate refused to suspend the constitutional
            provision--yeas 32, nays 8--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER offered a concurrent resolution for an appropriation of $451.90 to defray
            the expenses of the joint special committee to investigate the benevolent institutions
            of the State, to-wit: William H. Harrison, bookkeeper, expert services, 6 days at $6,
            total, $36; Watson &amp; Dickerson, for short hand report, 3,900 folios, at 6 cents
            each, $234, stationery and binding, $8.50, total, $242.50; George F. Miller, for 6
            days' services as expert bookkeeper at $6, total, $36; David B. Wilson;
            doorkeeper of the House, acting as sergeant-at-arms for the committee, $80.30; W.
            H.Hubbard, for subpoenaing a witness, $7; for witnesses, $39.90; Richard Huncheon,
            doorkeeper of Senate, acting sergeant-at-arms for committee, $20.90. </p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE moved to strike out all allowances to the doorkeeper for mileage and service
            on the ground that he is in the employ of the State, and it is his business to perform
            the service demanded of him by virtue of his position. He said there is a telephone
            connecting the Insane Asylum with the city, from whence a number of mileages and
            services for return are charged.</p>
          <p> Mr. OLDS favored passing the allowance as certified by the committee. </p>
          <p>Mr. FOSTER said the allowance is to reimburse the doorkeepers for actual expenses.</p>
          <p> The motion to strike out way agreed to.</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. REEVE, all allowances to witnesses in the employ of the State or its
            institutions, were stricken out.,</p>
          <p> On motion by Mr. HARRIS, the matter was referred to the <orgName>committee on
              finance</orgName> with instructions to report at 9 o'clock Monday

          <p> On motion by Mr. OLDS, the bill [H. R. 487] for the vacation of public squares in
            certain cases, was read the second time. On his further motion the constitutional
            restriction was dispensed with, the bill read the third time, and finally passed
            by--yeas 36, nays 0. </p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. WOOLEN, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the bill [H. R.
            377] to regulate the practice of medicine with the accompanying veto message of his
            excellency the governor, which was read. The <pb n="93" xml:id="VAA8558-17-343"/>

          <!--P.93 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
          <p>Mr. MENZIES demanded the previous question, and under its operation the bill failed to
            pass--yeas 22, nays 15--over the veto of the governor--</p>
          <p>Pending the roll-call--</p>
          <p>Mr. DICE, when his name was called, said: Thinking every senator who voted for this
            bill in the face of the governor's objections is doing a wrong thing, and so
            believing, was compelled to vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. REEVE, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said, believing this
            bill to be unconstitutional, in some of its provisions, which are unequal and unjust,
            and that it is of the species of class legislation, impracticable in its operation, and
            that is not only tends, but it will operate to enhance the evils it professes to cure;
            he had opposed it from the first as a bill that should not become a law. He therefore
            vote "no."</p>
          <p>Mr. STEIGHT, when his name was called, said: Whenever the gag is placed on a measure of
            so much importance he was disposed to vote against it: but believing this class of
            legislation to be vicious in its nature, he voted "no."</p>
          <p>So the bill failed to pass over the objections of the Governor</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. STREIGHT the bill [H. R. 568] supplemental to the common school law,
            authorizing school commissioners in towns of 30,000 inhabitants or over by the census of
            1870 to purchase grounds and erect public library buildings, was read the second time,

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR--No quorum voting there can be no business transacted except to

          <p>Mr. STREIGHT made an ineffectual motion--yeas 17, nays 19--to adjourn, the yeas and
            nays being demanded by the chair.</p>
          <p>Mr. BENZ insisted there had been a miscount. He counted 19 ayes to 17 nays.
            [Laughter].</p>
          <p>On motion by Mr. SHIRK the bill [H. R. 688] to create a board of pardons was taken

        <p>The bill [S. 91] to amend section 455 of the general practice act was read the first time
          and passed to the second reading.</p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON called up his bill [H. R. 70] fixing the salary of members of the General
          Assembly and judges of the supreme and superior courts. Salary of members of the General
          Assembly shall be $5 per day and five cents mileage; judges of the supreme court, $3,000
          per annum; cicuit courts judges, $2,000; superior judges, $2,500 per annum; criminal
          circuits, $1,500 per year--in counties having a city with a population of 40,000, criminal
          circuit judges shall receive $2,000 per annum; which was read the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the salary of the suprume judges was too small.</p>
        <p>Mr. ENGLISH moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike our all matter
          pertaining to the salary of judges.</p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>On the motion of Mr. WILLARD, this motion was laid on the table--yeas 39, nays 37.</p>
        <p>Mr. REED moved to recommit the bill to a special committee, with instructions to amend by
          adding a section fixing the compensation of grand and petit jurors in attendance upon the
          circuit, superior, and criminal courts of the State at $2 per day.</p>
        <p>The SPEAKER ruled the motion our of order.</p>
        <p>Mr. ALLEN, of Putnam, was in favor of the passage of this bill. He was not willing to
          concede to the judiciary and favoritism, and not think they should be a preferred few. He
          had favored every measure offered this winter to reduce the expenses of the State and
          county government. We have passed a bill reducing fees and salaries of county officers,
          and no let us pass this bill. If it had come late, it was better late than never.
          Jurors' per diem have been reduced to $1.60, and he could see no reason why the
          salary of judges should not be reduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER interrupted the gentleman by asking if he was not in favor of this bill
          because he knew that this is the last day of the session, and that the bill can not be
          passed? And Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, interposed the question, Why did you not vote for the
          fee and salary bill?</p>
        <p>Not recognizing the interruption, Mr. A. concluded his remarks by saying he thought the
          passage of the bill would save thousands of dollars to the people.</p>
        <p>Mr. HEROD spoke in opposition to the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. LEHMAN said: On last Wednesday a resolution was here, proposing to adjourn on
          Saturday, and in speaking in favor of that resolution, we were charged with making buncomb
          speeches and casting buncomb votes, and not these very gentleman come here, the last day
          of the session, when they know that it can not pass, with a bill proposing to cut down the
          salaries of judges and members of <pb n="94" xml:id="VAA8558-17-344"/> the General
          Assembly. These very gentlemen have set here drawing $6 per day for 80 days, and 20 cents
          mileage, and now, after having their pay safely in their pockets, they propose to cut down
          the pay of future General Assemblies. Why did not these gentlemen bring in this bill the
          early part of the session? Why wait until the bill could not pass? He would hurl back at
          these gentlemen the charge of buncomb, and asserts that nothing introduced and advocated
          during the entire session is equal in buncomb to this very bill. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD said this bill was offered to reduce the fees and salaries of that class of
          State offices which the fee and salary bill had left out.</p>
        <p> Mr. WATSON was opposed to this bill. He had never heard a man ask for a reduction of the
          salaries of judges or members of the General Assembly. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT had advocated a reduction of fees and salaries to a sum that would prevent
          officials from corrupting the ballot box as they have been doing.</p>
        <p> Mr. MARCH said the less a man is paid the more honest he performs his official
          functions. "To the victor belong the spoils" is an adage which has
          poisoned the very vitals of politics. </p>
        <p>Mr. HUBBARD said after a judge has served his term he loses his law practice, and this
          item ought to be considered. He thought $2,500 was not too much for a circuit judge.
          Referring to the pay of legislators, he expressed a willingness to head a list of members
          who would refund to the State $1 per day of their per diem.</p>
        <p> Mr. JOHNSON said on the 10th day of January a bill was introduced similar to this one,
          and by some pollyfoxing the bill was lost, and when the fee and salary bill was before
          this House he had incorporated the same in that, but when it went to the committee it was
          dropped out. </p>
        <p>Mr. OVERMEYER said: The gentleman who introduced the bill said we should begin reducing
          salaries where we can do some good. This bill was only introduced a few days ago, and this
          is the last day of the session for passing bills. Every one knows that the bill can not
          now go through the Senate, even it the House should pass it. Then the passing of this bill
          could do no good; besides there are provisions in the bill which are clearly wrong. Not
          willing to vote for a bill simply to make buncombe for its author, he should vote
          "no." </p>
        <p>Mr. STEVENS said he had honestly desired the reduction of fees and salaries of State and
          county officers, but as that measure had signally failed, he was at this late day opposed
          to all attempts to reduce the salaries of our judges below the amounts now paid to our
          county officers. The bill had been introduced for buncombe, and therefore he hoped it
          would not pass.</p>
        <p> Then bill then failed to pass the House by yeas 39, nays 47. </p>
        <p>The bill [S. 147] in relation to the inspection of petroleum oil for illuminating
          purposes, etc., was read the first time and passed to the second reading. </p>
        <p>The House concurred in Senate amendments to the bill [H. R. 683] providing for the prompt
          publication of the laws, acts, etc., of the 51st regular and special session. The Senate
          fixing the time at 6O days after the adjournment instead or 30.</p>
        <p> A message was received from the governor returning Mr. Edwin's bill [H. R. 377]
          regarding the practice of medicine, with the executive veto--and his reasons at length for
          refusing to give the bill his official sanction. </p>
        <p>The SPEAKER stated that inasmuch as the governor had returned, this bill the question
          before the House would be will the House reconsider the vote by which the bill passed the
          House? </p>
        <p> Mr. SLEETH said there were portions of the bill he was in favor of and other portions he
          was opposed to.</p>
        <p> Mr. BRIGGS said this bill applies only to those who hold themselves out to the world as
          qualified physicians, and that the State is overrun with quack doctors and they ought to
          be run out. A mistake of a doctor is covered only by the grave, and he thought the bill
          ought to pass, notwithstanding the governor's veto. </p>
        <p>Mr. SCHOLL came here opposed to taking up the time of the session in medical legislation,
          but he had voted for this bill before ana he wanted it to become a law now.</p>
        <p> Mr. DRAKE was opposed to allowing women to practice midwifery unless fully qualified, as
          he was quite certain that a large amount of the suffering of our women could be traced to
          the incompetency of these "mothers in Israel." He thought, too, that a
          woman could qualify herself for this practice by a six months' course of study
          under some competent physician; and that would remove all the objection of the governor.
          If women want to practice midwifery they should qualify themselves for that distinctive
          branch. </p>
        <p>Mr. CONFER thought if this bill should become a law it would open an amount of litigation
          that would do no one any good. </p>
        <p>Mr. PERRY was in favor of this bill for the good it would work to the people. He was in
          favor of passing the bill over the governor's veto. </p>
        <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
        <p>Under the operation of the previous question--demanded by Mr. Faulkner--the bill failed

          <p>On the motion of Mr. OVERMEYER, the constitutional rule was suspended--yeas 69, nays
            11--so that the bill [S. 147] for an act in relation to the inspection of petroleum, oil
            for illuminating purposes, etc., might be read the second time by title, read the third

          <p>Mr. CARTER thought there was a trick in this, and he could see no reason for the
            passage of the bill</p>
          <p>Mr. HUBBARD said this was the Ohio law, word for word. It can not injure any one, but
            will be a great blessing to the people at large. He would be only too glad to vote for
            such a bill.</p>
          <p>Mr. WILLARD--Its practical effect would be in favor of all the dealers in oil, and it
            would raise the price. It is a protective law, and will make new officers. It seemed to
            him to be a bill in the interest of a monopoly.</p>
          <p>The bill then finally passed the House by yeas 58, nays 26.</p>
          <p>The bill [S. 91] to amend section 455 of the general practice act was read the second

          <p>Mr. SLEETH thought the bill was unguarded and on his motion the bill was laid on the

          <p>The bill [S. 261] to amend section two of an act in relation to county auditors was

          <p>Mr. EDWINS again called up his bill [H. R. 377] regulating the practice medicine, which
            was returned by the governor, with his objections thereto, this morning, and failed for
            want of a constitutional majority, and it was now finally passed the House of

            pass by yeas 38, nays 40.</p>
          <p>Pending the roll call--</p>
          <p>Mr. SLEETH, in explanation of his vote, said he believed it was contrary to law, but
            nevertheless, for the sake of a little cheap buncomb, he could afford vote
            "aye."</p>
          <p>Mr. SNODDY, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: The gentleman
            from Rush (Mr. Sleeth) calls in question the legality of the local option feature.
            Unfortunately he was born a little too late. Forty years ago this very law was in force
            in every county in this State, and by the vigilance and industry of temperance men we
            have kept the evil from our door, and to-day there is not a single saloon in our county. </p>
          <p>The vote was then announced as above. </p>
          <p>Mr. OVERMEYER, introduced a bill [H. R. 705] for an act fixing the salary of deputy
            wardens of the State prisons at $1,000 per annum, and for an appropriation of $500 to
            purchase books for the prisons' libraries. He moved that the constitutional
            rules be suspended, in order that the bill may be read the second time by title,
            considered engrossed, the bill read a third time by sections and put upon its passage. </p>
          <p> Mr. CARTER thought the bill ought not to pass, as the deputy warden had perquisites
            that would make more than $200 per annum to him.</p>
          <!--Unrecorded Vote-->
          <!--P.95 in Vol. 18 in BLR-->
          <p>The House refused to suspend the constitutional rule--yeas 54, nays 20.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS, from the <orgName>judiciary committee</orgName>, submitted a majority
            report upon the resolution offered by Mr. Taylor, of Davis, in relation to
            woman' suffrage.</p>
          <p>MR. MARCH and Mr. THOMPSON submitted minority reports which were read, and, without
            action thereon, laid on the table.</p>
          <p>Mr. SHANKS said the committee has had this resolution under consideration, and three of
            the committee conclued that women are citizens, both of the State and the nation: that
            they are not prohibited by the constitution of the State, or of the nation from voting.
            That the national constitution secures to all citizens the right to vote. and denies to
            any State the power to refuse the right to vote on account of race, color or previous
            condition of servitude; and this has destroyed the power of the provisions of the
            constitution of Indiana, forbidding negroes or mulattoes to vote, and they are now
            permitted to vote. That white is a color, and women of a race, or races, as well as all
            men, should be allowed to vote. That they have been simply and only neglected and not
            prohibited by the constitution of the State from voting, and that females are now
            entitled to vote in elections where males are permitted to vote. He desired that the
            subject may have full thought by the people, and that they render justice to the females
            of this State, who in all the duties of citizenship have as faithfully discharged every
            duty to the State and country as have male citizens. The prohibition of the ballot to
            females keeps from the legislature of the country the highest moral element of society.
            He hoped this invidious distinction would no longer be tolerated in this State.</p>
          <p>The House then adjourned.</p>

        <p>Mr. HARRIS contended that when this matter was before the Senate two years ago this claim
          of $1,993.60 was settled by a Senate resolution allowing the claim at $500. </p>
        <p>Mr. REEVE replied that $500 was to pay a claim for services rendered in the Senate,
          allowed unanimously by the Senate committee on claims, (as was also the present claim,)
          and paid out of the Senate fund on a warrant drawn by the president thereof. </p>
        <p>Mr. HARRIS and Mr. FOWLER insisted the $500 was in full satisfaction of the $1,993.60
          claim. </p>
        <p>The resolution was rejected. </p>
        <p>On motion by Mr. FOWLER, the House concurrent resolution for an allowance of $200 each to

        <p>No quorum voting--</p>
        <p>Mr. STREIGHT moved that the Senate adjourn <hi rend="i">sine die</hi>, whereupon--</p>
        <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said: Senators: This General Assembly having decided to close
          its labors, its laws are now a part of the legislative history of the State, and I trust
          that time and experience will show that the wisdom of its acts will compare favorably with
          those of any former General Assembly. </p>
        <p>It is possible that some things have been done which had better been left undone; that
          you have failed to pass some measures which the public wants demand. To some extent all
          legislation is an experiment. But few measures are passed by unanimous consent. There is
          most always a divided opinion as to the practicability or justness of the measure pending.
          This necessitates an interchange of views and breeds discussion. The friends of the
          measure, believing the public welfare demands its passage, strive by argument to perfect
          its provisions and secure for it the requisite majority. Its opponents, believing its
          enactment will be inimical to the State, strive with equal zeal to prevent its becoming a
          law. And thus what some cons der as time wasted in debate is but an honest endeavor to
          conserve the public good. This diversity of opinion and inability to see alike is one of
          the faults of poor human nature, and will exist as long as man is fallible. When he
          arrives at a state of infallibility no legislative bodies will be needed. There will be
          neither makers nor breakers of the law. Then all mankind will walk together in one
          harmonious intercourse, amenable only to Him whose laws are written on the tablets of
          eternal time. Then indeed will the millennium have come, and that car of natural progress,
          whose wheels turn not backward, will have reached its destination, which lies in the
          brightness of the latter day.</p>
        <p> The labors of this General Assembly have not been light. It has apportioned the State
          for representation in the General Assembly and for representation in Congress. It has
          enacted upwards of a 100 other laws, among which are: reducing the rate of interest; on
          contract and judgment, exempting to the debtor from execution property to the amount of
          $600, exempting a portion of the wages of the laborer so necessary to the support of his
          family, saving from attachment and garnishee proceeding the laborer's wages in
          cases where the plaintiff and defendant are non-residents of the State, to farther protect
          the life and health of the miner in his dark and perilous employment in the mine, for the
          better government of the benevolent and reformatory institutions, reducing the fees and
          salaries of State and county officers saving to the people thereby alone upwards of a
          $100,000 annually. I trust its legislation will prove beneficial to the people and tend to
          further the prosperity and renown of the State. </p>
        <p>Senators, I thank you for your approval of the manner in which I have discharged the
          duties of the chair. Not in words merely formal, but with deep sincerity do I thank you. I
          have discharged its duties as I saw them, and understood them. Actuated by no motive other
          than to preserve order and decorum, and faciltate legislation. The duties of a presiding
          officer are necessarily laborious, requiring patience, strict attention and prompt
          decision, and if at any time the manner of my rulings have seemed harsh, I assure you it
          was not so intended, and sincerely hope 1 have in no instance been so unfortunate as to
          unintentionally give offense. I can not leave without expressing the deep obligation I am
          under to each of you for that defference with which you have always bowed to my rulings.
          And for that respect and courtesy exhibited toward the chair at all times, even when
          political asperity and party rancor seemed to hold sway in the Chamber. I thank you to a
          far greater extent than I can find words to express; and in parting can truly say that I
          am possessed of no feeling other than that of the kindliest nature toward each and every
          member and employe of this body, and shall carry with me through life the most pleasing
          recollections of our associations, and hope that without regard to political proclivities,
          may count each of you my personal friend, The final adjournment of a legislative body is
          to me always an occasion of solemnity. Despite myself the thought will flash upon my mind
          that these tongues that have been so <pb n="98" xml:id="VAA8558-17-348"/> animated in
          debate will, in a few short years, be stilled forever. Yes, senators, we will all soon
          have to answer the roll-call that will come from over the dark. deep, wide river to meet
          in that silent assembly that sits on its farther shore, where Democrat, Republican and
          National occupy seats side by side, free from political asperity and party hate; an
          assembly that never adjourns, the members of which answers the call of the roll but once.
          If my life shall be spared I hope to he here in January, 1881, to convene this Senate, and
          when I shall order the call of the roll may every senator holding over be here in health
          to answer to his name. I thank you all for your many acts of kindness and partiality, and
          wish that many years of prosperity, health and happiness may be vouchsafed to each of you.
          The question is on the motion of the senator from Marion, that the Senate adjourn sine
          die. As many as favor the motion will say "aye," those of a contrary
          opinion "no." It is carried. </p>
        <p>And so the Senate was adjourned sine die. </p>

                office of James C. Denny and Clarence A. Buskirk, to ascertain what amounts of money
                have been collected by each, from whom collected, and what office the person from
                whom the collection was made held at the time, if any, and, if not, whether the
                moneys collected had been in the hands of such person in an official capacity and
                returned after his term of office had expired, on account of what fund the moneys
                were collected by said Denny and Buskirk. That commissions were charged by them and
                their assistants, from what counties the collections were small, oat or what funds
                the commissions were retained, and out of what county; the full amount collected in
                each during his term of office, and the amount paid over to the proper county and
                State treasuries, and the amount such commission shall believe said Denny and
                Buskirk are indebted to the State or any of the counties for moneys collected and
                not paid over. </p>
              <p>Further resolutions declared that, to assist the commission in their inquiry, all
                county officers are required to make reports to them, on demand, of any payments of
                money made to the attorneys general or their assistants; a tabulated statement of
                the results of the investigation shall be made to the governor within 10 days after
                its completion; if there is found to be due to the State any moneys by either Denny
                or Buskirk, suit shall be brought by an attorney appointed by the governor, cost not
                to exceed S500, provided that if the commissioners and governor shall believe that
                either of the parties is insolvent and the sureties relieved by the statute of
                limitations, then no such suit shall be brought against such party; the commission
                shall receive $6 per day each for their services. </p>
              <p>And, whereas. It has been made to appear to the satisfaction of your committee that
                the Attorney General Buskirk, and that another record of such transactions was by
                him kept, as required lay law, which was carried away by him at the close of his
                term, and is not now in the office, where by law it is required to remain and as
                said book contains the records of one of the departments of the State government,
                and is the property of the State, therefore </p>
              <p>Resolved, That if Mr. Buskirk, on demand of the commission, refuses or fails to
                return said book to the office of the attorney general. the present attorney general
                is hereby directed to institute such legal proceedings as he may deem proper to
                compel the return of the same to said office. </p>

              <p> Resolved, That the governor appoint an expert to investigate the books in the
                attorney general's office under the tenure of James C. Denny and Clarence
                A. Buskirk, and if upon such investigation any amount be due the State from either
                of said persons, that he be authorized, and is hereby empowered, to institute suit

        <p>Mr. EDWINS said that he was not opposed to investigating, but he was opposed to any
          committee being appointed from this House at $6 a day for 40 days to go roaming over the
          county investigating what had been already discovered, and after the parties were found to
          be insolvent. There had been an investigation of the benevolent institutions, and
          according to the evidence the blackest and darkest of crimes and direst treachery had been
          perpetrated. The State officials had, according to the testimony, been convicted of fraud
          and peculation, and gentlemen who were so anxious to raise this committee had voted to
          smother and hide this great crime. </p>
        <p>Mr. WORKS said if this House wanted this investigation carried on satisfactorily and
          completely this resolution should be adopted, as he thought it was the cheapest and best
          way the matter could be settled. If it was the desire of this House to recover back the
          money said to be due the State from these gentlemen, it should be done as soon as
          possible. </p>
        <p>Mr. SNODDY wanted to see this subject come squarely before this House, and demanded a
          record by a yea and nay vote. </p>
        <p>Mr. TAYLOR, of Daviess, was opposed to the passage of the resolution, but was in favor of
          authorizing the governor to appoint an expert to examine into the matter. </p>
        <p>Mr. SHANKS said it was due to these men that they should have a thorough investigation,
          and if they had done wrong the people ought to know it. The honor of the State and these
          men demand that this investigation shall go on to a fair completion. </p>
        <p>The Senate concurrent resolution, for binding the acts of the regular and special
          session, in one volume, was adopted. </p>
        <p>On the motion of Mr. COPELAND a committee of two--Messrs. Copeland and Shutt--was
          appointed to wait upon the governor to ascertain if his excellency had any further
          communication to make to the House. </p>
        <p>Mr. SLEETH offered a concurrent resolution which was adopted, that in order that the
          people s Jail have at least an intimation of the laws by which they are governed, that the
          bureau of printing shall, within five days after the adjournment of the present General
          As-[sembly] <pb n="99" xml:id="VAA8558-17-349"/> [As]-sembly, cause to be published by one
          insertion in each of the two dally newspapers published at Indianapolis having the largest
          general circulation in the State, the numbers and titles of all the acts passed at the
          regular and special sessions containing an emergency clause. </p>
        <p>Mr. JOHNSON offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the thanks of this House are
          hereby tendered to the Hon. Henry S. Cauthorn, for the able and impartial manner in which
          he has presided over the deliberations of the special session of the Fifty-first General
          Assembly. </p>

          of the testimony and reports of the investigation of the benevolent institutions, in
          pamphlet form. </p>

          from the point of intersection by such canal to its mouth. </p>
        <p>Mr. SAINT moved to reconsider the vote adopting the resolution by which the report of the
          Benevolent Institutions investigating committee and the evidence thereof were ordered
          printed. </p>
        <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to lay that motion on the table. </p>

          "majority", in the 13th line from the bottom for the words "the
          adoption" should be substituted the words "laying on the
          table;" and in the 25th line from the bottom read "rejected"
          for "registered". Page 191, 30th line from bottom of 1st column, instead

        <p>The particulars of Legislative expenses for the extra session of 1872, itemized in the
          Specific Bill approved Dec'ber 21,1872, justifies our statement that the
          Legislature found the cost of the newspaper subsidies for legislative reports in this city
          to exceed that of the authentic <hi rend="i">Brevier</hi>.-- The cost of newspapers for
          that session above that of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Legislative Reports</hi> was $356.73.
          The newspaper vanished, but the <hi rend="i">Brevier</hi> is extant with all its
          contributions to history.</p>
        <p> The Legislature finding that the cost of their newspaper subsidies exceeded that of the
          authorized <hi rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi>, the subsidy was cut off by the act of
          December 19, 1872, By that act the newspaper became justly and legally recognized as but
          "stationery" for the people and their representatives, and, by
          implication, as unfitted and unworthy to be intrusted and authorized at the public expense
          as the depository of their solemn legislative records. </p>
        <p>The <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> have done for the people what the newspapers are
          unfit and unable to do in the matter of a just and stern legislative record; and the work
          has been done cheaper than the newspaper charges which have been paid out of the treasury
          for their partial,personal, restricted and unreliable matter called "Legislative
          Proceedings." </p>
        <p>The <hi rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi> contain a record that is impartial,--not a single
          partial report can be found in any one of the eighteen volumes issued.</p>
        <p> The <hi rend="sc">BREVIER</hi> Reporters in the 22 years of its publication have been
          careful chiefly to make their work here a good record, and rests its claims to the
          cherishment of the Legislature upon that alone. They have gone before no Committee,
          lobbied none, received no approaches for individual favor, nor shaped their work at any
          time with sinister or partizan objects. It has rested solely and all the time on its
          merits, its integrity and its fairness; and for these it has all the time received the
          favoring notice of the Legislature.</p>
        <p> As compensation should always be regulated by the skill required, there can be no
          question but that the pay for service but few are competent to perform should largely
          exceed the pay for labor that many are able to do. These <hi rend="i">Brevier
          Reports</hi>, in each page, contain more than three times as much matter as there is in
          one page of the Supreme Court Reports, yet the <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> are
          furnished to the state for two-thirds of a cent a page, while the Reporter of the Supreme
          Court has received three-quarters of a cent per page, besides the copyright.</p>

      <div type="prospectus">
        <p> In this submission of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> we have not been mistaken as
          to the common and growing public demand for just and intelligent public records. We have
          tried to meet that demand, and to provoke parties abler than we are to supply it as it
          ought to be supplied. And we still suppose that the representatives of the people know
          what they want in this matter know whether it is better to do everything here at the
          Capitol by memory and word of mouth than to stand upon a fair and open record for history. </p>
        <p>We have proceeded strictly upon the presumption that the peopled representatives know
          what is due to the country and to themselves in this matter of a record of their
          legislative action. And if there is any consideration against the continuance of the <hi rend="i">Brevier</hi> except that of its cost, the same conceit is as much against the
          lobbies and open doors for the sessions of the General Assembly; and it is at least one
          hundred years too late for secret sessions.</p>
        <p> The work can not be done by jobbers for the money that has been paid for it; and as to
          the standing contract price of the work, it carries that on every page: for "two
          thirds of a cent a page per copy' it is furnished to the proper accounting
          officers Of the State in printed sheets,<hi rend="i"> procured in every item of its cost
            at our own expense</hi>. </p>
        <p>The <hi rend="i">Brevier Legislative Reports</hi> have been acceptable to the Legislature
          and the people for seventeen years. The work has stood sternly on its merits with each
          particular session since '57 and it is offered again with the ability and desire
          on the part of these reporters to make such an abridgment of the State Legislative Record
          in the best form and at the cheapest rate. </p>
        <p>Considering the difficulties and opposition incident to such a work; the contingencies of
          failing health and failing purse, and failing at length to make an acceptable offering of
          the work, there is nothing in the offering of it on our part but hard work, and the good
          name of unswerving workers, much very delicate personal responsibility, and some pecuniary
          hazard--(large for our means--) and, last and at the best, but small pay. </p>
        <p>As seventeen consecutive sessions of the General Assembly have authorized the publication
          of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> it is regarded respectful and a duty to continue
          a proffer of the service that has been acceptable to every Legislature for so many years. </p>
        <p>None in the State are so competent to make a Legislative Record as the projectors of the
            <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> because the lives of no other Indianians have been
          passed in such like service.</p>
