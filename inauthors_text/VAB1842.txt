      One way to the woods

        

        

          
            THE song of Nature stirs
            Within the budding trees;
            Her true interpreters
            The birds and honey-bees;
            And wintry winds that freeze
            And toss the frosty firs,
            What minstrelsies of these
            That are not wholly hers?
          

          
            Dear heart, I pray it be
            Some little song of mine
            May murmur unto thee,
            From out the written line,
            Some note of that divine
            Eternal melody,
            And make the gladness thine
            It brings and sings to me!
          

        
        
        

        

          ONE WAY TO THE WOODS
          

          
            A LEVEL reach of April sun,
            Beside the river, faintly blue,
            That purls and swirls and twinkles through
            The sycamores, but just begun
            To bud anew;
            Then up a gently rising hill,
            Beneath tall walnut trees, until
            Some tufts of flaky hawthorns strew
            And powder all the way with white;
            On, past a farmhouse hidden quite
            In drifts of cherry bloom; and still
            Keep to the north, beyond the bend
            Abreast whose sharply curving turn
            The distant roadway seems to end
            In banks of brake and lady-fern,
            And willow boughs, in youthful hue
            Of tenderest green that ever grew,
            Verge into view.
          
          
            There, facing westward, loiter slow,
            While troops of robins, rollicking
            Among the bluebells, wing and sing
            And gladly as the robins, so
            Let Nature's gracious overflow

            

            Of light and life steep every sense
            In depths of joyous indolence!
            Thus, pacing leisurely, push through
            The wayside weeds and meadow-rue
            And wild witch-hazels, where a few
            White-turbaned bloodroots blossoming,
            Like small green-caftaned pilgrims, bring
            The shrine of Spring
            Their sweet belated offering.
          
          
            Then loose a leaning gate, and bold
            Fare on, across a cornfield where,
            Half-buried by the busy share,
            The stalks of stubble shine like gold,
            And, freshly turned, the furrowed mold
            Lies rich and bare.
          
          
            Tall daisy stems already chain
            The farther gate, that leads again
            Into a long, light, grassy lane,
            Where wagon-tracks of tawny brown,
            Inlaid with mosses, wind adown
            Through new green sheen of winter grain.
            The hedges there on either side
            Are leafless yet, but all the more
            In airy, universal, wide
            High-tide,

            

            The golden April sunbeams pour
            Between their ramparts, closely set,
            And filter through their silver net
            Of thorny interlacing boughs;
            The spreading redbud branches lean
            Like rosy coral in between,
            And in the distance, faintly seen,
            Some white sheep browse,
            And half a score of lazy cows
            Crop off the pasture's tender green.
          
          
            But by and by, upon the right,
            There breaks a sudden gleam of white;
            The fitful hum of honey-bees;
            And, tinkling in its interval,
            You catch the call
            Of orchard orioles, -- then all
            The blowing, snowing apple-trees
            Burst into sight!
            Ah, what more exquisite delight,
            What sweets in all the world more sweet,
            With more pure tenderness replete,
            Than some old orchard holds? And none
            Of all beneath the April sun,
            Can boast aught sweeter than this one!
            --I fancy that I see it now,
            Its sprays of bloom, that sway and toss;

            

            ('Twas there I broke this little bough,
            Whose waxy clusters, pink and white,
            Leaned so enticingly across
            The ragged fence-rails, gray with moss,
            The very trees seemed to invite
            Their own bright loss!)
          
          
            But then, in truth, one needs must pause
            Beside this self-same spot, because,
            O'ergrown with dandelions and weeds,
            The roadway ends; but winding thence,
            A violet-tufted footpath leads
            Through scented depths, and ways apart,
            Through shadowed aisles and thickets dense,
            Down through a deep fern-filled ravine,
            And on, into the hidden heart
            Of all the woodland's growing green.
          
          
            Beneath tall shafts of elm and oak,
            The trailing, brown, wild grape-vine swings,
            And in long wreaths the woodbine clings
            Round tangled undergrowth that springs
            Just high enough for one to stroke
            The little linden leaves, and feel
            The downy spice-wood buds, and steal
            A glimpse into a bluebird's nest.
          

          

          
            In crinkled verdure, here and there,
            The buckeye boughs show newly drest;
            And dogwood branches whiten where
            A tiny stream slips down below,
            Whose murmurous, faintly-fluting flow,
            Through long lush grass and starweed, frets;
            There golden-yellow cowslips grow;
            And there I found these violets.
          

        

        

          THE MARCH FROSTS
          
            THE little leaves that tip the trees
            With palest greenery everywhere,
            O bitter nights, that blight and freeze,
            And hurtling winds, and icy air,
            Forbear! Forbear!
            Have you no tenderness for these,
            Nor any care?
          
          
            No pity for the buds that break
            And fringe the maples, rosy red,
            The starting apple-sprays, that make
            A silver fretwork overhead?
            When these are dead,
            How shall the April for their sake
            Be comforted?
          

          
          
            Oh, all my heart is full of pain!
            The hurt they feel is hurt to me!
            The helpless little leaves! I fain
            Would cherish them so tenderly,
            It might not be
            Such cruel grief should fall again
            On any tree!
          
          
            I would that I could gently fold
            Against my breast, for sheltering,
            Each tiniest bud the peach-boughs hold,
            And every gracious burgeoning
            Of everything;
            So fondling them, through frost and cold,
            Until the spring!
          
        

        
          FEAST OF PALMS

          
            ONCE where green palms were laid,
            Rode strangest cavalcade
            Men e'er beheld;
            For in the midst of it
            Lowly a God did sit,
            It so in holy writ
            Stands chronicled.
          

          

          
            What though in triumph proud
            The glad exulting crowd
            Flung wide the palm,
            The joyful throngs between,
            Over the boughs of green,
            He rode with humble mien,
            Divinely calm.
          
          
            Aye, what were earthly prize
            To him whose prescient eyes
            Foresaw the thorn
            Foresaw all things to be,
            And kingliest victory
            Of meek humility,
            With patience borne?
          
          
            Then bring ye palms to-day,
            And holy, lowly pray,
            Nor nourish pride;
            Whoso in gentleness
            God's triumph doth confess,
            His heart the King will bless,
            And therein ride.
          
        
        

        

          BUDDING-TIME TOO BRIEF
          
            O LITTLE buds, break not so fast!
            The spring's but new.
            The skies will yet be brighter blue,
            And sunny too.
            I would you might thus sweetly last
            Till this glad season's overpast,
            Nor hasten through.
          
          
            It is so exquisite to feel
            The light, warm sun;
            To merely know the winter done,
            And life begun;
            And to my heart no blooms appeal
            For tenderness so deep and real,
            As any one
          
          
            Of these first April buds, that hold
            The hint of spring's
            Rare perfectness that May-time brings.
            So take not wings!
            Oh, linger, linger, nor unfold
            Too swiftly through the mellow mold,
            Sweet growing things!
          

          
          
            And errant birds, and honey-bees,
            Seek not to wile,
            And sun, let not your warmest smile
            Quite yet beguile
            The young peach-boughs and apple-trees
            To trust their beauty to the breeze
            Wait yet awhile!
          
        

        

          IN MEXICO
          
            THE cactus towers, straight and tall,
            Through fallow fields of chaparral;
            And here and there, in paths apart,
            A dusky peon guides his cart,
            And yokes of oxen journey slow,
            In Mexico.
          

          
            And oft some distant tinkling tells
            Of muleteers, with wagon-bells
            That jangle sweet across the maize,
            And green agave stalks that raise
            Rich spires of blossoms, row on row,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            Upon the whitened city walls
            The golden sunshine softly falls,
            On archways set with orange trees,


            

            On paven courts and balconies
            Where trailing vines toss to and fro,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            And patient little donkeys fare
            With laden saddle-bags, and bear
            Through narrow ways quaint water-jars
            Wreathed round with waxen lily stars
            And scarlet poppy-buds that blow,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            In liquid syllables, the cries
            Of far fruit-venders faintly rise;
            And under thick palmetto shades,
            And down cool covered colonnades,
            The tides of traffic gently flow,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            When twilight falls, more near and clear
            The tender southern skies appear,
            And down green slopes of blooming limes
            Come cascades of cathedral chimes;
            And prayerful figures worship low,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            A land of lutes and witching tones,
            Of silver, onyx, opal stones;

            

            A lazy land, wherein all seems
            Enchanted into endless dreams;
            And never any need they know,
            In Mexico.
          
          
            Of life's unquiet, swift advance;
            But slipped into such gracious trance,
            The restless world speeds on, unfelt,
            Unheeded, as by those who dwelt
            In olden ages, long ago,
            In Mexico.
          
        

        

          JANUARY
          
            TO and fro,
            To and fro,
            Athwart the tingling icy air,
            The linden branches blow, and so,
            With warp of wind and woof of snow,
            The weaver Winter's shuttles go
            Such garment rare
            The earth shall wear,
            No softest ermine, neither vair,
            Nor royal robing anywhere,
            Nor any cunning looms may show
            A fabric half so fair.
          

          

          
            Upon the peach and apple trees
            A thousand frosty fringes freeze
            The moon-vines lace the lattice bars
            In filmy filagrees.
            The grass is flecked with flaky stars
            The clover-tufts are hid from sight;
            And, now and then, a bird alight
            With burst of gleeful flutter, jars
            The pearly-laden red rose-hips,
            And tilting airily, so tips
            A tiny tempest, pelting down
            The slender briars bare and brown;
            Or else some sudden flurry stirs
            The fleecy drifts that freight the firs,
            And swept from silvery tassels slips
            A swirling cloud of trailing, bright,
            Light scarfs of powdered white.
          
          
            Along the wall the mossy stones
            Have caught and fixed the falling flakes
            Where, in quaint shapes, the grape-vine makes
            A low relief, with shadow-tones
            More soft than carven marble takes;
            And whiter by each gust that blows
            From off the roof, the climbing rose,
            In chiselled wealth of bough and thorn,

            

            About the doorway swiftly grows
            A skilful sculpture; but the sprays
            Of honeysuckle, overborne
            By crystal cargoes, cannot raise
            Their icy-fettered maze.
          
          
            A world of shining hints of hues,
            Wherein all tints so gently fuse
            In loveliness of light and shade,
            No eye may tell whereof is made
            Such pearly radiance; nor invade
            The violet depth thereof for clues
            To clasp its color-keys, and know
            The subtile secrets of the snow
            The gleaming heavens, overlaid
            With loosened spangles, softly fade
            Into the gleaming earth below;
            And all horizons seem to be
            Lost in white purity.
          
          
            Aye, richly, Winter, to and fro
            Thus let your silver shuttles go,
            Till every sparkling web is spun;
            Still, with rare skill, unceasing ply
            Your artful trickeries, and try
            All chill enchantments, every one
            Of all devices to beguile

            

            This dreary overweary while
            Wherein we wait the sun
            And since the north must yet prevail,
            And bitter cheerless winds assail,
            Come, white-wing'd snows, and over all
            Like shreds of floating feathers fall,
            And lightly lie!
            So, by and by,
            --Ah, by and by!--
            Like blue flakes from an azure sky,
            The April birds will fly.
          
        
        

          UNFAMILIAR
          
            THE world is all unreal to-day!
            I strive to fathom whence
            There sometimes comes this subtly strange
            Dim sense of difference.
          
          
            I gaze with gravely open eyes,
            No flaw of sight may be;
            Still, somewise vaguely out of touch,
            All things seem strange to me.
          
          
            The grass, the sky, the apple-trees,
            The honeysuckle vine,
            I know I know them all, --and yet,
            I cannot make them mine!
          


          
          
            Familiar tasks, with careful hand
            And vision, even now
            I fashion out; although, in truth,
            I scarce remember how.
          
          
            All purposes, ambitions, aims,
            All vital forces, take
            A value slight as if I slept;
            But yet I am awake!
          
          
            And vainly still my being seeks
            To break this baffling spell
            That blurs its clearer consciousness,
            --Wherefore, I cannot tell.
          

        

        

          HEART SONG
          
            AS one who holds a charm'd witch-hazel rod,
            And, as it veers, divines the hidden springs,
            Whose whispered chimes and muffled mur- murings
            Had passed unheeded underneath the sod,
            And as that spot, where careless footsteps trod,
            Then sparkles into silver speech and sings
            A liquid song that wakes to burgeonings
            The seeds imbedded in the barren clod,

            

            So, dearest heart, within my breast have you
            Pierced to the hidden melodies, and freed
            Its singing springs, and touched the buried seed
            Of strange, bright buds whereof I never knew!
            Sweet beyond words, and of such subtile power,
            It seems my whole life breaking into flower.
          
        

        

          THE MARSHES
          
            PALE shimmering skies that lightly bear
            Fine filmy clouds that idly fare
            In lazy wavering, wheresoe' er
            The faint, uncertain breezes go
            And even so,
            In airy motion down below,
            Tall wild rice, wild rice everywhere!
          
          
            From out the marshy wilderness,
            With plumes and pennons numberless,
            In endless lines its armies press :
            The very river it besets
            And foils and frets
            With leaves like little bayonets

            

            That pierce the light and glint and gleam
            And glitter in the midmost stream;
            And so besieged and closed about,
            The captive waves lap in and out
            Among the lacing stems, and creep
            Through flowered grasses and through deep
            Translucent pools wherein they seem
            To drowse and dream
            In draughts of liquid light, and steep
            In sunbeams, till, too spent to stir,
            They sink into a golden sleep,
            So held perpetual prisoner.
          
          
            And over all there softly plays,
            Through summer days,
            A marvel of pale violet haze
            That sheathes and wreathes and overlays
            The thousand swaying plumes that rise
            From all those silvery water-ways
            Wherein the drowsy river lies,
            Content to clasp the gracious skies
            That twinkle through its tangled maze,
            And nestle in it lazywise.
          
          
            And, now and then, a wild bird flies
            From hidden haunts among the reeds;
            Or, faintly heard, a bittern cries

            

            Across the tasselled water-weeds
            Or, floating upward from the green
            Young willow wands, with sunny sheen
            On pearly breast, and wings outspread,
            A white crane journeys overhead.
          
          
            For leagues on leagues no sign is there
            Of any snare
            For human toil, nor grief nor care;
            The fields for bread lie otherwhere.
            --Only the wild rice, straight and tall,
            The wild rice waving over all.
          
        

        

          THE DROUGHT
          
            ON laden lands the web of gold,
            Whose shuttles slanting sunbeams ply,
            Lies broken-meshed upon the wheat,
            Where sere stalks die.
          
          
            The young corn curls its husky blades,
            And bees athirst pale blossoms drain,
            While languid buds bend low to earth
            Between the grain.
          
          
            The fisher crosses, ankle-deep,
            The shrunken river as it moans

            

            Through bleaching banks of barren sand
            And scorching stones.
          
          
            Gaunt trees pathetic to the sky
            Their parched and crisping boughs stretch out
            O winds, go search the nimbus clouds,
            And end the drought!
          
        

        

          HYACINTHS
          
            I PLACED the purple hyacinths
            Above the lips I loved;
            Across the narrow mound a fret
            Of leafy shadows moved.
          
          
            Between the branches overhead
            The April sky was blue,
            And now and then a shining drift
            Of little clouds looked through.
          
          
            The blessed breath of bloomy things
            Enfolded all the air,
            And from the hedge of evergreen
            A robin sang somewhere.
          

          

          
            I strove to see the happy earth,
            But over bud and leaf
            A sudden darkness fell, for I
            Was blinded by my grief.
          
          
            O dearest heart! they seemed so long,
            The lonely, lonely years!
            I laid my face against the grass,
            And showered it with tears.
          
        

        

          THE BAYOU
          
            BELOW the bridge, a little way
            Float downward near the bank, beneath
            The trailing wild-grape vines that wreathe
            The water-oaks and elms, and sway
            Far out across the current; down
            Beyond the drift where in deep pools,
            Among the mosses' tawny brown,
            The lazy river-mussels cling;
            Where little turtles hide, and schools
            Of tiny fishes flash in view,
            And part, and dart, and start anew
            In eager aimless journeying.
          
          
          
            On, past the slender reeds that swing
            Their tufts of tasselled bloom, and show
            Where sweet-flags grow;
            Past willow wands that weave and fling
            Athwart the way a waving screen,
            Through which the tinkling ripples flow,
            And sing, and ring,
            With drowsy murmurs, soft and slow,
            And ceaseless silver cadencing;
            --But there, just where the bushes lean
            And cross in leafy archway, hung
            With rosy mallow-flowers, and strung
            With ivory button-balls, and green
            With tender freshness everywhere,
            Just there
            Turn, and steer straightway in between.
          
          
            Ah, surely none would ever guess
            That through that tangled wilderness,
            Through those far forest depths remote,
            Lay any smallest path, much less
            A way wherein to guide a boat!
            But whoso knows the stream, and shares
            The rare deep secrets that it hides,
            Nor e'er confides
            Save only unto him who bears
            
            True love of nature's lore,
            And dares
            Her inmost pathways to explore,
            --Unto such sympathetic eyes
            The river, ofttimes unawares,
            Leads onward to some sweet surprise.
          
          
            And so, push gently through the dense
            Low button-balls,
            And plumy growths of wild-rice, whence
            At cautious, watchful intervals,
            The brooding hermti-bittern calls;
            Then steering slowly, in and out,
            Curve close about
            The lofty forest trees, and wind
            Among the willows, intertwined
            And crept across
            By scarlet trumpet-vines, that toss
            In lavish richness unconfined
            Above the blooming water-moss;
            The trailing, tufted moss, that makes
            A carpet of its starry flakes
            So thick that one may scarcely see
            The long lithe lily-stems that grow
            Far down below
            With buds of pearl and gold enshrined
            Amid vague under-greenery.
          
          
          
            And lightly, here and there, among
            The russet rushes, as you go,
            The curling, purling ripples flow,
            And to and fro,
            With fitful motion, faintly stir
            The fine green film the waves have hung
            About the underwood, and flung
            In scarfs of shining gossamer
            Upon the grasses, lush and low;
            --Then presently,
            Beyond the lily-pads, maybe,
            There breaks the softly vibrant whir
            Of wafting wings, and through the reeds,
            Uprising--rising--far and free,
            A sweetly-fluting throstle speeds
            With burst of mellow melody.
          
          
            But from the forest depths profound
            There comes no sound;
            So dusk, so dense, so wholly still,
            The outer winds that thither stray
            Sweep slowly on, from tree to tree,
            And down long shadowed ways, until,
            Charged with the strange solemnity
            Those hushed and hidden haunts instil,
            All silently, into the day
            They steal away.
          
          
          
            --And there, within the bayou's heart,
            Adrift, apart
            From all save that untrodden wood,
            So deep
            Secluded in the solitude
            Of those tall towering trees, that keep
            The very atmosphere imbued
            With breath of primal peacefulness,
            --There, clasped in Nature's close caress,
            Slipped sheer from all inquietude,
            At peace upon the limpid stream,
            I know no other ways that seem
            So sweet wherein to drift and dream.
          
          
            There, floating on in tranquil mood,
            The tire, the tumult, and the stress,
            The dreary brood
            Of toil and fret
            And fevered, never-ending care,
            --All, all this wide world's weariness
            Seems otherwhere;
            So far, far otherwhere! - And yet,
            Through reason of the peaceful air
            My own griefs wear,
            That very sense of farness steals
            Into my heart with strange appeals;
            
            All distant strife of living pleads
            Its needs,
            Remote, half-comprehended, -- still
            With such insistent pathos, till
            My dream-borne spirit wakes and heeds;
            That sentient stillness stirs in me
            A keener, subtler sympathy;
            My inmost being throbs, expands,
            And understands
            More what the restless world may be.
          
          
            And like the free reed-birds that fly
            From those green tangles to the sky,
            Yet seek the bayou, by and by,
            So, on a nobler, higher quest,
            New-fledging from its body nest,
            My eager soul soars up and sees
            More of God's gracious mysteries;
            Wherefrom a larger love it learns,
            And then, with humble mien, returns,
            Divines, more near, the perfect rest
            Of Nature's breast,
            And so, touched tenderly through these,
            Feels more of true humanities.
          

        

        

        
          IN YOUTH
          
            NOT lips of mine have ever said:
            "Would God that I were dead!"
            Nay, cruel griefs! ye cannot break
            My love of life; nor can ye make
            Oblivion blest in anywise,
            Nor death seem sweet for sorrow's sake.
            Life! Life! my every pulse outcries
            For life, and love, and quickened breath,
            O God,--not, not for death!
          
        
        

          MIDSUMMER
          
            UPON the fields a golden blur,
            Pink bindweeds trailing through the corn;
            From orchard boughs the muffled whir
            Of bright wings, faintly borne;
            Along the roads, pale amethyst
            Of plumy banks of bergamot;
            And in my eyes a rising mist
            Of grief, or joy,--I know not what!
          
          
            Again I feel the old sweet ache
            That fills the heart for beauty's sake;
            The yearning tenderness that grieves


            

            O'er fields, and flowers, and wind-blown leaves,
            And golden sheaves,
            And loveliness of earth and sky,
            In strange sharp pangs,-- we know not why.
            The pain that baffles him who tries
            In anywise
            Its subtile grief to analyze;
            And yet that is a joy that thrills
            And overfills
            The quivering soul, and clarifies
            Its eager vision unto fine
            Undreamed-of raptures, all-divine!
            And so I let the surging tears,
            Unquestioned, brim my happy eyes,
            While all my harkening spirit hears
            The great Earth-song uprise.
          
        
        

          MISTRAL'S POEM "MIR√àIO"
          
            A ROSE of song that tops the tree
            In sunny gardens over-sea,
            Where grows the golden fleur-de-lis,
            The myrtle, and
            In scented clusters, dewy wet,


            


            The blue Provencal violet,
            The land of lilting chansonette,
            The poets' land.
          
          
            Like music swept from silver strings
            The pure sweet love the poet sings,
            And what though touched with sorrowings
            And grievous woes,
            Yet still the tender tale thereof
            Is dear all other themes above,
            A perfect song of perfect love;
            For like the rose
          
          
            That leans against the garden wall,
            Though on its petals raindrops fall
            And chill winds buffet, yet withal,
            When matched with this,
            Not all the shining lily spires
            Nor any scarlet poppy fires
            So satisfy the heart's desires
            And so love is.
          
        
        
          THE HILL PASTURE
          
            IN silky balls beside the stream
            The pussy-willows stand,
            Where thick the yellow cowslips gleam
            Upon the reedy land.
          

          

          
            And up the hillside, green and steep,
            The lacing dogwood boughs
            In fleeting glimpses show the sheep
            Like blossoms as they browse.
          
          
            The redbud trees are wrapped in rose,
            The hawthorn throbs and pales,
            And launched by every breeze that blows
            The elm seeds spread their sails.
          
          
            They float like shining spangles bright
            Adown the sunny air,
            And cargoes sweet of sheer delight
            Unto my heart they bear.
          
          
            In happy dreams I watch the flocks,
            While, like a lavish king,
            With golden key the day unlocks
            The treasures of the spring.
          
        
        

          THE MIST
          
            ABOVE the bayou, softly bright
            With coronal of silver rays,
            Through rifting drifts of pearly haze
            And rings of rosy halo-light,
            Across the sweet October night
            The rising full-moon rode;

            

            And lifting airily its load
            Of leaf and fruit and tangled fret
            Of little twigs, while newly glowed
            Her perfect disk, a linden showed
            In graceful silhouette.
          
          
            Sometimes the waxing moonbeams fell
            Athwart the river's brink and crossed
            Its still tide with their magic spell,
            Till all the trailing water-grass
            Glittered like traceries of frost
            Upon a pane of glass.
          
          
            In veils of vapor, far away
            To east and west, the marshes lay;
            A pallid wilderness, whereon
            Vague ferns and ghostly grasses grew,
            Tall moon-tipped rushes, and a few
            Weird water-willows, faint of hue,
            And sedges slim and wan.
          
          
            Then presently, slow gathering through
            The gleaming air, like webs that blow
            At autumn time across the blue
            In fleecy garlands white as snow
            And light as any feather, so
            The mist hung quivering, wreath on wreath;

            

            And gently, somewhere underneath,
            The river murmured low.
          
          
            So spectral, yet so strangely fair,
            All nature softly swept from sight,
            Till soon there only lingered there
            The earth's eidolon, still and white
            Whence ever, through that shrouding air,
            Dissolving in the breathless night,
            Fine forces mounted, spirit-wise;
            In shining wraiths I saw them pass,
            And essences of trees and grass
            Rise soul-like to the skies.
          
        

        

          OCTOBER SONG
          
            THE locust trees are hung with pods
            Of glossy russet-brown,
            And tawny leaves of sycamores
            Are swiftly drifting down.
          
          
            Their purple clusters, over-ripe,
            The trailing wild-grapes show;
            And frost-tipped woodbine clambers up
            From scarlet depths below.
          
          
            Still clinging to the clover stalks
            Are blossoms, white and sweet

            

            And pricked in tufted rows, the fields
            Are green with winter wheat.
          
          
            On furrowed mold, where grew the corn,
            Pale, golden stubble stands;
            And lingering blackbirds pipe and trill
            Through swampy meadow-lands.
          
          
            Far, far above, within the blue,
            Half hid in lofty flight,
            A hawk sails slow, and sunward turns
            A breast of shining white.
          
          
            The air is full of milkweed films,
            And floating thistle floss;
            And busily the spiders spin
            Their silver nets across
          
          
            The red-oak's tangled undergrowth
            Of lacing boughs, and string
            The yellow lindens, that the winds
            Are rudely pillaging.
          
          
            And where the ruddy maples blaze
            Athwart the gusty air,
            It lifts their leaves like little flames,
            And puffs them everywhere.
          

          

          
            But what if, loosed with fitful touch,
            The woodland doffs its gown;
            What if the fallow hillside grass
            Grows slowly crisp and brown!
          
          
            What matter that the truant sun
            Slips southward, day by day,
            And that, hard by, the winter waits
            To hood the skies in gray!
          
          
            I'll find but deeper joy in this,
            The autumn's pageantry;
            And sumac boughs are brighter far
            Than dark forebodings be.
          
        
        

          CONSCIENCE
          
            AH, God! Ah, God! if we but knew
            What hosts of haunting griefs we stir,
            What sorrowing spectres will pursue
            The least ungentle acts we do,
            I think we would be patienter!
          
          
            O throbbing heart and conscience, cease!
            Be still, be still, and give me peace!
          
          
            How could I guess, how could I know
            That from such blighting words would grow

            

            Thought-harvests that could trouble so?
            That in my heart sharp-bladed wrath
            Would reap such bitter aftermath?
          
          
            Had I not borne, and borne, and borne?
            Was not my spirit overworn
            With ceaseless striving to repress?
            Should blame fall if for one brief space
            Swift scorn gained place?
            Must burdened wrong seek no redress?
            --Yet, oh, all arguments how vain!
            The grief remains not any less.
            I only know the tears like rain
            Storm from my eyes! and I would fain
            Endure again
            The hurt, the heartache, and the pain!
            Oh, rather all that old distress
            Than this most keen remorsefulness!
          
        
        

          EVENING DOWN THE "LONG DRIFT "

          
            BLUE as the forest far and dim
            Upon the vague horizon's rim,
            As softly shadowed as the green
            Rush-tasselled marshlands in between,
            Rose-tinctured as the light that lies

            

            Within the tender evening skies,
            As golden as the afterglow
            That quivers up the west, and so
            As many colored as the tones
            That chase through changeful opal stones,
            The river ripples by,
            And I
            Am floating into fairyland.
          
          
            On either hand
            The pale, green-wanded willows stand
            In feathery tufts whose shadows hide
            Haunts where the shy wild-birds abide
            And through the reeds
            The lush rose-mallow bushes lean,
            Where screened by burgeoned button-balls,
            And tall wild-rice, the bittern feeds,
            And, clasped in clinging water-weeds,
            White folded lily buds are seen,
            And spikes of blazing cardinals,
          
          
            That like inverted torches show
            And burn and glow
            Down deep transparent pools and swirls,
            Where soft as silk the river-moss
            Spins slender threads of filmy floss
            Strung thick with little lucent seeds,

            

            While in and out and close across
            The fragile plantain-flower unfurls,
            And, thrusting through the dripping reeds,
            Star-worts, like tiny divers, toss
            Their hoards of blossom pearls.
          
          
            Through dimpling deeps and eddy whirls,
            Far, far below,
            With fitful motion, swift and slow,
            The shining fishes come and go;
            And all the limpid pools unfold
            Rare treasures shrined in sands of gold;
            For so
            While down the sheer clear stream I gaze,
            The tempered evening light betrays
            Sweet secrets, that the dazzling days
            With their bewildering fire and glow,
            And over-wealth of sun, withhold.
          
          
            --Ah, gently, gently, gently blow,
            Sweet winds of heaven now! for slow
            Upfloating from the dewy mold,
            The mist is rolled!
            O lightly, most divinely breathe,
            While yonder airy vapors sheathe
            The grassy marshes till they grow
            Too faint for any eye to know

            

            And see! like tissue veils that hold
            Fantastic river-genii bold,
            They rise, and rise, and twine and wreathe,
            And all the crystal stream enfold.
          
          
            On, on through wonderland I go,
            And hear the silvery ebb and flow,
            And chiming cadence, soft and low,
            Of tiny tinkling waves that creep
            Like thousand little liquid flutes
            Among the twisted maple-roots;
            While from the forest, still and deep,
            The night-owl calls,
            And distant wandering west-winds sweep
            With murmurous melody that falls
            As faintly as a song of sleep,
            With drowsy, dreamful intervals.
          
          
            To some enchanted tune
            They croon
            Sweet lullabies
            While deeper, ever deeper grows
            The violet tinge upon the rose
            Within the water-skies;
            Where rays of pearl and purple gleam
            From spangling scallop-shells, till soon
            Confusedly through all the stream

            

            The stars are strewn;
            And meshed in mocking greenery
            Of oak, and ash, and willow-tree,
            And trailing tangled grass, I see
            The little crescent moon.
          
          
            --Oh, keen-felt joy and strange distress
            Of nature's perfect graciousness!
            I feel your sweetly poignant smart
            Within my heart,
            Till, wrought by beauty's sheer excess,
            Quick teardrops start beyond restraint,
            And all my very soul grows faint
            With loveliness.
          
        
        

          BAFFLED
          
            AH! would that I that baffling touch might
              know,
            That oftentimes, as on a sounding-board,
            Strikes in my soul a strange elusive chord;
            That, grieving me with unremembered woe,
            Yet hints as surely of some long ago
            Glad life and joy, in lavish wealth outpoured,
            Till all my waking memory beats accord,
            And throbs and strives to grasp and prove it so.
          

          

          
            But ere its eager message I may learn,
            It sinks back fettered, with a nameless pain;
            Yet evermore I know it must return
            With sense of truth that battles to be plain;
            And in this subtile consciousness I yearn
            For that full knowledge which I seek in vain.
          
        

        

          EARTH VOICES
          
            O NOT alone in human hearts that throb,
            Do grief and joy find voice;
            For, even so, the fields and forests sob,
            And, even so, rejoice.
          
          
            There is no certain, separating line
            That wisest men may trace;
            Where sentience ceases no one may divine,
            Nor fix its bound or place.
          
          
            For he who humbly, reverently bends
            To them the harkening ear,
            From trees and grasses straightway comprehends
            Heart-tidings sweet and clear.
          

          

          
            The earth confides, as from a million lips,
            Its gladness and distress;
            With everything he finds true fellowships,
            And kindred consciousness.
          
          
            And knows that through the green leaves overhead,
            And through the silent clod,
            Through man and nature runs one golden thread
            That binds them both to God.
          
        
        

          A LITTLE CASCADE
          
            THE shining water slipped and slipped
            Adown the mossy rocks, and dripped
            From off fine fringing ferns in drops
            Of endless threaded pearls, that tipped
            The tasselled sedge and alder tops
            With flickering light; and then it sipped
            A drowsy draught of sun, and dipped
            Beneath small, clustering buds, and hid
            Among lush marigolds, and slid
            Between tall, serried ranks of reeds,
            And stroked their little leaves, and lipped
            The flower-spangled jewel-weeds;
            Then, speeding suddenly amid

            

            Faint shimmering spray, it lightly tripped
            Across white pebbly sand, and stripped
            The marsh-flower's gold, and fled, half-seen,
            A splash of silver through the green.
          
        

        

          PERSISTENT
          
            A LITTLE picture haunts me;
            It comes and comes again
            It is a tiny bird's nest,
            All ragged from the rain.
          
          
            It clings within a birch-tree
            Upon the moorland's edge,
            Between the barren branches,
            Above the swaying sedge.
          
          
            The sky is gray behind it,
            And when the north winds blow,
            The birch-tree bends and shivers,
            And tosses to and fro.
          
          
            I wonder, does it haunt them,
            The birds that flew away?
            And will they come to seek it,
            Some sunny summer day?
          

          

          
            I wonder, does some redbreast
            Upon an orange bough,
            Still picture it as plainly
            As I can view it now?
          
          
            Ah, me! I would forget it,
            Yet still, with sense of pain,
            I see this little bird's nest
            Within the driving rain.
          
        

        

          FLOOD-TIME ON THE MARSHES
          
            DEAR marshes, by no hand of man
            Laboriously sown,
            My river clasps you in its arms
            And claims you for its own!
            It laughs, and laughs, and twinkles on
            Across the reedy soil,
            That heed of harvest vexes not,
            Nor need of any toil.
          
          
            And in my heart I joy to know
            That safe within this spot
            Sweet nature reigns; let other fields
            Bear bread, it matters not.
            --What matters aught of anything
            When one may drift away

            

            Into the realms of all-delight,
            As I drift on to-day?
          
          
            Beneath the budded swamp-rose sprays
            The blue-eyed grasses stand,
            Submerged within a crystal world,
            A limpid wonderland;
            And where the clustered sedges show
            Their silky-tasselled sheaves,
            The slender arrow-lily lifts
            Its quiver of green leaves.
          
          
            The tiny waves lap softly past,
            So musical and round,
            I think they must be molded out
            Of sunshine and sweet sound.
            And here and there some little knoll,
            More lofty than the rest,
            Stands out above the happy tide,
            An island of the blest;
          
          
            Where fringed with lacy fronds of fern
            The grass grows rich and high,
            And flowering spider-worts have caught
            The color of the sky;
            Where water-oaks are thickly strung
            With green and golden balls,

            

            And from tall tilting iris tips
            The wild canary calls.
          
          
            --0 gracious world! I seem to feel
            A kinship with the trees;
            I am first-cousin to the marsh,
            A sister to the breeze!
            My heartstrings tremble to its touch,
            In throbs supremely sweet,
            And through my pulses light and life
            And love divinely meet.
          
          
            Far off, the sunbeams smite the woods,
            And pearly fleeces sail
            Athwart the light, and leave below
            A purple-shadowed trail;
            The essence of the perfect June
            So subtly is distilled,
            Until my very soul of souls
            Is filled, and overfilled!
          
        

        

          JULY
          
            STILL lingering along the lanes
            A few late elder-blossoms blow,
            And here and there a wild-rose, though
            Within their veins


            


            The crimson currents fainter grow,
            The pilgrim south-wind slowly drains
            Their fragile chalices, and slow
            The butterflies forsake the fanes
            Found fair a little while ago.
            Through all the fields, in orange stains
            The flaming milkweeds burn and glow
            Like blazing beacon-fires to show
            July beleaguers June; and low
            O'erborne, her bloomy banner wanes,
            The while he gains
            Her last sweet citadel, --and so,
            Supreme in conquering splendor reigns!
          
        

        

          AUTUMN COBWEBS
          
            THE grass is veiled with cobwebs,
            Their slender silken strands
            Are looped about the lilacs;
            And on the fallow lands
            The seeded weeds and brambles
            With shining skeins are bound,
            And scarlet dogwood branches
            Are wound and interwound.
          
          
            They wrap the thorny hedges,
            And shimmer in between

            

            The fruited elder thickets
            With faint elusive sheen
            They hang across the wheat blades,
            And in the mellow light
            So fill the fields with splendor
            As gold or silver might.
          
          
            The orchard boughs are distaffs
            Wherefrom the wind and sun
            Seem reeling filmy flosses
            Of which white threads are spun
            They trail from yellow cornstalks
            And wayside thistles, too,
            And fleecy tufts are drifting
            Far up into the blue.
          
          
            And even as I watch them
            They brush across my lips,
            And float about my forehead
            And touch my finger-tips;
            It is as if the Autumn,
            In sheer excess of grace,
            Would fondle me and hold me
            In her divine embrace.
          
        

        


        

          THE OLD GARDEN, IN SEPTEMBER
          
            A MORNING-GLORY vine has bound
            The leaning gate half-open, so
            A ragged row
            Of vagrant poppy plants have found
            The grassy path beyond its bar,
            And, capped in crumpled scarlet, go
            A bold
            Bright throng of truants, trooping far
            Adown the wayside's mossy mold,
            And fallow ground,
            That bits of bloom have bossed and scrolled
            In lavish limning wide around,
            And tufts of hardy fennel-star
            Have pricked and spangled white and gold.
          
          
            And high above the paling fence,
            And thrusting softly in between,
            The sweet-syringa bushes lean,
            A mass of checkered shadows, whence,
            With fluttering glints of silver sheen,
            Half-hid, half-seen,
            From curving canopies of green
            Close-lapping leaves and thickets dense,
            White butterflies drift down and bring
            The hint of spring,

            

            And mock the May-time's opulence
            And pride of pearly blossoming.
          
          
            Red coral beads already string
            The unpruned sprays
            A score of briar-roses fling
            And trail across the tangled maze
            Of sunshine, shadow, winding ways,
            And pebbly paths where, fine as down,
            Soft new grass shows,
            That grows
            From seeds the sower South-wind blows
            Off unmown tassels, high and brown.
          
          
            And since afar the summer goes,
            And lilies wane
            And fade and follow in her train,
            And, lapsed through lessened line, the last
            Long glory of the roses' reign
            Is overpast,
            Within the garden's kingdom close
            The year bestows
            A color coronet, that lies
            Upon the marigolds, and vies
            In richness with the regal guise
            Of starry crest and purple stain

            

            The first unfolding aster shows;
            That proud and princely suzerain
            Of quaint beds edged with crimson phlox,
            And four o'clocks,
            And files of fluted pinks, and rows
            Of great tall tilting hollyhocks.
          
          
            The pear-tree leaves are bronze and red;
            And overhead,
            Beyond the thick-set barberry hedge,
            Beneath the vane-tipped gable peak,
            A yellow streak
            Of burnished sunshine gilds the edge
            And drips its amber lacquer through
            The lichens of a little ledge
            Where, verging sharply into view
            Against the small
            Deep-shadowed squares that pierce the wall,
            A pair of pigeons preen and coo;
            They turn, and toss, and softly call,
            Then poised with fanning wings outspread,
            With many a sidewise dip and glance,
            And look askance,
            At last, launched boldly into flight,
            Speed straight ahead--

            

            Athwart the blue, a pulsing, bright,
            Swift throb of white.
          
          
            And loosed and sprinkled as they pass,
            Upon the grass
            In gusty storms the red leaves fall
            And here and there the way is tinged
            With late-sprung dandelions, and fringed
            With hoary dusty-miller leaves,
            And spicy gilly-flowers, and sheaves
            Of ribbon-grasses, stiff and tall;
            While surging softly over all,
            The sweet September weather creeps
            Along the paths in sparkling streams,
            And where its happy high-tide sweeps
            In mellow deeps
            Of warmth, and light, and limpid beams,
            A lazy kitten basks and sleeps.
          
          
            And close beside, bright dahlias rear
            Along the walks
            A horde of nodding tops, and peer
            Between the leaning sunflower stalks:
            Those veterans of the early year,
            That smitten now with age, and sear
            In tattered garb of tawny hue,

            

            Stand feebly swaying through the weeds,
            Whereon, in scattered showers, they strew
            Thin sifted seeds
            From out the darkened disks they hold,
            And, shorn and rayless, idly swing,
            Nor longer sunward, as of old,
            Lift up in loyal worshiping;
            --But pause a space! for, by and by,
            From out the blue
            Far reaches of the autumn sky,
            With buoyant speed and eager wing,
            A feathered flock comes wheeling down,
            So circling in a rapid ring
            Till all at once, on every brown
            And withered head, with grace untold,
            In yellow fringe the finches cling,
            A halo light, a living crown,
            A very aureole of gold,
            Transmuting and transfiguring!
          
          
            Through plumy grass the crickets whir;
            And ever, wavering in the breeze,
            Between the low-boughed pippin trees,
            In lacy films fine cobwebs stir,
            And swing, half-seen, their broideries
            Till suddenly some shaft of light

            

            Strikes out a single silver line
            To shine
            An instant, and then intertwine,
            And fade,
            And merge in dusky strands of shade,
            The overhanging branches braid;
            So
            To and fro,
            Now bright,
            Now quite
            Slipped out of sight;
            Then presently a woven blur
            Of swaying, silken gossamer.
          
          
            --Ah, tempered sky, and bloomy things,
            And scent, and song, and wafting wings,
            All sweetest syllables were vain
            To render plain
            The garden's dreamy whisperings!
            The tender beauty of the spot,
            The nameless spell, --I know not what,
            Nor have I skill in any way
            To so convey
            Those gracious secrets I would fain
            Find art to say!
            But in the sunshine, watching these

            

            Slight threads that loop the apple-trees,
            So, too, I weave this web of song,
            Whose tissue, touched by fancy's long
            Bright
            Wand of light,
            Is but the half-caught fitful sheen
            Through that unseen
            Close warp of love, forever bound
            And interwound,
            As fine as floss, yet strong as steel;
            Whereof I feel
            Not any years that intervene,
            Nor any stress of space, may part
            Its golden ties, that lie between
            This old-time garden and my heart.
          
        

        

          PRESENTIMENT
          
            OFTTIMES I feel, yet know not why,
            This haunting prescience stir in me:
            I know that when I come to die
            --It matters not where that may be,
            --Or near or far, on land or sea,
            An overpowering wish to lie
            Beneath the roof I loved so well,
            In that dear shelter wherein we,
            In life's sweet April, used to dwell,

            

            Where first my baby lips drew breath,
            Oh, in the bitterness of death
            This wish will bring fresh agony!
            That hearth where now no fires are lit,
            My heart will break desiring it.
          
        

        

          THE EXILES
          
            BARE blackened boughs
            That seem to press
            Low skies, storm-swept and pitiless,
            Must be the only roofs to house
            Or shelter their distress.
          
          
            They tread by night
            Beneath the trees;
            Before them desert distances,
            Whereon the endless snows are white,
            And endless tempests freeze.
          
          
            Their eyes are bound,
            And iron bands
            Are heavy on their helpless hands
            Ordained to delve the barren ground
            Of bleak, unlovely lands.
          
          
            Week after week,
            Across the snow

            

            And weary wastes, they wander so;
            No human heart wherein to seek
            Surcease of any woe.
          
          
            Forevermore
            Their footsteps wend
            Afar from hearth, and home, and friend
            Nor know they what grief hath in store
            Before the bitter end.
          
          
            Whate'er their deeds,
            It matters not;
            Their very names shall be forgot
            Their agony, their heartsick needs,
            And their forsaken lot.
          
        


        

          IN MID-OCTOBER
          
            THE dewy morning sky is pale
            Where, steeped in dazzling light,
            The southward-slipping sunbeams veil
            Its pearly depths from sight.
          
          
            But in the north, more pure and deep
            Than ever summer knew,
            The sweet October heavens keep
            Their rich autumnal blue.
          
          
          
            The little clouds float out so clear,
            Slow shredding in the breeze,
            I think none ever strayed so near
            These lofty forest trees.
          
          
            Along the smoky river's edge
            Green marsh-moss thickly grows,
            And smart-weeds glisten in the sedge
            Like coral, white and rose.
          
          
            And ruby-bodied dragon-flies
            In shining clusters pause,
            Or dart and sparkle, jewel-wise,
            On wings of silver gauze,
          
          
            Where tangled water-plants and grass
            Come drifting round the reeds,
            To find fresh cargoes, as they pass,
            Of shells and scarlet seeds.
          
          
            Adown the current, through the moss,
            The yellow willows show
            Like golden arras hung across
            The water-world below.
          
          
            Yet still the birch and maple trees
            Have barely felt the frost,

            

            Nor hint of happy harmonies
            The blackbird notes have lost.
          
          
            And pink wild-roses, here and there,
            Are blossoming anew,
            While through the prairies everywhere
            The violets are blue.
          
          
            It is as if the aging year
            A second time has found
            Its childhood, whose first playthings here
            Lie scattered on the ground.
          
          
            And with such rarest vernal spell
            It touches everything,
            Till tinctured, too, I scarce can tell
            If this be fall or spring!
          
          
            For if the April airs were sweet,
            These are not any less;
            Nor was the May-time more replete
            With perfect blessedness.
          
        

        




        

          PRESENT JOY
          
            O HEART, beat swiftly! that there may
            No least allotted part
            Of happiness elude thee; nay,
            Seize quickly that thou canst, nor stay
            Too long in quest of greater, when
            The spring so surely wears away,
            The summer skies grow cold and gray,
            And chill night cometh after day,
            --Beat swifter, then,
            O heart!
          
          
            For since fleet sorrow still pursues,
            All gladness to destroy;
            Since wintry winds wait but to bruise
            And break the foolish flower whose
            Bright-petaled buds too late unfold;
            Oh! therefore no faint ray refuse
            Of warmth or light, but rather choose
            Each gleam to cherish, lest thou lose
            Thy little hold
            Of joy.
          
          
            And if it so be given thee
            In anywise to taste
            The brimming crystal purity

            

            Of life's deep springs, not listlessly
            Let their clear stream go by, but speed
            To sip its sweets while sweet they be
            For slipping on they seek the sea,
            The years roll past, and presently
            There is no need
            To haste.
          
        

        

          NOVEMBER MORNING
          
            ATINGLING, misty marvel
            Blew hither in the night,
            And now the little peach-trees
            Are clasped in frozen light.
          
          
            On linden tips and maples
            An icy film is caught,
            With shining threads of cobwebs
            In pearly patterns wrought.
          
          
            The autumn sun, in wonder,
            Is gayly peering through
            This crystal-tissued network
            Across the frosty blue.
          
          
            The weather-vane shows silver
            Above the mossy leads 

            

            That glitter, brightly ice-glazed,
            In rare transparent reds.
          
          
            And round the eaves are fringes
            Wherein the seven hues,
            That bar the summer rainbows,
            Congeal and interfuse.
          
          
            Upon the walks the pebbles
            Are each a precious stone;
            The grass is tasselled hoar-frost,
            The clover jewel-sown.
          
          
            Such sparkle, sparkle, sparkle,
            In earth and sky and air,
            Oh! can it be that darkness
            Is ever anywhere?
          
        


        

          CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE CATHEDRAL
          
            A THOUSAND tapers make the midnight bright,
            And blaze about the carved cathedral choir,
            And touch the marble angels' wings with fire,

            

            And fill their faces with a golden light;
            So fair they are, in folded robes of white,
            It almost seems those parted lips suspire,
            Divinely yearning for the heart's desire,
            The marvel that shall glorify the night.
          
          
            Then, all at once, from out the ancient tower,
            The bells peal forth! and swelling over them
            The grand Te Deum magnifies the power
            Of Him the holy, born in Bethlehem;
            --0 dearest Child! no gifts nor incense sweet,
            But my full heart, I offer at Thy feet.
          
        
        

          CHRISTMAS CHANT ROYAL TO THE KING OF KINGS
          
            WHAT God hath wrought, long centuries
              ago,
            What man hath cherished in divinest lore,
            Chant, richly chant! In stately chords and slow,
            Intone the marvel done this day of yore.
            Sing of the star that burned so strangely bright,

            

            Of angel voices heard that hallowed night,
            When all the folding heavens, east and west,
            Betrayed the coming of earth's gracious Guest,
            And, steeped in prescient joyfulness, all things
            Did glorify a little Babe's behest.
            All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
          
          
            Yea! sing how though unto the Child did go
            The wizard ones, to worship and adore,
            And lowly bending at His feet bestow
            The gold, and myrrh, and frankincense they bore;
            How though high heaven, in starry splendor dight,
            Did homage to the promised Prince of light,
            Nathless, below, men idly slept, nor guessed
            The priceless gift of great Messiah blest
            Nor star, nor song, nor shining angel-wings
            That lordly presence anywise confessed!
            All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
          
          
            For so God chose from out a manger low
            The Light divine of all the world to pour


            


            And so He willed His own dear Son should go
            In mortal guise from out that stable door;
            Yet did He gird Him with such matchless might
            'Gainst death, and wrong, and evilness to smite,
            That for all souls by sieging sins opprest,
            He made the certain citadel of rest.
            What need, indeed, of earthly blazonings,
            Of pomp, of purple, or of regal crest?
            All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
          
          
            The Nazarene, reviled, acquaint with woe,
            Who all our mortal garb of sorrow wore;
            Who meekly proved how that He loved us so,
            Nor shame, nor scorn, nor grievous death forbore;
            The risen Monarch, from before whose sight
            All powers of evil flee in sore affright;
            The piteous Lord, whose all-forgiving breast
            Hath boundless bounty both for worst and best;
            The God majestic, whence, eternal, springs
            All glory, grace, and light ineffablest.
            All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
          

          

          
            Aye! though the years to olden cycles grow,
            Yet still, with newborn gladness, o'er and o'er
            Men learn the lesson of the Christ, and so
            Shall all the ages hence forevermore;
            Forevermore shall earth His praise recite,
            And sound His greatness unto heaven's height;
            Still sinful souls, by His great love caressed,
            Shall fain forego each God-forbidden quest,
            And seek the ceaseless shelter that He brings
            The hurt, the helpless, and the heart distressed.
            All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
          
          
            
              Envoy
              And so this day, though loosed in flurried flight
              The spangling snows enwrap the world in white,
              Let every hearth with holly-boughs be drest,
              This feast's fair honor freshly to attest;
              Let trolls be trolled, and every bell that rings
              With chiming cadence still the theme invest:
              All hail to Him, the holy King of kings!
            
          
        
        


        

          THE MARSH MIST
          
            THE sun slipped red behind the haze
            Of distant forest boughs, that raise
            In softened lines along the west,
            A leafy crest.
            The marshy prairie-land became
            A shining, many-colored maze;
            A tracery of gold and flame;
            An airy blaze
            Of rosy radiance without name!
            Of ruddy fire that crept,
            And swept,
            Through all the lacing water-ways.
          
          
            --Then, by-and-by,
            Beyond the rushes, lush and high,
            The June sunset grew overpast,
            The little limpid pools, that lie
            Among the sedges, faintly glassed
            The last
            Pale afterglow, whose yellow rays
            Flared up the dusky, western sky.
          

          

          
            In tangled lines of silver sheen
            The long grass leant;
            And breeze-tossed birches swayed and bent
            Above tall weeds and reeds, and green
            Wild rice and mosses, where, half-seen,
            Red lilies glowed, and, idly spent,
            The wandering night-wind lightly went.
          
          
            Sharp-cut against the eastern blue,
            The deep green forest deeper grew
            The leaves stirred, for a little space
            Then full and near,
            Within the tender violet skies,
            The moon rode up in gracious guise;
            And drifting darkly, level-wise,
            With wings outspread in lazy grace,
            Across her face,
            A wild crane voyaged slowly through
            The clear,
            Sweet depths of dewy atmosphere.
          
          
            So fell the night; hushed, slumber-bound;
            Not any sound
            In all that wilderness was made;
            Nor did a single bird invade
            The utter silence, wide and deep,
            Therein the lowland lay asleep.
          

          

          
            Between the faintly spangling stars,
            In silver bars,
            The mellow moonlight beamed and streamed;
            And then--divinely visible--it seemed
            The marshes dreamed!
            In vaporous wreaths and films unwound
            Above the ground,
            A strange white vision floated round!
          
          
            The grass grew hoary; every blade
            Was rich with rime, that overlaid,
            In drifts of misty flakes, the frets
            Of countless, quivering spider-nets;
            While mocking, frosty filagrees
            Wrapped all the trees;
            The reeds took on a sudden chill;
            An icy fringe began to freeze
            Upon the tasselled sedge; --until,
            Dissolving slow, with dreamful ease,
            That wintry phantasy had merged
            (But, ah, so subtly, silently!)
            To mimic waves, that swept and surged,
            Till all the marshes seemed to be
            A boundless sea,
            In whose vague depths long grasses trailed,
            Touched out by bright,
            Swift sparks of phosphorescent light,
            Where gleaming fire-flies flashed and paled.
          


          


          
            So, to and fro, with restless sweep,
            Borne back and forth by ceaseless swells,
            The tide rolled in; and here and there
            Laid bare,
            Within its tossing, billowy deep,
            The pink marsh-roses shone like shells.
          
          
            Through lingering change of lessened light,
            Within the west,
            The moon went waning out of sight;
            The little stars glowed half confessed
            Across the sedge the eastern gray
            Verged surely onward into day;
            The darkness hovered eerily;
            A chilling damp the air oppressed;
          
          
            --Then freshly, gently as may be,
            Sweet hints of dawning came to fill
            All things with hushed serenity.
            The misty surge grew calm and still;
            The marshes dreamed of perfect rest.
            --But suddenly
            A reed-bird piped within its nest!
            And borne with faint presaging thrill,
            From out the margin of the dim
            Horizon's rim,

            

            With cleaving motion from below,
            Some dawn-blown current's underflow
            Ran rippling through that airy sea;
            And, changed and channelled by such wide
            Disturbing tide,
            Impalpably it seemed to grow
            More fleecy white, to break and rift,
            And, fanned by viewless force, to lift,
            --And drift, --and drift, --
            To wander higher, --and more high,
            --And so,
            Within the sunny summer sky,
            A morning cloud began to blow.
          
        
        


        
          ENVOY
          
            IF I had lived among the mountain peaks,
            Through whose fine air
            And purest ether, crystalline and rare,
            The voice of nature most divinely speaks;
             Where far and free the winds of heaven blow,
            And from below
            Not any mist nor valley vapor mars
            The little stars
            If viewing all things from such lofty height,
            Might it not then been given me to know
            All things more truly, and through keener sight?
            And so,
            From off the mountains could I not have caught
            Some semblance of their majesty, and wrought
            More high and strong
            In song?

          
          
            Or had some fate decreed for me to dwell
            Beside the tide
            Of the great ocean, fathomless and wide,

            

            Whose mighty billows' ceaseless ebb and swell
            Tell ever of that grand sublimity
            Within the sea,
            Of storms that gather, and white gulls that cry
            From out the sky;
            If listening daily to the surges break
            Along the shining sand, tumultuously,
            Might not some echo of their voice awake
            In me?
            Might not my song some subtler essence win,
            And would not something, like the sea, therein
            More deep and clear
            Appear?
          
          
            --And yet I know not were it loss or gain
            Away from these
            My native hills, and stream and forest trees,
            And level fields of richly-growing grain:
            I cannot tell if they my song have filled,
            Or something stilled,
            Nor all that I have lacked, or they have lent
            But am content,

            

            Nay, more, thrice happy, if it be that they
            So bid me sing that any pulse is thrilled
            With hint of lightest summer wind, whose play
            Has spilled
            The honey from the least sweet wild-rose vine
            Or if, faint echoing up from any line,
            Some meadow bird
            Is heard.
