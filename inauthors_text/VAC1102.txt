OLE AGE AN' USEFULNESS
	


Uncle Ez Pash's return t' active employment
after havin' retired some years
ago at th' age o' eighty-seven, has been.


	
	


th' sole topic at th' blacksmith shop fer
several days an' many facts have been
brought t' light that completely rout th'



	
pop'lar theory that a feller's usefulness
ends at eighty-five.
"Why, Cato took up Greek an' learned
it at eighty; Goethe wuz eighty when he
put th' finishin' touches on Faust; Sophocles
wrote Oedipus at four-score an'
Theophrastus wuz ninety before he became
pop'lar as a writer," said Prof.
Alex Tansey.
"I don't know nothin' about th' fellers
you're talkin' about, but I do know that
Niles Turner's brother, Rodney, mastered
th' first high wheel bicycle at eighty-one,
an' fer many years thereafter he wuz a
familiar figure in th' sportin' circles o'
this town," said Tell Binkley.
"We find lots o' instances in our medical
researches which show that a great
many famous characters o' th' past did
not reach th' zenith o' ther fame until
after they'd safely tided over th' checker
age," declared Dr. Mopps. "Rev. Wiley


	
Tanger's case is one that proves my
point. Although he is still alert an'
preachin' regularly, it wuz not until he'd
won th' tri-county checker championship
at seventy-eight that he mastered theology
an' became eminent as a devine.
People are different. Some retire at
twenty. Ther is no rule fer retirin'.
It depends on th' feller. Some people
never begin t' work at all. Tilford Moots
quit plowin' fifteen years ago an' only
recently returned t' th' plow in order
t' release his wife fer war work. Gran'maw
Pash's brother, Bat, wuz a skilled
umbreller mender an' died in th' fairgrounds
at Frankfort in th' winter o'
seventy-eight at th' age o' eighty-one.
He'd been a great pool player up t' his
seventieth year. Another case o' which
I have personal knowledge is that o'
Virgil Plum. He'd never had any real
occupation or callin'. At seventy-four,


	
long after his children had married an'
fled, he became interested in croquet
an' astonished th' countryside. He died
o' over exertion on th' floor of a dancin'
academy at th' age o' one hundred
an' three."

FORTY YEARS AGO
		
		
		
By Uncle Niles Turner
		
Th' whole family dressed around th'
kitchen stove in th' winter, one at a
time.
We all walked home t' dinner at noon.
A farmer didn' know what an' egg or
a load o' hay wuz worth till he got
t' town.
Nobuddy bought a book if anybuddy
in town had th' one he wanted.
A father supported his daughters till
they were grown.
Nothin' broke th' monotony o' summer
but a one-ring circus.
We called farmers country Jakes.

Bacon wuz th' chief diet o' th' poor an'
oppressed.
People wore patched shoes.
Nobuddy wuz afraid t' drink at th'
town pump.
We used t' borrow a cow t' mow th'
lawn.
Th' lettuce season opened June first.
New shoes squeaked.
Sody fountains closed in September.
We all wore soggy red flannel underwear.
Th' courthouse square wuz a wood
market.
Th' boys made money carryin' notes.
You could jedge a feller's financial
standin' by his hitchin' post.
Ther wuz a little child swingin' on
ever' front gate.



		
Butchers carried whips that cracked
like a gun an' drove ther cattle thro'
town.
We only cleaned up on Saturday
evenin'.
Nickel cigars had a pleasant odor.
Dudes sent ther collars t' th' nearest
big city t' be polished.
We pressed th' creases out o' ready
made pants.
Doctors an' lawyers wore plug hats,
often with sack coats.
Hair watch chains an' gold headed
canes were plentiful.
Tub oysters set on th' sidewalk by th'
hitchin' racks.
Dried apples were strung on a cord.
Kids chewed bees wax.
Th' railroads run excursions t' balloon
ascensions.
Ever' bay window wuz full o' geraniums.




Ever' well ordered home had a rockery.
We thought ever' train goin' west wuz
goin' t' Californy.
Th' dentists pulled your teeth if they
hurt.
Fruit trees looked out fer 'emselves.
Th' best actors that ever lived showed
fer twenty-five an' fifty cents.
We knew who wrote ever'thing in a
newspaper.
Nothin' but saloons an' meat shops
took ice.
A woman wouldn' climb in a buggy if
anybuddy wuz lookin'.
Ever' doctor carried a saw.
Croquet wuz th' steppin' stone t' th'
swellest girl in town.

TH' PSYCHOLOGY O' TH' UNIFORM

ketches a girl ever' time," said Prof. Clem
Harner, t'day, in commentin' on Ermie


	


Moots' engagement t' Link Gage, o'
Camp Taylor. "Ther' used t' be a fife
player in my band named Earl Plummer
that wuz married seven times. He wuzn'


	
much t' look at in citizen's clothes, but
jest as soon as he jumped int' one o' th'
bright, flashy Hussar uniforms our band
boys used t' wear, you could hear th'
hearts flutter. Ever' where we played
he won a heart. He met his first wife
at a Bryan meetin' an' married her before
th' speakin' wuz over. He met his other
wives at Seymour, Warsaw, Tulip, Milroy,
Edinburg an' Indynoplus, but they
all left him when he took his uniform off.
His last wife wuz a North Side belle at
Indynoplus, who's since eloped with a
messenger boy. Ever' feller in th' band
got married before we wuz organized
three weeks."
"Gals like brass buttons," said Uncle
Niles Turner. "Nate Cope, if you'll

years without a beau. Then he joined
th' Uniform Rank o' th' K. o' P., an' wuz
gobbled up like a hot cake."



		
"I've got a rich aunt that could have
married th' swellest feller in Evansville,
but she married a bell boy," said Lafe
Bud, "an' she wuz engaged t' two letter
carriers when she met him."
"Ther haint no accountin' fer a girl's
infatuation fer uniforms, an' it don't allus
make any difference what kind of a uniform
it is," said Pinky Kerr. "Velie
Newcomb's first husband wuz a circus,
roustbout an' they lived t'gether an hour
after they wuz married. He wuz rollin'
an elephant tub int' th' ring an' he looked
so fine an' manly in his brown uniform
trimmed in red that she sought him out
an' introduced herself an' a weddin'
shortly follered."
"I got a cousin that fell in love with a
conductor on her weddin' trip an' left
her husband before th' train got t'
Niagary Falls. Later she married th'
conductor an' lived with him almost a

 
	
week," said Dr. Mopps. "Finally she
wed a motorman, but th' marriage wuz
an unhappy one. Now she's engaged
t' an elevator man."
"My gran'mother goes with an usher
at a nickel the-ater an' we're so afraid
she'll marry him," said Tell Binkley.
"Well, th' men folks are as bad as th'
women when it comes t' uniforms," said
.Miss Fawn Lippincut. "If us girls wuz

nothin' o' bigamists?"

A LETTER FROM TH' FRONT
		
		

Mrs. Min Nugent, cook o' th' New
Palace hotel, has received th' follerin'
interestin' letter from her son Stew, who
is somewhere in France with th' American
expeditionary forces:
		
	


					

			

	
DEAR MAW:
	

	
Well, here I am. I hope you are well.
We had some trip comin' over. Cigarettes
galore. A piece of shrapnel jest
now broke th' last pane o' glass in my
window as I write. I have enough terbacker
t' last a week. Unless some has
been sent since I left I'll probably be
without some days before some comes.
I'm billeted on th' parlor floor of an ole
historic chateau with a mantel piece that
goes back t' th' renaissance. My shoes
are dryin' on th' mantle. Cigarettes
should be mailed at intervals o' two days
apart t' assure a steady, unbroken flow.



		
Eatin' t'backer, too, only cigarettes is
th' most important. . . . I'm
writin' now with a pencil as a piece o'
flyin' shrapnel jest busted my fountain


	
Stew Nugent, A. E. F.
	

		
pen th' sheriff give me when I enlisted.
Tell him I'm out o' fountain pens agin,




but would rather have cigarettes. It's
wonderful how indifferent you git t'
danger over here. I'm not spendin' any
o' my pay as I want t' loaf a couple o'
years when I git home, so any cigarettes
or t'backer you send me is jest that much
saved. I wouldn' give much fer this
historic chateau after th' shrapnel gits
thro' with it.  .  .  . I'm finishin' this
letter this mornin' as a piece of shrapnel
put my candle out last night an' no
matches wuz t' be had. Th' French
people wuz certainly glad t' see me but
they have scarcely enough cigarettes fer
'emselves, an' are tired out an' poor after
fightin' so long, so I hate t' ask 'em fer
'em when friends kin send 'em t' me so
easily any time. It don't look right
t' take 'em from 'em an' I know you
would not want me t' do so. It's different
with eggs, which are plentiful. I
can't talk any French an' I can't tell what



	
ther sayin, but I wouldn' ask 'em fer
cigarettes, an' you wouldn' either if you
could see what they've been up against.
Are there any cigarette clubs at home?
Some o' the boys say ther's clubs in ther
towns that gather money with which t'
buy them an' send them t' them. Girls
send them th' same as socks, an' believe
me, th' boys are glad t' git 'em. I hope
you are well an' strong an' able t' work
fer many years t' come. You should be
glad you've got a good, easy cookin' job
when you think o' th' poor ole women
over here plowin'. Ther haint nothin' in
loafin'. I'm goin' t' work some when I
git back. I'm goin' over t' th' mantle
an' git my shoes as soon as th' shellin'
lets up a little. Mark your packages
care A. E. F. You cant carry a pipe
over here very handy. Shrapnel knocks
'em out o' your mouth. You bet I've
got my three cigarette cases distributed



		
where they'll stop th' most shrapnel. It
don't look like I'd ever git my shoes as
ther's a constant hail o' shrapnel. Don't
worry about me.
	
		
Your lovin' son,
STEW.
	

	
A. E. F. France.
(Put this on all cigarette packages
sure.)
