                    Whitcomb Riley. Perhaps fifty feet away in the same section there is another monument, equally
                    impressive, for Benjamin Harrison. Between these two there is a small flat tombstone, almost
                    unnoticed, for May Wright Sewall. Writing at the turn of the century, Booth Tarkington noted that
                    "in company with General Harrison and Mr. Riley, May Wright Sewall would necessarily have
                    been chosen … as one of the ‘three most prominent citizens of
                        Indiana.’"<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In light of subsequent treatment how strange
                    this assertion seems: most readers of Tarkington's statement today would wonder who May
                    Wright Sewall was.</p>
            <p>Sewall established a national and international reputation through several endeavors. She sought to
                    enlarge the role of women in Society, to mobilize women and get them to play a larger role in this
                    country and the world. She actively campaigned for a woman's right to an education equal to
                    that offered men. She sought the ballot for women, firmly believing that once educated and armed
                    with political rights women could stop war, clean up Society, and create a better world for
                    humankind. Not content with merely improving this world, Sewall also sought to conquer the ultimate
                    frontier. Two months before her death she revealed what had been a carefully concealed belief in
                    spiritualism. By 1920, Sewall's fame as a women's rights activist, peace advocate,
                    and spiritualist had <list type="footnotes">

                    degree of Mistress of Science, becoming one of the first women graduates in America outside Oberlin.
                    In 1871, Wright was awarded the Master of Arts degree.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    shared his wife's commitment to reform, and it was during her marriage to him that she
                    undertook her most ardent work for educational advancement for women as well as her work in the
                    suffrage movement. The couple turned their home, known as Sewall House, into a virtual salon in the
                    European sense, with many notables included on their guest lists.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    this argument Sewall responded: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To make it the object of one's life to please another person is to forget God, to
                            quench conscience, to lose sight of the personal ideal; it is to nurture deceit in
                            one's self and vanity in that other; it is an object of life as belittling to the
                            one who demands it as to the one who pursues it.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Self-fulfillment for women in the 1880s, however, was no simple matter, as the nature of
                    opportunities in higher education illustrated. Considering the feeble beginnings of what may be
                    called the "higher education movement" for women, consisting of boarding schools,
                    female seminaries, coeducational academies, and female colleges, women by the 1880s had made
                    considerable progress. Yet major barriers to higher education for women remained.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In an address presented to the International Council of Women in 1888, Sewall spoke of

                    Education in 1886. Most poignantly, she noted, only 35,976 women were enrolled in the 529 colleges
                    or universities admitting women, compared to the 802 institutions for men with a male enrollment of
                    78,185. Even including enrollees in normal schools, where in 1886 women outnumbered men 27,616 to
                    12,616, only 65 percent as many higher institutions were open to women as to men.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Sewall illustrated a further contrast between men's and women's
                    educational opportunities: "Communities and states, like individuals, express their
                    opinions in their investments." Investments in buildings and grounds for higher education
                    for men in 1886 were $62,356,638, compared to $9,635,282 for women's
                    facilities. In addition, Sewall protested that there were no state appropriations for the support of
                    women's colleges while state appropriations of $1,690,275 were made for
                    men's colleges and universities.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sewall believed that the barriers placed in the path of women seeking higher education were based on
                    three theories. First, there were those arguments arising from the alleged limitations of a
                    woman's nature. Advocates of "natural womanhood" argued that it was
                    "fruitless cruelty to encourage women to undertake an education which they could not
                    achieve, inasmuch as their failure would make their mental limitations conspicuous, and thus add to
                    their disappointment bitter mortification." Even if a few exceptional women should
                    demonstrate their possession of the mental capacity to do college-level work, their feeble bodies
                    would "sink under the severe application to abstruse subjects, and the result of such
                    efforts would be (to quote the awful phrase of one who signed himself ‘A Worshiper of
                    Womanhood’) hospitals and asylums filled with highly educated female wrecks."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking the same argument further, Sewall explained that those who advocated this position asserted
                    that even should a few women prove their ability to acquire a higher education, these acquirements
                    would "impair feminine grace, dull feminine sensibilities and destroy domestic tastes,
                    thereby unfitting women for the conjugal and maternal relations in which Heaven had appointed that
                    they should find their chief happiness."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-078-4-013"/> In her newspaper column, Sewall frequently attacked this
                    argument. By the 1880s, she knew that facts revealed the absurdity of such a position: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>in the long ago every claim of women for a share in higher labors and their rewards was met
                            by the assertion that woman's delicate physical organism would not permit it. Short
                            dresses, loose waists and thick shoes, with an increased degree of exercise corresponding to
                            the reform in clothing cancelled this objection; investigation disclosed the fact that the
                            average length of woman's life is greater than man's. Opponents next
                            asserted that woman's mind could never compass the acquisitions and endure the
                            discipline which could alone fit her for man's equal partner in life's
                            duties. The ease with which women bore away prizes and honors as soon as they had collegiate
                            opportunity was an offset to that argument. Then sentimentality and lack of practical
                            faculty was next urged as an argument against their possible success in the world. The
                            steady increase of the women who can and do earn comfortable incomes awakened the fear that
                            women, after all, had too much practical sense—and they urged that professional
                            and business activity and pecuniary independence would harden women's heart and the
                            very source of the world's sweetest sympathies would be dried up.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Proponents of a second argument against women's education asserted that women were created
                    for men and that the education of females should serve the best interests of the male population.
                    Sewall quoted one advocate of this position: the "tenderness, affection, and chivalrous
                    regard with which women had inspired men had been the chief agencies in softening men's
                    rough nature." According to this proponent, when the educated woman became self-sufficient,
                    her independence of man could cause him to relapse into barbarism. In addition, the value of
                    men's college degrees would decrease if granted to women. The first institution that asked
                    authority to confer degrees upon women was refused on the grounds that if women were to wear titles
                    and degrees, it would "cheapen academic honors in the esteem of men and abate their
                    intellectual enthusiasm."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The final argument against women's education was, according to Sewall, the one most widely
                    accepted by women themselves: higher education for women would upset the status quo. Writing in
                    1883, Sewall asked, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Will the girl who reads Homer, who pores over Euclid … be attractive to young men
                            who are wife-seeking? Will the young woman who is trained as an architect, skilled as a
                            physician, or eloquent as a preacher—will she ever be satisfied to abandon these
                            labors for those of the nursery and kitchen?</p>

                    with whom Sewall discussed the issue of women's education.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Sewall these arguments implied a fixed conviction that marriage and the home had little intrinsic
                    value and were welcomed only by women to whom all other alternatives were closed. Sewall did not
                    place marriage and family in such a lowly position. In her opinion, fear that woman's
                    Social and domestic value would "depreciate according to her development, her self-respect
                    and her self-sufficiency [had] no place outside of indolent fancy."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    Sewall believed an education enhanced the prospects for a happy marriage. Education elevated
                    marriage from woman's sole pursuit and vocation to one of several options and thus made it
                    approximate more closely ideal marriage. Ideal marriage, according to Sewall, was "the
                    union of one man and one woman who being equally independent, [were] equally and reciprocally
                        dependent."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to better marriages, better hygienic and sanitary conditions in nurseries and kitchens
                    would result from women's education. However, Sewall believed that none of these positive
                    arguments for an education should have been necessary because an education was a noble end in
                    itself. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Remembering that an education, if genuine, frees one's powers and liberalizes
                            one's spirit, one must regard this intellectual liberty, which is its fruit, as a
                            sufficient reason for desiring it, especially in the case of women. As a class, women are so
                            trammeled by precedent, prejudice, fashion, Social conventions, and narrow experience; as a
                            class they are so encased in their own emotional environment, that intellectual liberty, is
                            perhaps their only certain path to intelligent free-will.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sewall did more than simply philosophize on the question of women's education. She put her
                    ideas into practice at the Girls' Classical School in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which she operated with her husband from 1882 until his death in 1895 and alone until

                    pattern for a girls' school, with stress on the Social graces, but instead be the same as

                    of study was based on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> examinations for women, which also covered the requirements for admission to Smith,
                    Vassar, Wellesley, and other colleges. Music, painting, drawing, and "similar
                    branches" were <hi rend="i">riot</hi> taught in the school, but special attention was paid
                    to "physical training."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> According to Thomas Woody, the noted
                    historian of women's education, physical training was not taught in women's
                    colleges until the latter part of the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Sewall's
                    inclusion of this course in the Girls' Classical School curriculum was not only
                    controversial but also was closely related to the issue of women's dress reform.</p>
            <p>Within two months of the school's opening, Sewall requested that parents consider the
                    adoption of a "simple school dress" consisting of a kilt skirt and loose waist
                    with a sash. This met the requirements advocated by Sewall for reform in women's dress:
                    freedom of movement; absence of pressure over any part of the body; no more weight than was
                    necessary for warmth, and both weight and warmth equally distributed; and quick changeability. In
                    the day of the corset, bustle, and petticoats, Sewall dared not require such a uniform but urged
                    parents to consider such a dress code for the health and comfort of her students. She required,
                    however, the adoption of special shoes. Some students were wearing shoes whose heels "made
                    it impossible for wearers to participate with success in portions of the gymnastics
                        classes."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The Girls' Classical School catalogue for the year 1883–1884 summarized what had
                    been accomplished in the past year for women's education: "in both amount and the
                    quality of the work done, including Latin, Greek, Mathematics, French, German and English, the
                    pupils have shown themselves at least equal to the pupils in the School for Boys, and have fully

                    course of study designed as a preparatory school for colleges, but there was also a course of study
                    for women who were not planning to enroll in college. Graduates of the school who took the college
                    courses could now enroll as juniors at Indiana University or sophomores at Leland Stanford
                        University.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sewall's personal reputation as well as that of the school continued to spread. She was by
                    now the founder of the National and International Councils of Women, which had brought her world
                    fame, and she was still actively espousing the cause of women's suffrage.</p>
            <p>At the height of these activities, Theodore Sewall, who encouraged his wife in reform activities,
                    died of tuberculosis in 1895. After his death May Wright Sewall became the sole principal of the
                    Girls' Classical School. She continued adding innovations—an adult education
                    program and a Department of Industrial Domestic Science (later named Household Science). The latter
                    included chemistry, physics, physiology, composition of foods, and practice work in cookery. Classes
                    in invalid cookery and home nursing also were offered. These courses had equal rank with the
                    academic classes. A two-story addition to the school was necessary to accommodate the new
                        department.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The course of study in domestic science was one of the first
                    offered in Indiana or in the nation. Woody stated that "it required boldness …
                    to set up to teach a thing scientifically that had been thought to reside in an individual
                    naturally." The first such cooking school mentioned by Woody was established in 1874.
                    Classes remained experimental throughout the rest of the century, and as late as 1916 only 20
                    percent of the public schools offered classes in home economics.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>In spite of such innovations, by 1900 the Girls' Classical School was having financial
                    problems. First, Fredonia Allen, a former teacher for the school, established a rival school, Tudor
                    Hall, which was modeled after the Classical School. In addition, public high schools had become
                    common in Indiana. As a result of the financial difficulties, Sewall entered into a partnership with
                    Anna F. Weaver in 1905. For two years the women operated the school together, but in 1907 Sewall
                    announced her retirement. In a letter, Sewall explained, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>An entry in my diary, made the night before The Classical School opened in 1882, ran thus:
                            ‘Tomorrow I commence work to which I now expect to give the chief part of my life
                            for twenty-five years.’</p>
                        <p>This I have been permitted to do. This entry shows that it was within my intention to give
                            only twenty-five years to this particular method of carrying out my educational ideas. For
                            this opportunity I am profoundly grateful.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> For the next three years Weaver operated the school alone. In 1910 it closed permanently.
                    For a decade prior to Sewall's retirement from the school, however, she had been traveling
                    extensively and working in another field—the woman's club
                    movement—which garnered her an international reputation.</p>
            <p>Sewall's genius lay in her ability to organize. She was once described as a "Social
                    clockmaker who gets human machinery into shape, winds it up and sets it to running."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Her international reputation rested largely upon her success in organizing
                    and unifying the women's clubs of the world through what she termed "the council
                    idea." The council idea originated when Sewall discovered that women most often
                    "were interested only in women of their own class or in the legitimate recipients of their
                    own charities." She felt that a typical woman's club of the time consisted of
                    individuals of about the same Social position, with similar opinions, tastes, and aspirations. Such
                    groups seldom had contact with clubs of dissimilar backgrounds and interests. Through a National and
                    International Council Sewall sought to bring women of varied backgrounds together under conditions
                    that would show them that though different in traditions, wealth, Social position, religion, and
                    political opinions, they were all equally related to larger interests. Indeed, "likenesses

                    American suffrage leaders decided to form an International Woman's Suffrage Society. A
                    resolution calling for such a Society was proposed and adopted at this reception, and an

                    Falls Convention of 1848. Under Sewall's direction invitations were extended to this
                    international committee. As a result, European delegates attended the meeting in <placeName>

            <p>At this meeting Sewall stated her plan for forming two permanent organizations—National
                    and International Councils—to meet at regular intervals. She moved that a committee be
                    appointed to consider the council idea and specific plans for organization. The committee was
                    appointed, including such people as Frances Willard, Mary A. Livermore, Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone,
                    Antoinette B. Blackwell, and May Wright Sewall. This organizing committee met on March 27, 1888,
                    passed a resolution in conformity with Sewall's plan, and adopted constitutions for a

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Sewall explained that local Societies should unite in councils for each town or city
                    and that all state Societies should enter state and territorial councils. She asserted
                    "that this general plan of solidarity [would] be helpful to the utmost possible degree,
                    bringing women of all sects and sections into mutual acquaintances, efficiency and
                    fellowship." The simplicity of the plan was, to Sewall, its chief advantage, and the
                    practical applications were unlimited. The case of circulating petitions among women would alone
                    justify such an organization.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>The number of American local and state clubs, by definition ineligible for membership in the
                    Councils, continued to be a major concern to Sewall. She therefore urged the organization of local
                    and state clubs into one national organization which would qualify for membership in the National
                    Council. Her work bore fruit in 1889 when the foundation was laid for the General Federation of
                    Women's Clubs. Sewall attended the organizational meeting and was one of five women who
                    wrote its bylaws. Within two months of its organization, however, the General Federation decided not
                    to affiliate with the National Council because the Federation itself was a "sovereign and
                    international body."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Sewall was keenly disappointed. Although she was
                    a founder of the movement and was elected the first vice-president of the General Federation,<hi rend="sup">35</hi> her interest in it gradually waned when the organization failed to join the
                    National Council.</p>

            <p>By 1907 the International Council of Women was the largest of all organizations of women. It
                    consisted of over twenty national councils and represented approximately eight million women. Both
                    the National Council of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the International Council still exist. Each, however, was at its zenith during
                    Sewall's lifetime. A contemporary of Sewall observed: "the varied organizations of
                    women for specific reforms and for philanthropic work themselves nationalized, and later
                    internationalized their activities, until the object each pursued was so strong in its own specialty
                    that the need for coordinated support offered by the Council ceased to be felt and the financial
                    support of the Council was neglected."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> The attainment of
                    women's suffrage also reduced interest in the Council because once women could vote they
                    could voice their needs politically. It was in this realm of women's suffrage that Sewall
                    made one of her greatest contributions to reform.</p>
            <p>Much work had already been done in Indiana when Sewall joined the suffrage campaign. Indiana was one
                    of five states that formed a state women's rights organization within three years of the
                    Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, but when Sewall arrived in the state in 1872 no significant
                    progress had been made. Indiana's suffrage movement was suffering the same fate as the
                    national movement: it had been totally disrupted by the Civil War and four years later split into
                    two groups. Most Indiana suffragists remained loyal to the more conservative American Woman Suffrage
                    Association led by Lucy Stone. Sewall favored the more radical National Woman Suffrage Association,
                    founded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, and remained aloof from the Indiana branch
                    of the American Association.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>In March, 1878, Sewall and nine other individuals frustrated by the conservative nature of the old
                    organization held a secret suffrage meeting of their own. According to Sewall, "mysterious
                    whisperings" advertised the fact that there was to be a meeting of people known to have
                    "advanced ideas" concerning <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The secrecy of the meeting seems strange since suffrage had been debated in Indiana for fifteen years
                    by this time. However, in the 1880s "respectable citizens" refrained from openly
                    advocating suffrage. Sewall was by now teaching in the highly respected <placeName>

                    warned the legislators that their careers were being watched carefully and urged that they take up
                    the "Suffrage Question," devoting a day to hearing the arguments of suffrage
                    advocates before voting to remove "the unjust restrictions of the elective franchise to one
                        sex."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Earlier that year, in a letter to Sara Andrews Spencer,
                    corresponding secretary to the National Woman Suffrage Association, Sewall stated what she thought
                    was holding back progress in Indiana: "We find langour of effort here, but the reason of it
                    seems not so much a disbelief in the cause as an apathy—as the belief that suffrage for
                    women is so <hi rend="i">sure</hi> a thing that it is not necessary to struggle for it!"<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sewall dedicated herself to the elimination of this apathy by writing about the subject often in her
                    column in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi>. Many arguments had been advanced over the years opposing the franchise for
                    women. One often heard was the fear that the exercise of political rights by women would lead to
                    moral deterioriation. Sewall protested that far from this, civil and political equality would bring
                    a moral elevation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Hitherto, the codes of morality for men and women have differed widely. …

                            recognition. … The degree to which the country needs this influence is sadly
                            evidenced by the proclamation of young men that <placeName>

                    </quote> When women received the ballot, a moral elevation would occur in national politics.
                    According to Sewall, purity in the state would be enforced by those who guarded purity in the
                        home.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second argument against woman's suffrage was the belief that woman's place was in
                    the home. She should take no vital interest in public affairs because it was not in her nature to do
                    so. Sewall never doubted that a woman's first duty was to keep the house and care for her
                    family. Nor did she question that a man's first duty was to earn a living for his wife and
                    children. However, no one argued that all of a man's time must be absorbed by his first
                    duty. Likewise, Sewall saw no reason why a woman's home duties should completely
                    "absorb, monopolize and exhaust her."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more facetious argument declared that the ballot would destroy beauty. An antisuffragist male made
                    the following comparison between the enfranchised woman and a bearded woman: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The vote, ladies will in no way serve you, will aid none of you in your work; on the
                            contrary, it will rob you of your beauty. Political rights! It is as one should talk of the
                            mustache and the beard. A bearded woman! Is she pretty? No! Pray then continue to leave
                            politics to men as you leave to them mustaches and beards, and yourselves, remain women.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Sewall replied that the ballot would not make a woman plain. Rather it would enhance her beauty by
                    emancipating her. Happiness was the key to beauty and <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>it was that martyrdom of the body and that agony of spirit inherent in a state of slavery
                            which made women ugly. Political rights would render women beautiful, because they would
                            procure her at the same time moral independence and material comfort. Men tell women that
                            the ballot will be of no service to them. How does it happen that the sex that votes is much
                            happier and more comfortable than the sex that does not vote?<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    under the age of twenty-one or were married and therefore had no need for the ballot because they
                    were "under such influence and control as that relation implies or confers."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> To Sewall this was the most unfair argument of all. The claim that suffrage
                    was not a right but a privilege to be doled out to those who were deemed worthy was too unjust to be
                    comprehensible: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>No reason on earth can be given by those who claim suffrage as a right of manhood which does

                            80 bound up in those of man that they are sure to be protected, the answer is that the same
                            argument was urged to the merger in the husband of the wife's property, and it was
                            pronounced by the judgment of mankind fallacious in practice and in principle. If the nature
                            of men and women are so alike, for that reason no harm is done by suppressing women, what
                            harm can be done by elevating them to equality. If the nature be different, what right can
                            there be in refusing representation to those who might take juster action about many Social

                    Societies agreed to merge into one state organization. By the time of this merger, a national
                    alliance had also occurred. The newly formed National Council of Women was influential in persuading
                    the two national suffrage organizations to combine as the National American Woman Suffrage
                    Association. This organization joined the National Council, and Sewall's work as a
                    suffragist merged with her work within the councils.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the last decade of struggle for women's suffrage, Sewall was not in Indiana. Though
                    she remained an avid suffragist, she found what she considered to be an even more urgent cause which
                    dominated the next decade of her life. This new cause was to be the last in which Sewall would
                    participate —the search for international peace.</p>
            <p>That Sewall should become a peace advocate at the turn of the century was not at all surprising. The
                    peace movement, like the temperance crusade, was closely identified with feminists, and although the
                    American peace movement was older than the woman's movement, Sewall was the first actually
                    to organize a national woman's movement behind the peace effort. She accomplished this by
                    guiding the International Council of Women into accepting a peace platform that from 1899 to 1914
                    dominated the work of the organization and helped it become a driving force in the peace movement
                    throughout the world.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first line of work which all councils agreed upon was the promotion of peace and arbitration. A
                    resolution was first adopted in 1899 which committed the International Council to working for the
                    establishment of peaceful relations among the nations throughout the world by every means in its
                    power. The same resolution was reaffirmed by the International Council in 1904 and 1909.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> These peace resolutions were intentionally worded in broad terms so each

            <p>Sewall, as president of the International Council and chairperson of its Committee on Peace and
                    Arbitration, advocated other means of securing international peace. She firmly believed that
                    nationalism as taught in school textbooks should be eliminated and replaced with a more
                    international feeling of brotherhood. She urged that each National Council make a rigid examination
                    of all textbooks on the history of its own country to ascertain to what degree the relative
                    importance of war and military glory were exaggerated. "It is believed
                    …," she wrote, "that to a degree which would be appalling were it
                    realized by the world, modern history … results in the development of an arrogant and
                    vain-glorious regard for one's own country, and in contempt, resentment and hatred toward
                    other nations."<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the promotion of these changes in textbooks, Sewall urged that textbooks be adopted in

                    the "successive tides of immigration." According to Sewall, "It is most
                    inconsistent, and to a very large degree futile, for us to meet in peace congresses and discuss with
                    some degree of respect the great nations, and do nothing to abate the mutual ignorance and
                    consequent dislike, not to say hatred, of the representatives of different races in <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Sewall's arguments along with the work of the International Council brought her fame among
                    the peace advocates. In fact, at the four Peace Congresses which were held between 1904 and 1911,
                    Sewall was either a speaker or a guest of honor, representing the International Council and giving
                    an account of the work of nearly eight million women whom she represented.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When war broke out in 1914, Sewall was dismayed but became more determined than ever to work for
                    peace: "While many distinguished advocates of Peace felt that work for its establishment
                    was inevitably suspended by the war—to me the war seemed a proclamation to the women of
                    the world that some action by them which would assert the solidarity of womanhood was
                        imperative."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Consequently, she organized and chaired, under the
                    auspices of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, an International Conference of Women
                    Workers to Promote Permanent Peace. The conference met in July, 1915, and brought together
                    approximately five hundred people from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and eleven foreign countries. The climax of the conference occurred on the sixth and
                    final day with a speech by William Jennings Bryan, who had only recently resigned as secretary of
                    state under President Woodrow Wilson.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later Sewall attempted to take matters into her own hands by having a personal interview with
                    President Wilson on November 2, 1915. During this interview, Wilson stated that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    organizing a conference for that purpose at that time. Sewall left feeling, however, that Wilson was

                    attention from war, to stimulate peace workers in every country to renewed efforts, and to deepen
                    the participants' resoluteness in the cause. The mission actually did strengthen the peace
                    movement in neutral European countries, but the press viewed it as a monstrous joke, and the

            <p>Once the journey was over, Sewall dropped out of public life. Whether it was from the humiliation of
                    the trip or from her age or poor health (she was now seventy-two) was not known, but between 1916
                    and 1920 no public statement in print or otherwise seems to have been made.</p>
            <p>In 1920, the year of her death, Sewall publicly revealed another dimension of herself. She had, no
                    doubt, used this last five-year period preparing for publication in a new frontier, one which
                    involved her in the strangest aspect of her career—spiritualism.</p>
            <p>Despite the popularity of the spiritualist movement around the turn of the century, Sewall kept her
                    involvement a well-concealed secret until two months before her death. She gave two reasons for
                    maintaining silence over the twenty-five-year period of her experiences. First, those who contacted
                    her from the spirit world urged her not to give messages to the world at that time, and secondly,
                    the few friends (possibly a dozen in all) in whom she confided intimated that she was a victim of a
                    mental delusion. Public discovery of her belief in spiritualism could have destroyed her credibility
                    as a practical reformer. Therefore, she waited until "extreme feebleness" had
                    taken her permanently out of public affairs before revealing her psychic experiences.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

                    earth." She also expressed a belief that eventually psychic science would be taught in high

            <p>Sewall's adventures into the spirit realm began shortly after the death of her second
                    husband, Theodore Sewall, in 1895, but her real conversion to spiritualism occurred at an 1897
                        <geogName>Chautauqua</geogName> meeting at <placeName>

               </placeName>, when a
                    "sitting" was arranged for her with a "slate writer." At this
                    sitting, Sewall chose a clean slate that was sponged off and tied it with her own handkerchief. She
                    then held it in her own hands with no other hands touching it. She wrote down questions on
                    "bits of paper that had not passed out of her hands." The answers to these
                    questions were written in the form of a letter on the slate which was opened later in
                    Sewall's hotel room. She explained that she opened the slate expecting to find it bare, but
                    instead found that it was covered with "clear and legible writing," with
                    "perfectly coherent, intelligent and characteristic replies to questions which had been
                    written upon the bits of paper that had not left my hands."<hi rend="sup">78</hi> After
                    this experience, Sewall explained, "I knew as clearly as I now know after twenty-two years
                    of constant study and experimentation that I had, so to speak, acquired actual knowledge, if not of
                    immortality, at least of a survival of death—I had learned that the last enemy is
                    destroyed, in that he can destroy neither being nor identity, nor continuity of
                        relationship."<hi rend="sup">79</hi> From this time, Sewall claimed to have had almost
                    daily communications from her dead husband. Her book also described piano lessons by the recently
                    deceased master, Anton Rubinstein, and her most unusual recovery from Bright's disease
                    after following the instructions of a medieval priest.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

            <p>In the introduction to <hi rend="i">Neither Dead Nor Sleeping</hi> Booth Tarkington discussed the
                    paradox presented to followers of May Wright Sewall, who suddenly discovered that their unquestioned
                    oracle had been living "on the unknown Sea." Tarkington admitted he found himself
                    in a "condition of astonishment" when Sewall called him to examine her manuscript
                    before its printing. He observed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was to me dumbfounding to find that for more than twenty years this academic-liberal of a
                            thousand human activities, Mrs. Sewall, had been really living not with the living so to put
                            it. And as I read, it seemed to me that I had never known so strange a story; and at times,
                            dwelling upon her long struggle to cure her malady, and to make herself a proper messenger
                            for those known to us everyday people as dead, it seemed again that these almost grotesquely
                            painful sacrifices of the flesh were recorded, not of a modern lady of the world, but of
                            some medieval penitent. …</p>
                    </quote> Tarkington continued that there was one thing of which there could be no question: Sewall
                    did "put away" a malady pronounced fatal. Nor would anyone who had known Sewall
                    believe that she had intentionally deceived herself during the long experience with
                    "supernatural beings." Tarkington concluded that her experiences either were
                    authentic or a mysterious product of her own subconscious.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the public learned of Sewall's involvement in spiritualism, it was not as kind as Booth
                    Tarkington. This strange activity quickly overshadowed thirty years of work in education and
                    women's rights. The image of the frail old woman who fasted according to the directions of
                    a priest from the Middle Ages and pounded away at a piano chosen for her by Rubinstein was too
                    potent to overcome the image of a strong-willed woman who had fought for equality and justice.<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fact perhaps explains why Sewall's place in <geogName>Crown Hill</geogName> Cemetery in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is not as well known as those of her two friends and contemporaries, Benjamin Harrison
                    and James Whitcomb Riley. Nonetheless, as the field of women's history is further explored
                    the work of Sewall and other forgotten reformers will emerge as real and significant monuments. The
                    truest estimate of Sewall is found in what Booth Tarkington described as "the longing in
                    all humility, to be of great help to the world."<hi rend="sup">83</hi>

            <p>A modern student of nineteenth-century technology once observed that the technology of canals has
                    been their least-studied aspect.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Works on canals have examined their politics,
                    financing, folklore, and economic impact but nearly ignored technical matters. This paper treats the
                    least-studied aspect of this little-studied technology: canal culverts. Though obscure, the topic is
                    important. Culverts were by far the most frequently used devices to get canals past intersecting
                    streams, a vital task without which there could be no canals.</p>
            <p>In the design and construction of a canal there are four primary tasks that an engineer must
                    accomplish: survey a useful route with minimum elevation changes; deal with any unavoidable
                    elevation changes present on the route; guarantee an ample supply of water for the canal; and cross
                    lateral watercourses. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The much shorter Whitewater Canal in southeastern Indiana connected the east-central
                    part of the state at the National Road with the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Necessary changes
                    in elevation on these canals were effected by locks which sealed one elevation from another and
                    which served to pass canal boats up or down. The generally low relief of the
                    <geogName>Maumee</geogName>, <geogName>Wabash</geogName>, and <geogName>Whitewater</geogName>
                    valleys meant that no tunnels were required in Indiana, although the Whitewater extension to <placeName>

                    water, with occasional exceptions during the dry summer months. All of <list type="footnotes">

                    discussed because of their political and economic implications or because of the interesting
                    technical problems they present.</p>
            <p>The last engineering problem faced by the builder was to carry the canal across lateral streams,
                    ensuring either separation or controlled mingling of the two lines of water. This subject apparently
                    has seldom been the subject of historical research; certainly no published research exists for
                        Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> On the rare occasions that scholars have studied stream-crossing
                    on other canals, they have given their attention to aqueducts.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Yet these,
                    interesting as they are, constitute only a small percentage of canal stream-crossing structures for
                    the simple reason that most watercourses are too small to merit such elaborate water-bridges.

                    slack-water pools formed by dams, but the remaining 144 crossings utilized culverts.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                            a right-of-way, while an aqueduct is a bridge carrying water over an essentially undisturbed
                            stream, railroad, or road. A stone arch culvert may be thought of as a very wide, (usually)

                    first round of culvert building; and the results of a recent on-site examination of one particularly
                    well preserved but typical Indiana canal culvert from 1840. These data permit a coherent survey of
                    canal culvert technology in one state during a fifteen-year period of canal construction.</p>
            <p>The Hoosier state is an apt subject for such a study because it was far enough west to benefit from
                    the ideas and practices that had earlier been developed in the older part of the nation. Little
                    additional canal building was done west of Indiana, as the entire transportation method was soon
                    rendered economically unviable by the railroad. The men who thought about, designed, and supervised
                    the building of Indiana's canals were themselves the inheritors of several decades of
                    accumulated experience and informal education. But the engineers are not the main focus here; beyond
                    a few names and references to earlier canal experience in states further east, one will find little
                    about the men.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Canal culvert technology has center stage.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be imagined that is more prosaic than a modern culvert. The simple task of passing
                    relatively small quantities of water under rights-of-way is now inconspicuously managed by metal or
                    pre-cast concrete tubes. In the 1830s, however, at the time Indiana canals were begun, engineers
                    gave substantial attention to the design and installation of culverts, and they developed rules to
                    help them decide when to install a culvert in preference to other structures.</p>

            <p>M.S. Webb gave his canal rules in narrative form under three headings: (1) General Rules for Crossing

                    the solutions he recommended. Note that he did not offer a rule for some cases, but in others he
                    suggested two or three possibilities.</p>
            <p>Under "General Rules," Webb described how a canal is to be carried across
                    watercourses according to the varying sizes of the streams. He divided them into three classes

                    of all streams encountered in Indiana canal building. For these middle-size (Class 2) watercourses
                    Webb recommended passing the water under the canal by means of a culvert or set of culverts, an

            <p>The arrangements designed to cover the mid-range conditions, Classes 2a and 2b in Table I, received
                    most of Webb's attention, but before examining them in detail it may be best to place them
                    in context by examining Webb's solutions for the largest and smallest streams. In most
                    cases he recommended letting the small Class 1 brooks flow directly into the canal, avoiding the
                    trouble and cost of any elaboration at all. His only proviso in such cases was that a sufficient
                    number of waste weirs or overflow outlets be provided nearby so excess water might leave the canal
                    without damaging the banks. If the stream carried so much sand or gravel that it might tend to fill
                    the canal, he indicated that a small culvert should be built to pass the water under the canal.</p>
            <p>At the upper end of the scale, Webb wrote that large streams and rivers of Class 3 ought to be
                    crossed by aqueducts because these provided the surest navigation. He described an aqueduct as an
                    especially happy solution when the stream had high banks and the canal therefore passed far above
                    the stream bed. But an aqueduct required that adequate building materials—stone for the
                    piers and wood for the trunk—be close to the site, a distance Webb defined as no more
                    than six to ten miles.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> If a feeder (additional supply of water for the canal)
                    was necessary or desirable on that section of the canal, a dam could be built on the downstream side
                    of the canal crossing, and the canal itself conducted through the pool formed by the dam. In that
                    case the problem of carrying the towpath over the pool had to be resolved with a towpath bridge,
                    rope ferry, or horse ferry.</p>
            <p>When a culvert was the answer, Webb prescribed two distinctly different types depending upon the
                    circumstances: if the culvert could be set very low in its stream bed and if the size of the stream
                    fell toward the lower end of Class 2 (maximum flow passable through a twelve-foot chord semicircular
                    culvert), he recommended an inexpensive wooden rectangular culvert, placed low so as to be
                    permanently under water. Because wood deteriorates when not completely submerged, it was important
                    that not only the bottom, but also the 18–36-inch sides and the horizontal top, be kept
                    under water. This required a nice calculation to assure that there would be sufficient water to
                    maintain this cover, and frequently a small dam was placed across the stream just below the culvert
                    to maintain the water <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi> Webb did not mention all-stone aqueducts, although in the East there
                            were many, with arches up to ninety feet; Hahn, <hi rend="i">Guide to C &amp; O,
                            passim</hi>.</item>

                    to be open enough and to have great enough capacity to handle even spring floods so that the water
                    would not back up and damage or erode the canal embankment. If a wooden rectangular culvert was not
                    suitable because the stream was larger in flood than a twelve-foot arch could handle, or if the
                    stream bed was so far below the level of the canal that insertion of a low, wooden rectangular
                    culvert would leave a high, exposed bank, Webb prescribed a stone arch or in rare circumstances a
                    wooden arch.</p>
            <p>The guidelines found in Webb's manuscripts may be compared with Jesse L. Williams's
                    report of the actual structures found on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie in 1847. Williams examined minutely all the structures on the 189 miles of the
                    canal that had been built since 1832, from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> feeder.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Except for infrequent remarks on the condition of the
                    bank, he concentrated on the dams, bridges, aqueducts, culverts, locks, and waste
                    weirs—the "works of art," in the terminology of the time.</p>
            <p>Williams's report is organized differently than Webb's Whitewater notebooks.
                    Williams did not state the quantity of water or flow rate of each stream, nor did he indicate the
                    probable flows in flood-time. He simply reported the location, dimension, and condition of the
                    mechanical structures that he found on the canal. From these data one can only surmise the relative
                    size of each stream from the dimensions of the structure erected upon it, precisely the opposite
                    approach from Webb's <hi rend="i">a priori</hi> classification explained above. There can,
                    therefore, be no precise ranking of stream size on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie that would strictly parallel Webb's Whitewater classifications. The
                    general size of the streams crossed by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Erie can be estimated from the 1847 report, but erroneous deductions could be
                    drawn, as, for example, in cases where large arches or even aqueducts might have been put up, not
                    for the quantity of water that they could handle, but to gain height for the canal bed.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Williams concentrated on the elaborate structures and did not necessarily mention the very small
                    brooks of Class 1 that simply flowed into the canal. He did mention the location of moveable-gate
                    waste weirs, and since there were only four or five on the canal not accounted for by proximity to
                    large feeders, one may deduce that there were probably not many other small streams that simply
                    flowed into the canal.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Only three non-urban culverts of less than 6.3 square
                    feet of cross section (Webb's Class 1) were found on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie in 1847; such other streamlets as may have existed at that time apparently fed
                    into the canal. Even the four or five weirs mentioned may not have had any purpose other than
                    general control of water depth since they were used also to drain a canal level whenever maintenance
                    was required.</p>
            <p>Williams's report provides complete coverage only for larger streams. Selection of a
                    particular culvert dimension did not necessarily imply a stream of a certain size—there
                    was simply too much latitude, as the rules in Webb's Table I show and as the empirically
                    derived information in Table II indicates. The latter provides a breakdown of the classes and types
                    of culverts on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie in 1847, classifying all the lateral watercourses that Williams thought worth
                    mentioning and providing totals by type and size.</p>
            <p>The rarer culvert installations—stone arches, multiple wooden boxes, and wooden
                    arches—occur in a variety of sizes, but they are infrequent in the smaller categories.
                    These relatively complicated styles, however, along with aqueducts and dadpool crossings, appear at
                    all locations providing more than 40 square feet of cross-sectional capacity.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                    chose the cheapest and simplest device that he thought would work, with the result that wooden
                    rectangular boxes, single or multiple, carried the canal over three-quarters of the streams, and
                    even over some of apparently large dimension.</p>
            <p>Table III amplifies column 2 of Table II by showing how many openings or elements there were at the
                    twenty-eight streams where multiple-box rectangular wooden culverts were built.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> In some instances these were sizeable installations, as much as 72 feet wide.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Wooden rectangular culverts were low and flat, typical dimensions being 10 by 1.5 feet,
                    or 12 by 3 feet in each element. For wooden culverts Webb specified a length of 94 feet under the
                    canal, exclusive of head or wing walls, 6 feet longer than the stone arch culvert tubes which
                    normally had much more elaborate protective head and wing walls. Probably the two types similarly

                    wooden culverts in Table II. And one stone arch culvert had double arches, each eleven feet in

                    Williams's report is peppered with statements alluding to the poor quality of the work, the
                    insecurity of the arches, and the need to rebuild a number of them soon with good cut stone.</p>
            <p>The tension between the two opposing philosophies of building quickly and cheaply in order to get the
                    canal into service, or building securely of good stone from the outset, had long been a feature of
                    American canal building. In general, the first method implied construction of locks, culverts, dams,
                    and aqueducts from wood, with the goal of quickly opening the canal and using the revenues generated
                    from operations to <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-078-4-046"/> rebuild with stone or to renew repeatedly
                    with wood. Undercapitalized projects relied on this strategy, and immigrant engineers thought it a
                    typically New World trait. But these engineers saw it less as a result of capital shortage than as a
                    psychological characteristic of Americans, a part of the feverish activity of the new <placeName>

            <p>Whether undercapitalization or mere hyperactivity caused the American proclivity for wooden
                    construction, European-trained engineers preferred to build monumentally, in stone, from the

                    in evidence in Indiana in the 1830s and 1840s. The problem of financing Indiana's internal
                    improvements lies beyond the scope of this paper, but funds were short, and the people of the

            <p>The casual passerby on Towpath Road today might not even notice the arch. The great 85.5 foot length
                    of the culvert makes it in effect a very wide bridge, and it means that a broad expanse of earth
                    extends far from the road's edge on the south side, concealing the creek below. Only by

            <p>The height of the arch in relation to the former canal prism is not easy to determine because the
                    road has replaced the canal bed, but Webb's rule called for a minimum of two feet of earth
                    (called puddle) between the top of the arch stones and the bottom of the canal bed, and this gives
                    an indication of the minimum probable elevation of the canal. Note also Webb's comments in
                    Table I, mandating an arch if the bed of the stream to be crossed lay far below the level of the
                    canal. The site at Burnett's Creek suggests this condition. The fact that the engineer
                    there chose a rather large twenty-foot arch, with its attendant ten-foot rise (in addition to stone
                    thickness and puddle), indicates that the desire to gain height may have motivated him.</p>

                            1977, and were impeded by the presence of a large coiled snake. Though it was probably a
                            harmless black snake, the author is not herpetologist enough to know whether the creature
                            could be safely overstepped. He wishes to thank his wife and his aunt for holding the tape
                            even in the near presence of the reptile. Canal buff Tom Hahn has pointed out that winter is
                            the best time to explore and photograph old canal beds; in that season one avoids snakes,
                            poison ivy, and foliage.</item>

                    Webb's overhead drawing (lower part of Fig. 4), which shows that the foundation timbers
                    must extend ever wider as one moves out from the arch body toward the end of the spreading wing
                    walls. Notice that in every case (except for possible scribal errors in the 12+12- and 18-foot
                    rows), columns 1 and 3 add to 88 feet, the specified normal length for an arch body. Beyond the
                    basic 88 feet, the extent of the timber foundation is positively correlated with the length and
                    spread of the wing walls, which is in turn positively correlated to the span or chord of the arch.</p>
            <p>To understand this idea, one may take as an example the data for the 12-foot arch, which are
                    interpreted as follows: from <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-078-4-055"/>

                    undergirded by foundation timbers 17 feet long laid transversely to the arch body. Then beyond that
                    there were 5 feet under each parapet of timbers 28 feet long, then for 2 more feet there were also
                    28-foot timbers where the wings began to extend from the parapet, then a further 8 feet of 31-foot
                    timbers and finally, for the last 10 feet there were 34.5-foot beams reaching across to support the
                    furthest extremities of the wing walls. In every case the timbers extended completely across the
                    stream and tied together both sides of the arch and both wing walls. The overall result was a large,
                    hourglass-shaped platform of wood supporting all the masonry.</p>
            <p>Figure 7 shows graphically the remarkable survivability and durability of a wooden foundation like
                    this when kept <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-078-4-056"/> under water. The faint outlines of two intact
                    beams (among many) appear under the water in this photograph, which looks across and down into
                    Burnett's Creek just outside the north portal of the arch. Inside the arch a continuous
                    timber foundation floor stretches away under the water, with beams like those faintly visible in the
                    photograph.</p>
            <p>Webb did not amplify certain bits of data contained in Tables V and VI. For example, builders
                    apparently drove the pilings listed in Column 12 of Table V only near the ends of the horizontal
                    foundation timbers. Figures 4 and 5 at least lead to that conclusion.</p>
            <p>Also unclear are the two quantitites Webb gave for the two-inch oak planking (Table VI, column 2).
                    Apparently these two numbers are added in each case, since elsewhere he said that a ten-foot arch
                    required 750 square feet of oak planking. Figures 4 and 5 show that these were laid on top of the
                    foundation beams in order to provide a perfectly flat surface from which to spring the arch and
                    raise the wing walls.</p>

            <p>As is well known, the Indiana canal system was an economic failure. The large sums expended upon it
                    were not recouped directly in tolls and fees and probably not indirectly in economic benefits,

            <p>Like much of early American culture, this nation's nineteenth-century educational writings,
                    theories, and practices borrowed heavily from their European counterparts. Johann Heinrich
                    Pestalozzi (1746–1827), Swiss writer, teacher, and educational philosopher, exerted a
                    particularly strong influence on American educators.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Above all others
                    Pestalozzi's student, Francis Joseph Nicholas Neef, who served as principal of Robert
                    Owen's schools in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    </placeName>. Possibly because most American educational historians have interpreted Neef's
                    methods as imitations of those developed by Pestalozzi, scholars have labelled him the earliest
                    American practitioner of Pestalozzian pedagogy.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As a result, Neef's
                    role as an innovator in the fields of American educational theory and practice long has been
                    overlooked.</p>

                        Neef in 1806. Through private philanthropy he hoped to meet the urgent need for improvement in
                        American education by bringing Pestalozzian teachers, books, and teaching materials into this
                        country; until his death, Maclure championed Pestalozzian doctrines. See Arthur E. Bestor, Jr.,

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> A number of books and articles have appeared on Joseph Neef's
                        contribution to the spread of Pestalozzianism in America. Chief among them are William Maclure,

            <p>The oft-stated but misleading conclusion that Neef merely emulated the Pestalozzian method without
                    adding significantly to its theory or practice is based on several considerations. Neef was, first,
                    trained by Pestalozzi, taught under his guidance for about three years at the Burgdorf school, and
                    directed the Pestalozzian school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> for an additional three years. Neef also was brought to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> specifically to introduce the Pestalozzian teaching method. Publicly and privately,
                    Neef gave frequent testimony of his admiration of Pestalozzi, and he was never reluctant to
                    acknowledge his indebtedness to him. And finally, Neef's <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Plan and
                        Method of Education</hi> (1808) and <hi rend="i">Method of Instructing Children Rationally</hi>
                    (1813) include many direct references to his indebtedness to Pestalozzi, such as: "There is
                    nothing new under the sun. Do not expect, therefore, that I am going to initiate my pupils in new
                    arts, in unheard-of sciences. … They will learn no new things, but they will learn the
                    old things in a new way. This is Pestalozzi's method."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This
                    misinterpretation of Neef's role has rested on an unquestioning acceptance of the
                    educator's claims that he was simply following Pestalozzi's philosophy and on a
                    failure to look beyond these claims by actually comparing the <list type="footnotes">

                    Neef's theory of education has been treated only superficially, did any scholar express
                    discomfort with this view. Even Gutek maintained only that disciples once "trained by

                            scholarly source for a close examination of Neef's teaching methods. Unfortunately,
                            Gutek does not compare Neef's method of education to that of Pestalozzi by giving
                            specific details and differences, possibly because he did not have access to some Neef
                            manuscripts which were only recently made available to this author. Neef's
                            innovations were, however, mentioned as early as 1884. In a letter to Professor Eli F.

               </list>
                    <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-078-4-062"/> teacher's educational theories, which unquestionably
                    played a fundamental role in molding Neef's thought. At the same time, it must move beyond
                    this to analyze the distinctive features of American culture and especially of the American frontier
                    that led Neef to modify these theories. Neef's role as an educational innovator becomes
                    particularly clear in considering three areas in which his methods differed sharply from those of
                    Pestalozzi. First, Pestalozzi's objective was to teach the lower Social orders to help
                    themselves; for Neef, however, the goal was to show everyone, not only the poor, how to acquire the
                    skills of analyzing, examining, and investigating. Second, Pestalozzi's educational methods
                    reflected his belief that a person's place in the class structure was fixed and that there
                    was little likelihood of Social mobility; Neef's methods incorporated the American belief
                    that success and improvement were open to all those willing to work hard enough. And finally,
                    Pestalozzi viewed education not as a "head-in-the-clouds" affair, but as a
                    practical one; Neef left the content of education to the individual, thus separating content and
                    method and leaving each person to decide for himself his future station in life. The writings from
                    Neef's <placeName>

                    Pestalozzianism to the incorporation of significant innovations. These writings also reveal those
                    aspects of Neef's American experience which caused him to develop these innovations.</p>
            <p>Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's fame was first established with the publication of <hi rend="i">The Evening Hour of a Hermit</hi> (1780), a romantic novel in the tradition of
                    Rousseau's <hi rend="i">Emile</hi> (1757–1760). But it is his work at his
                    experimental schools at the Neuhof and in Burgdorf, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, upon which his reputation now rests. The Burgdorf school is famous for the development
                    of the "ABC of Anschauung," the reduction of instruction into its simplest
                    components, and for the teaching of writing,<list type="footnotes">
                  <item>Tappan of Kenyon College, Richard Owen pointed out various innovations.
                            "Pestalozzi's system," he wrote, "in some detail
                            modified and improved by Mr. Neef, was truly admirable and a means of drawing out of the
                            child's powers and cultivating habits of observations. … As Pestalozzi
                            had been less successful in applying his own principles practically to Geography than most
                            other branches … Neef proposes a great improvement, namely the construction by
                            his pupils of maps or plans after actual measurements." See Richard Owen to Eli F.

                    experimented with at this institute. These theories can be summarized briefly. Pestalozzi believed
                    that a teacher must not only know the child as a living and growing organism but also must acquire
                    the art of understanding children so that he may influence them; thus education must be
                    child-centered. He showed other teachers how to do research and experimental work in the field of
                    education. He introduced psychology, child-study, and <hi rend="i">Anschauung</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">5</hi> into education <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi> Largely due to Neef, Pestalozzi's notion of <hi rend="i">Anschauung</hi>—i.e., "observation" —is
                            referred to as "object teaching" or "object lessons" in
                            America. Other possible equivalents are "direct experience,"
                            "intuition," "sense perception,"
                            "view," and "sense impression." <hi rend="i">Anschauung</hi> was the keystone of the Pestalozzian theory of education. For Neef the term
                            meant that all knowledge should derive from the pupil's immediate experience, rest
                            on prior analysis, and involve the ability to predict results of actions; this represents a
                            definite innovation over Pestalozzi's original meaning of the term.

                    Pestalozzi's teaching methods attempted to prepare the child emotionally and intellectually
                    for life as an adult. He forced education to be democratic by devising teaching methods that were to
                    inspire children from different Social backgrounds. He put forward the view that instruction should
                    always begin with the simple before moving to the complex and with the physically near before moving
                    to the more distant objects. And lastly, Pestalozzi used simultaneous group instruction on an
                    experimental basis, a method which proved especially successful in the teaching of spelling,
                    arithmetic, and writing, as well as in play activities and gymnastics.</p>
            <p>This system of education was thus designed to take fully into account the pupil and what he was able
                    to achieve emotionally, intellectually, physically, and mentally. It was based on the principle of
                    "beginning with the easiest and making this complete before going further, then gradually
                    adding, little by little, to that already perfectly learned,"<hi rend="sup">6</hi> to
                    produce in the pupil a feeling of achievement. To this end education had to provide the pupil with
                    experiences, stimuli, and exercises which only gradually became more difficult and complex. The
                    basis of Pestalozzi's methods was best expressed in his <hi rend="i">How Gertrude Teaches
                        Her Children</hi> (1801), where he set forth that education should always aim at the harmonious
                    development of the child's personality, a concept borrowed from Rousseau, with whom he
                    agreed that education must harmonize with the laws of nature. Above all, he was one of the first
                    educators to attempt to analyze the elements of the science of education by proposing that
                    "the carriage of European public education must not simply be better horsed; what it needs
                    most of all is that it should be turned right around and taken on to an entirely new
                        road."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    identified with Pestalozzi's philosophical search for the means by which a person might
                    achieve fulfillment in life, personal satisfaction through one's vocation, and peace with
                    oneself. Thus it is not surprising that upon his recovery he ventured to Burgdorf, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, to apply for a teaching position.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In 1800 he joined
                    Pestalozzi's Bergdorf school faculty to teach foreign languages and gymnastics, almost
                    immediately developing close personal ties and a good professional relationship with Pestalozzi.</p>
            <p>At the end of 1803 Pestalozzi requested Neef to open a Pestalozzian school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, since he had become a skilled practitioner of the natural method and had mastered the
                    French language. As a loyal disciple Neef introduced Pestalozzi's method to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Unfortunately little is known about the <placeName>

                    </placeName> school except for one letter from Neef to Pestalozzi; in this the former expressed his
                    dissatisfaction with his assignment, complaining that the French did not really understand the
                    method that Pestalozzi advocated and that most of the pupils at the school were weak and
                        ill-prepared.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when William Maclure, the American geologist and philanthropist, visited Neef's

                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he accepted joyfully. He wrote of this decision: "I was not only glad to quit
                    Europe, but I burnt with desire to see that country, to live in, and to be useful to it, which can
                    boast of such citizens."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                        </placeName>, Indiana). On the back of the contract Neef states that he "received from
                        William Maclure three thousand two hundred livres tournois in full payment for expenses to the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> of America." This contract is one of the reasons echolam have never
                        seriously questioned Neef's devotion to Pestalozzian teaching methods. Rather, they
                        have attempted to evaluate the impact of the system, the fame of the various schools, and such
                        topics. Calkins, for instance, concluded that "the cause of Neef's apparent
                        inability to markedly influence the educational activities was because he failed to Americanize
                        the Pestalozzian system instead of merely transplanting it"; see Catkins,
                        "History of Object Teaching," 673. Another scholar saw Neef's
                        influence in a similar light: "Neef's work lacked permanency. Had he remained
                        in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                        </placeName> and organized a normal school for the preparation of teachers in the Pestalozzian
                        method, he would have been an important figure in American education." See Will S.

                    his lack of communication with Pestalozzi and due also to the influences and harsh requirements of
                    the frontier. A comparison of Pestalozzi's and Neef's views on the nature of
                    education, the possibility of Social mobility, and the content of education makes clear the ways in
                    which Neef developed into an innovative educational theorist.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life Pestalozzi was concerned with the plight of the poor. In 1774, after opening his
                    first school at the Neuhof, he recognized that his natural method of education increased the chances
                    of pauper children to become self-reliant by taking into account the type of life that each pupil
                    would have to lead after leaving school. "Education of the poor," wrote
                    Pestalozzi, "demands a deep and accurate knowledge of the real needs, limitations, and
                    environment of poverty, and detailed knowledge of the probable situation in which they will spend
                    their life."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> As a result, he encouraged his teachers to experience
                    their way of life to be better able to educate the poor. Moreover, a teacher "must descend

                    person's education, however, would be considered outside its Social context, thus implying
                    that one remains in one's Social class regardless of schooling. Education of the lower
                    Social orders should not lead these children outside the boundaries of their Social position and
                    condition; on the contrary, it should help them not only to become conscious of their situation but
                    also to accept the limitations peculiar to their Social class.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In his

            <p>Indeed, Pestalozzi became convinced that much of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>'s political and Social instability was caused by the lack of education. The
                    poor, being Society's least-educated class, were dissatisfied with their Social position;
                    proper education would lead them to understand and accept their place in the class structure. The
                    Swiss aristocracy, however, viewed any type of general education as a threat to their own place in
                    Society. As a result, they did not even attempt to understand Pestalozzi's
                    "doctrine of appropriateness of condition," with which he tried to change the
                    attitudes of the aristocracy and poor alike by arguing that a person's Socioeconomic
                    position should be based on his occupation alone. Education should be provided for everyone without

            <p>While Pestalozzi's system of education was intended primarily to prepare the poor to accept
                    their lot—i.e., to change their attitudes toward their Social status rather than that
                    status itself, to provide them with more flexibility in their trade, and to allow them to plan
                    ahead—Neef's motive for insisting that everyone has a right to a proper
                    education was quite different. Due to the vastness of America, its scarce population, and its
                    abundance of natural resources, Social and class boundaries were hardly visible on the frontier.
                    Here education was important, Neef believed, "because I know it to be the only source of
                    our acting well and consequently of our happiness."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neef's frontier experiences showed him that the survival of the individual often depended on
                    his ability to stand on his own two feet and to use whatever knowledge and skill he had in the
                    struggle with the harsh conditions of the frontier. In the life of each pioneer and
                    "back-woodsman," as Neef liked to refer to himself, ideas were often the only
                    instrument of adjustment and the results of their application were usually immediate. Under frontier
                    conditions control of the environment was an absolute necessity for survival. Indeed, knowledge was
                    prized as a person's most dependable means of extending his control over the environment.
                    Knowledge, furthermore, strengthened the pioneer's faith that he should not be afraid of
                    change but rather should welcome it as a sign of Social improvement and proof that he was able to
                    master the circumstances of life on the frontier.</p>
            <p>These frontier conditions were incorporated into Neef's method of education. In an undated
                    and hitherto unpublished manuscript Neef wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Fellow Citizens! To educate children is generally understood to mean teaching them all sorts
                            of arts &amp; sciences, as well as dead &amp; living languages. This view of the
                            matter, however, does not seem to be quite correct. If education consisted in the imparting
                            of knowledge of our arts &amp; sciences; then no person could be called completely
                            educated, unless thoroughly acquainted with languages, arts &amp; sciences too numerous
                            &amp; too difficult of acquisition that ten ordinary lives would not suffice to receive
                            such an education. The obvious impossibility of the scheme proves that such a comprehensive
                            instruction cannot be the real scope of education. Nor would the matter be mended by saying
                            that a judicious selection should be made of such languages, arts &amp; sciences as
                            would really be useful &amp; necessary to the welfare of the future man. For to make

                            life; but no human sagacity ever possessed such a gift of prophecy. Our arts, sciences,
                            languages are therefore but the instruments or means, through which the powers of the human
                            mind are developed, whereas evolving of these powers is the real object of education or
                            rather education itself. If you consider with me this view of the matter as being correct,
                            you will certainly not wonder at my declaring that the matters of instruction are but of a
                            secondary importance; whereas the method, by which any species of knowledge is imparted to
                            the human mind, becomes a matter of the most serious, the most momentous consideration. That
                            the reverse of this creed is firmly established in ninety-nine out of a hundred heads I
                            know, nor do I doubt but many a wise man will sneer at my preposterous notions. This
                            difference of opinion, however, only proves that my notion is different from that of others;
                            but for or against its correctness it proves nothing. This latter point is, however, the
                            only one that deserves our attention. Let us, therefore, examine whether I am right or
                            whether I am wrong.</p>
                        <p>It is evident, methinks, that with all our real or imaginary sagacity, we cannot possibly
                            foresee the future situation of our children, what art or what science will be necessary
                            &amp; useful to their future welfare. This position I think to be obvious &amp;
                            incontrovertible; and this being the case, how can we determine before hand what arts,
                            languages, sciences will be required to insure their future happiness, their future
                            usefulness? Suppose, for instance, I require a son of mine to learn the Greek language.
                            Well; chance &amp; choice combine, and the young fellow becomes a merchant. Do you think
                            that his knowledge of Greek will be of great service to him in his commercial speculations?
                            Do you, can you approve that the time, he employed in studying the language of ancient <placeName>
                                <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                            </placeName>, has been very usefully spent? Your smile convinces me that you suppose no such
                            thing. From this short exposition of the matter we are therefore forcibly led to the
                            conclusion that languages, arts, sciences must be considered only as the instruments by
                            which education is to be effected, that they are not of primary importance &amp; that in
                            their selection we can only be guided by the probabilities more or less obvious. But the
                            mode of acquiring knowledge is all-important, indeed. As soon as a child knows how to
                            acquire any species of knowledge, as soon as it has acquired the habit &amp; skill of
                            analyzing, examining, investigating every thing, it deems necessary to become acquainted
                            with; its education may be considered as accomplished.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>It is, therefore, not surprising that Neef did not agree with Pestalozzi concerning the doctrine of
                    appropriateness of condition. He realized that pioneer America was attempting to lay the foundations
                    of a new civilization and that these foundations could not be laid by simply transplanting European
                    educational thought and practice, which judged human beings by their ancestry rather than by what
                    they were able to achieve themselves. Here each family, whether rich or poor, encountered the <list type="footnotes">

                            on education. Its content suggests that it was written after the 1828 collapse of the Owen

                    achieve there became the only valid test of their character, education, and status. Since each
                    family had to grapple with the same crude frontier conditions, Neef was not interested only in the
                    education of certain Social classes. Moreover, he did not intend to prepare his pupils for a
                    specific station in life because on the frontier it was impossible for the teacher to know what
                    place in Society his pupils eventually would hold.</p>
            <p>This view also revealed a second area of difference between Neef and Pestalozzi: the
                    former's belief in the democratic ideals which America symbolized and particularly in the
                    American commitment to nearly unlimited Social mobility. This mobility was possible, in part,
                    because the European feudal system with its fixed class structure had not been established in the
                    thinly populated regions of the western frontier. Here the vastness of the country meant that the
                    pioneer, and with him American civilization, was continually on the march.</p>
            <p>Pestalozzi, who was culturally, Socially, and educationally bound to the European tradition and knew
                    of prejudices and class distinctions from personal experience, believed that one important objective
                    of education was to teach the pupil to be <figure>

                    Social and economic status and unquestioning reliance on the justice of the system. Here, indeed,
                    the pupils needed to be taught not to be mistrustful of the system itself, their role within the
                    system, and their limited rights.</p>
            <p>In America, on the other hand, Social mobility was less dependent upon one's background than
                    upon resourcefulness, hard work, courage, and ingenuity. With the westward movement and the opening
                    of new frontiers, the emergence of a new social order gave the American a sense of individualism,
                    necessitating a reliance on one's own judgment. "To educate children,"
                    concluded Neef, "is to prepare them for their future standing in life. We ought, therefore

                    grow up as rationalists who would muster evidence based on their own observations and who would not

                        world, he encouraged critical thinking and independent thought. This is a difference which
                        deserves further investigation and research.</item>

            <p>Neef attempted to realize the pioneer's desire to use the resources of science and
                    technology by strengthening each pupil's faith that he could effectively master frontier
                    life. His view of the well-educated man thus embodied the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A well educated man means a man who looks before he leaps, who examines everything and
                            believes nothing; who in every instance takes his own experience for his guides in acting,
                            who habitually and invariably refuses to act in obedience to his fancy or imagination or any
                            other suggestion of external testimony, who has acquired the habit of analysing every
                            subject that may interest him, who has acquired the habit of using his senses with certainty
                            and effect.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Thus, for Neef education involved more than the mere assimilation of information: it
                    denoted the ability to make dependable decisions based on personal experience, to make rational
                    inferences which would make life richer and more secure, and to base actions on prior analysis.
                    Education conceived in this way had moral as well as intellectual implications: because it fostered
                    the ability to predict an act's results and to weigh one's actions against their
                    anticipated consequences, a good general education of this type necessarily taught pupils to be more
                    free and self-reliant. Neef's curriculum was devised to enable his pupils to partake of the
                    kind of experiences that foster the growth of intelligent behavior. He provided ample opportunity
                    for responses to actual life situations, for planning to deal with these situations in the light of
                    different consequences, for the observations to study outcomes, and for various types of evaluations
                    of results.</p>
            <p>The third area of striking differences in their respective methods of education, closely allied to
                    the two already mentioned, was that Pestalozzi's was vocational: he tried to prepare the
                    pupil to find happiness, fulfillment, and flexibility in the trade of his parents or family.</p>
            <p>Neef did not share this view because the pioneers were oriented toward the future, not the past. This
                    outlook was the result of the young Republic's lack of any authoritarian system of civil or
                    religious institutions. Thus, the American pioneer's life was not constrained by precedents
                    of the past. Therefore, Neef preferred the following method: "As soon as a child knows how
                    to acquire any species of knowledge, as soon as it has acquired the habit &amp; skill of
                    analyzing, examining, investigating everything, it deems necessary to become acquainted with; <list type="footnotes">

                    it was the duty of the teacher to provide each child with an education that was less oriented toward
                    subject matter or the learning of a trade than toward good habits in the acquisition of correct
                    knowledge.</p>
            <p>The frontier experience, the mobility of American Social life, and the American people's
                    orientation toward the future rather than the past opened Neef's eyes to the real content
                    of education. In the following quote Neef went one step further by epitomizing the educational
                    system of his contemporaries: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Schooling goes on pretty well; that is schoolhouses are erecting, children are sent there,

                            and holy bibles are studied most devoutly. The consequence of all this ado will be as it
                            always has been, a plentiful crop of credulity; and therefore the next generation of men and

                            wretched as the drones, who live on the credulity and folly of the miserable drudging bees,

                            As to universal equal education of which the workers talk, this will take place as soon as
                            the bees shall unite their efforts to have themselves represented by honest bees of their

                            been thinking for more than thirty years past, I mean, since I became acquainted with my old
                            master Pestalozzi.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> The excerpt, although it avows to follow in the footsteps of the "old master
                    Pestalozzi," reveals Neef's innovative spirit, critical mind, and rational views.
                    While bearing in mind that schooling was not for schooling's sake, but for the acquisition
                    of knowledge to support freedom, Neef also hinted at the fact that his teaching methods had not been
                    accepted by most of the schools of his day and age.</p>
            <p>While Pestalozzi placed primary emphasis on the factor of social heritage when educating his pupils
                    for a specific trade, Neef seized on another concept—universal equal education of all
                    children, which to him meant that each pupil must be taught the skills of analyzing, examining, and
                    investigating, not specific subject matter. Thus Neef could oppose book-centered educators, who
                    often employed undemocratic, harsh methods. He realized that whenever education is restricted to the
                    study of books the work of the school usually becomes an end in itself: in classrooms thus cut off
                    from frontier life, the learning process inevitably must become as mechanical as the construction of
                    schoolhouses.</p>
            <p>Joseph Neef's rightful place as an innovative educator and educational philosopher should be
                    acknowledged. While he grounded his system of education in the ideas developed by Pestalozzi, Neef
                    went on to adapt these ideas to the Society he found in the New World. His belief in the democratic
                    ideals of the young Republic and his experience on the frontier, where the key to success was hard
                    work rather than ethnic, Social, or economic background, led him to advocate an equal education for
                    all. This education was to impart the skills necessary for investigation, examination, and analysis,
                    the processes which would enable pupils to base their decisions on personal experience and knowledge
                    rather than unquestioning acceptance of the teachings of others. Because he found a Society which
                    lacked Europe's fixed class structure and thus provided seemingly unlimited opportunities
                    for personal advancement, Neef <list type="footnotes">

                    appropriateness of condition. In America, such factors as personal choice and ability, rather than
                    social background, determined the trade one should enter. And finally, Neef believed that in a
                    Society free of the intellectual constraints of the type imposed by the Old World's archaic
                    religious and civil institutions education should aim at more than the mere imparting of specific
                    information. Rather, it should stress the process by which information was acquired, for by
                    mastering this process each person could gain an equal chance to participate in the exploitation of
                    vast natural resources, the exploration of new territory, and the foundation of a new civilization

                    and, for towns and cities, the house number. The enumerator then recorded for each person: name,

                    1900, the month and year of birth), marital status, place of birth, nativity of parents, whether

                            enumerators. For example, when questioning married persons in 1910 the enumerators were
                            instructed to "inquire whether they have been married before, and if this is the

                    </placeName>, and all foreign-born males over the age of twenty-one were asked their naturalization
                    status. All persons with an occupation were asked whether they were an employer, an employee, or
                    self-employed ("working on own account"). Those recorded as
                    "employees" were also queried as to whether they had been unemployed on the census
                    day (April 15) and how many weeks they had been out of work during the year 1909. The <hi rend="i">head</hi> of each family enumerated was asked whether the family's living quarters
                    were rented or owned and, if the latter, whether owned free or mortgaged. Finally, all native-born
                    males over fifty years of age and all foreign-born males who had immigrated before 1865 were asked
                    whether they had served in the Union or Confederate army or navy.</p>
            <p>The two articles cited above (see note 3) suggest a variety of ways in which the manuscript census
                    might be used in the study of family and community history. Those suggestions, by no means
                    exhaustive, apply to the 1910 census as well as to the earlier decennial enumerations. The 1910
                    canvass does, however, present some new research possibilities. In cases where a respondent did not
                    speak English, the enumerators were instructed to record the language he or she did in fact speak.
                    Thus, language can be used, as well as the national origins of the population, in examining a
                    community's heterogeneity. Likewise, the question concerning employment status (employer,
                    employee, self-employed) permits a new dimension to be added to studies of an area's
                    occupational structure and organization. The inquiry concerning number of weeks out of work during
                    1909 opens the way for consideration of unemployment patterns at the local level. Finally, the
                    question regarding Civil War service suggests interesting possibilities for demographic analysis, as
                    well as for explanation of the tenacity of both "bloody shirt" and "lost
                    cause" ideologies.</p>
            <p>In short, the 1910 manuscript federal census, like its predecessors, contains a wealth of data that
                    imaginative community historians can draw upon as they seek to understand the structure and texture
                    of life in the early twentieth century.</p>

                    "My Indiana Home" at the beginning of each program, the Hoosier connection would
                    not have been made by more than a handful of viewers. The series was, in content and structure,
                    clearly designed to speak to America about America and to let the Americans portrayed do the
                    speaking.</p>
            <p>In major ways the approach worked. Each of the programs succeeded in giving viewers entry into the
                    lives, concerns, moods, and humanness of the various protagonists. One could not help but be moved
                    by the dilemmas of the pizza parlor owner and his family struggling to keep home and business
                    afloat; by the gap between the hopes and the hard realities faced by the couple contemplating
                    marriage the second time around; by the shyness of the Republican candidate and the past mistakes of
                    the Democrat; by the quest for personal goodness and the hard rock of human nature as they shaped
                    the lives of the family belonging to a fundamentalist church.</p>
            <p>The lives portrayed were those of average people—the middle strata of middle America.
                    Davis's America is ‘just folks,’ as the saying goes: neither black
                    nor rich, neither fools nor genuises, neither heroes nor villains. One suspects that Robert and
                    Helen Lynd, the authors of the original <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> series, would have argued that the center of the series hit just below the middle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s classes on that hazy line where white collars show some blue. Thus, the
                    series is not best seen as finding the heart of middle America—lower middle would be more
                    accurate. Whether consciously or not, Davis focused mostly on an America that harks back to popular
                    images of the 1930s or to the "Honeymooner" lifestyle of the Cramdens and the
                    Nortons in the 1950s. These are good people who have yet to (or may never) make it, but who
                    aren't out of the running, and whose portraits are further softened by the absence of
                    stridency or bitterness. In this sense the lower-middle America portrayed here differs from the
                    Archie Bunker, hardhat images that dominated the media's middle America in the late 1960s
                    and early 1970s.</p>
            <p>The underlying sanity and frailty of Davis's Middletowners is the tie that binds the series.
                    The personae here are quintessential copers. They are people who have little understanding of the
                    economic, technological, and demographic forces impinging on their lives. In that, of course, they
                    are us, no matter who we are. Virtually every sequence in the series examines one or another coping
                    style or situation: the local politicians groping for popularity; the use of old-fashioned religion
                    as a gyroscope <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-078-4-084"/>

                    need to transform the pleasant game of basketball into a semi-philosophical, quasi-religious creed.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the sanity and humanness with which most Muncieites try to cope with vague but
                    powerful forces are less apparent in the series because of the decision made at P.B.S. not to air a

                    series as a whole, one suspects that it would simply have provided balance to the series as a
                    variant on mainstream styles of coping in middle America. One can appreciate the local apprehension
                    that led to protest against airing the sequence yet wish that those offended by it could understand
                    that the value of the series was needlessly damaged by their actions.</p>

                    translate scholarly findings for the general public or to provide scholarly perspective on field

                    featured families and individuals are analytical; it is an artistic piece to the degree that Davis
                    succeeds through cinema verite in making his subjects appear real and whole. Ironically, therefore,
                    its artistic success is its analytical failure. In execution, if perhaps not in conceptualization,

                    portrait of, not a documentary on, America. It is cinematic art, not cinematic humanities.</p>
            <p>The failure even to attempt to provide context or commentary on the views, feelings, and actions of
                    the protagonists in <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> Revisited</hi> is puzzling. Filmmakers are wont to remind academics that film works
                    best as a portrayer of feeling, mood and action; that, cinematically, context must arise from <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-078-4-086"/> within the film itself, not as an arbitrary intrusion of
                    scholarly words. Yet we can all think of cases where "talking heads" have, in
                    fact, worked well—some of us may even admire the likes of Alistair Cooke and Carl Sagan.
                    That contrary examples abound says nothing about the potential to use external as well as internal
                    commentary in filmmaking. My suspicion is that filmmakers who abjure "talking
                    heads" do so as artists alternately appalled at the thought of ruining perfectly good
                    footage with stuffy academic postscripts or aggrieved at the possibility that the commentator might
                    steal the show. It seems unlikely that a filmmaker of Davis's calibre would fall victim to
                    the former problem; as to the latter, one need only remember that for all the exposure <hi rend="i">Cosmos</hi> gave to Sagan, it hardly hurt the reputation of the producer, Adrian Malone.</p>
            <p>The fact that Davis was unwilling or unable to sense his subjects' inability to provide
                    context themselves, and unwilling (<hi rend="i">not</hi> unable) to do anything to fill that vacuum
                    was, in the end, doubly detrimental to the series. Lacking context, <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Revisited</hi> falls short as a truly exceptional inquiry into its subject, just as
                        <hi rend="i">Democracy in America</hi> would have had Toc-queville, like most
                    traveller-essayists, been content to describe what he saw. Moreover, its failure to provide context
                    may well account for the success of the protests leading to cancellation of the controversial
                    episode. Admittedly, this is an assertion, but it is an assertion premised on the critical role that
                    interpretation plays in helping people decide what to make of controversial acts or works.
                    Abjuration of that role has numerous risks. For <hi rend="i">

            <p>To lament the ramifications of the producer's decision to ignore the value of context and
                    assessment is not, however, to say that <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Revisited</hi> lacks quality or significance. Thinking about the meaning of
                    behavior requires a body of texts that scholars and citizens can interpret, separately or together.

                        </placeName> Revisited</hi> is such a text, often a compelling and provocative one. So long as
                    it is understood as an impressionistic, highly personal revelation of the hearts and minds of a
                    special segment of America caught in the act of coping, its place in the American tradition of
                    self-examination will be neither ignored nor exaggerated. While it does not deepen or amend the work
                    of scholars like the Lynds, it verifies the experiential reality that, among other things, lures
                    middle Americans to the tales of coping—comedic and melodramatic— that
                    saturate late-century popular culture in America. Having <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-078-4-087"/> viewed
                    this series, this reviewer feels no closer to understanding why modern times produce one response or

                    By Matthew E. Welsh. <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Collections</hi>, Volume LIV. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>As Professors York Willbern and Karl O'Lessker point out in their introductory essay in this
                    book, Matthew E. Welsh's governorship can lay just claim to special significance in the
                    recent history of Indiana for substantial accomplishments in such areas as civil rights, educational
                    reorganization, and the restructuring of state finances. Moreover, the popular Democratic
                    governor's success in carrying out a relatively liberal legislative program was achieved in
                    the face of a divided legislature and a Republican lieutenant governor in a state rightfully
                    regarded as wedded to a tradition of conservative politics. Thus Welsh's memoir of his
                    years in office comes as a particularly welcome source for the study of the state's recent
                    political history. For the most part it is a modestly stated, straightforward account, perhaps
                    rather blander than might be expected in its treatment of some of the controversies of the time, but
                    generally informative and even insightful. The memoir is especially good in showing how the governor
                    owed much of his effectiveness in getting legislation passed to his patience, his unshakably
                    moderate stance, and his prior experience as both a representative and senator in six sessions of
                    the Indiana General Assembly.</p>
            <p>In many ways the most interesting passages are the initial and the final sections, which deal
                    respectively with the gubernatorial campaign in 1960 and the presidential primary race four years
                    later. The first is a lively account, written with the assistance of campaign aide Richard Martin,
                    of how Welsh secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and went on to an upset victory over
                    his Republican opponent in an election in which the GOP won all but one of the remaining state
                    offices and Richard Nixon rang up a resounding majority over John Kennedy in the contest for
                    Indiana's electoral vote. In the last section Welsh collaborates with James McManus, his
                    news aide, in telling the often dramatic story of his successful campaign to defeat <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> governor George Wallace's presidential bid by standing in for Lyndon Johnson
                    on the 1964 Indiana primary ballot.</p>
            <p>Throughout the volume the former governor is careful to share credit for what was achieved with other
                    members of his <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-078-4-089"/> administrative team, and he adds at the close a
                    series of brief vignettes on the activities and leadership of the various executive branches. Eight
                    appendixes contain useful statistical tables as well as short narratives by two of Welsh's
                    close associates, Democratic legislative leader S. Hugh Dillin and Donald Foltz, director of the
                    Department of Conservation; also included is a list of state and county officers of both the
                    Democratic and Republican parties during the years 1961–1964. Although one might wish for
                    more intimate revelations of the governor's mind and spirit, historians of Indiana can
                    indeed be grateful for the publication of this memoir.</p>

            <p>Pictorial histories of American cities are hardy perennials for bookstore windows, public library
                    shelves, and coffee tables. The last decade has brought coast-to-coast series from at least three
                    publishing houses, in addition to numerous one-time efforts.</p>
            <p>The present volume on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is an example of the genre at its best. George W. Geib, as senior author, contributes a
                    narrative of growth and continuity in the evolution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His readable survey of the city touches on the high points of politics, the evolving
                    employment base, and the growth of public institutions. It also provides a capsule summary of the
                    changing face of downtown and the life cycle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> neighborhoods. Outside readers will be struck by the degree to which land use in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    town and small city of the nineteenth.</p>
            <p>The illustrations also make a major contribution. The historical material includes reproductions of
                    maps and documents as well as old photographs and drawings. Timothy Peterson, the historical
                    photography editor, drew most of the material from the collections of the Indiana Historical
                    Society, but he also tapped corporate collections, newspaper files, and other public institutions.
                    The book includes more than fifty contemporary photographs by Darryl Jones.</p>

                    </hi> meets the test. The illustrations are clearly reproduced and are well placed. The core
                    narrative is supplemented by short, independent photo-essays, boxed quotes, and excerpted sidelights
                    on local events.</p>
            <p>The last section of the book revives an old tradition in local history by providing six-hundred-word
                    sketches of thirty-eight business firms and nonprofit institutions that assisted the project as
                    "corporate sponsors." There is no evidence that the corporate contributors
                    influenced the body of the book, and the sketches recognize the role of private business as the

                    and blacks, but, the authors conclude, it has remained recognizably the same community. Working
                    class-business class distinctions, which the Lynds found pronounced, are reported to have largely
                    disappeared as economic conditions improved. The federal government's expanding presence
                    since the 1930s assisted efforts by all groups to achieve traditional family goals <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-078-4-091"/> such as home ownership, higher education, and care for the aged. Sex
                    role distinctions have softened, affecting adults and the treatment of children. The percentage of
                    women employed outside the home has doubled, although they still bear the principal burden of
                    housework. Parent-child conflict appears no greater and kinship ties seem stronger than in the

                    "notable for their sense of time and place, for their humor, for their characterizations,
                    and for the picture they give of an educated physician observing the people and events of a newly

                    the editors have ignored important primary sources in reconstructing the events of the case.
                    Considering its brevity, inclusion of this section in the introduction would have been more

            <p>Unlike most political and economic historians, earlier generations of frontier historians did not
                    ignore women. But the women they included are not the stuff of common humanity. Based on Hamlin
                    Garland or Ole Röolvaag, these portraits showed women either crushed or sanctified by the
                    frontier. <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-078-4-093"/> They tell more about the authors'
                    conceptions of "true womanhood than they do about women's lives on the frontier.</p>
            <p>Glenda Riley's <hi rend="i">Frontierswomen</hi> looks at how women actually lived in one
                    part of the American West. She focuses on white women who settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> from 1830, when an illegal squatter and her husband moved into Keokuk, to 1870, when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> no longer satisfied the census definition of a frontier. She poses essential questions:
                    Who were frontierswomen? Why did they go West? What work did they do? How did the Civil War matter?
                    Did the frontier foster "strong-minded" women?</p>
            <p>Riley approaches these questions by looking at individuals and by determining the range of answers.
                    She looks past the white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant "Madonna of the Prairies" and
                    sees also black and European women in those covered wagons. She remembers too that Native American
                    women peopled the frontier. Riley finds unwilling migrants, but also others married and single who
                    chose to move West or who at least recognized their own stake in a move decided by others.</p>
            <p>Riley examines the range of women's chores and notes the irony of the census label for
                    married women farmers—"not gainfully employed." She recognizes the
                    difficulties that women faced when their husbands went to the Civil War. But, she finds, "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> women quickly learned to manage a frontier society and a wartime society with
                    remarkable results" (p. 134). Like their urban sisters, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> frontier women carried on war relief work. Like their feminist sisters elsewhere, but
                    not in unusually large numbers, some <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> women lifted the banner of suffragism after the war.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the work of Riley, Julie Roy Jeffrey, Sandra L. Myers, Lillian Schlissel, John Mack
                    Farragher, and others, historians now understand more clearly the nature of frontier life for women.
                    And historians may now pose additional questions. The first might be what frontier women thought
                    about themselves and their world. What role did the church, neighbors, and women in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Omaha</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> play in defining these women's views? Did frontier women read? Did they read
                        <hi rend="i">Godey's Lady's Book?</hi> Did they mail order Butterick patterns?
                    Did they take credit for their contributions to the farm or discount themselves by saying simply
                    that they "helped"?</p>
            <p>As Riley correctly notes, historians of frontier women face multiple difficulties with
                    sources—the usual problems of research on women. But with books such as <hi rend="i">Frontierswomen</hi> available, frontier historians no longer must accept the illusions of the
                    forefathers.</p>

                    letters, an introduction, and new notes to make the American edition richer than the French.</p>
            <p>Theodore Bost came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1851. His most successful venture was courting Sophie Bonjour by mail. They married
                    the day after she arrived in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, in 1858. Sophie acted as ballast for Theodore's swings in mood, and her hard
                    work compensated for his frequent ill health. Excepting Theodore's trip to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> to see family and get medical treatment in 1871, the couple worked together for
                    sixty-two years. The letters span seventy years, beginning with Theodore's farming
                    apprenticeship in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> and ending with a letter from Sophie describing his death.</p>
            <p>Women's historians will appreciate seeing the same events through both Sophie's and
                    Theodore's eyes. Sophie took a much different view of childbirth, farming, their neighbors,
                    and events than did Theodore. For example, while Sophie dreamed "that my children were
                    butchered before my eyes" (p. 214), Theodore claimed "we were sleeping peacefully
                    in our isolated house" (p. 212) at the height of the Sioux uprising in 1862. Immigration
                    and Civil War historians will find Theodore's opinions interesting. His criticism of
                    American culture, the weather, and other immigrants reveals the difficulty of adjusting to a new
                    home. As a staunch antislavery Republican, Theodore's comments shed light on support for
                    Lincoln's war measures.</p>
            <p>The letters provide insight into the frustrations of those who expected to achieve a comfortable life
                    on the frontier. Bost's brothers were merchants and ministers in Europe. The Bosts moved
                    out of their leaky log cabin into a frame house and purchased a piano and sewing machine for Sophie
                    only with financial help from his family. They scrambled for a better income by keeping bees,
                    renting rooms in the summer, and teaching. Despite his status as a justice of the peace and a tax
                    assessor, Theodore's income was never secure. In 1874 he gave up farming, borrowing the
                    money from his brother to open a store in Excelsior, but after five years Sophie and Theodore <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-078-4-095"/> returned to farming. Six years later they left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

            <p>The collection is clearly edited with detailed notes and introductions which fill in the gaps between
                    letters. The volume is not compelling reading, but it is a useful addition to the literature on

                    value to buffs and scholars alike. Included are 337 informative, well-crafted, often original
                    entries on Lincoln's contemporaries, places where he lived and worked, issues and events
                    which shaped his career, and the collectors and biographers who preserved his memory. Wellchosen
                    illustrations (mainly photographic portraits and political cartoons) accompany most of the articles.</p>
            <p>Neely keeps his eye firmly fixed on Abraham Lincoln. Persons who influenced his era but not Lincoln
                    himself (e.g., Emerson, Garrison, W.T. Sherman) rate no separate entry; sketches of contemporaries
                    who are included highlight their relationship with Lincoln; and articles on <placeName>

                    </placeName> treat only Lincoln's views <hi rend="i">about</hi> such heroes. Not only the
                    great, but the humble and lowly whose lives brushed Lincoln's are to be found in this
                    book—even Grace Bedell, who suggested that Lincoln grow a beard; Horatio Taft, father of
                    Willie and Tad Lincoln's <placeName>

                    </placeName> playmates; Henry Wikoff, briefly a regular in Mary Lincoln's White House
                    salon; and Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckley. Indeed, Neely extravagantly gives
                    as much space to his portrait of Mrs. Keckley as he does to Andrew Johnson, Joshua Speed
                    ("Lincoln's only intimate friend"), Conscription, or Popular Sovereignty.</p>
            <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-078-4-096"/>
            <p>The quality of these essays is uniformly high. All rest upon the latest scholarship, make good use of
                    Lincoln's own letters and speeches, and possess a consistency and coherence which only a
                    single author could provide. Neely approaches Lincoln with sympathetic understanding but also with a
                    clear-eyed awareness of the foibles which made him human. Even the most controversial subjects, such
                    as Lincoln's record on civil liberties and his supposed losing battle against
                    Marfan's Syndrome, receive balanced, sensible treatment. Among the best articles are those
                    on Mary Todd Lincoln, Poetry, the Whig Party, <placeName>

            <p>The second volume of Stephen Z. Starr's trilogy about the Union cavalry could have been
                    entitled "Sheridan's Cavalry." It tells of the vast changes in the
                    organization, morale, and activities of the cavalry in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> after General Philip Sheridan took command in 1864. At that time much of the cavalry
                    still was detailed to the infantry, serving in small units as scouts, wagon guards, couriers, and
                    cattle drovers. Sheridan brought these troops together into a powerful, aggressive fighting force
                    that played a major role in the Union victory.</p>
            <p>The book has excellent descriptions of all the cavalry action from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Appomattox—and there was lots of action—but Starr also
                    describes the problems of keeping the large mounted force in the field. Even after three years of
                    war, the supply system could not provide the horses and forage needed by the cavalry.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to follow the movements of the cavalry on the maps included in the book; otherwise,
                    Starr's work is excellent. Better than any other book, it gives the Civil War student an
                    understanding of the very large contribution made by the cavalry in achieving the final victory.</p>

                    1865–1868</hi>. By Edward L. Gambill. (Ames: <placeName>

                    </placeName> State University Press, 1981. Pp. viii, 188. Notes, bibliographic essay, index.

            <p>Despite the attention historians have lavished on Reconstruction politics, most scholars have either
                    ignored the northern Democrats or treated them as a monolithic group of obstructionists. As Edward
                    L. Gambill demonstrates in this tightly organized monograph, northern Democrats were as torn by
                    factionalism as their Republican opponents. Adding detail to the recent work on northern Democrats
                    by Joel Silbey, Gambill shows how the Democratic party emerged from the Civil War with a stigma of
                    treason and without effective leadership.</p>
            <p>The party stumbled through the Reconstruction period searching for political and ideological
                    direction. Though wary of President Andrew Johnson and his conservative Republican advisors,
                    northern Democrats found themselves defending the president from the attacks of moderate and radical
                    Republicans. Yet the rapprochement between Johnson and his former party comrades was never complete,
                    and such movements for formal cooperation as the National Union party died aborning, destroyed by
                    mutual suspicion and bankrupt political strategy. Gambill argues that Democrats pursued a suicidal
                    policy of resistance to federal reconstruction policies and often obstructed compromise efforts
                    between President Johnson and the Republican majority in Congress. Although the author criticizes
                    the Democrats for appealing to northern racism, his own evidence proves that this was the only issue
                    that brought the party success. But even after striking victories in 1867, no strong national
                    leaders emerged; Horatio Seymour, George Pendleton, and Frank Blair were only pale reflections of
                    Stephen A. Douglas.</p>
            <p>Gambill asserts that the Democrats unintentionally helped the Republicans by rekindling the war
                    issues, and indeed in the short term the party faced disaster at the polls. Many readers will note,
                    however, the long-range effectiveness of Democratic strategy, for by 1874 the party had overcome the
                    opposition's bloody shirt tactics and recaptured control of the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>The author has examined the relevant newspapers and manuscript collections. He has written a
                    straightforward and largely uninspired narrative. Gambill's Democrats appear lifeless, and
                    there is not one interesting personal anecdote in the entire book. There are serious limitations to
                    this simple approach <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-078-4-098"/> to the subject. The author should have
                    analyzed Democratic voting patterns in Congress more rigorously; he makes perceptive comments on
                    particular pieces of legislation but attempts no overall interpretation. Despite some passing
                    remarks in the first chapter on constituency, Gambill neglects not only the rank and file but the
                    relationship of national issues to state and local ones. Might the Democrats, for example, have more
                    effectively exploited the ethnic and cultural divisions of the era? Although this book contains much
                    new information, there is still need for a solid, interpretative history of the northern Democrats
                    during Reconstruction.</p>

            <p>For years American labor history was the preserve of institutional historians. The focus was on the
                    rise of trade unions and their presumed role in dominating the goals and consciousness of American
                    workers, developments which were hailed as another variant of the theme of progress in American
                    history. The last decade, however, has produced a revolution in historical scholarship on American
                    labor. Historians have demonstrated that American workers have been more than narrowly focused
                    toilers who followed the dictates of their union leaders and simply sought wage increases and job
                    security. The most important insight emerging from the broader view of the American worker has been
                    the social and cultural context in which workers shaped their thought and protest. Studies have
                    shown them attempting to achieve social justice and equality, control of the work place, and even
                    family stability.</p>
            <p>David Alan Corbin's excellent study of southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wv">West Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> miners and their widespread protest in the years after 1880 provides another dimension
                    to the expanding definition of working-class culture in America. Corbin's miners marched on
                    government officials and fought protracted battles with state police not just as a response to
                    simple economic problems but ultimately because they tired of the confinement of their company towns
                    and felt that in America people should be treated <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-078-4-099"/> with more
                    dignity. These miners were not rampaging radicals or social revolutionaries but advocates of human
                    versus purely economic values. They espoused what Corbin labels "Americanism," a
                    call for "liberty, equality, and dignity" to all people and freedom from the
                    "absolutism of the coal companies" (p. 241). Corbin's miners, in other
                    words, were culture-bearing individuals shaped by long traditions of justice and the harsh realities
                    of the company town as well as economic hardship.</p>
            <p>Corbin is particularly penetrating when he analyzes the role of religion in mining enclaves. He
                    rightly notes the strong religious tradition that all men, whether they were southern whites,
                    blacks, or European immigrants, brought to the mining camps. He also deftly points out that miners
                    soon recognized that company-controlled churches could not satisfy their spiritual needs, especially
                    when most preachers admonished men against joining unions. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wv">West Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> the workers' solution was to transfer their religious fervor and economic
                    discontent to the one institution which gave them an outlet—the United Mine Workers of
                    America.</p>
            <p>This is certainly the stuff of provocative and insightful history. Corbin's account
                    contributes mightily to the dawning realization that culture and class were far from mutually
                    exclusive in industrial America.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Women and American Socialism, 1870–1920</hi>, Mari Jo Buhle traces the
                    history of the American socialist women's movement from its German-American origins in the
                    1870s to its collapse during the World War and Red Scare. This comprehensive and meticulously
                    researched treatment will become the definitive work on the subject.</p>
            <p>The history of the socialist women's movement as recounted by Buhle is the story of the
                    recurrent tension between class consciousness and gender consciousness. These themes emerge through
                    the "interplay of two parallel traditions, immigrant and native-born, with wholly different
                    modes of organi zation and world views" (p. xiii). German-American women, part of a
                    tradition that glorified women's place in the home and subordinated the women's
                    question to the class struggle, made the women's auxiliary their distinctive contribution
                    to the unfolding <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-078-4-100"/> socialist movement. Native-born socialists in
                    the women's movement of the 1880s and 1890s rejected the notion that class superceded
                    gender. They developed the independent women's club as their organizational form, sought to
                    remain separate from the male-dominated socialist movement, and placed a deep faith in the power of
                    womanly virtue to transform society. After the turn of the century, a new generation of women formed
                    the Socialist Party's Women's National Committee. The WNC abandoned the
                    nineteenth-century notion of women's "agency" and sought to make women
                    equal participants in the life of Socialist locals. The tensions between gender and class would not
                    go away, however. Questions relating to women in the labor movement, equal suffrage, and sexual
                    emancipation demanded separate approaches and special solutions. These unresolved problems, lukewarm
                    support from the party, and the general crisis of the left during the years 1917–1919 led
                    to the demise of the WNC and the collapse of the Socialist women's movement.</p>
            <p>The weakness of Buhle's book is that, although it is an excellent account of the activities
                    of the faithful, it fails to deal with the fact that much of their message fell on deaf ears. Why
                    were so many women unsympathetic or indifferent to socialism or the Socialist party? Buhle notes
                    that Socialist candidates in some localities blamed women for electoral defeats, but she regards
                    these reports as atypical. Was this really the case? The problem of women's
                    "alleged conservative tendencies" (p. 18) cannot be brushed off so lightly. If
                    Buhle's effort is a first step toward a rewriting of the history of American socialism, as
                    she suggests it might be, this sort of question must be dealt with.</p>

                    "Textual Commentary" stating the principles that the editors used in developing
                    this edition of the novel and a "Textual Apparatus" giving "Selected
                    Emendations in the Copy-<placeName>

                    </placeName>." The latter shows the exact revisions made in the manuscript by
                    Dreiser's first wife, Sara White Dreiser; by Dreiser's friend, Arthur Henry; by
                    Dreiser himself; and other changes. Included also are Dreiser's revised endings for
                    Chapters XLIX and L; "Sara White Dreiser's Revised Ending for Chapter L,"
                    which has been printed in all previously published editions; "Block Cuts Marked by Arthur
                    Henry and Accepted by Dreiser"; the chapter titles that were used in the Doubleday, Page
                    and Company edition; notes on Dreiser's word division; and a listing of all the editions of
                    the novel. Much of all this material will prove superfluous or tedious to many readers, but to the
                    Dreiser scholar it represents an incredibly painstaking and almost miraculous process of revelation,
                    not only about the novel as Dreiser originally wrote it but also about the author and his intentions
                    in the book.</p>
            <p>Sara Dreiser's revisions, mostly of mechanics, had the effect of making the characters speak
                    more formally than her husband had intended; Arthur Henry's cutting removed most of the
                    references to sex, so Hurstwood appears to have an idealistic love for Carrie, and Drouet's
                    pursuit of other women even while he is living with Carrie is reduced to innocent flirtation. Also,
                    since Henry lacked a real understanding of Dreiser's intentions, his cuts resulted in a far
                    less deterministic impression. Altogether Henry and Dreiser cut about 36,000 words, some 70 pages,
                    from the original. The first publisher, Double-day, required that all real names be changed and that
                    much of the profanity be omitted. The result of all these changes is that in the previously
                    published versions Carrie has less conscience and emotional depth, Hurstwood's possible
                    weaknesses (such as his extramarital adventures before he meets Carrie) are removed, Drouet becomes
                    a more likeable person, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ames</settlement>
                    </placeName> is less haughty and more believable. Furthermore, Dreiser's Spencerian
                    philosophy that man is insignificant, is controlled by fate, and cannot find lasting happiness is
                    muted. The claim of the editors of this edition that the restoration of the original version results
                    in "a more somber and unresolved work of art" (p. ix) is correct.</p>
            <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-078-4-102"/>
            <p>Of interest to Hoosier readers and scholars is the fact that Dreiser erred in placing <placeName>

            <p>During the Progressive Era at the beginning of this century, both the presidency and the press
                    underwent transformations resulting in their modernization. The often turbulent relationship between
                    these two old antagonists was never more interesting than during these two decades. As publicity
                    became an ever more significant factor in presidential leadership, a president's relations
                    with the press became more crucial. All the while, the press grew in power and acquired many forms
                    familiar to today's reader. The interaction between these two institutions during a period
                    recognized as formative for modern America provides the grist for interesting history.</p>
            <p>George Juergens approaches his subject from the perspective of the three Progressive Era presidents.
                    Theodore Roosevelt appears as the exciting figure he was; William Howard Taft as a bungler lost in
                    his own ineptitude; and Woodrow Wilson as an eloquent but stern statesmen who lacked the common
                    touch. There is, of course, nothing new in these profiles. Nevertheless, what the author manages to
                    accomplish in centering his book around them is to convey the idea that the manner in which a
                    twentieth-century president deals with the press reveals a good deal about him as a person and
                    leader. Juergens finds Theodore Roosevelt particularly effective in <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-078-4-103"/> handling his press relations. He was a gifted newsmaker who thrived on
                    the personal element in his relationship with newsmen; he was fascinated by journalism and
                    understood the medium. Some of the book's most interesting passages deal with
                    Roosevelt's management of news and his rapport with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wa">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> correspondents. Wilson's style of dealing with the press contrasted with
                    Roosevelt's. Yet in Wilson's time, as the author explains, the press acquired more
                    of its modern posture. Especially through the introduction of the presidential press conference,
                    Wilson developed a structure for dealing with the press that was a harbinger of things to come.
                    Juergens considers the press relations of Roosevelt and Wilson at length and allows readers to see
                    these men in their moments of irritation as well as triumph with journalists. By comparison, he
                    devotes one chapter, accurately entited "The Wrong Man," to President Taft. That
                    is space enough in which to explain this president's mishandling of press relations.
                    Juergens suggests that American journalism had entered the age of the reporter, a fact that
                    presidents henceforth would neglect, as Taft did, at their own peril.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">News from the White House</hi> is an appealing book. Aside from his neglect of
                    manuscript sources, Juergens's research is impressive, and his presentation of material
                    shows sound judgment. Readers will find this a well-written, informative, and engaging volume.</p>

                    </placeName> Public Health Service (PHS) had been conducting a study of the effects of untreated
                    tertiary syphilis on black men in <geogName>Macon County</geogName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, since the early 1930s. The "Tuskegee Study," so called because
                    Tuskegee was the county seat for this impoverished rural area, included as subjects 399 victims of
                    syphilis and 201 "controls" who were free from the disease. Although the disease
                    progressively ravaged its victims, the PHS made no effort to treat or cure its patients; rather, it
                    sought to compile statistics on the effects of advanced syphilis as they revealed themselves over a
                    lifetime by annual examinations and ultimately through autopsies.</p>
            <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-078-4-104"/>
            <p>The subjects were not told that they had syphili—only "bad blood," which
                    was not a synonym for syphilis in the black community. In effect they suffered experimentation with
                    their bodies without their consent. They did so because they were ignorant and because they received
                    modest benefits such as a burial fee, free aspirin, and "body tonics," and were
                    often chauffered to the examination site in an automobile by a zealous black nurse who gave a
                    club-like quality to the experience.</p>
            <p>The "Tuskegee Study" would seem objectionable for many reasons. Only blacks were
                    used, and perhaps one hundred men experienced premature death and many others needless
                    suffering—all the more so after penicillin became an effective cure beginning in the
                    1940s and 1950s. The PHS deliberately lied to the men under study, and no data assembled in the
                    study could ever prevent, find, or cure the disease. Nevertheless, few doctors in the PHS or in
                        <geogName>Macon County</geogName>, where physicians assisted the study, objected to it on
                    scientific or ethical grounds. Nor was there a national outcry when findings of the study were
                    periodically made public.</p>
            <p>The heart of James H. Jones's book is his analysis of this response. He weighs the evidence
                    fairly and judiciously. Racism was a factor, as was the absence of an effective cure for syphilis
                    when the study began. Bureaucratic momentum and the pretensions of science to supplant conventional
                    ethics, particularly the staple that the end justifies the means, also contributed.</p>
            <p>This is an important and well-researched book, but it has limitations; at times it is repetitive and,
                    because of the scientific discussion, unexciting. The author might have reinforced his case with a
                    discussion of the pretensions to power of physicians of that period. And he might have allowed for
                    the humanizing influences of the 1960s, which produced the exposure and denunciations in 1972.</p>

                    </placeName> was not vital to <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-078-4-105"/> American interests, but the
                    paradox was that "the less strategic an issue (and the less understood) the greater its
                    value as a symbol, precisely because of its unimportance" (p. 93). <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> became "an unwanted symbol" of America's resistance against
                    communism (p. 1591, and as the symbol became prominent with prolonged occupation the chances for
                    withdrawal became more remote. Though the occupation command claimed no political leanings, its
                    "affinity for wealthy elements" who favored "hierarchy, order, and the
                    status quo" (p. 41) placed Americans on the side of Koreans who spoke English and against
                    the guerrilla leaders who "could not bridge the linguistic and cultural gap" (pp.
                    41–42). By January, 1949, the State Department referred to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> as the "only remaining foothold of democracy" in northeast Asia (p.
                    161), and President Truman soon declared it "a beacon to the people of northern Asia in
                    resisting the control of communist forces" (p. 162). Thus the <placeName>

                    (p. 152).</p>
            <p>Dobbs's work raises several questions. He speculates that the Soviets believed that their
                    enemies had developed a "master plan" for the "encirclement" of
                    the USSR and "may have undertaken reasonably coordinated action in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> and Berlin to protest such a worldwide American plot" (p. 145). Thus the North
                    Koreans in June, 1948, shut off electric power in the country on the same day that the Soviets
                    blockaded Berlin, while the USSR perhaps intended its military withdrawal from <placeName>
                        <country reg="kn">North Korea</country>
                    </placeName> to pressure the <placeName>

                        <country reg="ko">South Korea</country>
                    </placeName>. On another matter, Dobbs argues that Acheson's "defense
                    perimeter" speech of January, 1950, was an attempt to exploit a rift between Moscow and
                    Peking by signalling Red <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> that the Truman administration was dropping support for the Nationalists. But as Dobbs
                    notes, such policy was impossible in a political environment in the <placeName>

                    Truman administration was unwilling to draw the line against Soviet expansion. Dobbs admits that
                    America's view of the postwar world as bipolar necessitated the belief that
                    "native communists were Soviet puppets" (p. 194) and led to the acceptance of
                    "repressive regimes" with "staunch anticommunist <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-078-4-106"/> credentials" (p. xi). The <placeName>

                    Worse, Dobbs concludes, America's later policies in Asia followed the pattern in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>: "policy drift, the subordination of local reality to requirements of the

            <p>With the growing interest in the preservation and restoration of our architectural heritage, it would
                    be hard to find a more timely publication than Jeff Dean's <hi rend="i">Architectural
                        Photography: Techniques for Architects, Preservationists, Historians, Photographers, and Urban
                        Planners</hi>. Dean's book is a primer intended specifically for the non-professional
                    photographer who may frequently need to take architectural photographs skillfully in conjunction
                    with his work or hobby. The book gives a concise review of the many problems encountered by the
                    architectural photographer and the techniques and equipment required to overcome them. Dean pays
                    particular attention to solving the problem of converging parallel lines in architectural
                    photographs, which is caused by the lack of perspective control on the lenses of most 35-millimeter
                    cameras, the standard equipment of most amateurs.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the author gives many useful hints on selecting the right film, lenses, screens,
                    filters, and other equipment; some basics of good photographic composition; and when the best times
                    of the day are for taking pictures. He also provides information on how to submit photographs to the
                    National <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-078-4-107"/> Register of Historic Places and the Historic American
                    Building Survey.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there is so much information in this brief volume that, unless the reader has some previous
                    knowledge, he may be overcome by all the new information. Anyone in this category might pay careful
                    attention to the frequent charts, tables, and diagrams. They are easy to comprehend and impart a
                    good understanding of the topics discussed.</p>
            <p>One area where the book is lacking is in its description of the schools of architectural photography.
                    The predominant school, called the "antiseptic" school, portrays buildings in
                    their most photogenic light. The other school regards these flawless photographs as
                    "misleading distortions of reality, masking truths by artificial purity" (p. 1).
                    Dean draws the line between these two schools but does not tell the reader how to take anything but
                    "antiseptic" photographs. A longer discussion in the chapter on composition,
                    dealing with the problem of how to capture the broader environment of which a building is a part,
                    would have been useful to those photo-historians who are attempting to show something about the
                    society that interacts with its architectural surroundings.</p>
            <p>Overall, however, the book is highly informative and easy to read. It can be recommended highly to
                    every amateur photographer.</p>

            <p>Historians who have had the pleasure of meeting Leland Sonnichsen have a healthy respect for his
                    scholarship and literary style—and for his charm and grace. Non-teaching historians
                    welcome his understanding of the frustrations and rewards of their work. He has bridged the gap
                    between the two segments of historical scholarship, and <hi rend="i">The Ambidextrous Historian</hi>
                    reflects that linking.</p>
            <p>In these essays, Sonnichsen addresses several concerns. He has sympathy and praise for the staffs of
                    small research libraries and for editors of state, local, and regional journals. He criticizes those
                    who would restrict the study of "real" history to the academy and those afraid to
                    look beyond their own small <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-078-4-108"/> areas of training, but he
                    encourages those who choose to deal with areas of seemingly narrow concern and do so with care and
                    skill.</p>
            <p>These concerns are raised in the context of the history of the West. Sonnichsen is well aware that
                    preservation of that history has its own problems: so much of it has happened so recently that it
                    often does not seem like history at all. Fortunately, as he notes in the essay "Victims of
                    Time," most pioneer communities cared that their own story be told and founded community
                    institutions through which it could be recorded.</p>
            <p>One group perhaps deserves more praise from Sonnichsen. As most who deal with researchers in western
                    historical agencies can attest, there is a growing group of fine teaching historians who use the
                    resources of such agencies and encourage their students to do likewise. These scholars, whose sense
                    of colleagueship goes far beyond the walls of academe, share their insights with—and
                    brighten the lives of—the librarians and editors for whom Sonnichsen has such regard.
                    They deserve his attention as well.</p>

                    Burnham, Ronald P. Formisano, Samuel P. Hays, Richard Jensen, and William G. Shade.

                    index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>This volume contains essays by several prominent scholars who synthesize the results of recent
                    vigorous work, much of it their own, in political history. In keeping with the emphasis on voting
                    and parties, they use realignment elections to describe the last two centuries of American politics.
                    The essays cover many significant topics, including the functions played by parties in the political
                    system, the social bases of partisanship, partisan ideology, eligibility to vote, and why
                    realignments occurred. The authors essentially present the state of the field, with a special
                    emphasis upon the ethnocultural approach to voting and parties. As such, the book is indispensable
                    to secondary level and college history and social science teachers and also to non-professionals
                    with a serious interest in political history.</p>
            <p>The perspective on electoral alignment eras leads those unfamiliar with the recent scholarship into
                    new historical terrain <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-078-4-109"/> where many familiar landmarks lose some
                    of their significance. For example, in his chapter on the second American system, William G. Shade
                    describes Van Buren as looming far larger than Old Hickory in such important areas as the effect of
                    his presidential candidacy on voting behavior, his contribution to the development of an ideology
                    justifying political parties and party systems, and his role in organizing the Democratic party.
                    Similarly, Paul Kleppner can write about the 1850–1892 period with scant reference to the
                    Civil War except as a formative experience reinforcing the loyalty of Republican partisans in the
                    North and of Democratic partisans in the South. To Walter Dean Burnham, the significant events in
                    the Progressive Era largely lay in the changes in the rules of the political
                    game—notably, registration laws, the Australian ballot, and the southern system of
                    disfranchising laws. Thus, the precipitous decline in voter turnout during the System of
                    '96 is far more noteworthy to Burnham than Mark Hanna's maneuverings, TRs
                    thunderings, or Wilson's muddlings. The chapters by Ronald P. Formisano on the Federalist
                    period and Richard Jensen on the post-New Deal Years also present perspectives in which the
                    conventional "major events" no longer provide a useful guide to American electoral
                    behavior.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most serious deficiency of the book lies in the authors' failure to view an
                    "electoral system" as something other than an era bounded by realigning elections.
                    A system is usually viewed as a set of interacting elements, not as a temporal period. The authors
                    do not specify the component elements or state the nature of the relationships linking them
                    together. As a consequence, the essays are seriously weakened on two counts. First, the analysis of
                    each era is without adequate focus—there is no clear statement of which phenomena are to
                    be explained, no discussion of the causal factors to be drawn upon to explain the phenomena, and no
                    development of a research design aimed toward thoroughly measuring the relative effects of such
                    factors. Second, the chapters vary substantially in their coverage of electoral politics. Some
                    aspects of the electoral system discussed for one era are not treated fully elsewhere. Because a
                    defined system is not explicitly followed through time, the promise of the title of informing one
                    about the "evolution" of electoral systems goes unfulfilled.</p>
