            <lg>
              <l><hi rend="b">E</hi>NGLAND&apos;S sun was slowly setting o&apos;er the
                hilltops far away,</l>
              <l>Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day;</l>
              <l>And its last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden fair,--</l>
              <l>He with footsteps slow and weary; she with sunny, floating hair;</l>
              <l>He with bowed head, sad and thoughtful; she with lips so cold and white,</l>
              <l>Struggled to keep back the murmur, &quot;Curfew must not ring
                to-night.&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Sexton,&quot; Bessie&apos;s white lips faltered, pointing to the
                prison old,</l>
              <l>With its walls so tall and gloomy, moss-grown walls dark, damp and cold,--</l>
              <l>&quot;I&apos;ve a lover in that prison, doomed this very night to die</l>
              <l>At the ringing of the curfew, and no earthly help is nigh.</l>
              <l>Cromwell will not come till sunset;&apos; and her lips grew strangeley
                white,</l>
              <l>As she spoke in husky whispers, &quot;Curfew must not ring
                to-night.&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Bessie,&quot; calmly spoke the sexton (every word pierced her young
                heart</l>
              <l>Like a gleaming death-winged arrow, like a deadly poisoned dart).</l>
              <l>&quot;Long, long years I&apos;ve rung the curfew from that gloomy shadowed
                tower;</l>

              <pb id="VAA9480-014" n="12"/>
              <l>Every evening, just at sunset, it has tolled the twilight hour.</l>
              <l>I have done my duty ever, with a purpose just and right.</l>
              <l>Now I&apos;m old I will not miss it. Curfew bell must ring
                to-night!&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thoughtful brow;</l>
              <l>And within her heart&apos;s deep center Bessie made a solemn vow.</l>
              <l>She had listened while the judges read, without a tear or sigh,--</l>
              <l>&quot;At the ringing of the curfew Basil Underwood <hi rend="i">must
                die.</hi>&quot;</l>
              <l>And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and bright;</l>
              <l>One low murmur, faintly spoken, &quot;Curfew must not ring
                to-night!&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>She with quick step bounded forward, sprang within the old church-door,</l>
              <l>Left the old man coming slowly, paths he&apos;d trod so oft before.</l>
              <l>Not one moment paused the maiden, but, with cheek and brow aglow,</l>
              <l>Staggered up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro;</l>
              <l>As she climbed the slimy ladder, on which fell no ray of light,</l>
              <l>Upward still, her lips repeating, <hi rend="i">&quot;Curfew shall not ring
                  to-night !"</hi></l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>She has reached the topmost ladder; o&apos;er her hangs the great, dark
                bell;</l>
              <l>Awful is the gloom beneath her, like the pathway down to hell.</l>

              <pb id="VAA9480-015" n="13"/>
              <l>See! the ponderous tongue is swinging; &apos;tis the hour of curfew now,</l>
              <l>And the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath, and paled her brow.</l>
              <l>Shall she let it ring? No, never! Her eyes flash with sudden light,</l>
              <l>As she springs, and grasps it firmly: &quot;Curfew shall not ring
                to-night!&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Out she swung,-- far out. The city seemed a speck of light below,--</l>
              <l>There &apos;twixt heaven and earth suspended, as the bell swung to and fro,</l>
              <l>And the sexton at the bell-rope, old and deaf, heard not the bell,</l>
              <l>Sadly thought that twilight curfew rang young Basil's funeral knell,</l>
              <l>Still the maiden, clinging firmly, quivering lip and fair face white,</l>
              <l>Hushed her frightened heart&apos;s wild throbbings: <hi rend="i"
                  >&quot;Curfew shall not ring to-night!&quot;</hi></l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>It was o&apos;er, the bell ceased swaying; and the maiden stepped once more</l>
              <l>Firmly on the damp old ladder, where, for hundred years before,</l>
              <l>Human foot had not been planted. The brave deed that she had done</l>
              <l>Should be told long ages after. As the rays of setting sun</l>
              <l>Light the sky with golden beauty, sires and dames, with heads of white.</l>
              <l>Tell the children why the curfew did not ring that one sad night.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>O&apos;er the distant hills comes Cromwell. Bessie sees him, and her brow</l>

              <pb id="VAA9480-016" n="14"/>
              <l>Lately white with sickening horror, has no anxious traces now.</l>
              <l>At his feet she tells her story, shows her hands, all bruised and torn;</l>
              <l>And her sweet young face, still haggard, with the anguish it had worn,</l>
              <l>Touched his heart with sudden pity, lit his eyes with misty light.</l>
              <l>&quot;Go! your lover lives,&quot; cride Cromwell. &quot;Curfew shall
                not ring to-night.&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Wide they flung the massive portals, led the prisoner forth to die.</l>
              <l>In the morning of his manhood. &apos;Neath the darkening English sky.</l>
              <l>Bessie came with flying footsteps, eyes aglow with love light sweet;</l>
              <l> Kneeling on the turf beside him, laid his pardon at his feet.</l>
              <l> In his brave, strong arms he clasped her, kissed her face upturned and white,</l>
              <l>Whispered, &quot;Darling, you have saved me, curfew will not ring
                to-night.&quot;</l>

              <l>But when the train reaches Verona it&apos;s almost sure to be late,--</l>
              <l>&apos;Specially when any one's waitin&apos;. Been gatherin&apos;
                flowers, I see?</l>
              <l>Ah, well! they&apos;re better company than a rough old fellow like me.</l>
            </lg>

            <pb id="VAA9480-017" n="15"/>
            <lg>
              <l>You noticed the graves &apos;neath the willows, down there where the blossoms
                grew?</l>
              <l>Well, yes, there&apos;s a story about them, almost too strange to be true;</l>
              <l>&apos;Tis a stranger, sweeter story than was ever written in books;</l>
              <l>And God made the endin&apos; so perfect -- There, now I see by your looks</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>I will have to tell the story: Let me see; &apos;twas eight years ago,</l>
              <l>One blusterin&apos; night in winter, when the air was thick with snow;</l>
              <l>As the freight came round the curve there they beheld a man on the track,</l>
              <l> Bravin&apos; the storm before him, but not heedin&apos; the foe at his
                back.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>And ere a hand could grasp the bell-rope, or a finger reach the rod,</l>
              <l>One sweep from the cruel snow-plough had sent the man&apos;s soul to its
                God!</l>
              <l>They laid him out here in the freight-house. I stayed with him that night;</l>
              <l>He&apos;d one of the pleasantest faces, so hopeful and young and bright.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>There was only a worn-out letter; I know it by heart -- it said:</l>
              <l>&quot;Dear John: Baby May grows finely. I send you this curl from her head.</l>
              <l>We will meet you at Brackenboro&apos;. The grandfather&apos;s sad and
                lone,</l>
              <l>But I read him your kind words, sayin&apos;, when we&apos;ve a home of our
                own,</l>
            </lg>

            <pb id="VAA9480-018" n="16"/>
            <lg>
              <l>He shall sing the songs of old England beneath our own willow tree.&quot;</l>
              <l>That was all there was of it, lady, and &apos;t was signed just &quot;Alice
                Leigh.&quot;</l>
              <l>So we made him a grave in the mornin&apos; and buried the man out there,</l>
              <l>Alone, unmourned, in a stranger&apos;s land, with only a stranger's prayer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>But when he&apos;d slept in his lonely grave out there nigh on to a year,</l>
              <l>Ray&apos;s freight ran into a washout by the culvert, away down here;</l>
              <l>There were only two passengers that night, dead when we found them there,--</l>
              <l>A sweet little English woman, and a baby with golden hair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>On her breast lay the laughing baby, with its rosy finger-tips</l>
              <l>Still warm, and the fair young mother with a frozen smile on her lips.</l>
              <l>We laid them out here in the freight-house, I stayed that night with the dead;</l>
              <l>I shall never forget the letter we found in her purse; it said:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Dear Alice: Praise God I&apos;ve got here! I&apos;ll soon have a
                home for you now;</l>
              <l>But you must come with the baby as soon as you can anyhow.</l>
              <l>Comfort the grandfather, and tell him that by and by <hi rend="i">he</hi> shall
                come,</l>
              <l>And sing the songs of old England &apos;neath the willows beside our home;</l>
            </lg>

            <pb id="VAA9480-019" n="17"/>

            <lg>
              <l>For, close by the door of our cottage I&apos;ll set out a willow tree,</l>
              <l>For his sake and the sake of old England. Lovingly yours, John Leigh.&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>The tears filled my eyes as I read it; but I whispered, &quot;God is
                just!&quot;</l>
              <l>For I knew that the true heart yonder--then only a handful of dust--</l>
              <l>Had drawn this sweet little woman right here and God&apos;s merciful love</l>
              <l>Had taken her from the sorrow to the glad reunion above!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>So, close by the grave of the other we laid her away to rest,--</l>
              <l>The golden-haired English mother, with the baby upon her breast.</l>
              <l>I planted those trees above them, for I knew their story, you see;</l>
              <l>And I thought their rest would be sweeter &apos;neath their own loved willow
                tree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Five years rolled along; and, lady, my story may now seem to you</l>
              <l>Like a wonderful piece of fiction; but I tell you it is true,--</l>
              <l>As true as that God is above us! One summer day, hot and clear,</l>
              <l>As the train rolled into the station, and stopped to change engines here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Among a company of Mormons came a tremblin&apos; whitehaired man;</l>

              <l>Of a place called Brackenboro&apos;? and how far have I yet to
                go?&quot;</l>
              <l>&quot;It&apos;s the next station north,&quot; I answered,
                &quot;only thirteen miles below.&quot;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>His old face lit up for a moment with a look of joy complete;</l>
              <l>Then he threw up his hands toward heaven, and dropped down dead at my feet!</l>
              <l>&quot;Old Hugh Leigh is dead!&quot; said a Mormon, &quot;and sights
                o&apos; trouble he&apos;s be&apos;n.</l>
              <l>Nothin&apos; would do when we started but that he must come with us then</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>To find Alice, John, and the baby; and his heart was well-nigh broke</l>
              <l>With waitin&apos; and watchin&apos; in England for letters they never
                wrote.&quot;</l>
              <l>So we buried him there with the others, beneath the willow tree.</l>
              <l>&apos;Twas God&apos;s way of endin&apos; the story--more perfect than
                man&apos;s could be.</l>

              <l>While a fond look shone in his eye of brown:</l>

              <l>To-morrow the bell from the tower will ring</l>
              <l>A joyful peal. Was there ever a king</l>
              <l>So truly blest, on his royal throne,</l>
              <l>As I shall be when I claim my own! &quot;</l>

              <l>&apos;Twas a fond farewell; &apos;twas a sweet good-by;</l>
              <l>But she watched him go with a troubled sigh,</l>
              <l>As into the basket, that swayed and swung</l>
              <l>O&apos;er the yawning abyss, he lightly sprung;</l>
              <l>And the joy of her heart seemed turned to woe</l>
              <l>As they lowered him into the depths below.</l>
              <l>Her sweet young face, with its tresses brown,</l>
              <l>Was the fairest face in the mining town.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Lo, the morning came! but the marriage-bell</l>
              <l>High up in the tower rang a mournful knell</l>
              <l>For the true heart buried &apos;neath earth and stone,</l>
              <l>Far down in the heart of the mine alone,--</l>
              <l>A sorrowful peal on their wedding-day</l>
              <l>For the breaking heart and the heart of clay;</l>
              <l>And the face looking out from her tresses brown</l>
              <l>Was the saddest face in the mining town.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Thus time rolled along on its weary way,</l>
              <l>Until fifty years with their shadows gray</l>
              <l>Had darkened the light of her sweet eyes&apos; glow,</l>
              <l>And had turned the brown of her hair to snow.</l>
              <l>Oh! never a kiss from a husband&apos;s lips,</l>
              <l>Or the clasp of a child's sweet finger-tips,</l>
              <l>Had lifted one moment the shadows brown</l>
              <l>From the saddest heart in the mining town!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Far down in the depths of the mine, one day</l>
              <l>In the loosened earth they were digging away,</l>
              <l>They discovered a face, so young, so fair;</l>
              <l>From the smiling lips to the red-gold hair</l>
              <l>Untouched by the finger of Time&apos;s decay,</l>
              <l>When they drew him up to the light of day,</l>
              <l>The wondering people gathered round</l>
              <l>To gaze on the man thus strangely found.</l>

              <l>Then a woman came from among the crowd,</l>
              <l>With her long white hair, and her slight form bowed.</l>
              <l>She silently knelt by the form of clay,</l>
              <l>And kissed the lips that were cold and gray.</l>
              <l>Then the sad old face, with its snowy hair</l>
              <l>On his youthful bosom lay pillowed there.</l>
              <l>He had found her at last his waiting bride,</l>

              <l>The conductor heard her story</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">As he held her dimpled hand,</l>
              <l>And sighed for the sad hearts breaking</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">All over the troubled land.</l>
              <l>He tenderly dried the teardrops</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">From her blue eyes brimming o&apos;er,</l>
              <l>And guarded her footsteps safely</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Till she reached the White House door.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>The President sat at his writing;</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">But the eyes were kind and mild</l>
              <l>That turned with a look of wonder</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">On the little shy-faced child.</l>
              <l>And he read Fred's farewell letter</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">With a look of sad regret.</l>
              <l>&quot;&apos;Tis a brave young life,&quot; he murmured,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">&quot;And his country needs him yet.</l>
              <l>From an honored place in battle</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">He shall bid the world good-by;</l>
              <l>If that brave young life is needed,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">He shall die as heroes die.&quot;</l>

            <lg>
              <l><hi rend="b">I</hi>F there&apos;s one thing makes me happy, more &apos;n
                another,&apos;tis to sit</l>
              <l>Here above that little valley, lookin&apos; right down into it.</l>
              <l>It reminds me of the Christmas present I brought home last year;</l>
              <l>One o&apos; them queer circumstances people like to tell, an&apos;
                hear.</l>
            </lg>

            <pb id="VAA9480-028" n="26"/>

            <lg>
              <l>I&apos;m a rough, plain spoken farmer, as most any one can see,</l>
              <l>An&apos; the story&apos;ll get no fancy touches if it comes from me.</l>
              <l>But you&apos;d like to hear me tell it? Well, sit down there in the shade.</l>
              <l>Right below us is the finest picture God has ever made.</l>
              <l>Rest your eyes there while I&apos;m talkin&apos;. I&apos;m a rough man,
                as you see--</l>
              <l>Where Joe got his artist talent is a mystery to me.</l>
              <l>For the only brush I&apos;ve handled was to paint the old cow-shed,</l>
              <l>An&apos; his mother wastes her talents makin&apos; pies, an&apos;
                bakin&apos; bread.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Say! but I <hi rend="i">was</hi> proud to win her. Finest lass for miles about.</l>
              <l>Hair the color o&apos; the cowslips from the meadows peepin&apos; out;</l>
              <l>Cheeks as red as Seek-no-furthers; eyes -- Excuse me, there I go</l>
              <l>Takin&apos; up the time with Lucy, when you want it spent on Joe.</l>
              <l>Joe, our black sheep, always riled me, didn&apos;t care for work like Jim,</l>
              <l>Spent his time in idle dreamin&apos;. But his mother favored him.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Couldn&apos;t help it. &apos;Twas her nature. Always loved the weakest
                things;</l>
              <l>Had good words for ev&apos;rybody; took the pizen out o&apos; stings;</l>
              <l>Said Joe&apos;s laziness was talent; loved her stalwart laddies too;</l>
              <l>But the weak one was her fav&apos;rite -- what else could his mother do?</l>


              <pb id="VAA9480-029" n="27"/>

              <l>I was always pickin&apos; at him, and &apos;twas plain enough to see</l>
              <l>That there wasn&apos;t much affection wasted &apos;twixt the lad
                an&apos; me.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Such things can&apos;t go on forever, an&apos; one day we had a row.</l>
              <l>I was mad, an&apos; said a good deal I don&apos;t like to think of now.</l>
              <l>Then his mother pleaded for him with her face all wet with tears,</l>
              <l>Said that he would be an honor to us in the comin&apos; years.</l>
              <l>How I scoffed at that, an&apos; told him to go earn his livin&apos;
                then.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>That was five years last November. Lucy&apos;s face was in its prime,</l>
              <l>With the light o&apos; girlhood on it; just toned down a bit by time;</l>
              <l>But it saddened, an&apos; it whitened, an&apos; I watched her, day by
                day,</l>
              <l>With a heartache I can&apos;t tell you, as her brown hair turned to gray.</l>
              <l>More than Joe had ever cost me I spent in my search for him,</l>
              <l>While his mother&apos;s face grew sadder, an&apos; her watchin&apos;
                eyes grew dim.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Turn again toward the valley. There&apos;s a picture worth your while,</l>
              <l>With the sunlight restin&apos; on it like the touch o&apos; God&apos;s
                own smile,</l>
              <l>Keep your eyes there while I&apos;m talkin&apos;. You&apos;ll not see
                the like again.</l>


              <pb id="VAA9480-030" n="28"/>


              <l>Gradu&apos;ly I turned home matters over to the care o&apos; Ben,</l>
              <l>An&apos; I spent my time with business. Though the home folks didn&apos;t
                know</l>
              <l>I was seekin&apos; among th&apos; lowly for my Lucy&apos;s lost boy
                Joe.</l>
            </lg>


            <lg>
              <l>I was just about discouraged when, as Christmas time drew nigh,</l>
              <l>I was lookin&apos; at some presents, thinkin&apos; what I&apos;d better
                buy,</l>
              <l>An&apos; I heard the people talkin&apos;, on the street, an&apos;
                ev&apos;ry where,</l>
              <l>&apos;Bout a paintin&apos;, an&apos; a fortune offered by a
                millionaire</l>
              <l>To the artist for his picture, but he wouldn&apos;t let it go.</l>
              <l>So, I paid the price to see it, thinkin&apos; all the while o&apos;
                Joe.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Joe -- a-wanderin&apos;, most likely homeless, friendless. First I knew</l>
              <l>I was in the crowd before it. &apos;Twixt two heads a bit o&apos; blue</l>
              <l>Caught my eye, an&apos; then I saw it all just as you see it there</l>
              <l>In God&apos;s paintin&apos;. That green valley, with the sunshine in the
                air,</l>
              <l>With the river runnin&apos; through it, an&apos; two clouds, like banks
                o&apos; snow,</l>
              <l>An&apos; I knew that he had done it. Joe, my Lucy&apos;s lost boy, Joe.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>&quot; Joe,&quot; I cried, &quot; come home to mother.&quot;
                An&apos; the people thought me mad,</l>
              <l>When I climbed an&apos; kissed the picture, for the sake o&apos; Lucy's
                lad.</l>
              <l>But a man stepped out before them, with a face I didn&apos;t know;</l>




              <pb id="VAA9480-031" n="29"/>

              <l> Took me in his arms, an&apos; called me: --&quot; Father!&quot; in the
                voice o&apos; Joe.</l>
              <l>Then he stood right there before me like a king, so tall, an&apos; grand;</l>
              <l>Joe, for whom I'd been a-seekin&apos; among th&apos; lowly o&apos; the
                land.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Christmas morn you should &apos;a&apos; seen me, steppin&apos; as
                though I walked on air.</l>
              <l>Happy? There was not a youngster half so happy anywhere.</l>
              <l>An&apos; when I brought out my present smuggled in upon the sly,</l>
              <l>Lucy--now ain&apos;t women queer though? When they&apos;re glad they always
                cry--</l>
              <l>Yes, Joe&apos;s welcome home was something to remember. Ben an&apos;
                Jim.</l>
              <l>An&apos; the family altogether&apos;s everlastin&apos; proud
                o&apos; him.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>&quot;But who shall plan the structure?&quot; Black sweeps the swollen

              <l>While anxious faces gather dark-browed on either side.</l>
              <l>And, lo! before Tenorio a youthful form appears,</l>
              <l>Tall, dark, and slender, seeming a very boy in years.</l>

            <lg>

              <l>Across the young face hopeful there swept a dash of pain.</l>
              <l>One glance, half love, half pity, he gave his girlish wife,</l>

            <lg>
              <l>&quot;To-morrow morn the people will gather on the shore,</l>
              <l>And I shall see the sun rise o&apos;er Spain's green hills once more;</l>
              <l>Once more I&apos;ll clasp you, darling, close to my breaking heart,</l>

              <l>Ah! death indeed were welcome, forgetfulness were kind,</l>
              <l>To veil the dark dishonor and shame I leave behind.&quot;</l>

              <l>No word spoke Catalina, but when he sought his bed</l>
              <l>To the bridge of San Martin she flew with noiseless tread.</l>
              <l>A lurid spark she kindled, the night-winds fanned the flame,</l>
              <l>And soon the fiery billows had saved her husband&apos;s name.</l>

              <l rend="ti-2">Stood a maiden, young and fair;</l>
              <l>Rain-drops gleamed on cheek and forehead,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Rain-drops glistened in her hair.</l>
              <l>Where the bridge had stood at morning</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Yawned a chasm deep and black;</l>
              <l>Faintly came the distant rumbling</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">From the train far down the track.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Paler grew her marble features;</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Faster came her frightened breath,--</l>
              <l>Charlie kissed her lips at morning,--</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Charlie rushing down to death!</l>
              <l>Must she stand and see him perish?</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Angry waters answer back;</l>
              <l>Louder comes the distant rumbling</l>

              <l>Springing from the heart&apos;s devotion</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">In the forming of a thought.</l>
              <l>From her waist she tears her apron,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Flings her tangled tresses back,</l>

              <l rend="ti-2">Right and left she flings the flame.</l>
              <l>Turns and speeds with airy fleetness</l>

              <l>Hark! a shriek prolonged and deafening,--</l>

              <l>Flaming torch and flying footsteps,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Fond eyes gaze in vain to see.</l>
              <l>With a white face turned to heaven,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">All her sunny hair thrown back.</l>
              <l>There they found her, one hand lying</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Crushed and bleeding on the track.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>

              <l>Gold they gave her from their bounty;</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">But her sweet eyes wandered back</l>

              <l>A thousand miles lay &apos;twixt their homes,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Watered by many a crystal stream;</l>
              <l>Dame Nature reared a thousand domes,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">And spread a thousand plains between.</l>
              <l>They met, clasped hands, scorned bolt and bar.</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Which cautious age puts on the heart;</l>
              <l>Shared room and purse, then wandered far</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">By quiet ways and busy mart.</l>
              <l>By San Antonio&apos;s winding stream,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Through narrow streets, the two lads passed,</l>

              <l>Where'er its somber shadow falls</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Is hallowed ground,-- more sacred none!</l>
              <l>Within its portals stood a man</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Like some grim shadow on Time&apos;s shore,</l>
              <l>Gray as the walls about him, and</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Like them a memory, nothing more,--</l>
              <l>A page from out the deathless past!</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Through film of years, and rising smoke</l>

              <l rend="ti-2">And confronted us in that lonely place.</l>
              <l>We two, being one, had the same desire.</l>
              <l>He spoke her name. With my hand on the hilt</l>
              <l>Of my sword I listened. Like liquid fire</l>
              <l>The burning blood coursed through my swollen veins,</l>
              <l>And hardened the length of them into chains.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>What happened? I know not. Ronald lay there</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">At my feet. The sod grew red at his side --</l>
              <l>A river of red--crept up to his hair;</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Lapped his cheek; spread its gory fingers wide.</l>
              <l>A flower dripped it over its brimming cup;</l>
              <l>Earth&apos;s thirsty lips parted and drank it up.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>And straightway an Angel confronted me,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">With feet, ankle-deep in that awful wound.</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">My senses reeled, and the heart of me swooned</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">At sight of my crime. He reached for my sword,</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">And traced on my forehead a burning word,</l>
              <l>Thus branding me &quot;Cain&quot; for eternity.</l>

              <l>And all the land was fragrant beneath her dainty feet.</l>
              <l>The pearly dew-drops glistened on rose-hedge, bush and tree,</l>
              <l>And flashed their sparkling jewels all over Germany.</l>

              <l>Grew tender in his musings, for Spring was young and sweet.</l>
              <l>For him the glad-voiced songsters sent forth their notes of glee,</l>
              <l>And Heaven seemed showering blessings all over Germany.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>He met a little maiden with tear-drops in her eyes,</l>
              <l>And to his kindly questions she sobbed out low replies.</l>
              <l>&quot;My father died in battle, kind sir,&quot; she said, &quot;and we

              <l>What cares he for our sorrows? Oh, sir, could he but own</l>
              <l>A heart as warm and tender as thine, there soon would be</l>
              <l>A sound of thanks ascending all over Germany.</l>

            <lg>
              <l><hi rend="b">N</hi>IGHT rolled its somber curtain back to greet the dawning
                day,</l>
              <l>Black swept the angry Danube on its terror-freighted way.</l>
              <l>Great blocks of ice came crashing down amid the torrent&apos;s roar,</l>
              <l>And seething waters flung their spray upon the icebound shore.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Across that raging, roaring space where Leopoldstadt lies,</l>
              <l>Back to Vienna&apos;s listening ear came moans and sobs and cries,--</l>
              <l>Came piteous voices pleading. &quot;We are starving bring us bread!
                &quot;</l>
              <l>And white hands reached imploring o&apos;er the waters dark and dread.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>The Emperor Francis Second soon filled the boats with food;</l>
              <l>But who will face the dangers of this angry, seething flood?</l>
              <l>He begs, implores, and threatens: bribes and promises are vain,</l>
              <l>While from his famished people comes that anguished wail again.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>&quot;I cannot see my people starve!&quot; The Emperor Francis cries;</l>
              <l>A quiver thrills his earnest voice, a moisture dims his eyes.</l>
              <l>Alone he leaps into a boat and pushes from the shore;</l>
              <l>&quot;They&apos;d give their lives for me,&quot; he said, &quot;and
                I can do no more.&quot;</l>

              <l> A hundred men are ready now to brave the swollen tide.</l>
              <l>If death must come to their brave king, they&apos;ll meet it at his side.</l>
              <l>Behold they reach the distant shore! The hungry ones are fed;</l>
              <l>And mothers kiss the hands that bring their starving children bread.</l>

              <l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE window blazed out with its Christmas light,</l>
              <l>&apos;Twas decked with holly and mistletoe bright;</l>
              <l>It was fairy-land. There were sweets and toys,</l>
              <l>There were dolls in costume and shepherd boys.</l>
              <l>There was Christmas joy in the air about,</l>
              <l>But a poor child stood in the cold without,</l>
              <l>With her wan, white face, and her tearful eye,</l>
              <l>And the happy mothers they passed her by.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>&quot; I will stay right here by the Christ-child&apos;s
                home,&quot;</l>
              <l>She said, &quot;for at midnight he&apos;s sure to come,</l>
              <l>I&apos;ll wait in the light so he can&apos;t forget,</l>
              <l>For I&apos;ve never had any Christmas yet.</l>
              <l>He couldn&apos;t come into our room so drear,</l>
              <l>But the Christ-child will surely find me here,</l>
              <l>And he&apos;ll bring me a doll like that, or this,</l>
              <l>And maybe he&apos;ll give me a Christmas kiss.&quot;</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>At midnight the beautiful Christ-child came,</l>
              <l>In garments of light, on a cloud of flame,</l>
              <l>He bent o&apos;er the child in that bleak, cold place,</l>
              <l>He warmed her, and fed her and kissed her face.</l>


              <pb id="VAA9480-058" n="56"/>


              <l>He lifted her out of her life&apos;s dark night,</l>
              <l>And carried her into the Christmas light.</l>
              <l>But when it was morning the people said</l>
              <l>That a child was found by the window dead.</l>

              <l rend="ti-2">And now they come home to us just once a year.</l>
              <l>Little Mary will come, our dear little Mary--</l>

            <l>When all the land was fragrant beneath the feet of Spring.</l>
            <l>Two little sisters wandered together, hand in hand,</l>
            <l>Along the dusty highway, their bare feet soiled and tanned.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>&apos;Twas not a childish sorrow that dimmed their eyes with tears;</l>
              <l>Their little hearts were burdened, with grief beyond their years.</l>
              <l>The bright-eyed daisies blossomed in valley and in glen;</l>
              <l>The robins sang their sweetest, spring smiled, but not for them.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Beneath the trees of Whitehall, within their shadows brown;</l>
              <l>From out the royal palace the queen came walking down.</l>
              <l>She saw the children standing together, side by side,</l>
              <l>And gazing down with pity she asked them why they cried.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Dear Lady,&quot; said the eldest, &quot;my little sister Bess</l>
              <l>And I, have come together, a hundred miles, I guess.</l>
              <l>Sometimes the roads were dusty and sometimes they were green.</l>
              <l>We got so tired and hungry. We want to see the queen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>"Our mother&apos;s sick, dear lady. She cries &apos;most all the day.</l>
              <l>We hear her telling Jesus when she thinks we're at play;</l>

              <l>She tells him all about it, how, when King James was king,</l>
              <l>We were so rich and happy and had most every thing.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;We had our own dear father, at home beside the Thames;</l>
              <l>But father went to battle because he loved King James.</l>
              <l>And then things were so different, I cannot tell you how --</l>
              <l>We haven&apos;t any father, nor any nice things now.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Last night our mother told us they&apos;d take our home away,</l>
              <l>And leave us without any, because she couldn't pay.</l>
              <l>So, then, we came together right through the meadows green,</l>
              <l>We prayed for God to help us, and take us to the queen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;Because our mother told us that, many years ago,</l>
              <l>The queen was James&apos; little girl, and, lady, if &apos;twas so</l>
              <l>I know she&apos;ll let us keep it -- our home beside the Thames,</l>
              <l>For father went to battle because he loved King James.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>&quot;If we should have to leave it, I&apos;m sure our mother&apos;d
                die,</l>
              <l>For there&apos;s no place to go to -- no place but in the sky,&quot;</l>
              <l>Her simple story finished she gazed up in surprise</l>
              <l>To see the lovely lady with tear-drops in her eyes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>And when the English daisies, dew-damp had gone to rest;</l>
              <l>And when the English robins had sought each downy nest,</l>
              <l>A carriage, such as never had passed that way before,</l>
              <l>Let down two little children beside the widow's door.</l>

              <l>They brought the weeping mother a letter from the queen,</l>
              <l>Her royal seal was on it, and folded in between,</l>
              <l>A slip of paper, saying; &quot;The daughter of King James,</l>

              <l>Mamma said she&apos;d send for the Brownie men.</l>
              <l>And here is my Dolly as good as new.</l>
              <l>Her hair has growed in, and is curly, too;</l>
              <l>Her eyes are both straight, and each little place</l>
              <l>The measles left has gone from her face;</l>
              <l>Her arms are as good as before she fell,</l>
              <l>And it was the Brownies who made her well.</l>
