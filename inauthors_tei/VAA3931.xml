                        <p>AT nightfall of a day in May, 1833, there was lamentation in a fisher's
                            hut on the banks of the Mexican lake, Chapala. The shadows of St.
                            Michael's hill, which rises high and rocky out of the town's centre, had
                            long since fallen across the Chapala plaza. The sun had set in red and
                            gold, and the waves, as the darkness came on, were rising slowly. The
                            hut was of adobe with steep, thatched roof. Its rooms were two and its
                            floors earthen. There were many other huts like this in a long line to
                            the east, and between them and the water stretched smooth brown sand
                            where white nets, for two hundred yards, were extended on poles to dry.
                            The nets should be taken down at this hour or earlier, and rolled into a
                            ball, and the tiny black boat that should carry them into the lake a
                            little later on rode restless and empty at the shore. The larger <hi
                                rend="i">canoa,</hi> too, its one sail furled, tossed yonder on the
                            waves, unused for days, &#151; and the nets remained extended with
                            the wind fluttering them.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-008" n="2"/>
                        <p>A boy of fourteen years came out of the hut with a little bundle of
                            rockets in his hand, and sat down near a tree. He was much whiter of
                            face than the majority of the inhabitants of this fishing village. His
                            features were clearer cut and more intelligent. His eyes were deep and,
                            at present, sad, for there were tears in them. The lake breeze dried the
                            tears. He untied the rockets in absorption, &#151; the absorption of
                            a man who has seen or dreamed much, and with none of the air of a child.
                            He was dressed in loose white, the common clothing of this simple people
                            of the high tropics. He wore sandals on his feet.</p>
                        <p>He lit the rockets one by one with wax matches, and they shot into the
                            air hissing, and burst with sudden reports on the night's stillness. It
                            somehow seemed a very solemn thing. There was no play in this. The last
                            of them left him in grief, as plainly written on his face as though he
                            had added twenty years to his few. The crack, crack of the explosives in
                            the air had aroused no one along the shore. The boats still rode
                            uneasily and empty, and the nets fluttered untouched, like ghosts. In
                            the hut, however, there was heard the loud wailing of a man, &#151;
                            a hysterical wailing rather than a grief-stricken one, such that a
                            philosophic listener would not have pitied long, for surely the mourner
                            would soon recover and be as boisterous in another direction. A little
                            girl of four years, in cotton dress oddly long, crept out, awe-struck,
                            went to the boy where he still sat, and silently hugged him. Then she
                            whispered:</p>
                        <p>"What is he crying about, Vicente? What is the matter with her? Is she
                            &#151; is she dead, brother Vicente?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-009" n="3"/>
                        <p>"Clarita," he said, holding to her, "she is dying, and the rockets have
                            gone before her, and we shall have no mother &#151; nobody,
                            nobody."</p>
                        <p>Whereat the little girl sobbed and crept back into the hut, among banana
                            and castor trees that stood about it. The boy did not move. When the
                            wailing of the man permitted, Vicente could hear the low voice of a
                            priest within; the same who had sent him out with the rockets to fire,
                            according to custom, as the soul departed.</p>
                        <p>It was at length quite dark, save for the stars, brilliant enough. Only a
                            little candle-light fell three feet outside the door. A gendarme came
                            round the corner not far away, where the two white church towers stood
                            high, past some lime-kilns, and along the row of fishers' huts. He
                            arrived at the candle-lit doorway and stood in the, light with his hat
                            off.</p>
                        <p>"Is she dead, Francisco?" he asked.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, my God! Dios! Dios!" wailed the man within. "She is gone &#151;
                            the life of my life!"</p>
                        <p>The priest was quiet enough and the girl again awe-struck. The gendarme
                            handed a paper to the priest, who read it.</p>
                        <p>"This is an order," said the latter, "that she is to be buried at once.
                            Why, there is no contagion here."</p>
                        <p>The gendarme shrugged his shoulders.</p>
                        <p>"People are afraid of small-pox," he said.</p>
                        <p>The dead woman lay on matting and blankets on the dirt floor, with
                            candles at her head and feet, her face covered. The little girl came
                            silently to her and sat down at her head.</p>
                        <p>"What!" shrieked Francisco, a fisherman not yet forty. "To-night!
                            Animals! Beasts! Will you tear my heart from my body?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-010" n="4"/>
                        <p>"They are afraid, señor, all the town, for there has been the disease
                            this year in Jocotepec, and some women who have looked at Doña Julia
                            have said it was like it."</p>
                        <p>"This is blasphemy! Holy Mary protect us! In the night &#151; and to
                            take her away now! Oh, Dios! Dios!" And he wailed afresh and more
                            hysterically.</p>
                        <p>The priest knew that there was no small-pox here, but &#151; it was
                            as well now as another time. Francisco's grief was not very deep. The
                            order was given, let it be executed. The town had indeed, foolishly,
                            been afraid of the hut. It seemed there would be difficulty in securing
                            men to carry the coffin. The gendarme went out. He would find them, said
                            he. He went no further than two huts away, and after parley returned
                            with two fishermen. They passed Vicente sitting, without motion, on the
                            sand, and entered the hut. The two were named, respectively, Anastasio
                            and Fortino. The one was long and lean, and the other massive. They, as
                            Francisco, wore the white clothing and the sandals. There were, too,
                            colored sashes round their waists.</p>
                        <p>There was little else said. Anastasio brought a rude wooden coffin that
                            seemed to have been awaiting the moment under the banana-trees. Fortino
                            remained outside, while his companion carried it in. Presently the
                            latter and the gendarme came out again, bearing it awkwardly. Coffins
                            were sometimes carried to the grave on a table, the table being hoisted
                            to the single bearer's back. They had no table here, and no one would
                            lend, for fear of the disease. So the great Fortino, strong as a bull,
                            lifted it lightly to his shoulder, and went tramping away. Anastasio,
                            the gendarme, and the <pb id="VAA3931-011" n="5"/> priest followed in
                            silence. Francisco threw himself down in the hut and beat his skull with
                            fierceness. The burial party was nigh swallowed up in gloom, yonder a
                            little way across the beach, when the girl ran out laboriously through
                            the sand, fascinated. She was at their heels, reaching up her little
                            hands to the coffin, and stumbling. She did not sob or cry, but they
                            heard her quick breath and turned in surprise, whereat she clung to
                            Fortino, looking up at the coffin piteously. Only the gendarme was moved
                            and loosed her grip.</p>
                        <p>At that moment, Vicente, who had but just perceived the child, came
                            running, seized her in his arms, and bore her back. She struggled, and
                            at length sobbed bitterly; but he held her, and sat down with her where
                            he had been before. She clung to him then with her head buried on his
                            shoulder, while he watched the retreating shadows of the burial party.
                            They were barely seen yonder where the white nets ended. They were
                            turning into a lane now, between two huts. They were gone. Dry-eyed, he
                            stared at the scarcely-seen corner for many minutes. He did not know it;
                            but he did not feel like a boy, nor was his face a boyish face.</p>
                        <p>He knew she had been good to them both, and that to have a mother was,
                            somehow, to have that which is most necessary. When they had eaten the
                                <hi rend="i">frijoles</hi> and the <hi rend="i">tortillas</hi> there
                            in the hut with her, it had always been she who had prepared them. She
                            had done it as though she loved to do it. She had not been like that
                            woman four huts away, who beat her children. Yes, it was plain she had
                            loved them. When they had played together, he and Clarita, here on the
                            sand so many, many evenings <pb id="VAA3931-012" n="6"/> after the moon
                            was up, while the nets were drawing fish, and the waves lapped the shore
                            gently, she had always been watching over them. She had been the true,
                            the real part of all living, though he had not known it till now.
                            Francisco had been only another person who came and went and fished and
                            was boisterous. When they had awakened in the morning, and Clarita had
                            hugged him, it was the mother they saw first. When they lay down on the
                            matting to sleep at night, she had watched them and made them warm. He
                            began to realize in some larger way that she had been above the life
                            that she lived; at least, she had been more faithful than her race. So
                            he held the child tightly, there in the dark, and did not want to move,
                            and a dormant loneliness that had long belonged to him took shape.</p>
                        <p>An hour passed, and she was asleep in his arms, contented. Francisco had
                            become silent. By faint distant whistles and the sound of an oar coming
                            across the water, Vicente knew there was fishing farther away at other
                            parts of the shore. But Francisco's nets, which Fortino and Anastasio
                            had been wont to draw with him, hung idly as before, and there was no
                            fishing here. He grew stiff, but not sleepy. After a long time he was
                            surprised that the priest returned and entered the hut. A grunt from
                            within told of the awaking of Francisco. The latter's grief had not kept
                            him from sleep.</p>
                        <p>"Has he come?" said the priest.</p>
                        <p>"No," said Francisco.</p>
                        <p>The boy heard no more, and there seemed to be no more said. His attention
                            was suddenly attracted by the faint plashing of oars a little way out on
                            the waves. He strained his eyes, and at length saw a <pb
                                id="VAA3931-013" n="7"/> shadow, which became, indistinctly, a boat.
                            It was strange, thought he, that a boat &#151; and a little boat
                            &#151; should be coming here in the night, for to-night there was no
                            fishing. The plash came nearer, and the boat touched the bank. He could
                            just see that a form stepped out of it. There seemed to be no anchoring
                            or tying of the vessel, and there was no more noise.</p>
                        <p>The figure came over the sand. He would have thought it a woman had it
                            not been so tall. It moved slowly, and passed within a few yards of him
                            and the sleeping child without seeing them. Vicente noted then what he
                            had not seen before, that a candle had been placed in the little yard of
                            his own home, under the banana-trees. The figure moved to this candle
                            and stood at the door, and he saw it more plainly. It was a man, but
                            robed. He would have been very tall had he not been bent. The light
                            barely showed to the staring boy eyes of terrible lustre, and a face
                            white. This last was the more wonderful to Vicente. He had never seen a
                            really white face before. Even the priest of Chapala was almost as dark
                            as his neighbors. The new-comer went in as noiselessly and mysteriously
                            as he had come, and the scarce-seen shadow of his boat rose and fell
                            beside that other little fishing craft.</p>
                        <p>For another hour there were the murmurings of conversation within,
                            sometimes only whispers. Once or twice Francisco's voice broke out in
                            passion, and once in a broad jest. Vicente thought of creeping closer
                            and listening. But his sorrow and his loneliness, the great night and
                            the child, put the idea out of his head; he only sat still. In spite of
                            the continuous sound of voices, sometimes eager, <pb id="VAA3931-014"
                                n="8"/> sometimes arguing, often urging, and at last even
                            threatening, the boy nearly forgot the new-comer. He grew tired, and
                            would have wakened his sister and gone in. But there was stirring, then,
                            and the priest and the boatman came out. The latter went to the beach
                            slowly, as he had come, but the boat did not depart. The priest came to
                            Vicente.</p>
                        <p>"He who has just come," said he to the boy kindly, "is a man greater than
                            are we. For many years he has been a friend of mine, of Francisco, and
                            of Julia. You are left alone now, Vicente. He has come to take you with
                            him, not so far away but that you can return, and he will show you new
                            things."</p>
                        <p>The boy stood up, wakening the girl, who still clung to him. His eyes
                            were very wide open and black, and he stared a moment in silence and
                            wonder at the priest.</p>
                        <p>"Why," he said simply and resolutely, "I do not want to see new
                            things."</p>
                        <p>"Listen, boy. As yet you know nothing, even of yourself. You have lived
                            here in this hut since your earliest memory. Will you not believe that
                            there is a wide world beyond this, with strange deeds and strange gains
                            in it? You will go to-night because I, your priest, tell you to. You
                            will learn many things you did not know. And you will learn more of
                            yourself &#151; of yourself, do you understand? And to-morrow you
                            may return &#151; if you wish."</p>
                        <p>"Oh! what is the hitch now?" cried Francisco, bursting, in irritation,
                            out of the hut. "Bring him in!"</p>
                        <p>Vicente was led in, bewildered. He put the girl down, and she sat beside
                            him on the floor.</p>
                        <p>"What are you hanging back for?" said Francisco. <pb id="VAA3931-015"
                                n="9"/> "Haven't I raised you and taken care of you? And when I tell
                            you it's all right, it is, isn't it? Origins!" And he struck his palm
                            with his fist. "It's to be explored. Can't you show any interest in the
                            origin?"</p>
                        <p>"The origin of what?" asked the boy. "I don't know what you mean."</p>
                        <p>"Then go with him and learn. It'll pay."</p>
                        <p>"And leave Clarita?"</p>
                        <p>"You may return to-morrow night &#151; if you wish," said the
                            priest.</p>
                        <p>Vicente was unconvinced. The priest led him, then, to the water's
                            edge.</p>
                        <p>"We shall speak to the other," he said.</p>
                        <p>They found the boat, and, a little way from it, the tall man standing on
                            the shore. The latter approached and laid a gentle hand on Vicente's
                            shoulder. Then he stooped and talked to him. His voice was low and
                            sibilant, but kind. It-seemed to hold a magic in it for the boy, who
                            knew not why, but half wanted to follow him.</p>
                        <p>"Come with me, my son," said the speaker. "It is necessary. I will teach
                            you, to-night, many things you have wanted to know. I am, your mother's,
                            your father's, the priest's friend. They and I say it is best."</p>
                        <p>In spite of the magic a sudden panic seized Vicente. He broke away and
                            ran to the hut. He caught Clarita in his arms and cried:</p>
                        <p>"Oh! they are going to take me away from you! I can't leave Clarita!"</p>
                        <p>Passion swept over Francisco's face. He waited no more, but tore the girl
                            away from him, seized him in a grip of iron, and carried him back to the
                            shore. Clarita, terrified, seeing her best-beloved <pb id="VAA3931-016"
                                n="10"/> dragged away, cried aloud in that frightful dread and
                            wretchedness known only to a child. At the shore Vicente heard her
                            calling his name and weeping. She was following him, in the second
                            bereavement of the night, toward the water. Francisco ran back and
                            stopped her, and they two were again in the hut. The priest held the boy
                            by the shoulder. Another shadow was seen then, running out from the
                            banana-trees across the beach to the shore, &#151; a small shadow.
                            It came boldly up to the boat's side, and a girl's voice called out:</p>
                        <p>"What are you going to do with him?"</p>
                        <p>It was a very young voice. This girl could not have been more than ten
                            years of age. Her face could not be plainly seen, but she was tall for
                            her age. Her dress was shorter than Clarita's, and her head and feet
                            were bare.</p>
                        <p>"Who is this?" said the boatman kindly, at the same time reassuring
                            Vicente by the pressure of his hand.</p>
                        <p>"This is Pepa," said the trembling Vicente. "Her mother keeps the
                            restaurant."</p>
                        <p>"I am Vicente's sweetheart," spoke up Pepa without hesitation, and
                            frankly. "Vicente is going to marry me when he grows up. Do you think I
                            would stay at home when his mother died? No. I am not afraid of the
                            small-pox; and I ran away and came. I have been hid under the
                            banana-trees since dark. What are you going to do with him?"</p>
                        <p>The tall stranger slowly took a wax match from a box, lighted it, and
                            held it to her face. It lit a keen interest in his own eyes. He smiled.
                            There was one gray lock falling down on his white cheek, wherein were
                            wrinkles.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, she is beautiful. You will marry him <pb id="VAA3931-017" n="11"/>
                            when he grows up?" he said, as the match went out. "Good. And you want
                            him now to go with me and see some of the world you will conquer
                            together."</p>
                        <p>"Oh! is that what you are taking him for?" said she, as though she
                            understood it. She meditated, while Vicente wavered between the
                            fascination which the scene and the man were exercising on him and his
                            fears. She seemed altogether too old for her age.</p>
                        <p>"She is a strange child," muttered the priest.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, Vicente, you ought to go," said she.</p>
                        <p>The boy was lifted bodily into the boat. He struggled much, but it was of
                            no avail. Within, he sank down, trembling more. The robed form of the
                            stranger entered after him and cut off escape. He was startled at the
                            rising of a rower at the boat's farther end. He had thought there were
                            only the two of them in the vessel. The rower said nothing, but took up
                            his oars, and the boat was pushed off. Even yet Vicente heard the sobs
                            of Clarita in the hut as she cried his name, &#151; the hut that had
                            been his home, and from which the woman who had loved him had been
                            carried away on a fisherman's shoulders.</p>
                        <p>"Good-by! good-by!" cried Pepa from the shore. "And you will marry me
                            when you come back!"</p>
                        <p>It was all a dream to him. He was bewildered, and could not think.
                            Crouched on the boat's bottom as it glided away into the darkness, the
                            last he heard from the shore was little Clarita's voice. She was weeping
                            and calling his name.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER II</head>
                        <p>THEY were out of sight of the shore almost at once, save for the faint
                            candle-light at the hut. That too disappeared when they sank into a deep
                            trough of the waves, and when they arose again Vicente could see it no
                            more. He was on the floor of the boat with the oarsman behind him and
                            the old man in the stern before him, and there was no sound but that of
                            the oars and the waves. He gained assurance sufficient to look about.
                            The oarsman was not to be distinctly descried. He wore a sombrero that
                            made a pointed shadow against the sky as he swayed back and forth. His
                            silence alone was remarkable, and as he pulled he sometimes sighed
                            deeply. There was a slim little mast with a sail furled on it, unused
                            because they were going against the wind. They appeared to him to be
                            aiming straight out across the lake, a thing he had heard called madness
                            in such a frail bark as this and in the night. For the worst storms come
                            at night and the nearest shore straight across is twenty miles away. He
                            was not a child to be long cowed. He gained self-command. That black
                            figure in the boat's stern must know its course. A kind of pride or
                            haughtiness came to the child and he sat still, scorning to be
                            afraid.</p>
                        <p>It seemed hours during which nothing happened, and there was no word
                            spoken. The ceaseless rise and fall of the waves, their lapping on the
                            boat's sides, <pb id="VAA3931-019" n="13"/> and the stroke and the sigh
                            of the oarsman, these were all. He longed to see the face whose eyes had
                            fascinated him. The form was always there in the same position, but the
                            face unseen. He believed it must be midnight or later, and in spite of
                            the strain he was growing sleepy, when the wind changed. He saw the old
                            man's arm make a slow motion in the air, and the oarsman ceased rowing,
                            hoisted the little sail, and crawled to the stern, sitting down beside
                            the other. Dread and doubt swept over the boy in turn as he watched
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The boat sped on now, striking the waves boldly, and the sail was full.
                            That great loneliness came over Vicente again. It was the loneliness of
                            the lake thus dark and unknown, the loneliness of the night, and the
                            loneliness of his heart. He was tired and he lay on the boat's bottom.
                            He was thinking of Clarita when he fell asleep.</p>
                        <p>He was awakened by the striking of the boat upon a rock gently. He
                            started up and the rower was leaping out to a shore dimly seen. The sail
                            was down and the boulders of a high and rugged ascent loomed about. Half
                            the night sky was shut away by a mass of land whose rugged edge above
                            him cut a zigzag line along the stars. He had never been, since he could
                            remember, five miles from the village of Chapala. Nor were any coasts
                            opposite the village known to him. Familiar names of certain Indian
                            towns on the lake's border were in his mind, but here was no town. Nor
                            did he know how many hours the journey had occupied. He had come long
                            over black waves. He had arrived in the night at an unknown and
                            seemingly deserted coast. He knew no more.</p>
                        <p>His companion, following the oarsman, lifted the <pb id="VAA3931-020"
                                n="14"/> boy out to the rocks. The oarsman was again communicated
                            with by signs. He was apparently deaf and executed his orders like a
                            slave. The boat was tied in a little cove, the chain rattling
                            startlingly on the otherwise complete silence. The oarsman went on up
                            the ascent, picking the tortuous path among rocks. Vicente preceded the
                            old man and struggled up. He was at length lifted into the latter's arms
                            and borne, as though his weight were nothing. A wild goat and kids
                            started from the rocks and bleated, leaped away, and were gone in the
                            gloom. The climbers were a hundred feet above the water when they came
                            to a wall. The servant scrambled over it and took the boy. The wall was
                            in ruins with rough stones fallen at its base. There was tangled
                            vegetation here and cacti lifted their myriad flat leaves against the
                            sky, for the summit of the ascent was reached. The oarsman put the boy
                            down and between the two men Vicente walked on. There was no further
                            sign of life, and he imagined he could see the faint gray of the dawn.
                            Before them rose huge irregular piles, formless. A little nearer and the
                            piles were ruins too, ruins of buildings vaster than any he had ever
                            seen. They entered in between two walls that broke off aimlessly at the
                            entrance. All seemed stone, heavy, irregular, silent. All was deserted.
                            They climbed over heaps of rocks fallen from heights that loomed broken
                            overhead. They were at length under a high-arched roof which, with its
                            walls, formed a black tunnel whose end he could not see. At its
                            beginning the arch too had fallen, and indistinctly he could descry
                            another arched roof that joined it. The tunnel was double.</p>
                        <p>Within they walked over soft mold and the place was damp. When they had
                            penetrated some distance <pb id="VAA3931-021" n="15"/> into this passage
                            the leader paused and struck a light. There were sheer walls surrounding
                            them, rising to the shadowy arch. A door in the masonry here blocked the
                            path. This the servant opened and led the way, holding the match, down
                            stone steps, and the boy was pushed after him. They arrived thus at a
                            chamber where the servant lit a candle. He was bade by a sign from his
                            master to withdraw, and he did so, there being only time for Vicente to
                            see as he turned to the door that his hair was straggling and long and
                            his face disfigured by a great scar stretching from the corner of his
                            mouth across his cheek.</p>
                        <p>There were heavy benches and a seat made of the fallen stones. The floor
                            was of stones also, as were the walls and the roof. There were shelves
                            built up irregularly of pieces of the ruins, and a bottle of wine and
                            some bread were on one of them. A couch covered with blankets stood
                            opposite the one door, and stones formed a table whereon were books and
                            candles.</p>
                        <p>"Sit down," said the old man.</p>
                        <p>The boy sat and looked at his companion. He had not seen the latter's
                            face plainly till now. It was a face that he never forgot. It seemed
                            half smiling and half grim. It might be fascinating or terrible
                            &#151; its white forehead, its wrinkled cheeks, the strong mouth
                            defying age with the lines about it that might mean grief, or power, or
                            crime, the eyes that alone showed a hidden fire which must have burned
                            in vain for years, the gray hair falling round it. The man came nearer
                            and laid on the boy's shoulder a hand that was long, of large joints,
                            and heavy. His voice was oddly gentle.</p>
                        <p>"You have never heard of a hermit," he said.</p>
                        <p>"No," said the boy.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-022" n="16"/>
                        <p>"Nor do you know why men leave the world and bury themselves away like
                            animals in the depths of the earth."</p>
                        <p>He stood long, musing over the child, scrutinizing his features. He
                            sighed then, like one stricken, and turned away and sat down on a bench
                            by the table.</p>
                        <p>"I will tell you why," he said at last.</p>
                        <p>He turned fully to Vicente again and never ceased, till he ceased
                            speaking, to hold him with his eyes. He knew the power of that gaze. He
                            knew and felt the weight of his purposes. Under circumstances the most
                            simple how impressionable is a child! Spellbound, half terrified, how
                            could this one escape the singular influence of his unknown companion?
                            Vicente's lips were drawn and his eyes were wide. Clarita's voice had
                            died from his ears. Pepa was no more in his thoughts. Francisco, even
                            she they had borne away, were forgotten. Only the unthought loneliness
                            was there, and he listened.</p>
                        <p>"You live," continued the hermit, seating himself by the table, his voice
                            low and distinct, "in the most unfortunate country on the face of the
                            globe. She was conquered in blood, she was ridden in selfishness and
                            brutality, she is exploited by adventurers and torn by revolutions. She
                                <hi rend="i">is</hi> no country. And who owns her? Whose is the land
                            and the right? There was, here on these plains and in these mountains,
                            in the times gone by, a proud and noble race, your race. And the land
                            was free and the government an empire. Your mother's fathers built
                            cities under this same Mexican sun, and reared a state strong and
                            beautiful. They were masters of the soil for centuries. They were proud,
                            true, silent. They were bent on a civilization on whose very threshold
                            they stood, when one fatal year, in the midst of their security, <pb
                                id="VAA3931-023" n="17"/> came the sound of the Spanish gun. You
                            have heard tales of the conquest. You do not know its ferocity, its
                            bloodiness. Your own fathers were cut down like the corn in the field.
                            Your fathers' cities were swept away in ruin. Your fathers' wives and
                            daughters were seized and held for the basest purposes, and cast away.
                            But for one all-merciful hand every individual of your race would have
                            fallen in blood or pined in slavery, and your great-grandfathers, your
                            mother, you yourself, would never have existed. That one merciful hand
                            was the hand of the church. It could not restore to you your ancient
                            lands; it could only save you from butchery or slavery and keep you
                            alive, holding you in its bosom, warming and nourishing you, till you
                            should have learned to be your masters. This it did. For many years you
                            were slaves and it freed you and taught you religion. It has been your
                            race's protector, your race's only hope."</p>
                        <p>The speaker's face was lit almost with the light that lights the face of
                            the fanatic. He leaned farther over the rude table, stretched out a long
                            finger at the awed listener, and continued:</p>
                        <p>"Child, to save a lost and fallen race is the noblest calling that a man
                            can have. If that race be your own, and its blood leap in you, and you
                            be fighting the battle of your butchered fathers and winning that which
                            is by God's right yours, the task is infinitely great. Do you know,
                            child, whose is that task?"</p>
                        <p>The boy could not have escaped from his companion's eye had he wished. He
                            did not wish. He gazed at him and slowly shook his head. He was moved
                            and thinking, and a flash of satisfaction came into the hermit's
                            face.</p>
                        <p>"Boy," he said solemnly, "that task is yours."</p>
                        <p>There was silence for some seconds.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-024" n="18"/>
                        <p>"How &#151; how," said the youth, hesitatingly, "can it be mine?"</p>
                        <p>"You have seen the poverty of your own people. You have lived among them
                            and you know their ignorance. Your priest tells me he has begun to teach

                            Already, young as you are, I know you have begun to realize the

                            to be. Your enemies cry, 'Give them time! They will rise!' My son, they
                            have had three hundred years, and they have not risen. Why? Because they
                            are cheated of their own, and their conquerors alone have knowledge and
                            civilization. They need one strong hand held out to help them up. They
                            shall then attain that freedom and that greatness for which the church
                            has held them and has waited."</p>
                        <p>"Why," said the boy, "the country is free. Hidalgo freed it."</p>
                        <p>A low, bitter laugh broke from the other.</p>
                        <p>"Free to what? To a hundred successive bondages. Child, where there is no
                            stability, no government, there can be no freedom. Hidalgo, like his
                            many followers, though his cry was liberty and his banner the Virgin,
                            was an adventurer. How soon after his death did Iturbide's empire prove
                            his weakness? That empire should have lived. There should be no republic
                            here. This country's factions are too wild. She is too unsettled. Govern
                            herself? Madness! She can no more govern herself than a wind can govern
                            the sea it has lashed to fury. She needs one powerful, never-failing
                            hand. Iturbide lacked the strength. He fled, returned, and died. Your
                            land and your people have, since then, been given <pb id="VAA3931-025"
                                n="19"/> over to a mob of madmen. Revolution has followed
                            revolution. Government there is none. Lies, treachery, murder,
                            self-aggrandizement, are the politics and the aim of these successive
                            devastating flames. Your people are like starved sheep, driven bleating
                            here and there, fleeing the forest fire to be caught in the barren
                            rocks, and leaping the rocks only to fall into the sea. So-called
                            governments hold you as the despairing player holds the dice and cast
                            their fortunes with you. Each new blusterer lets you fall as you will,
                            only that it be luck for him. Allende, Guerrero, Morelos &#151; my
                            son, what were they? Criminals with their fingers on your throat. And
                            most blasphemous &#151;"</p>
                        <p>Here he leaned farther forward and there was a singular smile on his face
                            that drew the lines about his mouth into unpleasing prominence.</p>
                        <p>"The church itself, the vessel of God's spirit, your only friend and
                            protector, is exploited with you."</p>
                        <p>There was a long silence after this, and the speaker sat watching the
                            boy. The expression of the old man's face sank into sadness. He raised
                            his hand and stroked the long gray locks.</p>
                        <p>"My son," said he at last, "you are coming to the rescue, and I shall
                            tell you why. You were not born to fish or to plant corn on the shores
                            of this lake. You were born to learn and to do. Your country and your
                            people have waited long for one strong spirit. For the ancient empire
                            lives yet, trodden though it is, in the depths of your national
                            character. The time is coming when every bitter wrong you have suffered
                            will bear its fruit at last, and the fire burst out. I have heard its
                            warning. These last petty brawlers will light the match, for you and
                            your race will endure no more. If I prove to you the <pb
                                id="VAA3931-026" n="20"/> right is yours and the time has come, and
                            give you the means and show you the way, will you follow and grow to be
                            your people's liberator?"</p>
                        <p>The boy, wrought to a high pitch, threw his head down on his arms to the
                            table and cried with a fervor that sounded strange in a boy's voice:</p>
                        <p>"I would &#151; Holy Mary help me! I would do it if I could!"</p>
                        <p>"You can and you will. The woman who died to-night was not your
                            mother."</p>
                        <p>The boy started up as though he had been struck. The other's face calmed
                            him, and he sat down, holding his breath.</p>
                        <p>"Will you believe me? Have you faith that I am telling you the
                            truth?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes," gasped the boy.</p>
                        <p>"Your mother died fourteen years ago. She came to the monastery one night
                            in Guadalajara bringing you. Ah, I remember the night." He stopped and
                            dreamed. Of all the many emotions that the face had shown, the sorrow on
                            it then seemed the deepest. "I remember the night. She was nearly dead
                            when she came. She died there. We took charge of you. Your eyes
                            &#151; ah, yes &#151; your eyes were like hers, when the monk
                            brought the candle and held it over you, and your hair was already black
                            and thick." He paused again, dreaming. "Some of the monks knew her and
                            her history, and they decided together that you should be kept and cared
                            for. I will tell you who she was.</p>
                        <p>"Montezuma's was not the only so-called empire in the Mexican valley.
                            There were two others on the banks of the Texcocan lake. There was
                            another city, too, almost as beautiful as his, the city of Texcoco.
                            These three empires formed a league and <pb id="VAA3931-027" n="21"/>
                            were, when your enemies conquered them, virtually equal. The kings of
                            Texcoco were as royal as Montezuma himself, though the latter-held the
                            predominance in the councils and the wars. The three ruled all this
                            land, farther to the north than this, and farther south than Yucatan.
                            Before the conquest Texcoco was torn with wars of the succession. One
                            branch of the royal family was driven away, a cousin of the king seizing
                            the throne. A brother of that king was one of those driven out. In the
                            event of there being no heir from him who held the throne or him who
                            claimed it, this brother's descendants would be the rightful kings.
                            After so many years, that has come to pass. That wronged Texcocan, after
                            using all his powers in vain to win Montezuma to his cause, wandered in
                            the mountains for many months. His brother at last came into his own
                            through the intervention of Cortes, and he expected again to be taken
                            into favor. In this treachery disappointed him. He who then took the
                            throne feared this wandering brother would attempt a usurpation. The
                            latter was hunted down just previous to the conquest and would have been
                            killed. Absolutely alone he fled far to the west, over many mountains
                            and plains, being days with scarcely any food. One evening near sunset
                            he arrived at the summit of a ridge, and looked down into the bosom of
                            this lake, then called Chapalac. The beauty of its circling mountains,
                            the limpidness of its waters, soothed him. At his feet lay a little
                            fishing village, the same they call to this day Tizapan. He descended,
                            found shelter among these simple folk, kept the knowledge of his
                            identity to himself, and spent his days and died there. But he had
                            married one of the maidens of the village. To her alone he confided the
                            secret and laid on her the solemn injunction <pb id="VAA3931-028" n="22"
                            /> that the knowledge of his royalty should go down, a sacred secret in
                            the line, till some future date should restore it to its own. Just
                            before his death he made her swear it. He died in ignorance of the fall
                            of Mexico, and the fact that the kingdom whose secret his wife held was
                            swept away. She had two sons, and they, too, were intrusted with the
                            truth and certain written proofs of it. So the line descended. It
                            branched away from the lake, and I have studied it elsewhere. Some of
                            its branches are lost; there is only one that is clear to the present
                            day. One of its members was a bishop in Guadalajara one hundred and
                            fifty years ago; another died fighting a corn insurrection in the city
                            of Zacatecas near the end of the last century. As the line descended,
                            the written secret, with its gradual accumulation of added proof,
                            descended with it, cherished fondly to the death of its every member.
                            Fourteen years ago the only living representative was a woman of twenty
                            years. She was beautiful. Her blood was pure as the blood of the old
                            emperors. Not one taint of the Spaniard had entered the line. She had
                            the bearing, the untouched strength of mind, and the will of
                            royalty."</p>
                        <p>The speaker sighed, shaded his face with his hand, and paused.</p>
                        <p>"Well, she bore a son," he continued, "and died."</p>
                        <p>The boy was trembling from head, to foot. He arose and seized the other's
                            hand, half in a curious frankness, half in agitation.</p>
                        <p>"Am I the boy?" he cried.</p>
                        <p>"You are the boy."</p>
                        <p>The weight of it fell on Vicente then, and he could say no more. His face
                            was gray-brown, and he again sat down.</p>
                        <p>"Her secret was intrusted to me," said the hermit. <pb id="VAA3931-029"
                                n="23"/> "She knew the church to be against the folly of Hidalgo.
                            She knew the Dominican monastery at Guadalajara to be in favor of
                            royalty. She had no grown member of the family to whom to intrust the
                            secret, and you were too young. And &#151; I had been a friend to
                            her. So she died, leaving it to me. Two of my brother monks were told,
                            and it was decided that if the time came to help you to your own,
                                <unclear>you-</unclear> old rights and the old rights of the church
                            at once might be restored. It was agreed that, to a
                                <unclear>certain-</unclear> age, you should be raised among the
                            common people, that you might know them. I was leaving then the
                            monastery, even that little of the world I was putting behind me. I
                            carried you to this lake and thence to Chapala, and gave you to
                            Francisco and to Julia, Yesterday word came to me from the Chapala
                                <unclear>pries-</unclear> and the monastery that Julia was dying.
                            Then, too the time is coming. So I went and brought you. I had paid
                            Francisco much to keep you. I had to pay him more to get you away
                            without disturbance, for he wanted you to help him with his fishing
                            boats. Ha <unclear/> ha!" The laugh was grim. "Fishing boats! As the
                            Christ said on the borders of a lake like this <unclear>-</unclear>
                            'Come, I will make you a fisher of men!'"</p>
                        <p>There was another long pause, and the boy, scarcely able to sit, tingling
                            in every nerve, waited.</p>
                        <p>"The least touch of the match," continued <unclear>hi-</unclear>
                            companion slowly, "is sufficient to raise a revolution in this
                            inflammable land. It needs the strong hand <unclear>o-</unclear> a
                            rightful king to hold it in its proper course. I say again, the people
                            are ready for you. You are to say whether or not you will make yourself
                            ready <unclear>fo-</unclear> them. If you tell me yes, you shall be

                            brought you here, first because this is half the distance to the spot on
                            the shore where a horseman will meet you to carry you thither; second,
                            because here my purposes as to your destinies took unchangeable shape;
                            third, because here, locked in the ground, I keep the proofs, and I am
                            going to intrust them to you. I wanted you to carry through all your
                            life the memory of this night, the picture of this place, and the face
                            of this lonely old man, that you may know the life and the secrecy that
                            guards your destiny. For child, child," and his voice was unsteady,
                            "your destiny is mine."</p>
                        <p>The hand that had again shaded his face was taken away.</p>
                        <p>"Tell me if you are ready. Your people were driven from their Eden and
                            made to toil and sweat three hundred years in bondage. Come. I will lead
                            you back that you may see again the cherubim and the flaming sword that
                            turneth every way and know again where is your race's tree of life."</p>
                        <p>The boy arose impassioned, fell on his knees beside the hermit, and
                            clasped him as he would have clasped a father.</p>
                        <p>"I will do it. Help me, oh Holy Mary!"</p>
                        <p>To this the hermit replied nothing, nor did he touch the youth with his
                            hands. A look that was a mixture of daring and of fear, and, too, of
                            some stronger passion, flooded his face as he stared at the kneeling
                            figure. When the boy arose he said:</p>
                        <p>"You will think of it long and deeply."</p>
                        <p>He too was on his feet, going in scarcely concealed agitation to the
                            entrance.</p>
                        <p>"Sleep there," he said, pointing to the couch, <pb id="VAA3931-031"
                                n="25"/> and went out of the low door and closed it behind him.</p>
                        <p>To Vicente, wrought to the highest strain of emotion, it seemed for a
                            moment that with the thud of the closing door he must awake from his
                            dream. He sat down on the cot and watched the wavering halo round the
                            candle's flame. His gaze followed the rays and rested on the shelf with
                            the bread and the bottle, on the table with the books, and on the
                            unspeaking stones of the walls. He lay down at full length, his eyes
                            again on the halo. He had hardly done so when he fell asleep. He slept
                            profoundly, dreamlessly, for twelve hours.</p>

                    <div3 type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAPTER III</head>
                        <p>IT was the opening of the door that awoke him. He started up with a cry
                            and saw the old man standing, at the bedside, a fresh candle in his
                            hand. Of the white light of the hermit's face, there was no abatement.
                            The latter then talked to the youth again for an hour, in that same low,
                            convincing, compelling tone, now standing before him fastening on him
                            his eyes, now walking with long strides to and fro the length of the
                            little cell. His form seemed taller, as though it straightened with the
                            inspiration of his words. There was nothing left unsaid. The pitiable
                            plight of the nation, the duty of a king, the future &#151; these
                            were the themes, rendered solemn, sweet, glorious by a measured
                            eloquence calculated to impress even an older and a less emotional heart
                            than Vicente's. He stopped at last in the middle of his walking and
                            turned abruptly on the boy.</p>
                        <p>"Are you ready?" he cried.</p>
                        <p>The listener had wakened with every nerve on the alert. He had drunk
                            every word. He now stood up with every drop of his blood bounding in his
                            veins.</p>
                        <p>"I am ready," said he.</p>
                        <p>The hermit went to the shelves, took away the stones at their back, and
                            drew out two small packages.</p>
                        <p>"These are the proofs," he told the boy, putting one into his hand. "You
                            will keep them forever, <pb id="VAA3931-033" n="27"/> and learn to read
                            them. And this," giving him the other, "is a little money. You will need
                            but little now. In the time to come you will not forget the tomb from
                            which you are to receive the rest."</p>
                        <p>"Why is it a tomb at all?" suddenly asked the boy, half daring, half
                            childishly frank. "And why did you leave the monastery instead of
                            staying to teach me yourself, and why are you buried here?"</p>
                        <p>"Asked like a king of his subject," mused the hermit.</p>
                        <p>Saying no more, he went to the door and, opening it, stood for a moment
                            looking up and out. No light of day penetrated to the cell. The boy
                            reasoned as to the hour. It must be night again. Presently the servant
                            came down the steps and in. He bore a basket which he put upon the
                            floor. The boy was again struck with his peculiar appearance. The scar
                            gave to his face an expression partly devilish, partly foolish. His eyes
                            and forehead bespoke intelligence. His manner was that of the defeated,
                            even the cowed. He went out</p>
                        <p>"Eat," said the hermit.</p>
                        <p>The youth found wine, bread, beans, and fruit in the basket. He ate
                            heartily, drank some wine, and stood up again looking his benefactor
                            fearlessly in the eye.</p>
                        <p>"I am ready to go now," he said briefly.</p>
                        <p>The hermit again opened the door; the servant came nearly to the entrance
                            and stood waiting on the steps in the shadows outside.</p>
                        <p>Vicente approached those shadows. His benefactor took his hand and
                            pressed it so that it ached, saying:</p>
                        <p>"Boy, your soul is your mother's soul, and your destiny is beyond even a
                            hermit's dreams."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-034" n="28"/>
                        <p>The speaker wheeled away, plainly agitated. He went to the farthest side
                            of the cell, crying strangely, with his back to the youth:</p>
                        <p>"Go! Leave me! Leave me!"</p>
                        <p>In the doorway Vicente turned.</p>
                        <p>"I only want to be sure of one thing," said he, "if you will promise it
                            to me."</p>
                        <p>The old man wheeled again and waited.</p>
                        <p>"I want the priest in Chapala to teach Clarita to read," said the
                            boy.</p>
                        <p>"It shall be done," was the reply, "and in return I shall exact this
                            promise of you. You are never to seek this spot again till it seeks you.
                            You are never to inquire its location. No curiosity, no motives good or
                            bad, are to lead you to search for me till I have called you. If you
                            never so much as hear of me till your throne be established you are not
                            to think it strange. Simply in silence trust me, believe that I have
                            reason and know my course, and seek not to unearth this tomb, lest its
                            power to help you fail. Will you promise me this?"</p>
                        <p>"I promise it," said the boy, and went out.</p>
                        <p>He was just outside the door. His gray-brown face, lit with
                            determination, a face so much lighter than that of the slavish figure
                            behind him, seemed to stand out of the gloom. With a sudden sound like a
                            sob the hermit strode across the cell and seized him violently in his
                            arms.</p>
                        <p>"The face," cried he, "the face too!"</p>
                        <p>And he kissed the face with passion, pushed the boy away, and turned into
                            the cell again, shutting the door behind. The last impression Vicente
                            had of his features was the impression of suddenly increased wrinkled
                            age.</p>
                        <p>The servant and the boy went out together, the <pb id="VAA3931-035"
                                n="29"/> servant leading. They passed over the soft mold and under
                            the long arched roof. They came out of the tunnel's broken end and
                            climbed the piles of fallen stones. The sound of small waves, dashing on
                            the rocks, came suddenly up and the night wind struck them. Over the
                            stony way they had come they descended to the water and the boat was
                            rocking at the shore. The night was much as the previous one had been,
                            starlit; and the waves were no higher than before. They entered the
                            boat; it was pushed off, rowed round some points of rock, and headed
                            away into the dim lake. After a little time the sail was hoisted, the
                            boatman sat in the stern with the sail's ropes, and the boy sat at the
                            prow. What dreams, what slow unrolling scenes, what fears and hopes and
                            dazzling promises, were in the brain, then, of him whose disposition
                            since his earliest childhood had been the dreamer's, &#151; him to
                            whom the waves breaking on the beach, the sunset with its myriad clouds
                            of intensely colored light and its circle of flaming mountains, the nets
                            and the children tumbled together on the sand, the care of the only
                            mother he had known, all had held a cause of visions and of loneliness,
                            a meaning, a promise? In a sense the boy died as he crossed the waters
                            on that night, and the man was born, young as he was. But the man knew
                            nothing and must learn.</p>
                        <p>An hour passed as silently as had been the journey on the night before.
                            He began to wonder who could be the figure that sat so motionless in the
                            stern. From wondering this, he pictured his face. The youth's
                            imagination cast that visage constantly up, exaggerated and distorted
                            it. For many minutes it refused to be put down. It seemed to speak pain,
                            agony, crime; or it was mocking all these. The boy <pb id="VAA3931-036"
                                n="30"/> grew intensely nervous and the first fear that he had felt
                            since he left the Chapala beach came on him, now that the strong
                            influence of the hermit was removed. He could not bear the silence. He
                            found perspiration starting from his forehead.</p>
                        <p>"Who are you?" he suddenly cried aloud.</p>
                        <p>There was no answer. The waves lapped the boat's sides, and the wind
                            swayed the sail and blew his hair round his face. There seemed no doubt
                            the man was a mute. His imagined features hung before the boy for many
                            minutes yet. The latter heard, then, the dashing of waves behind him to
                            the right. He had not watched their course, nor looked ahead during the
                            last hour. He turned, and another shore and other rocks rose behind him.
                            Another moment the sail was down; a little longer and the boat was run
                            skilfully aground on a space of beach, three yards in length, left by an
                            opening amidst boulders.</p>
                        <p>Only vaguely had Vicente till now realized his absolute ignorance of that
                            spot of shore to which the hermit had led him. Now as he leaped out it
                            broke on him with full force. In all the lake's one hundred miles of
                            length, two hundred and fifty miles of circuit, where was the cell? And
                            this spot, too, where was it? They could not have crossed the lake in
                            two hours. They must have crossed, thought he, merely a bay, sailing
                            from one rocky point to the arm opposite. He knew of no such bay. They
                            might be at the extreme western end of the lake where it narrows. He had
                            but a moment to puzzle over this, for two horsemen and a third riderless
                            horse came along the beach over a stony trail. One of them brought a
                            basket and gave it to the mute, who, putting it and himself in the boat,
                            lay down there, doubtless waiting <pb id="VAA3931-037" n="31"/> for a
                            turn of the wind before retracing his course. The other horseman
                            dismounted and gave the third animal to the boy.</p>
                        <p>"The hermit has intrusted you to us," he said, without preface. "To the
                            monastery. Come!"</p>
                        <p>Vicente mustered his courage. A new, half-savage delight, such as the boy
                            feels in reading of strange adventures, took possession of him. But the
                            reality of it, and the weight and purpose of it never left him. He
                            mounted, and they rode away. The rocks clinked under them. They ascended
                            a low knoll, and came by a single path to an opening between peaks where
                            they rose higher and higher to the connecting ridge, and then descended
                            again to a valley. They struck a wider road after a time, and spurred
                            on. For hours the horses were urged to an almost incredible speed. The
                            boy was strong and tough as his Indian fathers, and he rode well.
                            Mountains loomed to the right and the left, were passed and sunk into
                            the shadows. Others rose to the front, and were passed too. Here a heavy
                            gate was opened and closed in silence, and a tiny earthen hut stood
                            alone in the wide stretch. Mesquit bordered the way for miles, and dried
                            streams, waiting thirsty for the summer rains, made ruts that the horses
                            leaped. The men spoke but little, and only of the way, the hour, and the
                            speed of the journey. Vicente, with all his youthful vigor, was at last
                            sore and weary when, there being still no light of dawn visible in the
                            sky, they came to the outlying huts of the city of Guadalajara, passed
                            them, and entered its streets of cobblestone.</p>
                        <p>They did not pass through the city's centre, but merely made a circuit in
                            some of the outskirts. They were in the regions where the streets become
                            roads into the dusty country, when they stopped at the <pb
                                id="VAA3931-038" n="32"/> monastery walls. One of his companions
                            dismounted at a double door that was twelve or fifteen feet in height
                            and a good ten broad. The wall itself rose high and massive, and
                            extended seemingly a long distance. It inclosed unseen grounds and the
                            buildings. The dismounted man knocked with vigor by an iron knocker. A
                            porter pushed back the grating of a little window, and there was some
                            conversation. The door swung open and the three entered and were closed
                            in, the ponderous timbers giving out a deep thud. The porter lay down on
                            the ground, and the riders and their horses, finding themselves in a
                            wide, bare court that surrounded edifices, crossed it, and, under these
                            second walls, circled the monastery.</p>
                        <p>The boy had nearly lost his sense of direction, when they were halted
                            again at another door. They were all dismounted now, and after another
                            knocking a monk came out and led the horses away, saying nothing. One of
                            Vicente's companions left him, the other led him in. The passages were
                            stone and cold, and they came into an inner <hi rend="i">patio,</hi>
                            square-columned, open to the starlit sky, save where trees made the
                            gloom deeper. Another passage and another <hi rend="i">patio;</hi> and
                            yet a third passage and a third <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> Everywhere were
                            silence and darkness. At length in the fourth court, larger than the
                            others, where a fountain played, there was a ray of light. It issued
                            from a cell under the roof of a columned <hi rend="i">corredor.</hi> To
                            the partly open door of this they went and knocked. The prior came out,
                            and with him the boy was left.</p>
                        <p>The prior brought a candle, whose light fell softly over his black robes
                            and over the sunken, colorless skin of his face. He led the way to a
                            fifth court, and as they passed the fountain the candle-light fell on an
                            iron stand which held a book of unwieldy size chained <pb
                                id="VAA3931-039" n="33"/> to it by an iron chain. Vicente followed.
                            The place took the bounding life out of his veins. As they approached
                            the cell that should be his, home-sickness swept over him like pain, and
                            the hut on the Chapala sands was before his eyes. In the cell, bare and
                            rude enough, yet with a bed on which he could sleep himself into
                            enthusiasm again, the prior put down the candle. To this monk there was
                            subject of profound interest in the slight, lost figure before him. He
                            looked into the boy's face, scrutinizing it. Then he blessed him, with
                            his hand on his head.</p>
                        <p>"All will be well," said he.</p>
                        <p>He went away and shut the child in.</p>
                        <p>The outer walls that inclosed the monastery grounds extended four hundred
                            yards in each direction; they were twenty feet high. In the hundreds of
                            years of Spanish rule in Mexico the church acquired vast tracts of land
                            and built vast edifices. A later policy has swung back the secret doors
                            and made public the cloister, and in many cities walls like these still
                            stand, but inclose barracks, hospitals, prisons. In former days these
                            squares held the great strength of the land, and out of their secrecy
                            and their silence issued who knows what arms of power?</p>
                        <p>When that outer door shut the boy in, it was not to open again for him,
                            nor was he so much as to see the world, for six long months. Indeed he
                            never became wholly free from the influence of the place, and the day
                            when he finally left it for the last time was to be a day of much
                            meaning.</p>
                        <p>It shall not be the purpose of this narrative to relate the workings of
                            that power by which the church, in so many countries and so many ages,
                            has molded its agents and brought about its ends. Infinite patience
                            seems to have been its <unclear>watchword-</unclear>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-040" n="34"/> Let months and years count for nothing. Do
                            not act till the time is ripe. If the long, long care and building of
                            one set of the church's servants do not finish the task, this is
                            nothing. These being dead the next shall take it up. Be there born in
                            the heart of Rome, or in that of a dependency of Rome, a purpose, it
                            shall be deathless. Rome shall bury haste, she shall hug the secret, she
                            shall cover the egg for years, for centuries if she must, till it
                            hatch.</p>
                        <p>Weight and gloom oppressed the boy for two months. He scarcely left his
                            cell. The depth of the purpose should be given time to sink, slowly,
                            deeply, into his very soul. Who, inexperienced, can depict the effect of
                            the cloister on the spirit of a boy? His, and they saw it plainly and
                            joyed in it, was too strong to break. It took in seriousness. He fasted
                            and saw few of the monks. The prior's sunken features and eyes of keen
                            life were much with him. He was led slowly, coldly, in the way of his
                            future. He walked, on rare occasions, like a small, silent ghost,
                            through the corridors and the many <hi rend="i">patios,</hi> where the
                            trees reflected the sun and the fruit hung yellow. He talked a little
                            with the figures about him. He learned, at first, almost nothing
                            concerning them. They had their cells, their refectory, their chapel.
                            There seemed to be unlimited numbers of them, but the place was so large
                            there were seldom more than a few together, yonder at the fountain, here
                            in the court, passing there under the shadows of the columns, or
                            chanting at the altar. The <hi rend="i">patios,</hi> he learned, were
                            twenty-three. The chapel was exactly in the centre. And wherever he
                            turned, were walls, walls, walls. The prior taught him many things,
                            solemnly. There were many conferences over his welfare of which he knew
                            nothing. <pb id="VAA3931-041" n="35"/> It was gradually explained to him
                            how, to know the world and to realize the meaning of his destiny, it was
                            best first to drink the dregs of bitterness here. Later, said they, he
                            should not be bound by the ceremonies as were they. He should be taught,
                            and should learn to be freer than they. But now&#151;</p>
                        <p>So he fasted, he prayed, he walked in gloom. No element of the boy was
                            allowed to show itself. He was, for the time, a monk, young as he was.
                            If he did not understand it he did not, at first, question. He was dumb.
                            Many a sick hour his brain revolted and would show him nothing but
                            Clarita, the lake, the woman who had been faithful as his mother. But
                            his outdoor, vigorous spirit, though dormant, was unable to be crushed.
                            Other days his dreams of old came back, and the mystic in him roused and
                            responded to these gloomy walls, these stone passages, these trees and
                            fountains. Toward the two months' end he grew unendurably weary of this
                            cloister life. The Aztec blood in him was too pure. They found him one
                            day, when they had left him in the deepest gloom, leaping the stones of
                            the fountain with a wild freedom like a panther. They took counsel
                            together. The meaning of his own future had not sufficiently sunk into
                            his understanding. So a monk, one he had learned to hate (though there
                            were many he respected and a few he loved) came to his cell, whither he
                            had slunk away abashed.</p>
                        <p>"You must scourge yourself," said he solemnly, and held up the
                            scourge.</p>
                        <p>There was a deep vein in his own nature, of the existence of which the
                            boy had till then been ignorant. His blood boiled. He was like an
                            enraged king. He scarcely knew what he did. Scourge
                            himself&#151;like the lowest? They had done much with
                                <unclear>him-</unclear>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-042" n="36"/> He had submitted for weeks. He had desired
                            to submit and had put the boy's spirit down and tried to learn. He had
                            suffered, feared, wept. He had grown thm and weak. The eyes that glared
                            suddenly on the priest were sunken eyes. He knew in that moment who he
                            was.</p>
                        <p>"I am no monk!" he shrieked, and, springing toward his visitor, seized
                            the scourge from his hand and brought it hissing through the air,
                            straight across the other's face. The monk beat a precipitate and
                            scandalized retreat, his cheek bleeding. He cried blasphemy for many a
                            day. The boy shrank trembling into a corner, rage and remorse combating
                            in him.</p>
                        <p>It was a question for the prior to settle, and the prior was old and
                            worldly-wise, despite the cloister. He chuckled to himself over the
                            matter, which he seemed to weigh with solemnity. It proved to him that
                            the boy's nature was a nature to be feared. It was time, said he, that a
                                <unclear>litt-</unclear> more liberty should be granted, and his
                            education should be begun and vigorously pursued. So Vicente was
                            reprimanded only. Then he was led out to the big book chained in the <hi
                                rend="i">patio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"This is the Bible," said the prior. "The common people should not read
                            it, but you, you are to be taught to read, not only this, but many other
                            things."</p>
                        <p>The monks took him in hand, and the lessons of all kinds began. They
                            found him apt. The monk he had scourged did not approach him, but
                            frowned from a distance with bandaged cheek. Even yet they fed the boy
                            but little. But he wanted little. And many hardships were put upon him.
                            He was given, after his studies, heavy labor; but he preferred it to
                            idleness.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-043" n="37"/>
                        <p>At the end of the half year they sent him out on certain days, like
                            Luther of old, to beg in the streets. They wanted him, too, to learn the
                            city and the customs of its people. So he scudded through the narrow
                            ways, begging his bread, dressed in the habit of the cloister. He
                            prowled into every nook and corner of the town. He was many a time
                            lonely and sad and wandered on, even in the night, to drown his
                            restlessness. The people of some streets grew to know the face of the
                            boy, a face thin but strong, gray-white, unlike the more ordinary
                            Mexican face. The main plaza in the town's centre was haunted by him.
                            The deep cathedral bells seemed to him to find echo in the emotions of
                            his heart, in its memories, its capacity for love, its loneliness and
                            its hopes. He wandered under the plaza's trees and among its flowers. He
                            went under the cathedral's pointed towers and into its doors. The mass
                            was solemn to him; but there was one thing strange in his conduct. He
                                <unclear>wo-</unclear>ld not kneel. They had noticed this long and
                            with pain in the monastery chapel. They had prayed with him, exhorted
                            him, threatened him, punished him. He had listened to it all. He had not
                            defied them; he had not seemed rebellious. He had meditated on it and
                            made no reply. They had watched his eyes and pale face, and, puzzled,
                            left him. He would not kneel.</p>
                        <p>He learned, in the time that then passed, to read. He had learned a
                            little of the Chapala priest. The prior brought him such books as were
                            calculated to inspire him, histories of his people and their wrongs,
                            works relating to kings and their rights, treatises on the divine origin
                            of the church and its legitimate power. In his sixteenth and seventeenth
                            year in particular, these books and many more absorbed <pb
                                id="VAA3931-044" n="38"/> him. Also, he went much to the chained
                            volume by the fountain. The Old Testament was his favorite. He read it
                            as another boy reads a fairy-tale. He dreamed over it, lay awake
                            thinking of it, arose with his nerves in tension in the middle of the
                            night and carried his candle to it and read. The books seemed to have
                            changed him more than all else. He became more silent, meditative,
                            self-contained, as though he felt a power grown in him. He had the look
                            and the manner of one much older than he. One night he found in the
                            chained book a passage that had failed to strike him before. He recalled
                            that the hermit had quoted it. He carried it, after that, till the day
                            of his death, in his heart.</p>
                        <p>"And he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming
                            sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, long since had he devoured the contents of those proofs
                            of his lineage which the hermit had submitted to him. He read them over
                            and over. He kept them locked away in safety save when he took them out
                            to pore over them yet again. The proof was there, clear and indisputable
                            back to the old time, and every letter of it he learned by heart
                            &#151; his mother's epistle written in a fine, peculiar hand and
                            ending with a passionate appeal to her child, then unborn &#151; the
                            preceding documents extending back, older and yellower; among them that
                            of him who had been killed in Zacatecas and whose involved sentences
                            embodied a curiously quaint dream of the imperial future &#151; the
                            crisp statement of facts written one hundred and fifty years before by
                            the Guadalajara bishop, who trusted his cause to the Virgin &#151;
                            finally, the irregular piece of sheepskin, doubtless from some flock of
                            Chapalac's shore, whereon were <pb id="VAA3931-045" n="39"/> the
                            unfading hieroglyphics of the old prince, relating his wanderings. This
                            last the boy carried always with him. It was like a talisman that
                            brought to him the help of those warrior spirits who had been as royal
                            as Montezuma's self.</p>
                        <p>The time was approaching when the monks intended sending him back, for a
                            year, to his people, to study them more thoroughly, to be in touch with
                            their interests, to wander all the lake region over and be a part of it;
                            then again to return for the final training and the final wait till the
                            opportune moment for the blow.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
                        <p>CLARITA had not forgotten him. If the fishers knew where he was they did
                            not tell her. She was too little at first to know how to question. After
                            months, during which she rarely heard his name, she lost all disposition
                            to question. But her life was not what it should have been. She still
                            lived in the hut with Francisco; and Anastasio, his tall, lean
                            fellow-fisherman, had come to live with them. What care she received was
                            little more than to be hastily fed, and, for the rest, to take care of
                            herself. She played with the children on the sand, or went wandering
                            with the enterprising Pepa up St. Michael's sides over the town. She had
                            in her an unexpressed longing for better care, and she remembered
                            Vicente and held him in her heart.</p>
                        <p>She grew pretty as she grew older &#151; not a beauty like Pepa's.
                            Pepa's eyes learned to flash at eight years of age. There was freedom,
                            grace, daring, in Pepa's very carriage. She did naughty things, too, and
                            all the village knew her. If she was punished by her mother at the inn
                            she cried out that when Vicente came to marry her, he would punish her
                            mother too and the whole fishing town. She also remembered the boy, but
                            she had so many other things in her lively, scintillant brain, that the
                            memory gradually grew vague. With Clarita it was different. She was
                            quieter; her prettiness was modest, <pb id="VAA3931-047" n="41"/>
                            subdued. Her hair was oddly auburn, and when she washed it in the lake
                            on Saturdays and dried it in the sunny breeze, it glistened like gold;
                            which gold Pepita mingled with her black tresses, let the wind wrap the
                            two of them in the combined mesh, and ran off laughing with Clarita held
                            round her slim body by Pepita's strong young arm, both girls
                            barefoot.</p>
                        <p>Francisco was cruel at times, and loud and boisterous always. He did not
                            understand the child and little cared. So she did not love him. She
                            loved nobody there, unless it were Pepita, whose spirit was too wild for
                            her. She sat on the sand under a huge <hi rend="i">salati</hi> tree that
                            stood by the shore, and, though she did not think it, her little heart
                            was crying for something beyond. She thought at those times under the
                            wild fig's great branches of the brother she had romped with, the
                            brother who had carried her on his shoulders, tumbled her in the sand,
                            eaten and slept with her, and disappeared across the lake in the night.
                            When she was eight the priest came and arranged that he should teach
                            her. He explained to her that Vicente had exacted the promise. She had
                            not heard the name for months. Her blood leaped up and her face, not a
                            very dark one, flushed with an eager blush, and the growing dimples in
                            her cheeks were suddenly deep.</p>
                        <p>"Where is he ?" she said, half afraid to ask.</p>
                        <p>"He has gone away to learn, too, but he will come back."</p>
                        <p>She was only bewildered at this. But she asked no more. His memory was
                            the only thing of reality and happiness in her life; he had wanted her
                            to learn, and she would learn. That one past wish of the boy's was
                            enough for all her heart and its affections to tie to.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-048" n="42"/>
                        <p>She was nine years old when she went once with the fishermen to the city
                            market with the fish. Some of the men went early every Thursday morning,
                            that Guadalajara's market might be full of fish for Friday. The fishers
                            clubbed together for this and took turns in going, two making the
                            journey for all. Pepa had already gone more than once. She had run off
                            to go. She used to own a burro of her own, and if the men would not
                            permit her to ride between the baskets on theirs, she rode hers. Alas !
                            the growing, high-spirited, reckless Pepita cost her wrinkled-faced
                            mother at the <hi rend="i">meson</hi> many a night's sleep. Clarita
                            would not do as she. When it came Francisco's turn she begged to go. It
                            was rarely he let her do anything like that; but he let her now.</p>
                        <p>Francisco, Anastasio, and Fortino the big, circled out on the lake in the
                            little boat all night, dropping the meshes of the long net. They drew
                            its two ends then to the beach, and pulled in the net's circle, using
                            both hands and feet, till the white fish wriggled on the sand. This was
                            repeated till three o'clock of Thursday morning. Then they piled the
                            fish in tall cylindrical baskets among wet banana leaves with wet banana
                            leaves over the top to keep them cool. The burros were driven out of a
                            lot behind the hut, and came stupidly. The baskets were roped to them,
                            one on either side of each burro. Then Clarita was awakened, arose from
                            the earthen floor, put on her little long dress of pink cotton and her
                            blue <hi rend="i">rebozo,</hi> and came rubbing her eyes. By lantern
                            light on the beach Anastasio's long arm hoisted her to a burro's back,
                            and she sat high up perched between the two guarding baskets, with her
                            feet out on the burro's neck. Then the journey began, and Fortino
                            &#151; he who had carried her mother's coffin away on his <pb
                                id="VAA3931-049" n="43"/> shoulder &#151; was left with the
                            nets. Francisco and Anastasio walked behind the burros (there were five
                            of them), beating them with sticks, and making the journey, so nearly as
                            possible, a lively one.</p>
                        <p>They went for hours thus over stony ways, and were climbing the ridge
                            that stretched between mountains when the sun came up. They stopped on
                            the ridge's summit, with all the great lake spread out like a silver
                            jewel in its porphyry boundary of peaks behind, the sun reflected in it,
                            and the valley and its trail to Guadalajara to the front. The girl
                            leaped down, and they made a fire of brush on the ground and warmed
                            beans and ate <hi rend="i">tortillas.</hi> Then they were away again,
                            and noon found them half the distance to the city. Dinner at one was
                            like the breakfast, and the stream they ate it by was tiny and poor, for
                            it was in March, &#151; a season warm enough here, but dry. Clarita
                            mounted again in silence, dust on her dress and on her auburn hair, and
                            the animals were beaten on.</p>
                        <p>"What would you do, Anastasio," cried Francisco, in a speculative vein,
                            "if you had a thousand dollars ?"</p>
                        <p>Anastasio, the chief characteristic of whose attenuated body was
                            laziness, whistled slowly as though the sum were not comprehensible.</p>
                        <p>"I'd just sit down on the shore," drawled he, "and let them bring me <hi
                                rend="i">tequila</hi> from the first day of January round to the
                            last day of December, leaving out Guadalupe day, and San Francisco day,
                            and a few more <hi rend="i">fiestas,</hi> when they could make it <hi
                                rend="i">pulque.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"Ha ! ha !" shouted Francisco, as though it were a joke of great
                            refreshing qualities. "But alter a day you wouldn't be in a condition to
                            drink it!"</p>
                        <p>"Then they could just set it around on the sand till I came to," drawled
                            Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"I never saw the amount," mused the other, <pb id="VAA3931-050" n="44"/>
                            dreamily. "The most I ever had &#151; well, you know when it was
                            &#151; when they paid me," with a wink at the girl, who was on the
                            second burro to the front, "to keep him, you know."</p>
                        <p>"And you spent it infernally regularly. Yours was a great deal. Pay you
                            for taking him, pay you for keeping him, and you made them pay you for
                            taking him away. Francisco," continued the drawling fisherman, swinging
                            himself all the while lazily along, and towering far over six feet in
                            lank height, "Francisco, the mother of God will reward you."</p>
                        <p>"If I could only sell him again," sighed Francisco, breaking into a roar
                            after the sigh, "the reward would be greater!"</p>
                        <p>Clarita's burro chancing to lag at that moment, they came to her side.
                            There were tears in the child's eyes, and when Francisco uttered a harsh
                            exclamation at the sight, she sobbed. They whipped the burro up, and she
                            was trotted on, her little bare feet sticking out on the animal's neck,
                            her body perched straight between the two great baskets, and the tears
                            running slowly down her cheeks.</p>
                        <p>It was eight o'clock at night and dark when they came to the city. They
                            entered an inn, or <hi rend="i">meson,</hi> for the poorer classes. It
                            was low and large and square, built about an open, stone-paved court
                            where many burros waited. The fish being at once disposed of to
                            market-men in tall sombreros and red blankets, the fishermen and the
                            girl went into a dirty dining-room where some were eating round a rude
                            table and some were squatted on the floor. A cook brought them eggs, and
                            the inevitable <hi rend="i">tortillas,</hi> and some fried pork from
                            charcoal fires that burned in pot-like <hi rend="i">braseros.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A half hour later the child, lonely, unhappy, was <pb id="VAA3931-051"
                                n="45"/> put to bed with some women in a bare room with a blank
                            white wall, brick floor, and matting for a bed. She fell asleep. The
                            next morning the sound of rockets awakened her. She started up in dread.
                            The sound brought over her the misery of that night long ago when her
                            mother died. She thought she was to be torn again from Vicente. She
                            found instead that it was a feast day, and all the city was in a giddy
                            mood. Francisco was calling her. There were to be bands in the plaza, a
                            saint carried with great procession and pomp through all the streets,
                            illimitable amounts of <hi rend="i">tequila</hi> drunk, and, at night,
                            "castles" and wheels in fireworks. In the restaurant were crowds of men
                            and women. The men's white clothing was all spotlessly clean, and the
                            women were in bright colors. Their shouting and laughing bewildered the
                            child, and <hi rend="i">gorditas</hi> and <hi rend="i">chicharrones</hi>
                            and many another fried and sputtering thing sizzled on the charcoal
                            fires. She could not eat. Francisco and Anastasio had already taken some
                            liquor, and they were as happy as was possible for Mexicans to be on a
                            gala day. They had the money for the fish.</p>
                        <p>"More <hi rend="i">tequila !</hi>" whined Anastasio. "I am so long,
                            brothers. It takes so much to get to the bottom of me. Friends, I can
                            always feel it drying up on the road down, and my stomach is left
                            whistling."</p>
                        <p>"Then it will have whistled music enough for a cock-fight before night.
                            Ha! ha!" cried Francisco. "Come on !"</p>
                        <p>They were out and away to the plaza, Clarita, her blue <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo</hi> over her head, following them dumbly, forgotten. The
                            narrow streets were full of gay colors and the shops were crowded. The
                                <hi rend="i">cantinas</hi> were fullest of all. Round the plaza were
                            the low-arched <pb id="VAA3931-052" n="46"/>
                            <hi rend="i">portales</hi> under whose continuous shade the people
                            promenaded. The trees swung golden fruit in the morning breeze, the
                            flowers spoke all colors, and the pointed cathedral towers rose high
                            against the deep blue of the Mexican heavens. There was a band playing,
                            and the girl, lost in its melodies, wandered nearer and nearer it.</p>
                        <p>It was all strange to her, half awing, half fascinating her. She had
                            watched the crowds for an hour, moving slowly here and there, and a
                            great yellow flower that had swung over her head was just falling to the
                            ground at her feet, plucked by the wind, when she remembered that she
                            had not heard the loud jests of her father and his companion for some
                            time. She was alone and grew terrified. She ran from the plaza to the
                            arches of the <hi rend="i">portales,</hi> not knowing why nor whither.
                            As she ran she caught sight of a figure in black, passing among the many
                            brilliant colors of the thronged street. She paused, she stopped. She
                            knew not whether her terror increased or abated. The face of the figure
                            had been toward her but a moment; the figure itself was passing on. She
                            would have cried out, but could not. She was in one instant back in the
                            days of her infancy. She would have run after the black figure, but this
                            too she could not do. She was fixed to the spot. She saw it going away,
                            turning the corner by the cathedral, walking slowly as though in a
                            revery &#151; and it was gone.</p>
                        <p>After many minutes she was able to decide which was the street by which
                            they had come from the <hi rend="i">meson.</hi> She entered it and
                            trudged on, her <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> fallen to her shoulders. She
                            was sick and full of weariness. She entered the <hi rend="i">meson</hi>
                            unseen, crept into the room where the matting was, and crouched in a
                            corner on it. She was trembling. She stayed there <pb id="VAA3931-053"
                                n="47"/> all day, the music, the rockets, the noise of the
                            procession when they carried the gaudy saint along the street, failing
                            to draw her out. As for Francisco and Anastasio, they were happy enough,
                            without thought of her, without intention of returning home till the
                            festivities should be done. <hi rend="i">Tequila</hi> is a good thing
                            with which to silence care. They did not return to the <hi rend="i"
                                >meson</hi> till nearly night. They entered at last in mood half
                            maudlin, half boisterous.</p>
                        <p>"A little more <hi rend="i">tequila,</hi> mother," muttered Anastasio to
                            the woman in the restaurant."It has &#151; it has got &#151;
                            nigh to the bottom."</p>
                        <p>Francisco, suddenly remembering, went to look for the child. She was not
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The day's gloom and loneliness had produced their fruit. She was not all
                            timidity and she had had time to think and feel. She felt sure she had
                            seen the only human being she loved, the only one that loved her. She
                            had been neglected all her life, neglected and cruelly treated to-day.
                            She wanted him &#151; she could bear it no more without him. Toward
                            evening she crept out of the <hi rend="i">meson</hi> again and ran
                            swiftly, recklessly to the plaza, covering her face with her blue <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo,</hi> and arrived breathless at the cathedral. She
                            hung about its great iron gates for an hour, hardly daring to hope. Many
                            figures came out and went in, some of them in black. None was he. At
                            last, when the red sunset was in the sky and over the street, the
                            biggest of the bells boomed out over her head.</p>
                        <p>Then she saw him, slighter than the other black figures, graceful, to her
                            beautiful. He was coming out, though the rest were now going in, and she
                            saw his face plainly. She had been a tiny thing when they took him away,
                            and years had passed. But she <pb id="VAA3931-054" n="48"/> would have
                            known him anywhere in all the world. She saw his face more plainly
                            still. It had never been so white as this in days gone by. It had never
                            been so thin nor the eyes so deep. She was terrified anew at the change
                            in him, terror mixed with ecstasy. She did not run to him. She stood
                            holding to the iron of the gate, staring at his eyes. He was a yard from
                            her, looking at the ground and not seeing her, when she uttered a wild,
                            harsh cry:</p>
                        <p>"Vicente! Vicente!"</p>
                        <p>He turned, surprised, looked, caught her up, and held her sobbing against
                            his breast.</p>
                        <p>He was alarmed yet delighted to have her. He walked with her, at first in
                            silence, into one of the narrow streets where the seclusion was more
                            marked. There he put her down.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, Clarita !" he cried, "where did you come from &#151; why are you
                            here ?"</p>
                        <p>She was here to find him, and she told him so, and she never wanted to go
                            back, clinging to his hand with all her dimples out and the blushes
                            there too, the auburn hair blowing about her face and the happiness
                            returned.</p>
                        <p>Where did he go? Where did they take him? Where was he now? She would go
                            too &#151; oh! mightn't she, mightn't she stay with him?</p>
                        <p>"Have they treated you ill ?" asked he, looking down at her pityingly.
                            She felt again that his face was changed. It was more serious, the eyes
                            larger and darker.</p>
                        <p>She told him they had left her here in the streets and she had run back
                            to the inn and crouched on the floor all day. Couldn't she stay with him
                            &#151; please, oh ! couldn't she stay with him ?</p>
                        <p>He bit his lips and there was red blood in his very <pb id="VAA3931-055"
                                n="49"/> forehead. His anger at Francisco was boiling in him. Had
                            they begun to teach her to read?</p>
                        <p>"Oh yes, the padre teaches me, and I came yesterday with the fish. Oh!
                            can't I stay with you?"</p>
                        <p>"No, Clarita," he replied, and was lost in a sudden revery. Then he
                            continued as though the decision had but then swept over him. "But I am
                            coming, little sister, and soon. Look at me. I promise to come
                            back."</p>
                        <p>He seemed wrapped in the meditation of his purpose after that, and walked
                            on, holding the child's hand. She gripped his as though never to loosen
                            it, and trudged with him. She was terribly afraid he would send her
                            back. His black clothing and his silent manner filled her with something
                            like reverence. For the mere idea of Vicente had ever been to her an
                            idea of all that was beyond her poor little life.</p>
                        <p>He walked faster and faster, dreaming and holding her hand. He came to
                            the monastery walls and suddenly stopped.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita," he said, "I promise to come back to you. And when I come I
                            will explain all, why I went away, and the thing that I am going to do.
                            You are going on, and must study as I wanted you to. You will be able,
                            by and by, to understand me. And, under the <hi rend="i">salati</hi>
                            tree I am coming to talk it over with you, there by the lake where we
                            played. Francisco does not know what he does. I shall teach him to treat
                            you better. And now, because it is not permitted that you enter here,
                            you must go back with him."</p>
                        <p>She could make no reply to this. She simply raised her <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo</hi> to her head and wrapped herself in it, humbly obeying.
                            To stay was all her thought &#151; but he said to go. It was nearing
                            dusk and the hour <pb id="VAA3931-056" n="50"/> had arrived when the
                            gendarmes of the day on the street corners were being changed for those
                            of the night. One of the latter, ready for his watch, passed them under
                            the monastery walls, with his lantern. He took his station at a corner,
                            and the other, whom he relieved, came walking by.</p>
                        <p>Vicente had observed this latter gendarme before, had even addressed him
                            at times. He was a very young man, probably not yet twenty-one. He was a
                            little over medium height with broad shoulders, graceful and athletic
                            figure. The uniform sat well on him.</p>
                        <p>"Señor!" called Vicente.</p>
                        <p>The other came up. Vicente explained to him that the child, his sister,
                            had come with the fishers from the lake, that she had lost her way and
                            that he wanted the officer to take her back to the inn. The gendarme had
                            won a secret confidence in him long since by his quiet, firm doing of
                            his duty. Clarita was given into his charge and Vicente offered him a
                            piece of money. The other looked at it, shrugged his shoulders, and
                            smiled.</p>
                        <p>"No," said he. "I dare say the child will pay enough in herself. Pay for
                            a pleasure &#151; a happiness in the gloom? Ah, not so, my friend.
                            Come, little one, we'll have you back."</p>
                        <p>She turned to Vicente, who caught her up again.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita, I promise to come. Go back to the lake and wait for me."</p>
                        <p>So, with her hand in the gendarme's and her head turned round to her
                            brother's retreating figure, she left him.</p>
                        <p>"And what is the lake like?" asked the gendarme.</p>
                        <p>She had said nothing and not seemed to know he was there. She looked up
                            suddenly. She had not <pb id="VAA3931-057" n="51"/> noticed before that
                            he was different from other men. His face was white, at least white to
                            her, though it was doubtless tanned. But she always remembered it as
                            white. His hair, too, where it could be seen under his gendarme's cap,
                            was not black and straight. It was dark brown and waving. His eyes were
                            dark, though, like hers, nearly as dark as Vicente's. He spoke her
                            language a little oddly too. She did not know what it meant when one
                            pronounced his words in that manner. She forgot to reply &#151;
                            thinking again of Vicente. Vicente would come; Vicente would come!</p>
                        <p>"Is the lake beautiful? Are there mountains there and are the towns
                            big?"</p>
                        <p>"Not big like this," said she.</p>
                        <p>"Mountains?"</p>
                        <p>Yes, there were mountains.</p>
                        <p>"Tell me about it. What do you do? What kind of a place? What do they
                            call your town?"</p>
                        <p>"Chapala. It is a little place."</p>
                        <p>"Are the people all like you? Ah &#151; tell me they are like you!
                            "He was looking at her auburn hair.</p>
                        <p>She did not understand this.</p>
                        <p>"Oh no. They are mostly bigger," said she. "Fortino is very big."</p>
                        <p>"Are there any of them white?" he asked with much sudden intensity.</p>
                        <p>She threw a quick look at his face. There was some mystery about
                            whiteness to her. No, said she, Vicente was the whitest she knew.</p>
                        <p>"And what do you do there?"</p>
                        <p>"They fish there."</p>
                        <p>"Are the nets big and white, and are there boats?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh yes; they are very, very long, and they stretch them out on the sand
                            to dry and we play <pb id="VAA3931-058" n="52"/> out there." She was
                            growing interested and he won confidence.</p>
                        <p>"What do you play?"</p>
                        <p>"Well, if it is moonlight, while they fish we play on the sand."</p>
                        <p>"And who are we?"</p>
                        <p>"Pepa and I. It used to be Vicente, but they &#151; "</p>
                        <p>She could not speak of that, and stopped.</p>
                        <p>"Who is Pepa?"</p>
                        <p>"She is another girl."</p>
                        <p>"Is her hair like yours?"</p>
                        <p>"No, it is black. We wash it in the lake on Saturdays, and we climb the
                            mountain and can see right down into the <hi rend="i">patios</hi> of the
                            houses."</p>
                        <p>"Is the lake very big and beautiful?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh yes."</p>
                        <p>He sighed deeply and walked on in silence.</p>
                        <p>"Are there gendarmes there?" said he.</p>
                        <p>"Oh there is a <hi rend="i">jefe politico</hi> there and some of his
                            men."</p>
                        <p>Silence again, then:</p>
                        <p>"Why," he muttered, "God knows it would suit me. The farther away the
                            better. If it is like you, little girl, it ought to be balm indeed. I
                            think I can feel the breeze and see the sunset already. Heigh-ho! to be
                            where all is fresh, new, untouched &#151; and to forget. Little
                            girl, you are so eloquent a pleader of your native shores that I fain
                            would go!"</p>
                        <p>They came to the inn.</p>
                        <p>"This is it," said she subdued, and started in, leaving him with no
                            ceremony, afraid of Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"Good-by!" he called.</p>
                        <p>She turned, startled, remembered the Mexican politeness, and came and
                            shook hands with him gravely. His face was full of real regret at
                            leaving her.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-059" n="53"/>
                        <p>"Good-by. May be I shall come to your lake sometime and see you there
                            &#151; and how much better were there none but you and I! Heigh-ho!
                            Good-by &#151; and back to the shadows."</p>
                        <p>She remembered him long.</p>
                        <p>Francisco came in soon, raving, and would have whipped her had not liquor
                            rendered his purposes diffused. She ate <hi rend="i">frijoles</hi> and
                                <hi rend="i">tortillas</hi> for supper, as always, and went to bed
                            on the matting. "Vicente will come," said she. The castles and wheels of
                            fireworks were duly witnessed by her long since unsteady father and by
                            Anastasio, to the bottom of whom the liquor had now quite descended,
                            much to his satisfaction. They woke her up very early in the morning and
                            the journey was made back to the lake as it had been made to the city.
                            And all the way, jogging along perched between the empty baskets on the
                            burro's back, she said," Vicente is coming." They arrived at Chapala at
                            night and she was tired and sleepy and went to sleep on the earthen
                            floor. Francisco, Anastasio, and the other fishermen counted the money
                            by candle light. There was not much more than half of it left. But then,
                            yesterday was a feast day; and the half was received
                            sympathetically.</p>
                        <p>As for Vicente, his purpose was formed. He stated his case plainly to the
                            prior, and, partly because of the imperiousness of his demand, partly
                            because it accorded with the prior's intentions, won the necessary
                            consent. He was nineteen years of age. He had received what was
                            considered, at that time and in that region, a good education. He had
                            read much. He had thought more. He had grown in more ways than one.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, with the very money in his pocket the hermit had given
                            him (for he had spent <pb id="VAA3931-060" n="54"/> almost none of it)
                            with the understanding that his connection with the monastery continued
                            through the Chapala priest, and that through that circuit more money
                            could be drawn, Vicente, dressed in the clothes of the middle classes
                            and not of the monk, rode out of the city and took the stony way to the
                            mountain lake.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER V</head>
                        <p>OUT of the rocky hills that lie back of Tizapan on the lake's southern
                            side, used to come in those days, to Chapala, a young man of a cold,
                            piercing eye, pointed moustaches, and quick, silent tread like the tread
                            of a cat. He was no peon. He had a widowed mother in Tizapan who might
                            have been called not far from wealthy. She gave him some fruit groves in
                            the hills and tried to tame and make something out of him by letting him
                            manage them. The biggest market on the lake in those days was the
                            Chapala market on the northern shore. So she bought him two <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas,</hi> and every Saturday afternoon his peons loaded them
                            with fruit and, if he chose (and he generally did, for he loved the
                            water), he came with them, an all night's sail across the lake, to sell
                            on Sunday morning.</p>
                        <p>Being of a wild turn he had known the whole lake and the mountains that
                            surrounded it since he was able to row and stick to a horse. He knew too
                            much of it. He had a passion for gambling and came home many a time in
                            his youth without his horse, and not infrequently with two or three. He
                            ran off at eighteen years of age to Guadalajara with several hundred
                            dollars he had scraped together. He learned all the games there, and
                            though he lost nearly all his money learning them, he was a sufficiently
                            apt pupil to win it back again. He went to Mexico City too. What times
                            he had had there nobody knew. After <pb id="VAA3931-062" n="56"/> some
                            months Doroteo Quiroz came wandering home without anything. But he had
                            acquired that cat-like tread, his ever ready manner, and a new daring.
                            He took great pride in having the gambler's honor. But he said, with a
                            sigh, that gambling was a ruinous business and he was going to raise
                            fruit. He did raise fruit; but he set up a roulette table in Tizapan,
                            too, and taught other people to play. His eyes, at twenty-two, had that
                            cold, strained, yet often attractive ustre that comes into the eyes of
                            the gamester who has seen wild times. He was grown to be distinctly
                            handsome.</p>
                        <p>On a certain Sunday morning in summer Doroteo's two flat-bottomed craft,
                            with single square sails spread to a bulging breeze, came sailing across
                            the lake. They had weathered a storm all night, such a storm as only the
                            Chapala rainy season can evolve. The winds and the rain had beaten them,
                            and the waves had cast them about, while streaks of lightning tore the
                            sky. Doroteo had been in it all, save when the rain was hardest, high up
                            on the stern, and had sung a falsetto air to the thunders. The sun was
                            out radiant now, the sails glistened drying, steam rose from the wet
                            planks and the piles of yellow fruit on the bottom, and the waves rocked
                            gently. Chapala's white, twin church towers rose glistening before,
                            under St. Michael's stony head, and Tizapan was not even a speck away
                            across the water to the rear.</p>
                        <p>"Down with the sails, boys, and up with the poles!" cried Quiroz; and
                            then he sang softly:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"The game was sweet, the game was swift,</l>
                            <l n="2">And deft that black-eyed Spanish girl.</l>
                            <l n="3">She staked her love upon the red &#151;</l>
                            <l n="4">I won it fair at every whirl.</l>
                            <l n="5">She would not give it me!"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-063" n="57"/>
                        <p>He was leaning on the bow of the larger vessel, and the larger vessel's
                            name was the "Goddess Venus," painted in black letters across the sail.
                            He wore one of those rich sombreros that characterize the Mexican
                            gentleman of the country districts. Its silver bands glistened and its
                            wide brim was embroidered in golden threads. He wore, too, tight
                            trousers of a fine, soft leather, with silver buttons linked with silver
                            chains down the sides to his feet, and above, a short brown jacket of
                            the same material.</p>
                        <p>The sails came flapping down, and the sailors, with their white cotton
                            drawers rolled to their hips, and their brown legs glistening, walked
                            slowly back and forth on the boats' upper ledges, poling the awkward
                            vessels to the shore. The smaller of the two, called "The Delirium," was
                            brought thus quite to the sandy beach, stern first. The other was too
                            heavily laden and was halted some yards out.</p>
                        <p>"Now, out with you, boys," cried the owner, "and carry me."</p>
                        <p>Two peons leaped overboard, and the water rose to their hips. One of them
                            took the rope of the boat; the other received Doroteo's form on broad
                            shoulders and waded with him to the stretch of sand, where he put him
                            down. The stern of the "Goddess" was drawn, by means of the rope, to the
                            prow of the "Delirium," and a means thus formed of unloading her cargo,
                            using the smaller <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> as a bridge. There were other
                                <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> tossing about, some at the shore, some
                            anchored far out, some sailing in or sailing away, each with its one
                            square canvas glistening. These boats are from twenty-five to sixty feet
                            in length, part of each being covered with a thatched roof. There is one
                            mast. Up and down the rugged path that led past the <hi rend="i"
                                >salati</hi>-tree into the <pb id="VAA3931-064" n="58"/> street, and
                            thence to the market-place, workmen and strollers passed and repassed,
                            and the fruits of a hundred kinds of trees and the vegetables of many
                            strange plants, the charcoal of distant fires and the wood and stone of
                            distant mountains, went laboriously thither.</p>
                        <p>"Good morning! Good morning, Don Doroteo!" cried a voice.</p>
                        <p>He had scarcely been set down. He turned to find at his elbow a slender
                            girl of fifteen years of age.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa!" he cried, letting his gaze wander slowly over her body, a body
                            coming to maturity with remarkable swiftness. "Why, she's a woman. Eyes
                            of me &#151; she's grown! Dios! let her grow an hour more and she's
                            Venus herself. How in beauty's name did you do it so quickly?</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"She staked her love upon the red &#151;</l>
                            <l n="2">I'll win it straight at every whirl!"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>"No; it is promised," she said, demurely. She wore a red dress. She
                            clapped her hands in a spontaneous exuberance of spirits and cried it
                            repeatedly. "It is promised &#151; it is promised!"</p>
                        <p>"Promised? Faith, you begin early. Promise at fifteen, break it at
                            sixteen. To whom?"</p>
                        <p>His men were unloading the fruit. They had piled bags of oranges on the
                            sand. She sat down on them, and talked teasingly:</p>
                        <p>"To a man. To the handsomest man. To one who has seen everything that
                            there is."</p>
                        <p>Quiroz's eyes were shining and his moustaches were sticking out with
                            extreme pointedness, his whole handsome face showing a scarcely tamed
                            interest in her.</p>
                        <p>"He has been, too, to strange place," she continued, <pb id="VAA3931-065"
                                n="[]"/>
                            <figure entity="VAA3931-2">
                                <p>"'Touch me if you dare.'"</p>
                            </figure>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-066" n="59"/> her black eyes dancing. "He is going to
                            wake up the world."</p>
                        <p>"Good!" said Doroteo. "And neither the world nor he will sleep again,
                            I'll wager them on that, if Pepa Aranja is a part of the play."</p>
                        <p>There was something half mocking in his tone, and he smiled at her with
                            his lips shut, and then made a dash at her, and would have had her hand,
                            but she leaped up and stood on top of the farthest bag of oranges. The
                            workmen were surrounding her with mangos and <hi rend="i">tunas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Touch me if you dare," cried she triumphantly, straightening herself up,
                            "and I shall jump into your <hi rend="i">tunas.</hi>" The morning breeze
                            was blowing her hair and her skirts about her. There was red blood in
                            her dark face. She was all life, all motion. She answered his smile then
                            with a dazzling one of her own, a smile such as one might travel a
                            thousand miles and never see again; and she followed it with a ringing
                            laugh, and tossed her head. "Oh &#151; when we get it awake, we can
                            keep it awake!" she cried.</p>
                        <p>"Jump into the <hi rend="i">tunas</hi> if you wish," said he, stepping
                            slowly nearer her and speaking low, "but tell me about him. Holy Mary! I
                            may want you myself! You are so alive. Who is he?"</p>
                        <p>"Don't you know? He went away five years ago, in the night. He came back
                            last spring. He's been all over and all round the lake since then. You
                            know him!"</p>
                        <p>"Ah," said Quiroz, with much satisfaction. "Vicente. And fortune goes
                            with him." His eyes dilated, and he came close and whispered. "Are you
                            in this big game, too? By the mass, I believe you're capable of secrets
                            and schemes, and the Lord knows what, young as you are. Come. Maybe I'm
                                <pb id="VAA3931-067" n="60"/> in it too. What do you know &#151;
                            that he is going to be &#151; what?"</p>
                        <p>She grew suddenly long faced.</p>
                        <p>"I am not that kind &#151; to go telling it," she said, solemnly.</p>
                        <p>"Pooh! I know it all &#151; and more. He has been in every town since
                            his return, on all the lake's shores, and beyond. Do you fancy I have
                            n't seen him, talked to him, and offered my humble services? And when he
                            begins &#151; oh, Pepa knows it all, eh? &#151; Pepa only! And
                            when he begins, and the wheel spins, Doroteo's future will be staked as
                            well!"</p>
                        <p>She was wide-eyed at this.</p>
                        <p>"So," said she, "you know it, too!"</p>
                        <p>"Why, I can hold my tongue. He told me of you. Doroteo is reckless.
                            Doroteo is bold. He has seen the world &#151; ha! ha! And the game
                            goes on merrily when he spins the wheel. These things Vicente knows, and
                            Doroteo's knowledge of the people and the lake, <hi rend="i">si,</hi>
                            and his boldness, señorita! Compared to Vicente and &#151; your
                            servant, all other men are &#151; cows!"</p>
                        <p>He whispered it full of scorn.</p>
                        <p>"And maybe," continued he, "Doroteo, too, is promised to be in at the
                            waking of the world!"</p>
                        <p>His face held a secretive, half fierce expression. He twirled his
                            moustaches.</p>
                        <p>"Dios!" he cried, "to think a girl of fifteen should be a woman
                            &#151; and an oriental beauty!"</p>
                        <p>Any one but Pepa would have hated his gaze. She laughed at him
                            bewitchingly.</p>
                        <p>"He will be coming back to Chapala to-day," she cried. "And when he comes
                            &#151; ah," looking the while into Doroteo's eyes mischievously,
                            "compared to him <hi rend="i">all other men</hi> are &#151; cows!"
                            She laughed <pb id="VAA3931-068" n="61"/> again in ringing glee, and
                            glapped her hands, and skipped on the orange bags. He sprang toward
                            her.</p>
                        <p>"Little witch!" cried he, his eyes flaming, "I'll have a kiss out of
                            those red lips for that!"</p>
                        <p>She was too quick for him. She leaped from the orange bags to one of
                            mangos, and skipped a little again, flushed and with flashing eyes. He
                            was after her there, too, and she sprang up to the low bow of the
                            "Delirium," and laughed at him and stuck out her lips. He was up in an
                            instant, making the single high leap from the ground, strong and swift.
                            But her black hair, flying free, disappeared within under the thatched
                            roof, and her feet made a thud on the boat's flat bottom. She was
                            scrambling over the piles of yellow and red fruit, shouting to him to
                            come on, nigh knocking the peons against the vessel's sides; and he was
                            after her in hot pursuit. She emerged from under the thatch near the
                            boat's pointed prow, and climbed to the boarded space across the front.
                            On this elevated stage over the water she had a moment to turn and laugh
                            at him. Then she jumped across the open between the vessels, and was
                            high up on the lofty stern of the "Goddess Venus." <q
                                direct="unspecified">

                                </lg>
                            </q> she sang breathless.</p>
                        <p>He was there too, and they scrambled under the second thatched roof. She
                            stood at last higher yet on the slanting prow of the "Goddess." The
                            waters rose and fell, sun-lit, under her, and there was no retreat. She
                            was flushed to her forehead, and put out her lips to him temptingly
                            again, as he came on. He thought he had her then, but he did not know
                                <pb id="VAA3931-069" n="62"/> her. He was jumping up to her exalted
                            perch, when she disappeared over the side. There was a little shriek and
                            a splash, and he saw a red flash swimming away to the shore. She was out
                            on the sand, laughing and shouting defiance to him and running away,
                            dripping with her soiled garments clinging round lithe limbs. She was
                            gone in the upper street, and he lacked his kiss.</p>
                        <p>Vicente was indeed, at that very time, riding out of Ajicjic, a village
                            on the shore to the west. An hour later he appeared in Chapala, and,
                            shut with Quiroz in a room of the <hi rend="i">meson,</hi> held a
                            conference with that active gamester, whom he had long known as daring
                            and intelligent, and whom he had chosen for those qualities, believing
                            the gaming instinct would be no detriment in the day of hazardous deeds.
                            It was then revealed to Quiroz, not altogether to his satisfaction, that
                            the time was not at hand. It was Vicente's decision that some years must
                            yet go by before the blow should be struck. So the two separated,
                            carrying with them certain differing images of the yet distant
                            future.</p>
                        <p>As for Clarita, Vicente had done all in his power to better her lonely
                            condition. He had been with her as much as possible, but this was
                            little. He had expostulated with and threatened Francisco in behalf of a
                            kinder treatment, and had finally accomplished something by combining
                            these means with money. He had, too, found a woman who would look a
                            little after the child, for the interest of Pepa's mother had been
                            enlisted more strongly in Clarita's favor. But the child was not happy
                            unless Vicente were there. The veil of sadness that nature and
                            circumstances had cast over her from birth, would not lift, save in his
                            presence, and even then it was not so much a lifting <pb
                                id="VAA3931-070" n="63"/> of it as a rendering it sweet. Vicente had
                            come, and she was more nearly happy; she dreaded thinking of the time
                            when he should again leave her for a long period. She studied diligently
                            these days, and when Vicente was there she doubled her lessons, being
                            taught by the priest and her brother too. She never considered him other
                            than her brother.</p>
                        <p>And the day must come when he would indeed leave her again for long. He
                            passed all these months in a careful study of the people, the country of
                            the lake region, the towns, the mountains. He was, for weeks, unheard
                            of, being yonder on the southern border, or in the western hills, or
                            high up among the mountain planters. He learned the people's thoughts,
                            their ways, and the gauge of their intelligence. He carried with him a
                            manner and a mind serious, thoughtful, full of the time to come. He was
                            received everywhere by the clergy, and taught and encouraged &#151;
                            must it be said? &#151; even blinded by them. They helped him
                            calculate the power of the springs that would move the people. They
                            showed him the effects of past revolutions, the failure of them, the
                            lack of a deep movement which the church alone could arouse. He grew sad
                            at the spectacle of his unhappy land. He fed on dreams of the dead ages
                            when his own blood made an empire here, on hopes of the future when he
                            should establish a thing true and strong in the instability of this
                            national falsehood.</p>
                        <p>His thoughts and feelings deepened and his character expanded. The one
                            defect lay in the very basis of his enthusiasm. The church that called
                            him, as it were, into being, inevitably cast over his mind that shade of
                            the dreamer, the ascetic, even the fanatic, which the intense reality of
                            a deed such as <pb id="VAA3931-071" n="64"/> he contemplated could not
                            brook. That the cloister is not the best propagator of strong practical
                            deeds history plainly shows. Where the church has won in politics she
                            has done so by abandoning the influence of the cloister. On this young
                            soul, filled with a towering earnestness, the effect of his surroundings
                            and the power that backed him was not conducive to the highest strength.
                            His enthusiasm took the color of his dreams, his hopes became
                            visions.</p>
                        <p>His brain held, burned into it, the picture of the cell to which, so many
                            years ago, he had been taken, of its occupant, and of the stony coast
                            whose waves and rocks were always, in his mind, associated with night.
                            But he made no inquiries. He recalled his promise and the hermit's
                            anxiety in exacting it. He respected that anxiety. Yet he could not be
                            blind. The existence of such a spot as that to which he had been led
                            could not be altogether unknown to all people. Thus, whether he would or
                            not, he was brought to a half knowledge of its location. Time going on,
                            though he would not search or inquire, he believed he knew where the
                            hermit buried himself.</p>
                        <p>The year rolled round, the seed was springing up indeed. There were
                            seemingly great forces at work in silence for him. But he must acquire
                            more knowledge and more power and the time must ripen. There came a day
                            in another spring when the monastery walls once more shut him in.</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult to exaggerate any account of the disturbances of
                            this young land, which, in the first half of this century and later,
                            seemed to have gone mad. No historian has done full justice, if indeed
                            any has tried, to the throes and paroxysms she passed through in that
                            short term of years between the victories of Hidalgo and the fall of <pb
                                id="VAA3931-072" n="65"/> the French. In 1836 Spain finally
                            acknowledged the independence of her embroiled and bitter whilom colony
                            after a virtual independence of no inconsiderable age. But to a casual
                            observer in those times it must have seemed that such success served
                            only to add to the unhappy state.</p>
                        <p>In 1838 France bombarded Vera Cruz in the interest of the celebrated Pie
                            Claim. The noise of that bombardment found discordant sounds enough
                            throughout the land to answer it. During those days a new constitution
                            was being forced on the people; and a new constitution meant revolution
                            after revolution. When the matter with the French was settled the noise
                            was found to continue from within more deafening than it had been round
                            the walls of Ulua. To follow the changes and unravel the skein of events
                            were useless, if not impossible. In 1839 General Mejia fell into the
                            power of that formidable Santa Anna. About the same time other sections
                            of the land rose up, crying for a new republic, unsatisfied with the one
                            that as yet had had scarce time to breathe. "A new republic," cried
                            they, "called no more Mexico; let it be named Sierra Madre." Sierra
                            Madre went down, a wreck. In 1840 Gutierrez de Estrada wrote pointing
                            out the alleged impossibility of a republic at all. He despaired; he
                            called for and urged the plan of an empire. He was banished and his
                            exile paid for the hazardous views he held. Bustamente was president
                            then; he was so till 1841. In that year that rugged-souled old fighter,
                            Santa Anna, in a revolution founded on the plan of Tacubaya, deposed
                            him. Europe was Bustamente's asylum. Echeverria was president for a few
                            crazy days. He could hold the seat no longer, for Santa Anna, with arms
                            to back him, took it for himself.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-073" n="66"/>
                        <p>In 1843 Brave's <hi rend="i">Junta de Notables</hi> decreed yet another
                            new constitution, and the trouble grew worse. By that constitution Santa
                            Anna was made far more absolute than is compatible with the name of
                            president. Rebellion was rampant; it seemed every corner of the land
                            would rise up in its own half-organized revolt. In 1844 the city of
                            Guadalajara presented a formidable array of armed denial. The waves of
                            that disturbance spread in all directions. Even the regions of the lake
                            felt the heavings of popular indignation; and some out of those quiet
                            fishing huts went forth to skirmish and to die in the city's streets.
                            Santa Anna came in person and the Jalisco revolt was with trouble
                            crushed. The time was fast coming when that old despot would see his
                            powers on the wane. Returning to his capital he found the nation, that
                            had seemed to shudder at his gorgon gaze, in arms against him. After his
                            fall Herrera, for one short year, held his seat. But it was many years
                            yet before the tenacious Santa Anna, bandied about by innumerable
                            events, and rising and falling with them, had at last to acknowledge in
                            his crippled age that his power was grown as rotten as his body. During
                            Herrera's régime the war-clouds of another country, a great and
                            formidable country to the north, began to blow black over the Rio
                            Grande.</p>
                        <p>Of those from the lake who participated in the Guadalajara insurrection
                            in 1844, was the chief of police of the Chapala canton, an officer
                            called in Mexico <hi rend="i">jefe politico,</hi> head of the gendarmes
                            of one of the sections into which the states are divided. He was a
                            hard-boned, gray-headed old man. When the trouble grew hottest the
                            governor had called him and his men to aid the state troops, such as
                            there were. He had gone with fire in his eye, riding out hotly <pb
                                id="VAA3931-074" n="67"/> one night at dusk toward the city. He had
                            got the worst of it, and three weeks later, when the revolt was crushed,
                            they came carrying him home to the lake on a canvas cot, whereon he
                            raved and tore his hair in a delirium. He died while they were crossing
                            the stony market square of his town of Chapala.</p>
                        <p>He who came to take the place of the fallen chief was that same gendarme
                            who had long before led Clarita back to the inn. He rode into the town
                            at night. He appeared the very next morning striding along the beach
                            surveying his ground, an athletic figure whose step was the step of
                            youth and alacrity. Pistols hung at his belt and a spur clinked on his
                            heel. It was then he found Clarita sitting in the hut's door reading a
                            book. In spite of the years the recognition was immediate.</p>
                        <p>"I have found you at last!" cried he in frank delight. "And all the way I
                            wondered, is the little, one still here!"</p>
                        <p>She was fifteen years of age, and yet a child. She arose with modest
                            blushes and held out her hand. She saw again the color of his face,
                            unusual to her. She noticed, too, that if his speech had had in it
                            before a foreign accent, it had lost it now.</p>
                        <p>"Thank you, señor, for taking me," she replied. "It was very good of
                            you."</p>
                        <p>"Books!" said he. "I come and find you reading a book, and here among
                            fishing boats. What fairyland am I to be master of?"</p>
                        <p>"It is a book Vicente sent me," said she. "It is about Rome and Hannibal,
                            and how he crossed the Alps, and the battle of Cannæ. So many things,"
                            she sighed, absently smoothing the mesh of her shining hair, "seem to
                            have happened in the world."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-075" n="68"/>
                        <p>"Many more than you dream, little one, and many that it were well you
                            dream not."</p>
                        <p>There were suddenly heard the thuds of a horse's feet and a high-spirited
                            steed burst on the newcomer's view, scattering sand from its hoofs. It
                            pranced along the beach to Clarita's hut, bearing Pepa on its back
                            &#151; Pepa grown older, more beautiful, resplendent now in many
                            colors, her blue skirt scarcely hiding the black-stockinged ankle at the
                            side-saddle's stirrup. She flashed a laughing eye at Clarita and called
                            to her and checked her steed.</p>
                        <p>"Another of my subjects," said the new-comer to himself. "Perhaps, after
                            all, it may not be quiet enough here for a recluse like you, Don
                            Rodrigo. A fine horse," he added aloud. "A remarkably fine horse. But
                            tell me, my never-forgotten little friend," turning to Clarita, "how it
                            has been with you since I saw you so long ago and you told me of your
                            land so that I fain would have come to it with you?"</p>
                        <p>"Arid why, señor, have you come at last?"</p>
                        <p>"Did I not tell you your pleading for your native shore must draw me
                            away?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, señor, I am sure it was another reason."</p>
                        <p>Pepa, unnoticed, restless on that account, colored high at this neglect.
                            She would not seem to care or listen, not she. Yet she knew she strained
                            her ears lest the sound of the light morning waves drown the words of
                            him who had dared to see only her horse! She knew that white man was
                            somehow different from her race. She felt, the first time in her life,
                            that here was one with whom she would not dare to romp and flirt.</p>
                        <p>"The reason was chiefly that, I give you my honor on it," said Rodrigo.
                            "I remembered you always; <pb id="VAA3931-076" n="69"/> and I wanted to
                            get away, being a roving sort of youth and not liking it there, nor
                            anywhere else very much. And I could smell these waters and see the
                            mountains, my honor on it, little one, from the very eloquence of your
                            speech. And I said it would suit me. Then we had wars and troubles in
                            Guadalajara &#151; though not like Hannibal and Rome, Heaven save
                            us! And I'm afraid I killed somebody at one time. At least I, with
                            others, shot at a mob, and some of them died. It happened that the life
                            of the governor, who was a friend of mine, was saved by that shooting.
                            He would insist that I had done a good thing, though it had been only to
                            kill people, and, heigh-ho! little girl, killing people is n't a good
                            thing. Well, in spite of me he would reward me; and then it chanced that
                            your <hi rend="i">jefe politico</hi> here was killed."</p>
                        <p>"Ah, I know about that," said Clarita gravely.</p>
                        <p>"Well, remembering your eloquence, I said to the governor, 'Make me the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe politico</hi> of Chapala.' And he did it."</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" cried she in delight, suppressed with timidity, being ignorant of
                            the times to come as was he, "you are the new <hi rend="i">jefe!</hi> I
                            am so glad! I know you will take good care of us, señor."</p>
                        <p>"Good-by, Clarita!" Pepa was calling, tossing her head and dancing two
                            middle fingers at the girl on the ground, and letting her impatient
                            steed move away. "I had something to tell &#151; never mind
                            &#151; another day!"</p>
                        <p>"I too am going in that direction," said Rodrigo. "Good-by, little one; I
                            will see you many times."</p>
                        <p>Pepa did not make her horse go very swiftly; neither did she look at the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> who overtook her and walked at her side
                            along the beach.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said he, never looking higher than the <pb id="VAA3931-077" n="70"
                            /> beast's neck, "a remarkable horse. Now how much would you say that
                            horse is worth?"</p>
                        <p>"Enough," said she shortly. "But I got it."</p>
                        <p>Her family was not of the common classes. Her widowed mother at the <hi
                                rend="i">meson</hi> had been the wife of no peon and the inn itself
                            was no common, dirty <hi rend="i">fonda.</hi> There was money in the
                            family, as there is to this day in many a secluded Mexican family which
                            gives no outer demonstration of it. Pepa had wanted the horse. Alas! she
                            would have created trouble for some one had she failed to secure it.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, it is yours?" said he.</p>
                        <p>"Of course," haughtily piqued at the exclusiveness of his interest.</p>
                        <p>"Then I should like to buy him. I have to buy several in fact. Now what
                            would you take for your horse? I nearly killed my best one coming here
                            so fast."</p>
                        <p>"And why, señor, did you, a foreigner, come here?"</p>
                        <p>"Call me not that," he replied, plucking a fig from the <hi rend="i"
                                >salati</hi> to which they had arrived. "My soul is your country's
                            soul, señorita. Well," musingly, "you see how the waves come beating in
                            and kill themselves in that foolish way. They commit suicide thus. It
                            chances that in the land from which I came men sometimes want to do
                            likewise. And if they are not bold enough &#151; they like to come
                            to places where it is lonely."</p>
                        <p>She made no reply. She only looked at him. The life of Josefa Aranja had
                            this day come to a new path. After a moment she turned her horse's head
                            abruptly and rode slowly away toward the street.</p>
                        <p>"Adios, señor," said she.</p>
                        <p>"And you will not sell your horse?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-078" n="71"/>
                        <p>Had he, then, seen nothing, nothing but the horse? She went on into the
                            town. Pepita was dreamy till nightfall.</p>
                        <p>There came other days, and many of them, wherein he saw her plainly
                            enough, and made no secret of it; wherein, too, he grew to know her as
                            did no other.</p>
                        <p>Clarita also he saw, and in time learned the great difference between her
                            of the high spirit and this quieter one.</p>
                        <p>The two had scarcely left the latter when a <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> from
                            the church came bringing her a letter. All her communication with
                            Vicente was through the priest. She eagerly seized it. There was no
                            other thing in her life that brought her a pleasure such as came With
                            these letters, save the coming of Vicente himself; and, since that year
                            he had spent about the lake, he had come but once, eight months before
                            the writing of this epistle. He had stayed three weeks then and
                            returned. It was a serious letter, couched in the terms of his own mood.
                            Wrapped in a sweet delight, she read as follows: <text>
                                <body>
                                    <div type="letter">
                                        <p>L<hi rend="sc">ITTLE</hi> S<hi rend="sc">ISTER,</hi>
                                            &#151; I ought to write happily to you, remembering
                                            that you are a child. The letter should be bright. But
                                            you have never, Clarita, seemed quite a child to me.
                                            Whether it is that I, weighted as I am with the purpose
                                            you know, have oppressed you, &#151; no, I am sure
                                            you will not say this is it. It is because your spirit
                                            is older than your body. So I never feel that I must
                                            write myself to you other than I am. And for one with
                                            that before him that I have before me, to call himself
                                            happy were folly. Yet I am not repining. My hopes are
                                            high. But you will understand how the lightness of
                                            boyhood must now long since have passed from me.</p>
                                        <p>Clarita, it is a strange thing, this that I have to do,
                                            and <pb id="VAA3931-079" n="72"/> a very great one. The
                                            unhappy state of our people works unhappiness in me. I
                                            am overcome, at times, contemplating the little that
                                            they have, the very much that they need. Since I last
                                            wrote to you I have been away. I went to Mexico City
                                            that I might see the heart of the country. It is a
                                            troubled heart. Even its own beatings it knows not. It
                                            is war and tyranny and selfishness &#151;
                                            selfishness always. The land has no time to turn to
                                            those pursuits by which it should live. It seems dying
                                            in paroxysms.</p>
                                        <p>I found there a class unlike any that you know, though
                                            there are some of them here, too; a class of
                                            aristocrats, people educated, versed in the world. There
                                            are wonderful women there, little girl, and men whose
                                            intelligence, were it not blind, should bring about
                                            better things. I saw with bitterness that these, a small
                                            minority of my people as they are, had lost sight, in
                                            their wrangling, of the masses of us who live away, who
                                            crowd the little towns and make the country. These
                                            masses alone can I claim for my people. And the
                                            enlightenment and the power that the others have must
                                            one day be to them.</p>
                                        <p>But how very far are these our people from ability to
                                            reach enlightenment! Can there be, anywhere on the
                                            globe, a race that needs more? And this in particular
                                            brings sadness to me: the thing they do most need is
                                            character. Truth, honesty, faithfulness, these our
                                            people have not, these they dream not. In my readings of
                                            other peoples, Clarita, I always felt their histories
                                            started with some quality we do not have. They were
                                            stable. I wondered, then, is it because my nation is
                                            young that it knows not truth? I think it is not so. Our
                                            ancient ancestors, the Aztecs, kept faith, and they were
                                            newer than we. Heart rottenness, faithlessness, deceit,
                                            &#151; these I have found to be qualities of old
                                            nations, nations run out, living in tradition. And as my
                                            heart is true and as I am writing to her I love as my
                                            own blood, I swear I believe that the dishonesty of my
                                            race comes from Spain. It is the tainted <pb
                                                id="VAA3931-080" n="73"/> blood. We were not highly
                                            civilized before the Spaniards came. I will not claim
                                            even that which others have claimed. But had Spain not
                                            wronged us we should have reached a development which
                                            this broken Spanish offspring knows not. Clarita,
                                            longing for something true, something firm and strong, I
                                            have looked about me in vain. Somewhere under the
                                            current it may be &#151; but invisible. Let me say
                                            it with shame, veracity is gone from the whole scheme of
                                            the Mexican character. I have wept and cursed and called
                                            us no more than a nation of liars and thieves. The
                                            seller in the market cheats his neighbor a score of
                                            times every day that he breathes the air. The child at
                                            its mother's skirts learns first of all, greatest and
                                            chiefest lesson, to lie for gain. Everywhere that I go
                                            my heart bleeds. What can I do with these; what can I
                                            hope from a nation from whose whole moral life truth has
                                            been taken away, to whom dishonesty is virtue &#151;
                                            theft, success? This to me, in the masses of the people,
                                            who are under the current of the political storms, is
                                            sadder than the embroiled condition of the government
                                            that shifts and fights over their heads.</p>
                                        <p>But I must not, I will not despair. How I long to do it
                                            all, to lift them! But, it will take generations. If I
                                            can be but the beginning of something stable, let me not
                                            say that I have lived in vain. Somewhere under the
                                            current must lie the truth, and I know in other things
                                            my people have traits that have, many times, made
                                            nations of the greatest power before whom the world has
                                            trembled. They have all else. Let them only be taught in
                                            this night that truth, truth alone, will bring the day.
                                            I see but one way. There must come, and there will come,
                                            as surely as the sun rises, some man of strength, some
                                            iron soul that can grasp the nation and hold it in the
                                            way of progress. There must be a heart that never
                                            flinches; an eye that sees into every nook and corner of
                                            the land; a mind that grasps all, digests all; a soul
                                            that loves and is true. That man will come. Might it be
                                            I! But despair not; if not I, then <pb id="VAA3931-081"

                                            nevertheless prophesy, the century shall not die till he
                                            come.</p>
                                        <p>In these thoughts, what comfort to turn to you, little
                                            girl by the lake! You alone are true. I read your last
                                            letter with delight. Your writing improves, and you can
                                            think. That you love the books I have found for you is
                                            much happiness to me. Pepa too has written. Mow secretly
                                            she learned long ago, and how she surprised us, when
                                            last I came, by writing in the sand! May the time come
                                            when there shall not be a canton where schools are not,
                                            and scarcely a peon's child that cannot read. Pepa has
                                            won my heart. How deeply I had grown to love her I did
                                            not know till I saw her last. Already is she a woman.
                                            Tell her that my promises to her, when last I saw her,
                                            are locked in my breast. She is not absent from me. Let
                                            me not be absent from her. I shall write to her soon,
                                            and let love hold us as one.</p>
                                        <p>And so, good-by, my sister. I shall come sometimes to
                                            Chapala for a short while only, before I come at last
                                            for the great deed &#151; and then, Heaven be my
                                            guide! And turn not from your sweet, pure walking in the
                                            world. Be truth, Clarita, in this darkness of untruth.
                                            Let the world lie, let faith die away, I know you will
                                            carry in your heart the virtue that was your mother's,
                                            the faithfulness that is your own. Go you with God.</p>

                        <p>He did come one other time before the great time came. And after that the
                            waiting began drawing to an end. What power he had was gathered close in
                            him, ripening fast. Meanwhile the waves of revolution ceased not to
                            sweep the land. The people saw little chance for safety. Comfort and
                            peace failed together. Dissatisfaction was abroad. In this unstable
                            state the very means of living must grow more scant Corn, that chief
                            factor of the food of the commons, <pb id="VAA3931-082" n="75"/> had
                            scarce time to grow, till the hot blasts withered it. Famine occurred
                            from time to time in many parts. It came at length to Jalisco and the
                            lake region. There was a dearth of corn. The same old cause that has
                            stirred the masses since the days of Rome, ay, and long before, served
                            to raise them here.</p>
                        <p>But even in this, fish could still be drawn from the lake. The great
                            majority of these people were not really hungry. A leader who was more a
                            man of the world, who had fewer visions and was more practical, would
                            not have mistaken the sporadic uprising of a few for a profound
                            movement, nor the results of his own magnetism, and the church's
                            under-working, for the evidences of a permanent change. He would have
                            feared the current was shallow.</p>

                        <p>THE nucleus of the army was born during the summer of 1846. Vicente left
                            the monastery early in July, and, without going to his former home,
                            proceeded to Ocotlan, a town on the lake some distance to the east of
                            Chapala. The clergy had been, in all this region, diligently at work.
                            The priest of Ocotlan received him. The last of his plans were there
                            matured. He began a slow journey round the lake's borders, not for the
                            purpose of raising any considerable number of troops, rather to prepare,
                            in conjunction with the priesthood, for the uprising on a second circuit
                            which he should undertake at the completion of the first. He wished, on
                            this primary journey, merely to gather up a small body of some two
                            hundred men whom he knew personally, and understood to be even now ready
                            for him. He would drill that body, and make it the beginning whereto
                            subsequent rebels might cling.</p>
                        <p>By the end of July he was on the lake's southern side at Tizapan. Quiroz
                            here joined him. They proceeded to Tuxcueco and San Luis. When they
                            arrived at the latter place they were at the head of more than one
                            hundred men. They made no demonstration. <pb id="VAA3931-084" n="77"/>
                            They interfered with nothing, produced nothing of a revolution. They
                            held their men in check and drilled them. They found the clergy working
                            as silently and quickly as they. They knew just what number of soldiers
                            they might expect from each town when they should come again. Months
                            before there had arrived, little by little, in certain of the larger
                            places, arms and ammunition purchased by the church. These should be at
                            Vicente's disposal. Some of his troop came already armed. Those who did
                            not were quietly provided for. By late August he was in Jocotepec, at
                            the lake's western end, with his expected band of two hundred. He camped
                            them a mile from the town.</p>
                        <p>He, with Doroteo, spent an additional month in that spot. He received
                            secret word, almost every day, from the priesthood relative to the
                            depositories of arms, the well mapped-out course of his coming triumphal
                            march with its prearranged details concerning camps and provision for
                            the army. As yet his force was infantry, save ten. He drilled them thus
                            for lack of horses. But there were negotiations on foot for more
                            animals. It was his determination to mount every man possible and as
                            quickly as he could. This, too, was the church's purpose. It was hoped
                            and believed that by the completion of half the second circuit he might
                            see his entire force, grown as it should be, mounted. With a formidable
                            array of cavalry, composed of these hardy riders, he would be safe
                            against immediate attack to organize more infantry, or, should the time
                            seem ready, make a quick dash and carry consternation immediately to
                            Guadalajara itself.</p>
                        <p>Whatever may be said as to the rawness of the <pb id="VAA3931-085" n="78"
                            /> rest of his troops (from the very speed of his subsequent movements
                            not well organized) it is certain that his nucleus of two hundred
                            became, under his hand, like a fine machine. He spent day and night in
                            labor over them. He won their hearts. He learned to wield them with the
                            accuracy and precision pf a single tool.</p>
                        <p>All this time, though occasionally menaced, he was not disturbed. He had
                            produced absolutely no confusion, and the public mind was not roused.
                            The State was impoverished as to troops. Every canton had been sucked of
                            its blood for many wars. There were no State troops whatever in the lake
                            region, few enough anywhere else. The only defenders of these districts
                            were the <hi rend="i">jefes politicos</hi> of the cantons and their few
                            gendarmes. Even these police had been diminished in number for distant
                            combats. At Chapala there was but the ridiculous number of eleven. The
                            cantons were small. If Vicente found himself exciting hostility in one,
                            he had but to flit with his troop into another, where a different,
                            weakened, and unroused <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> held sway.</p>
                        <p>On a day of September, the summer rains having about ceased, and the long
                            dry season being on the point of beginning, he suddenly, without
                            warning, crossed the boundary of Rodrigo's dominion at Ajicjic, entered
                            the Chapala canton, and appeared late in the evening with his two
                            hundred in Chapala itself. They marched in quietly, meeting no
                            opposition, wheeled down the main street, issued on the beach, and
                            camped there for the night.</p>
                        <p>The town was profoundly stirred, but without tumult. Rodrigo (who, as
                            shall be seen, had not been altogether inactive), calling together his
                                <pb id="VAA3931-086" n="79"/> eleven men (they were all mounted),
                            shut himself up in the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> of the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefatura politica,</hi> cursed his fortune for dividing the State
                            as it was, and leaving him in one division of it with eleven men, laid
                            the matter before his confederates, and speedily decided his course.</p>
                        <p>The revolutionary band was provided for and left in the hands of
                            lieutenants. Quiroz, night approaching, went with his quick tread for a
                            secret conference with the priest. Vicente first found Clarita alone in
                            the fishing hut, and, having spent with her a half hour, which to that
                            lonely girl was a space of intense delight, left her, and proceeded to
                            the inn. The night had come, and the waves were rising on the lake. The
                            last pink glow of the sunset lingered in the zenith. The wind came fresh
                            and strong out of the watery west, and blew over camp and town. He
                            entered the <hi rend="i">meson,</hi> whose wide, inner <hi rend="i"
                                >corredores</hi> and <hi rend="i">patio</hi> with plants were silent
                            and dark. He proceeded straight to a room reserved for him. He wondered
                            where was Pepa.</p>
                        <p>Having left ajar the door leading into the wide veranda, he lit a candle.
                            He stood there a moment, its light over his features, displaying the
                            high forehead, the sensitive mouth, the strong chin, &#151; above
                            all, the peculiar whiteness of his complexion. He stared out into the
                            shades of the silent <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> The guests at this time of
                            year were few. Supper was not served till two hours later. The <hi
                                rend="i">corredores</hi> were unlighted. Where was Pepa? She had
                            been informed of his coming. He waited yet a half hour. She had not
                            come.</p>
                        <p>He had just turned with knitted brow to the candle, when she suddenly
                            appeared, framed in the shadowed doorway. She had grown taller. She <pb
                                id="VAA3931-087" n="80"/> was never more beautiful. She gave a
                            little cry, but advanced slowly. He met her half-way, held her, and
                            gazed into her eyes. Something in them produced in him a sudden gloom.
                            She seemed changed. There was an unwonted touch of sadness in her
                            face.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa!" he cried. "What is it? You do not seem like the old Pepa. Tell
                            me!"</p>
                        <p>"The old one? Ah, Vicente, you do not want the old one." She looked
                            dreamily at the light "No, no &#151; a new one, one that knows you
                            and understands the greatness of all you will do. Vicente, I am turned
                            into a half wild girl these times. Oh! I am restless! I want to do
                            something &#151; to act, like you." She pressed closer to him. "Tell
                            me," she whispered, "when is the first blow to be struck. When can we
                            fight?"</p>
                        <p>He laughed gently at her.</p>
                        <p>"You, the woman," cried he, "calling for blood! Pepa, you have been to me
                            the soul of this great hope. I have carried you with me wherever I went.
                            That I may come to her, I said, before the real war begins, and let her
                            be the final inspiration of it, &#151; her love the beginning and
                            the power of it &#151; this will be my happiness. You have lifted
                            this dream above dreams, that march above the acts of adventurers. I
                            have lain down every night with your face before me, arisen every
                            morning with Pepa for the spring of the day's deeds. You are restless;
                            your blood bounds with the uncrushed spirit of the old days as does
                            mine. Then may you indeed begin the action. Pepa, the time of quiet
                            marches and drilling is this night passed. Tell me &#151; are you
                            ready with your own hands to begin for me the new course?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-088" n="81"/>
                        <p>"What is it?" she whispered eagerly. There was a depth to that eagerness
                            that even he did not comprehend. She grew suddenly solemn, hanging on
                            his words. He believed her face slightly darkened.</p>
                        <p>"It is this," said he. "The first overt act shall be committed to-night.
                            The time is ripe. I need now at last to make the one irrevocable leap.
                            Hitherto I have done nothing distinctly hostile. I will show my
                            intentions plainly to-night, that all the world may see. The provocation
                            must come from me. I can no longer go on increasing my numbers without
                            opposition. So let it be plainly war. Three hundred men await me at
                            Mescala, whither I go to-morrow. Ocotlan has others. By to-morrow night,
                            so ready is the machinery of the church, I shall march into the latter
                            place with eight hundred. The progress henceforth is swift, open. I am
                            from this night in war. To break into it boldly, so that there may be no
                            retreat either for me or for my men, I shall take possession of the
                            canton building here before midnight."</p>
                        <p>She turned suddenly pale. But she conquered the thought that caused the
                            pallor, and smiled that dazzling smile of hers. She grasped his hand in
                            a tight grip, and whispered:</p>
                        <p>"Will there be a battle?"</p>
                        <p>"There may be resistance, but I doubt it."</p>
                        <p>She was silent. She withdrew from him and paced the room. She broke out,
                            presently, into a ringing laugh of keen and reckless merriment. She came
                            back to him where he stood by the candle watching her. She put her hands
                            upon his shoulders, and brought her raised face close to his.</p>
                        <p>"What am I to do?" she asked.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-089" n="82"/>
                        <p>"I will tell you. The people need some striking beginning to appeal to
                            their imaginations. The match must flare in a way that the populace will
                            see. The moment of the break ought to have in it something that can be
                            told and spread in all directions. Hidalgo, when he raised the people
                            long since, recognized the advantage of the tocsin. He knew that among
                            all the untutored masses that sound would ring out and produce an effect
                            that a hundred proclamations would not cause. I have thought of this
                            long. Pepa, you shall ring the tocsin and start the revolt. My men shall
                            be ready. A quick and orderly march will be made to the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefatura politico,</hi> and the place taken. The flame will then be
                            lit. None can turn back. My reign will begin when you touch the bells of
                            the church."</p>
                        <p>Her blood was bounding; yet it did not produce that burst of enthusiasm
                            he had expected.</p>
                        <p>"If they resist," she whispered, "and you seize them, will they
                            &#151; will they be &#151; killed, even the leader?"</p>
                        <p>"Untamed, indeed!" cried he. "What, then, is the beautiful barbarian's
                            idea of war! They shall only be held, unless they die fighting. What is
                            it? Have I dreamed this poor little dream in vain?"</p>
                        <p>She threw her arms around him with a feverishness that he may have
                            thought he understood.</p>
                        <p>"I will do it!" she cried. "What is the hour?"</p>
                        <p>"Twelve o'clock," said he.</p>
                        <p>She broke away from him and ran to the door. She turned, and her eyes
                            were blazing with the light he thought he loved and understood. What
                            man's mind could have been prism enough to separate and count the rays
                            that made that light? The <pb id="VAA3931-090" n="83"/> fever in her
                            grew. She threw a quick kiss at him from her finger tips and was
                            gone.</p>
                        <p>A <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> was lighting lamps over dining-tables which
                            stood in the <hi rend="i">corredor.</hi> She could hear her mother's
                            voice in the far kitchen. She went out into the dark passage that led
                            into the street, passed a shadow standing there, and was startled that
                            it slightly moved. She came into the street, and went wandering
                            restless, bareheaded, toward the lake. She stood at last under the <hi
                                rend="i">salati</hi> tree, the water beating up on the sand before
                            her. She suddenly started and turned. The shadow that had been in the
                            passage had followed her with lithe, silent tread. She could see his
                            pointed sombrero, and the points of his moustaches were barely
                            visible.</p>
                        <p>"Josefa Aranja," whispered he, half mockingly, &#151; "the heroine
                            &#151; ah, she of the bells. Does she dream of the long future
                            wherein the tocsin shall still ring Pepa's fame and memory! The days and
                            the years will go by and die. The king will reign; and pupils in schools
                            will learn of her, of her who rang the bells. And after many years there
                            will be a high bronze statue in a beautiful park in the city's centre,
                            and the statue will be the slender figure of Josefa Aranja. And on this
                            day school children shall sing and bands shall play, and there shall be
                            wreaths on her head and wreaths at her feet, &#151; though Pepa
                            shall know it not, for that she lies yonder, where the sun falls yellow
                            on the sod! Ah! picture of beauty! &#151; she who rang the tocsin,
                            and is called her country's liberator!"</p>
                        <p>She turned angrily on him, her very forehead burning.</p>
                        <p>"And Doroteo Quiroz," she cried, "may be called a traitor on that
                            day!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-091" n="84"/>
                        <p>She ran away and disappeared in the darkness. She came at length under
                            the two slender white spires. The church was dark and deserted, and in
                            the empty walled court before it she spent the next few hours alone,
                            seated in the darkness at a tower's base. Those hours were unhappy ones.
                            When the clock over her head struck half-past nine, she could sit still
                            no longer. She sighed and arose.</p>
                        <p>"He will be fleeing," murmured she, feeling the heat on her face.</p>
                        <p>The clock struck yet other quarters. The struggle in her that made the
                            hours unhappy grew fiercer as the night advanced. It was at last
                            intolerable, and she could wait no more. It was half-past ten when she
                            went slowly up the deserted street past her home, and came, with
                            something like stealth, to the open market square. The tiny shops were
                            closed and the stone-flagged space was bare, save for a few lime and
                            orange trees. She crossed it with a quick impulsive burst of speed, the
                            struggle in her having ended.</p>
                        <p>She came at length to that long, low, white building over whose door the
                            words "Jefatura Politica" were painted in yellow letters. She flitted to
                            the iron-barred window in the shadow. The window's doorlike inner
                            shutters were closed, though she could detect little gleams of light
                            coming through the cracks. She held to the bars, her untamed heart
                            beating swiftly. She put her face to them after a time and called,
                            scarcely above a whisper:</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo!"</p>
                        <p>There was no sound from within. She shivered a little. She could just
                            hear the clock striking a quarter to eleven, the tones wavering up from
                            the lake on the uncertain wind. She became a little <pb id="VAA3931-092"
                                n="85"/> piqued and then half angry. She laughed with scorn of
                            herself, but nervously. She slipped on, then, to the door, some yards
                            distant. It was very large, and double, to permit of the passage of
                            horses. It was made of heavy, thick wood, set in something of a recess.
                            She was at it, silently extending her hand toward the iron knocker, when
                            a guard stepped from the recess's shadow.</p>
                        <p>"What do you want?" asked he.</p>
                        <p>She was too daring not to go on now in the course begun.</p>
                        <p>"To speak to the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi>" she whispered, shrinking as
                            much as possible into the darkness.</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" he said, recognizing her. "He is busy."</p>
                        <p>"I will speak to him," she said imperiously. "Go and tell him to let me
                            in."</p>
                        <p>The man entered, and presently returned and admitted her, closing the
                            door after her. She went through the stone-paved passage that led to the
                                <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> That inner court was very large. On two
                            sides, approached by wide-roofed <hi rend="i">corredores,</hi> were
                            offices, a court, and living rooms for Rodrigo, and certain other
                            officials. Opposite the door, barely distinguishable in the gloom on the
                            far side, were many stables. There was a door there, too, leading out to
                            the rear at St. Michael's foot, where there was no beaten path among the
                            boulders and over the rocky mountain side, but where it was possible for
                            a horse to go, reaching thus, by a circuit, the Guadalajara road.</p>
                        <p>She heard some confusion in the darkness of that distant side where the
                            stables stood. One towering and spreading <hi rend="i">mamey</hi> tree
                            in the <hi rend="i">patio's</hi> centre swayed and sighed with the wind.
                            She tiptoed along the bricks and gently knocked where a beam <pb
                                id="VAA3931-093" n="86"/> of light came through a keyhole. Rodrigo
                            himself opened the door. She had shrunk away and hidden herself in the
                            shadow. He saw only the night, and heard only the confusion at the
                            stables. She some-how felt or feigned fear. He stepped out and caught
                            sight of her dress as the wind fluttered it. His face became suddenly
                            serious, seen in the light from the office.</p>
                        <p>"What is it?" said he, in a voice hardly audible.</p>
                        <p>"You do not ask me to come in," she replied. She was sulking in the
                            shadow. He presently succeeded in drawing her out of it.</p>
                        <p>She went in and sat down by a large square table whereon were papers and
                            a pistol with its cartridge belt. He sat down opposite and gazed at her.
                            She had heard his spur clink as he entered. She arose boldly, closed the
                            door, and returned to her seat. Her face showed the extreme high tension
                            of her nerves. It was with her a peculiar moment, wherein a native,
                            reckless daring combated with fear, even with shame. She spread out her
                            fingers on the table, and did not look at Rodrigo or say anything. She
                            merely sat there. Then the blood rushed to her face.</p>
                        <p>"You have come," said he at last, slowly, "because the troubles and the
                            wars are beginning. I was never blind to the fact, Pepa, that you had a
                            lover. So the &#151; friendship that sprang up and lived and grew to
                            be &#151; well, it was not a cold one &#151; between us, you
                            feel must give way. We are sooner or later to go different paths. You
                            would be an enemy, should it fall to my lot to fight, that would lend
                            more meaning to fighting. Knowing you as I have known you, I fancied
                            many times that when the silent little army reached this place you would
                                <pb id="VAA3931-094" n="87"/> desert us and turn Amazon. You have
                            come to say good-by; is it not so?"</p>
                        <p>She threw back her head and let her eyes rest on him. They were burning,
                            and the red blush was in her very temples.</p>
                        <p>"I can say it if you wish," said she, half petulantly, half solemnly.</p>
                        <p>"It is not I, it is the troubles that wish," he replied. "You have made
                            the days pass with an added light in them, &#151; the sad old days.
                            I shall ever be glad I knew you. May you never, in these bad times that
                            are coming, do such great deeds as to be no longer the girl you are.
                            Pepa, I shall remember you always as you were in the days when we knew
                            each other."</p>
                        <p>"Remember me!" cried the impetuous girl, arising with anger and pain in
                            her face. "No &#151; crush me out of your memory. I will ask but
                            that one favor. If, when I come, as I came to-night, with a thing on my
                            tongue to say, which I trembled thinking of, that would have been,
                            perchance, more nearly like ruin to me than great deeds, and I dare not
                            say it, rather fling it away from me &#151; if, when I am thus, you
                            call up some old days coldly, and all but tell me to say the last
                            farewell and be gone &#151; then I pray you, Don Rodrigo, in the
                            name of unspoken faith, do not strain your foreign ideas of kindness to
                            keep me in your memory!"</p>
                        <p>Many a time he had feared the possibilities in this girl. He had vainly
                            tried to hold her back. He was struck now by a positive grief that stood
                            out for one second on her face.</p>
                        <p>"You hate me &#151; you despise me!" she cried suddenly. "Let the
                            bird break its wings!"</p>
                        <p>She was leaving him, hurrying to the door. He <pb id="VAA3931-095" n="88"
                            /> sprang forward and reached it before her. He flung it open and
                            pointed out. She looked, and the light from the room fell in a wide
                            streak across the <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> She beheld horses there
                            saddled, and men in secret haste saddling others. She heard his spur
                            again clink on the bricks. She realized the purposed flight.</p>
                        <p>"Go!" whispered he. "You must not stay. Whether you will it or not I
                            shall remember you. You see the horses &#151; you understand. You
                            need not say the thing you were afraid to say. Never &#151;
                            never!"</p>
                        <p>She moved away.</p>
                        <p>"And thank you!" he called after her, thinking of days she had brightened
                            for him, himself struck with a sudden sadness.</p>
                        <p>She was surprised, her heart brought back, by those last words. She
                            turned from the shadow one instant, and smiled on him a quick smile
                            which he never forgot. She ran out, then, to the street, and was
                            gone.</p>
                        <p>He knew at once that she had misinterpreted his thanks. He knew that was
                            the thing above all else he should not have said. He muttered
                            self-accusations and turned back into the room.</p>
                        <p>Her mood was changed. She was become eager, full of intense excitement,
                            happy with a happiness that made her heart sing. She drowned all other
                            thoughts, recalling his last words and look, crushing all other visions.
                            This was enough, like liquor that in itself suffices though it bring
                            unheeded pain afterward. She would not return to the <hi rend="i"
                                >meson;</hi> nor would she speak to or see any other human being
                            till midnight should come. She crossed the plaza and went to the east.
                            She turned then into the <pb id="VAA3931-096" n="89"/> darkness of a
                            street that leads to the lake behind the church. She wandered on down
                            toward the water, her happiness becoming, as she came, mingled with a
                            certain pensiveness which seemed ever a part of her nature, which was,
                            indeed, the trait most fascinating in her.</p>
                        <p>She was as still as the night. Behind the church there were lime-kilns,
                            huge and smoking. They stood at the beginning of the open beach. She
                            came to them. The burner suddenly threw open the door of one of the
                            blazing furnaces in order to heave in more wood. A shaft of intense red
                            light shot out across the beach and the lake, so that the sand and the
                            water seemed burning with it, and a tunnel was cut into the heart of the
                            night. She stopped near the kiln in the shadows. The burner heaved in a
                            stick, and then suddenly saw her appear in the brightest of the light,
                            staring into the fierce mass of white fire. He was startled. She looked,
                            bathed in that brilliancy, like the fire's very spirit. He gaped at her
                            and turned to his work.</p>
                        <p>"Pretty hot," volunteered he.</p>
                        <p>She went away toward the water.</p>
                        <p>"No&#151;no," said she, slowly. "That is n't hot."</p>
                        <p>The door of the furnace was shut, and the night buried in darkness the
                            shaft the light had cut. She came to the water's very edge, where the
                            night waves rolled on the sand, running frantic races all along the
                            shore, out of blackness into blackness, white demons that they were.</p>
                        <p>When the clock struck three-quarters past eleven, she entered the walled
                            front court of the church, and came to the side of the right-hand tower.
                            In its base was an open door leading to stairs and the belfry. It was
                            never closed, and the bell-ringers <pb id="VAA3931-097" n="90"/> lived
                            in huts by the lime-kilns. She went in and groped in the narrow space of
                            blackness for the steps. Then she began to ascend. As in many Mexican
                            churches of to-day the stairs to the bells were stone and spiral. They
                            were very old and worn, by much use, into deep hollows. She circled
                            round and round and up, in the darkness, her hands following the stone
                            wall and the central stone shaft. She could see absolutely nothing. She
                            came at last to the spiral's summit, traversed a short passage, went
                            under a low doorway, and issued in the belfry.</p>
                        <p>It was open to the free air on all sides. At its corners many slender
                            white pillars supported the spires above. Their lightness and grace were
                            pure beauty even in the night. The cool west wind swept through under
                            the bells which hung their great weights and iron tongues over her head.
                            She felt for the rope of the largest, a bell of deep voice. The cord was
                            tied to the clapper. Having assured herself of its position, she went to
                            the belfry's side and leaned over the stone railing, waiting. She grew
                            again feverish, and could scarcely be still. The wind cast her black
                            hair all about her face and fluttered her skirts. She sang an odd and
                            melancholy song:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"Oh thou Fair God! when wilt thou come again,</l>
                            <l n="2" rend="ti-1">That all the barren land may laugh with
                                flowers?</l>
                            <l n="3">Fulfil thy sacred promises to men,</l>
                            <l n="4" rend="ti-1">Bring us the fruits of thy mysterious powers!</l>
                            <l n="5" rend="ti-2">We die &#151; forsake us not.</l>
                            <l n="6" rend="ti-2">Hast thou thy sons forgot?</l>
                            <l n="7">Thou wast our fathers' God &#151; Be ours! Be ours!"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>She waited yet another silent minute. Then the silver voice under her
                            began proclaiming the hour of midnight. She turned and seized the rope,
                            and <pb id="VAA3931-098" n="91"/> counted. At the last stroke she put
                            out all her energy, and the great clapper crashed against the bell. The
                            tocsin pealed out, not once nor twice, but many times. She swung the
                            iron tongue to and fro with mighty clangor. All the silent night seemed
                            suddenly shattered by that battering hail of sound. The town was up and
                            the cry raised. The days of primitive peace were done.</p>
                        <p>The two hundred had been drawn up in the plaza a moment before the hour.
                            They had marched quietly and stood in quiet. There was no marked
                            demonstration. When the tocsin sounded and the townspeople began
                            gathering in wonder, the troops were brought in order to the <hi
                                rend="i">jefatura politica.</hi> The bell having ceased, Doroteo
                            Quiroz's lithe form went noiselessly to the wooden door. He knocked
                            resoundingly, and demanded the surrender of the place in the name of the
                            new government. There was no reply. He knocked again, and again demanded
                            in a loud voice. No answer. The next step was already decided upon. With
                            one hundred men Vicente had now disappeared up the street, wheeled the
                            corner and ascended to St. Michael's side, from which he could reach the
                            building over a tortuous course at its rear. All was done quietly and in
                            order. There was no wish to cause fighting or bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz, in front with the other hundred, quietly awaited a signal. The
                            townspeople still came flocking, and huddled about in silent groups in
                            the darkness of the plaza. In the midst of that silence an unexpected
                            thing occurred. The great Fortino (long since, in the recesses of his
                            crude heart, a deep admirer of Vicente) had secretly wished to join the
                            new movement. Not appreciating the full <pb id="VAA3931-099" n="92"/>
                            value of order and a quiet declaration of war, he now, in the crowd's
                            middle, seeing the ice broken and the revolution begun, became inspired
                            to deeds. He felt his vast muscles tingle. He was exasperated that the
                            door opened not, and that Vicente's forces stood thus balked. An
                            unreasoning enthusiasm entered him. In silence he trod up the street
                            after the one hundred who had disappeared. He was in that street now
                            alone, bending over something. The most prominent constituent of the
                            ceilings in many Mexican houses is the enormous beams that are left
                            visible, sometimes beautifully carved. These are frequently of such size
                            and weight as to astonish the beholder. One of them lay, on this night,
                            in the street before an unfinished house. It was over twenty feet long
                            and exceedingly thick. It was thought six men would be needed to put it
                            in place. Over this bent the enthusiastic giant. He had begun to chuckle
                            a deep, inward chuckle. He kneeled and seized the timber at its middle.
                            Some from the crowd had now lit torches of a resinous wood called <hi
                                rend="i">ocote,</hi> and came running hither.</p>
                        <p>"Away! away!" growled the big one. "Leave me to it!"</p>
                        <p>He heaved and groaned. Great folds of skin, bristling with hair, bulging
                            on his neck, were visible in the flickering light. The width of his back
                            seemed suddenly doubled. He put out his tremendous strength, swelled and
                            strained, sweat dripping from his flaming countenance. Those watching
                            were amazed to see the timber slowly rise, till it rested on his
                            shoulder, &#151; a position unusual for the burden of a Mexican
                            carrier. Then he came erect, his legs straightening inch by inch. He was
                            facing the plaza, and balanced himself with that <pb id="VAA3931-100"
                                n="93"/> great weight, looking ahead. He chuckled still, rumblingly.
                            He was absorbed, seeing no one.</p>
                        <p>"Out of the way!" thundered he. "Give me room. Give &#151; me
                            &#151; room!"</p>
                        <p>He had begun his astonishing course, and the spectators held their
                            breath. That mass of wood that scarcely one of them could have lifted
                            went heavily on, a mammoth battering ram. The chuckle of the bearer grew
                            louder. The perspiration became streams. He went his ponderous way down
                            the street, his speed increasing. He broke from a walk to a trot, and
                            the trot grew faster. He gathered momentum and charged on, being like a
                            locomotive let loose. Every step he took added to his irresistibleness.
                            His tread seemed to shake the ground. They saw him coming, looming out
                            of the shadows, and spread to right and left. His chuckle grew louder
                            and burst into a low roar. He was running now, fearfully. He could no
                            more have stopped himself than if he had been some cyclone sweeping down
                            on the lodgings of the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi> He neared the plaza,
                            swerved through a great arc to the right, and made the quarter circle,
                            the timber wheeling with him. His roar burst into a shout and the end of
                            that ram crashed straight through the wood of the door, went crunching
                            on full half of its twenty feet of length, cut a square hole for itself,
                            as though it had been cast from a cannon, and stuck, fastened there,
                            horizontal, its hither half protruding into the street. The shock had
                            hurled Fortino back, but not discomfited him. He let the chuckle sink
                            slowly into silence, and sat down on the opposite side of the street,
                            satisfied. Thus unexpectedly and uncalled-for, in the matter of
                            revolution had Fortino declared himself.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-101" n="94"/>
                        <p>The soldiers and some of the crowd seized the protruding end and swayed
                            on it. The door was speedily demolished and an entrance thus effected at
                            the same time that Vicente found the rear door wide open, and marched in
                            at the head of his men. The two parties met. The crowd surged in after
                            them, and filled the <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> Torches flared from many
                            hands, and the deserted condition of the place was apparent.</p>
                        <p>The first who pushed in after Doroteo's soldiers was Pepa, her face full
                            of excitement.</p>
                        <p>"They have gone!" said she in Doroteo's ear.</p>
                        <p>He turned a piercing eye on her and smiled a gallant but half mocking
                            smile.</p>
                        <p>"And how does the fair one know?" whispered he, drawing out the point of
                            his moustache.</p>
                        <p>She flashed a keen look of defiance at him, and, going to Vicente, flung
                            her hand up wildly in air and hailed him as victor. The crowd rallied
                            round her, instinctively making her a leader, and shouted with her.
                            Having satisfied their curiosity they surged out. Excitement was growing
                            and they seized Fortino, had him up on shoulders (a task fraught with
                            difficulty), and bore him triumphantly to and fro amidst tumult.</p>
                        <p>"Anastasio," said Francisco, looking on dubiously, "this triumph of
                            Fortino's is treason to us."</p>
                        <p>"He will come to a bad end," drawled Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>There were to be a few hours' sleep for the soldiers before the march to
                            Ocotlan. Vicente at length returned to the <hi rend="i">meson.</hi> He
                            found Clarita there waiting for him and trembling. It was there he bade
                            her good-by, lingering long with her. She was very sad when she finally
                            turned away. He had but left her when Pepa, excitement still high in <pb
                                id="VAA3931-102" n="95"/> her, met him in the barely lit <hi
                                rend="i">corredor.</hi> She threw her arms round his neck.</p>
                        <p>"Vicente!" she cried, "I am going with the army!"</p>
                        <p>He grew pale.</p>
                        <p>"My horse is the best of them all," cried she, the feverish burning of
                            the eyes and temples visible again. "And I cannot stay! I am made for
                            this. Call it wild they may &#151; but I am wild. Already the
                            soldiers rallied round me. I can be the spirit of it!"</p>
                        <p>"Pepa &#151; Pepita! What mad dream is this!"</p>
                        <p>She broke away and ran to her room, laughing over her shoulder at
                            him.</p>
                        <p>"I am going!" cried she, and disappeared.</p>
                        <p>He knew too well that the thing on which she set her heart she did.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER II</head>
                        <p>THERE was no sign of dawn over the eastern waters, and the crowd had
                            dispersed and left silence, when a candle was lit in Fortino's hut.
                            Fortino's hut was on the beach, like those of the other fishers; and it
                            was so small and so frail, being made of reeds, that it trembled to its
                            foundations at the very approach of the monster who lived in it. It
                            seemed there need be no surprise should his head burst through the
                            thatch, or an arm or a great leg be heard crashing in the walls. He was
                            again chuckling, smotheredly, and the very bristling folds on the back
                            of his neck were damp with perspiration. Some new things in the way of
                            possible deeds and honor had come into the brain of Fortino, and the
                            vistas of war were opened up to him.</p>
                        <p>A rollicking song came unsteadily along the beach, interrupted by an
                            occasional hiccough. It echoed crazily in the night, and came nearer. It
                            quite entered Fortino's hut, and, with it, the singer came too.
                            Francisco's eyes were observed staring at the light, and Francisco's
                            broad grin became a prominent furnishing of the bare hovel. Some
                            distance over his head Anastasio's became visible, blinking, sleepy.
                            Fortino sat down heavily on the floor.</p>
                        <p>"A traitor shall not repose!" cried Francisco. "Anyhow, not while there
                            are things like this! Sh! Look. What do you think of this for <hi
                                rend="i">spoils?</hi>"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-104" n="97"/>
                        <p>He whispered it with husky intensity, and held out something that
                            glittered in his hand.</p>
                        <p>"Don't take the spoils, now, Fortino," whined Anastasio. "They are his.
                            To him be the reward." And he came in and lay down with his feet out of
                            the door and his head against the opposite wall. He had left a blanket
                            and a roll of nets outside.</p>
                        <p>Fortino looked more closely. The thing was an inkstand with a little
                            silver on it. The significance of this possession broke on Fortino. He
                            stared long at it, growing red.</p>
                        <p>"St. Francis!" muttered he.</p>
                        <p>"Sh!" said Francisco. "It is out of the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> office.
                            Ha! ha! All things are to be made public! Spoils to him that can get
                            them," lowering his voice. "Corn? Why, corn is n't going to count!"</p>
                        <p>"Do you curs mean to say," said Fortino, "that what we can find we
                            get?"</p>
                        <p>"Why, curse me," cried Francisco, injured, "isn't it <hi rend="i"
                                >war?</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi> and peace and a blessing go with it," said
                            Anastasio, eying the silver. "Let peace be with the war."</p>
                        <p>"Men," said Fortino, meditating, "you are given over to unworthy
                            thoughts. Besides, what is the thing worth?"</p>
                        <p>Francisco became knowing, shrewd.</p>
                        <p>"I don't know what this one will be worth. This war may be worth
                            millions; it may be only thousands. But I do know, <hi rend="i">si,
                                señor,</hi> I know <hi rend="i">exceedingly well</hi> that wars
                            there have been that would dazzle a fellow's eyes, that there have. Men,
                            there were wars in Rome."</p>
                        <p>And he elevated his nose.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-105" n="98"/>
                        <p>"Where is that?" inquired Anastasio with interest.</p>
                        <p>"Rome is a country of kings," said Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"To the north?" said Anastasio, politely.</p>
                        <p>"It is &#151; it is an island," said Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"A fishing country," put in Fortino with authority. "It is among the
                            Triquis. I was in that direction once. It is south."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, ignorance!" groaned Francisco. "This is not that Rome. This one is
                            farther off. Well, there was a fellow came down on Rome. He came up over
                            the mountains, which were of considerable heights. And a battle was
                            fought, called &#151; the battle was called &#151; Hannibal was
                            the battle called."</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Si, señor!</hi> It is the name of the place," broke in
                            Fortino with anger, and beating the soil with his fist. "And it is among
                            the Triquis. I have been nigh to it. A fair sized village is Hannibal
                            &#151; <hi rend="i">for</hi> an Indian village. The houses there are
                            round, made of cane. I am some travelled, señor. I am well posted on
                            Rome, having been, I tell you again, in that direction once on a burro."
                            And Fortino growled and grumbled away over his Rome in high dudgeon.</p>
                        <p>"You won't be convinced? This, I tell you, is another Rome further off!
                            And do you know what spoils they gathered up after the battle?"</p>
                        <p>"The Triquis are an ordinary set. They are a measly tribe, the Triquis,"
                            said Fortino. "I wouldn't build much on any spoils out of the
                            Triquis."</p>
                        <p>"Triquis!" burst out Francisco in hot wrath. "This is Rome! Rome is no
                            Triqui!"</p>
                        <p>"I know, I know," said Fortino, nodding his head and speaking with calm
                            assurance. "I tell you I was there, and their houses are round."</p>

                        <p>"Oh, come to the spoils, Francisco," complained Anastasio, sitting
                            painfully erect and waiting.</p>
                        <p>"I defy you to make an estimate," cried Francisco. "Guess now."</p>
                        <p>"Was it silver <hi rend="i">pesos,</hi> or was it gold?" inquired
                            Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"The Triquis have no gold," put in Fortino, stubbornly. "It's rare they
                            get silver even. They are too far west in the wild parts. They do their
                            trading in corn, the Triquis."</p>
                        <p>"These, I tell you," said Francisco, "were an island of kings &#151;
                            farther off."</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Si,"</hi> said Fortino, "there is a fishing island west of
                            the Triquis."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, come to the spoils!" cried Anastasio, in exasperation, getting up.
                            "Was it <hi rend="i">pesos?"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Friends," replied Francisco, his face lit with calm, triumphant
                            happiness, "they gathered up, after the battle of Hannibal in Rome, one
                            bushel of gold rings!"</p>
                        <p>There was some silence, Anastasio staring with shining eyes.</p>
                        <p>"Hm!" said Fortino at length, &#151; "nose rings. Don't build on any
                            Indian nose rings. I don't call to mind that the Triquis wore nose
                            rings. But I'll wager you on this: if a bushel of nose rings was ever
                            gathered up out of that measly tribe of Indians they were brass."</p>
                        <p>"These were <hi rend="i">not</hi> brass," contradicted Francisco. "And
                            what is more, they were finger rings."</p>
                        <p>"Francisco," said Anastasio, with some plaintiveness, "is this a true
                            thing?"</p>
                        <p>"It is a part of history," said Francisco. "Clarita read it to me out of
                            a book."</p>
                        <p>Fortino was greatly taken aback.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-107" n="100"/>
                        <p>"Oh," said he, "if it came out of a book." He began to look on Francisco
                            with more interest. "Is that a fact? In the books, eh? Well, maybe it
                            is. I won't go against the books. I never heard of any such thing out of
                            the Triquis. Well &#151; if she read it out of a book."</p>
                        <p>Anastasio was at the door.</p>
                        <p>"There is no doubt about their being gold, Francisco?" queried he.</p>
                        <p>"They were pure gold," said Francisco with importance.</p>
                        <p>Anastasio sighed heavily, and went out and gathered his nets in his arms.
                            He came to the door.</p>
                        <p>"It was a whole bushel of them, now, Francisco?" he asked, dreamily. "You
                            wouldn't lie to me, <hi rend="i">amigo?</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"A full bushel of pure gold rings &#151; and this was only a small
                            part of the spoils."</p>
                        <p>Fortino was still sitting staring up at the narrator. Anastasio sighed
                            again, and went with the roll of nets to the far corner.</p>
                        <p>"Let them stay here, Fortino, till the day when I return," said he.</p>
                        <p>"Where in the name of the devil are you going?" grumbled Fortino, like a
                            man irritably convinced.</p>
                        <p>"To the wars," said Anastasio, with sentiment.</p>
                        <p>"Are you two fellows going to the wars?" inquired Fortino, eying them
                            both.</p>
                        <p>They made no direct reply.</p>
                        <p>"They gathered them up right off of the ground," said Francisco at
                            length, like one seeing the vision of it,&#151;"just gathered them
                            up. No trouble at all filling the bushel, &#151;just gathered them
                            right up."</p>
                        <p>Anastasio dropped the net in the corner.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-108" n="101"/>
                        <p>"Ah," sighed he, "it is more lucrative than fishing."</p>
                        <p>They all pondered on it for an hour, chiefly in silence, and the first
                            streaks of the dawn found them pondering on it.</p>
                        <p>"I don't count on or want the spoils," said Fortino, "but I want to know
                            when he is going to start out for Ocotlan."</p>
                        <p>"Before sun-up."</p>
                        <p>"Well, come on," said Anastasio, leading the way, swinging himself out
                            and over the sandy beach toward the plaza. The others followed, the
                            green, blue, and magenta of their respective sashes beginning to glimmer
                            a trifle in the pale dawn.</p>
                        <p>"Patriotism is a fine thing," said Francisco, sententiously.</p>
                        <p>"Wars are a ripe good thing," observed Anastasio; and he added, going
                            lankly on before: "St. Mary rewards him that makes sacrifices."</p>
                        <p>Before sunrise the little force marched out of Chapala, taking the lake
                            road to the east, in which direction lay Mescala and Ocotlan. It had
                            slightly grown both as to infantry and horse, the latter numbering
                            thirteen. It was in good spirits, to which the cool, exhilarating air of
                            the morning added. In the east, over the water, hung the red of the
                            coming sun, and the lake lay still and glassy, waiting, mountains
                            reflected in its clear crystal. A quick, steady progress was maintained
                            till nearly noon. Quiroz rode before the little force of cavalry,
                            keen-eyed, watchful, reserved. Vicente, likewise mounted, followed the
                            horse at the head of his foot soldiers. He was eager to be on, now that
                            the plunge was made. If Rodrigo's departure had been for the purpose of
                            making a stand, that stand could <pb id="VAA3931-109" n="102"/> not be
                            of effect against this force, small as it was, unless in some way the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> should have much increased his own. At the
                            earliest, therefore, Vicente expected no formidable opposition till he
                            should have reached Ocotlan and gathered up the forces awaiting him.</p>
                        <p>The band that had joined him from Chapala numbered less than fifty. They
                            were undisciplined, and, in the main, unmounted. He had called them
                            together in the early dawn, effected some sort of organization, and made
                            of them a company. He had cast about for a leader. Fortino had long been
                            known to him as a man of great power and dogged clinging to his purpose.
                            The sudden bold, though unauthorized act of the stubborn, hard-headed
                            monster, had appealed to him. He believed him the sort of man from which
                            to make a good soldier. He came to a quick decision, mounted Fortino on
                            one of the few horses obtained in Chapala, and put him at the head of
                            the new force. Anastasio and Francisco were thus under the leadership of
                            their old comrade.</p>
                        <p>But the horse farthest in the lead of all this motley band did not bear
                            Quiroz. There was yet another before him, &#151; a free, independent
                            member of that army; one to whom no military discipline could or would
                            extend. It was the girl, Josefa Aranja. With many emotions warring in
                            her she had kept her laughing threat, suddenly appearing when the march
                            was ordered, mounted on her incomparable steed, waving her hand at the
                            army, dashing on in front of it. She wore a red dress, &#151; a
                            color she much preferred. She had donned a black <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo</hi> that, falling to her shoulders, did not conceal her
                            shining hair. She gave Vicente no <pb id="VAA3931-110" n="[]"/>
                            <figure entity="VAA3931-3">
                                <p>"She called to them, saying she would lead them into battle"</p>
                            </figure>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-111" n="103"/> opportunity to expostulate. She galloped
                            away to the front as the troops started, the ends of her <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo</hi> fluttering in the wind of her speed. She was followed
                            by the glistening eyes of Doroteo Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>At first she was joyous, exultant in a sort of barbarous freedom. She
                            turned her head and flashed her smile at all the line and waved them on.
                            She fell back and called to them, saying she would lead them into
                            battle. She was like a fascinating child, full of a restless, consuming
                            spirit. When Vicente, for the last time, pleaded with her not to go on
                            this perilous course, she only laughed, and said she would win his
                            victories for him.</p>
                        <p>The soldiers, in particular the two hundred trained men of Vicente's own,
                            caught the fair leader's spirit. The novelty of <unclear>i-t</unclear>
                            and her daring roused enthusiasm. They seized upon her as upon some
                            element of luck, an embodiment of fortune. She appealed to their gaming
                            instinct as she did to that of Quiroz. She was the thing to stake it on.
                            She took the place of a banner to rally round. They began at length to
                            cheer her. They threw up caps and called her "La Capitana;" whereat she
                            waved at them again, and kindled fresh enthusiasm with her brilliant
                            smile and her contagious laugh. An army needs something to idolize. She
                            had the nature to draw out its emotion. She could soon become, thus, the
                            idol, the centre of attraction, finally a symbol even vital to it.</p>
                        <p>After a few hours the dancing of her eyes ceased, and the buoyancy
                            departed from her. The excitement had fed on other things than the
                            exhilaration of thus riding on before. It had been born of a dangerous
                            fire, and had burnt itself out. She was <pb id="VAA3931-112" n="104"/>
                            far in the lead, and a gloom fell on her. She rode slowly, one steady
                            course, looking ahead. The sun had lifted its yellow ball out of the
                            water, and was half way to the zenith. She stared into its reflected
                            image. Her face had grown dark. The men behind her inspired her no more,
                            &#151; indeed, they had never done so. Other dreams were hers as she
                            rode thus, and she knew that the thing that had led her out on this
                            unwonted course was not merely her wild nature, her longing for action.
                            It was another and a deeper thing, &#151; a recollection of days
                            that had not held Vicente in them, of a parting that rankled in her
                            memory. She could be the spirit of battles &#151; yes, she had that
                            unusual nature that has marked some few women out of the long course of
                            history. But had he who was the leader of the troops behind her been
                            another, would the enthusiasm have gone out and the gloom come? She
                            laughed a mirthless scorn of herself. She heard, then, Quiroz's voice
                            behind her. Unconsciously she had let his horsemen come nearer her, and
                            he had reached her side unawares.</p>
                        <p>"Why did the spirit of the strange one suddenly die?" said he, glittering
                            on her. "What is it that lives hidden in you? Pepa, there is no man in
                            the wide world can read you. But, believe it, there is one that knows
                            your powers. Quiroz, if it please you to hear, is that one. What need
                            the army fear? Ha! &#151; listen." He came closer and whispered it,
                            fastening his eyes on her. "Even though the centre of it were killed,
                            the scheme could live on. Though the leader died &#151; what were
                            even that? Pepa and one servant of hers, who knows her, could yet do all
                            things."</p>
                        <p>She turned her face to him, flashed a contempt of <pb id="VAA3931-113"
                                n="105"/> that daring speech, and, saying nothing, rode away from
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Shortly before noon they arrived at Mescala. It was but a collection of
                            mud huts about an irregular and gaunt square, wherein a few lean pigs
                            squealed for the food they were not likely to receive. The lack of corn
                            had fallen heavily on this region. Behind the town were many fields in
                            the mountains which had been wont to sustain a scattered population of
                            whom Mescala represented only the centre. The hand of want had drawn out
                            such military powers as the district possessed. Vicente had not been
                            mistaken in the number of soldiers there to be obtained. There were
                            three hundred armed men, including seven horsemen,
                                <unclear>-awaiting</unclear> him in the square, under the leadership
                            of a gray-headed old fighter called Pancho. The two bodies shouted
                            greeting to one another and coalesced. Dinner was eaten at that place.
                            Vicente, who had been watching Fortino's man&#156;uvring of his
                            small band, and who was always on the look-out for a leader of merit,
                            had been pleased with the conduct of the giant. He gave him, in
                            addition, a minority of Pancho's men.</p>
                        <p>The march was speedily renewed. The long hours of the sunny afternoon,
                            coloring the lake white, then yellow, then pink, saw the advancing
                            column ever on the lake's shore, and ever nearer Ocotlan. Evening came
                            on, and the low walls of that town appeared, lit with the light of
                            sunset.</p>
                        <p>Round about this village the mountains somewhat give way, leaving a
                            plain. Through the plain's middle and by the town runs a small stream
                            that, issuing from the lake, makes away on its long course to the
                            Pacific. The army entered this plain <pb id="VAA3931-114" n="106"/> when
                            the sun was near the western horizon. It marched for a mile over a wide
                            road, cut straight through unfenced fields of green corn. The stalks
                            stood dense on either side, but were of a sickly growth, the rains of
                            the past summer having been light. The mile being nearly traversed, the
                            column issued into a bare space of some one hundred yards' width,
                            crossed that and came to the stream. The banks were not steep. The bed
                            was some thirty yards in width, but the water occupied only some four of
                            the thirty at the farther shore. All the rest of the space between the
                            two low and sandy banks was level, dry, and gravel-covered. The column
                            descended into this bed, crossed it, waded the shallow stream, climbed
                            the other bank, and proceeded toward Ocotlan's adobe houses, which stood
                            immediately at hand. The town made no defence; it could not. Indeed it
                            was already occupied by Vicente's allies. The head of the troops coming
                            to the first street, was met by a hasty messenger from the <hi rend="i"
                                >presidente</hi> of the town council, who, fearful and with no
                            troops, made haste to surrender. The surrender was no more than received
                            when there came dashing along the Mescala road a boy on foot. He was
                            Pancho's son. He brought the news, pantingly, that a body of cavalry had
                            eaten dinner in Mescala and were pursuing him; they would arrive at
                            once. The youth had slipped away, and, believing himself the especial
                            object of that cavalry's hate, had run the whole distance with all his
                            speed, so marvellous is the endurance of many an Indian lad. He was too
                            excited to have gained any idea of the number of the enemy. All efforts
                            failed to elicit even the most unsatisfactory estimate. Pepa had ridden
                            to him while he delivered his message.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-115" n="107"/>
                        <p>"Was the leader white?" she asked.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si! Si!</hi>" was the reply.</p>
                        <p>She turned her horse away and rode alone to the river.</p>
                        <p>Preparation was speedily made for battle. It was determined to hold the
                            bank of the stream next the town. The Ocotlan troops, gathered to join
                            Vicente, were immediately sent for. They came out of the street on the
                            double quick. There were some two hundred and sixty of them, including
                            but six horse. The secret organization effected by the church's powers
                            had so far been thorough. Vicente saw himself at once at the head of
                            more than eight hundred men, the expected number. They were
                            undisciplined save for his original two hundred, but he mustered his
                            skill in their disposition. His cavalry now numbered twenty-six. With
                            Quiroz at their head he placed them to the fore at the stream, extended
                            in a single line. Behind them, on the flat between stream and town, he
                            drew up his foot. He ordered earthworks to be thrown up; but the work of
                            so doing was scarcely begun when the enemy came.</p>
                        <p>When Don Rodrigo, with his eleven men, rode out of Chapala the night
                            before, it was not his purpose permanently to abandon the field. True,
                            he did not wish for war; yet he had followed Vicente's movements with
                            deep interest. He had early seen that the uprising should be crushed at
                            once, and, being republican to his heart's core, had at times felt some
                            glow of desire to crush it. He was a personal friend of the governor,
                            and possessed, he knew, the confidence and good-will of that somewhat
                            weak executive as did none other of the police of the lake region.
                            Perceiving the danger to grow <pb id="VAA3931-116" n="108"/> more
                            threatening, and the sapped and tottering State to remain impotent, he
                            had, a week <unclear>earlier-;</unclear> addressed a long and appealing
                            letter to the governor. He had laid the whole situation before him,
                            urged the need of immediate action, reminded him of the powerlessness of
                            the few country police, and finally, with what eloquence he could
                            master, called for a body of troops, however small, to be at once
                            despatched, that the revolt might die in its infancy. He freely offered
                            his own services to lead the attack should no better leader be at hand,
                            at the same time declaring himself not eager for the duty.</p>
                        <p>The governor was a man of nearly shattered nerves. He was drawn this way
                            and that, buffeted by many waves of the national turbulency. He lacked
                            decision and promptness. There were many other calls for troops, seeming
                            as urgent as Rodrigo's own. The State was poor to penury. Already the
                            panic-stricken executive had been called upon to create soldiers where
                            no soldiers were. He was at his wits' end. There had come no reply to
                            Rodrigo's letter.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> had written again, and, when Vicente reached
                            Chapala, he determined to wait no longer. He would go straight to
                            Guadalajara, urge his cause in person, secure what troops he could, and
                            return. He did not wish the leadership. But he would take it should the
                            State furnish no other for the place.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of the morning, therefore, he was riding with his eleven on
                            the Guadalajara road. He perceived before him a cloud of dust, which,
                            somewhat dissolving, displayed a little band of horsemen approaching
                            him. He halted, and the leader of that band, meeting him, gave him a
                            paper with the governor's seal thereon.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-117" n="109"/>
                        <p>"My one friend in many troubles," it read informally, "you have saved me
                            in this sea before; you will do it now. You talk of leaders and troops
                            as though I could raise them from the dust. I am driven to insanity with
                            the distracting calls on the resourceless State. You are leader enough;
                            there is no other. Kill the Chapala revolt for me and my gratitude is
                            eternal. I send you thirty horsemen. You want more, but they are not to
                            be had. Why? Because of mobs we have plenty, of armies none. The
                            government has gotten itself mixed in a war with the United States. I,
                            as every other State of the Republic, am sapped of troops. I create you
                            captain of this band. Add what gendarmes you can. Strike quick, and I
                            trust you."</p>
                        <p>Thirty men! Rodrigo scanned them with something like humor in his eyes.
                            If he must be launched into a small war of his own &#151; heigh-ho!
                            &#151; let us at it! His army was infinitesimal, but he recalled
                            that Vicente's two hundred were nearly all foot. Forty-two horsemen, he
                            believed, did they strike at once, fearlessly, would effectually
                            paralyze the revolt; for they were well armed with sabres and short
                            guns. He ordered a return to the lake. The men cheered him, and the
                            gallop to Mescala was begun.</p>
                        <p>He who had been the leader of the thirty assumed, henceforth, a position
                            somewhat like that of first lieutenant to Rodrigo. He was named
                            Bonavidas. He was a large man, with very broad shoulders, but a frame
                            exceedingly bony. His legs and arms were very long. The most striking
                            detail of his appearance was a peculiar sickliness, even haggardness of
                            countenance. He was at times frightfully pale, and breathed like one in
                            exhaustion. His expression <pb id="VAA3931-118" n="110"/> was uncanny.
                            These characteristics were all the more curious when it was seen that a
                            good humor (somewhat infernal), expressed by a haggard smile, was his
                            usual mood; and that he seemed ever powerful, more so, indeed, the more
                            sickly was his face. Rodrigo studied this anomaly of a man as they rode.
                            He believed he had here an ally such as he needed.</p>
                        <p>"Bonavidas," said he at last, "you do not look like a man to hunt
                            fighting."</p>
                        <p>"If every other," said Bonavidas, smiling his ghostly smile, and
                            expressing his eagerness by a flapping of his lank knees against the
                            saddle, his mind characteristically lingering over the unclean thought,
                            &#151; "if every other be as lively a corpse as I, we shall soon be
                            digging graves for the living."</p>
                        <p>They arrived, at some time between the hours of ten and eleven, at the
                            ridge overlooking the lake. That beautiful expanse of water lay
                            shimmering in the white light.</p>
                        <p>"A pretty place to spoil with trouble," said Bonavidas. "The shores are
                            as handsome as the water. And what is that spot that lies out there in
                            the middle?"</p>
                        <p>"An island," said Rodrigo. "And a spot haunted. There is never a Mexican
                            thinks of the beauty of that; he dreams only of its ghosts and steers in
                            the other direction. They say it is long since cursed, and the devil has
                            it."</p>
                        <p>"An attractive idea," said Bonavidas. "What is on it?"</p>
                        <p>"Ruins of a Spanish prison," returned Rodrigo.</p>
                        <p>They had descended from the ridge's summit, and, for a time, the lake
                            disappeared. They issued at last on its borders and made a short halt at
                                <pb id="VAA3931-119" n="111"/> Mescala, where, the town being nearly
                            deserted, it was found impossible to learn the number of those who had
                            passed before; for the populace of the country districts are often found
                            to be in total ignorance of numbers. A steady trot was then entered
                            upon, which brought that small body of cavalry to the corn-covered plain
                            about Ocotlan shortly before the sun, a red and fiery ball, touched the
                            horizon's line.</p>
                        <p>Emerging into the wide road between the fields of grain, more than one
                            eye detected the line of battle yonder under the walls of the town with
                            the river before it. Rodrigo halted his men. The corn was not high, and
                            the horsemen could see over its mile of extent. A sudden silence fell on
                            them. They sat and scanned that opposing force for one short minute;
                            then they looked at each other. Its extraordinary one day's growth
                            astounded even Rodrigo. His face grew white, but he shut his jaws and
                            flinched not. He saw a band of cavalry which seemed not greatly inferior
                            to his own. Behind it, deployed in a single compact line, he perceived
                            nearly eight hundred foot. He believed he detected Vicente's form,
                            mounted, in front of the division of the left. The leader of the centre
                            he did not recognize. On his enemy's right he saw a division headed by
                            an enormous man whom he believed, yet could scarcely believe, to be the
                            fisherman Fortino. He looked more closely, and decided it was he. He
                            knew Fortino to be unskilled as a leader. That right division appeared,
                            too, a trifle weaker than the others. Lastly, it was nearest the
                            street's end leading into the town. Rodrigo swept the front with quick
                            eyes, seized upon these facts, steeled his nerves, and made his plans at
                            once. <pb id="VAA3931-120" n="112"/> He turned to his men, calmly,
                            leisurely. He smiled a cool, humorous smile at them.</p>
                        <p>"Are you afraid?" said he.</p>
                        <p>Their awe at the superior force fled at once. They declared for the dash.
                            He knew his dangers and his powers, but did not hesitate.</p>
                        <p>"We will meet the cavalry with a shock it will never forget," he
                            commanded. "Ride, brothers, every one of you a demon. We will crush the
                            horse. We then plunge through their right wing of infantry, cut it in
                            two, and gain the street. We will then, with the protection of its
                            narrowness, hold it against the entrance of the infantry, whose lines in
                            a street can be no wider than are ours. Come; your lives and victory
                            depend on crushing the horse, and one blow will do it."</p>
                        <p>He saw a wavering smile play over Bonavidas' pale face, and the relish
                            that odd person had for this deed of danger was unmistakable. One minute
                            only had been occupied in the survey. In one more the forty-two were
                            deployed in corn-fields, the line's middle resting on the road.</p>
                        <p>The word of command was on Rodrigo's lips, but he did not utter it. He
                            saw, in that moment, issuing from his enemy's ranks, a horse at whose
                            saddle fluttered a crimson dress. It was Pepa, and he suddenly knew her.
                            She <unclear>dashed-</unclear> down into the stream and came on.</p>
                        <p>That unexpected movement had taken Vicente completely by surprise. He had
                            tried to induce her to retire into the town. She had persisted in
                            remaining on the field, though to the rear and out of the probable range
                            of shots. Vicente, now absorbed in the concentration of his powers, was
                            suddenly amazed to perceive that she had already <pb id="VAA3931-121"
                                n="113"/> burst through the line of infantry at a point distant from
                            him, and crossed the stream. She was a hundred yards to the front before
                            he realized it. He called after her. He commanded her. He started away,
                            spurring his horse, to force her back. He heard Quiroz's voice behind
                            him cry:</p>
                        <p>"Let her alone! She will walk barefoot over burning hell before she die
                            &#151; let her!"</p>
                        <p>Vicente perceived that his enemy was waiting. He knew that only brute
                            force and a disgraceful scene could make her return, even should he
                            overtake her &#151; and her horse was superior to his. He heard the
                            army behind him burst into enthusiasm for her daring; knew that to
                            hamper this their inspiration would be a military mistake. He realized
                            that the fight was waiting on her; that his men had come to trust that
                            this untamable woman carried with her her own safety. Chagrined, he was
                            forced back. He, as Rodrigo, held his men and waited. His troops were
                            shouting:</p>
                        <p>"Viva la Capitana! Viva la Capitana!"</p>
                        <p>The girl did not heed. Seeing she was not pursued, she suddenly slackened
                            speed. She rode slowly on, her horse stepping proudly, majestically. She
                            came in between the two fields of corn and halted not. Her black <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo's</hi> ends waved behind her in the rising evening
                            breeze. The last of the sunlight, piercing the field of grain, cast its
                            horizontal beams on the red of her dress and barred it with lines of
                            shadow, so that the crimson, as she went, flickered and flashed with a
                            thousand intermittent rays of light. The tasselled stalks whispered and
                            waved in air. She held the two forces motionless. Her eyes, deep
                            burning, were bent before her. Blood suffused her face, and the
                            excitement, <pb id="VAA3931-122" n="114"/> repressed, showed itself only
                            in eyes and lips.</p>
                        <p>In the universal silence she came thus to a point half way between the
                            two troops. She halted her horse and turned a little sidewise. She could
                            see Rodrigo before her. She looked and saw Vicente behind her. Her face
                            became suddenly bloodless, and the corn-fields seemed swaying and
                            circling round her. She recovered herself, gathering her strength, and
                            looked at the two ways. Their lengths were equal. Their widths and
                            smoothness were the same. It was as far to Vicente as to Rodrigo
                            &#151; the one was to her right, the other to her left. The wide
                            path through the fields led straight to either. She would not turn her
                            horse east or west. He was champing his bit. She loosed the reins and
                            let him have his will, her hand trembling as she did so. Even in her the
                            spirit of gaming lived. She watched her steed with fear concentrated in
                            her great eyes. He turned and went on in the direction she had been
                            going. A delirium of haste seized her. She spurred him and dashed toward
                            the horsemen of Rodrigo. She bent over, her face a face of flame, and
                            urged him on. She drew up with a quick and reckless wheeling of her
                            steed before the leader. He had advanced some ten paces to meet her. She
                            looked at him haughtily, but her eyes spoke her spirit. She bent them on
                            him and said, low:</p>
                        <p>"What is it you have for me?"</p>
                        <p>"Nothing," said he, his face still whiter.</p>
                        <p>A wave of anger and shame burst on her. She shot a look of hate at him,
                            wheeled, and dashed back so quickly that the troops who idolized her
                            could not have known even that she had come so near the chief of their
                            enemies.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-123" n="115"/>
                        <p>She galloped toward the river, hearing the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> sharp
                            cry of charge. She let her powerful horse put out all his speed and flew
                            down toward Vicente's forces, the sound of the galloping cavalry behind
                            ringing in her ears. She neared the stream and raised her hand high in
                            air, crying:</p>
                        <p>"Follow me!"</p>
                        <p>She had one instant to knot her flying <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> round her
                            waist, leaving her head bare. Then she wheeled once more toward
                            Rodrigo's advancing line.</p>
                        <p>It would have been well could Quiroz have held his horsemen on the
                            stream's east bank, thus taking his enemy at a disadvantage when that
                            enemy should cross and be forced to mount it. But Vicente saw the space
                            between river and town to be too narrow; the cavalry was too close to
                            the foot. Did it so remain the foot would be hampered by its presence.
                            So, immediately on the charging of Rodrigo's men, he ordered a
                            counter-charge of Quiroz's twenty-six.</p>
                        <p>They saw the girl, having come to the stream's opposite bank, turn to
                            lead that charge. Doroteo and his horsemen dashed into the stream,
                            across the gravel bed, up the other side, and followed her. Rodrigo's
                            line had cut straight through the trampled grain. He held it compact and
                            steady. He swung down toward the river with mighty force. He knew the
                            value of one quick, projectile-like charge at a given point.
                            Instinctively he adopted the tactics of Napoleon, of Greene, of Forrest.
                            He swept out into the open plain between corn and stream with bursting
                            speed.</p>
                        <p>The girl had fallen in with Quiroz's men. She was at Doroteo's side, wild
                            as an animal, leading them on. The two bands fired volleys and then
                            crashed together with terrific shock. It was hence <pb id="VAA3931-124"
                                n="116"/> forth a fight of sabres, knives, or pistols. The
                            indiscriminate mass swayed for an instant to and fro. Horses and men
                            went down. She was in the middle of it, fighting on, blindly, enraged.
                            She scarce knew what she did. She believed she aimed her weapon more
                            than once straight at that white leader who had cast her back. But he
                            bore down untouched. His force pushed on irresistibly, cutting or
                            crushing as it went. The inferior line of Quiroz slowly gave way,
                            ground, as it were, over the course it had traversed. It fought with
                            unabated fury. Quiroz's shrill cry, "Down with them! Down with the sons
                            of Hell!" rang ever clear and high over the noise of battle. His men
                            were hurled to the river's bank and down. Reduced in number they still
                            fought on. Rodrigo's line crushed its slow way into the gravel bed and
                            over it. He was losing men; he bore on, cutting his way with demoniacal
                            desperation.</p>
                        <p>He tried to centre his powers on Quiroz, to slay that fierce fighter. But
                            enchantment went with Quiroz. He seemed to feel, in the tempest's
                            middle, a joy, a delight that was devilish. He held a long <hi rend="i"
                                >machete.</hi> His every blow was delivered with a coolness as great
                            as were its power and speed. His eyes glittered like coals. He was yet
                            pressed back. His line floundered for one instant in the waters of the
                            stream, turned and dashed up the other bank. The girl was with it.
                            Rodrigo's men, suffering here most severely, staggered up after,
                            concentrated their power and still pressed on. It seemed they were
                            cutting through solid iron, so marvellously did Quiroz hold his force
                            together. But that force was crushed at last straight into the line of
                            Fortino's right. There its leader made an <pb id="VAA3931-125" n="117"/>
                            ultimate desperate effort. He held Rodrigo in check yet another minute.
                            The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> was gathering his strength for the final
                            wheel to the left and a leap through the ranks of infantry.</p>
                        <p>That minute was enough. In it Vicente showed his cool head and the
                            discipline he had ground into his two hundred. He was with that band on
                            his line's left, whereas the fight of the cavalry was on the right.
                            Rodrigo being for an instant checked by horse and foot, Vicente swung
                            his two hundred round, like the spoke of a wheel on the hub of the
                            centre. The machine-like precision of his men was proved. Rodrigo was
                            caught, as it were, in the trap of an angle. Vicente's left poured a
                            sudden deadly hail on his flank. The whole line was at once engaged.
                            Pancho's centre, raw as they were, broke on the imprisoned <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe.</hi> The State's horsemen went down like grain in the field.
                            Rodrigo, driven to his last madness, huddled the remnant of his torn
                            force, called out the power of every nerve, gave the cry for the great
                            burst, plunged like a maniac through horse and foot, knocked the
                            charging Fortino half senseless with a blow from his empty weapon, cut
                            through the panic-stricken right, as though his line had been a line of
                            steel, dealt death about, left a bloody track behind, tore himself loose
                            from his last antagonist, and galloped away into the town's street.</p>
                        <p>The battle, small as it was, had been inconceivably fierce and deadly.
                            Vicente had shown, once for all, his coolness, his deep thought, his
                            power over men, though he had so fearfully outnumbered his antagonist.
                            The flank fire of his two hundred had done terrible execution, a fire
                            and a movement directed with masterful genius. He had ridden up <pb
                                id="VAA3931-126" n="118"/> and down his ranks, calm. He had no more
                            heeded the storm of bullets than though it had been a storm of dust. He
                            saw Fortino, after a brave dash, stagger back dazed. He saw the
                            gray-bearded Pancho with a long wound opened on his cheek, and the blood
                            trickling down the beard, drip, drip, with the flood that needs no
                            haste. He perceived Bonavidas' ghastly countenance, haggard as death,
                            but living with a cruel joy as he felled his antagonists with powerful
                            arm. He poured in his fire, cut his enemy down, then saw that last
                            charge of Rodrigo's remnant, &#151; the bursting asunder of
                            Fortino's right, and the escape.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz's decimated cavalry gathered itself together and dashed at the
                            town in hot pursuit. The girl was already far in the lead, disappearing.
                            The red ball of the sun had gone down. The lake had burned with its last
                            fire and grown leaden. The night was coming quickly on. Rodrigo had not
                            sufficient men remaining to make a stand, even in the street. He fled.
                            That memorable battle was fought and won.</p>
                        <p>The gray-bearded Pancho, as the tumult ceased, fell dead from his steed.
                            The stream and the stretch beyond and the space before the town were
                            strewn with slain. Vicente had lost eighty-seven men, the scarcely
                            conceivable, deadly effect of that infuriated band of penned-up cavalry.
                            Out of the forty-one that had followed the bold dash of Rodrigo, but a
                            dozen cut their final gash of blood through the crushed right and
                            escaped. Such was the Battle of Ocotlan, told yet with bated breath in
                            many a fisher's hut, remembered as a fight such as, for fierceness, the
                            lake had never seen &#151; will never see again.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER III</head>
                        <p>WITH the setting sun rose clouds in the east and south, and lightning
                            over the southern mountains was answered by other lightning over the
                            eastern. The rumblings of distant thunder told of the coming of one of
                            those swift storms of rain and wind that at times follow the rainy
                            seasons some weeks after the daily summer storms have ceased. The stony
                            road from Mescala to Ocotlan, with the mountains to its one side and the
                            darkening water to the other, was overcast with gloom, when there came
                            along it toward the latter town a single traveller on foot.</p>
                        <p>The gloom was of that dull, weird kind that heavy clouds and a lingering
                            bit of sunlight conspire to produce. It could not be many minutes till
                            the way would be dark save for the lightning flashing on the road's
                            rocks and the pedestrian moving among them. A wind came out of the south
                            and crinkled all the lake, and heavy blue waves began to beat upon the
                            shore. The wind caught the skirt of the traveller's dress and whipped
                            it, a flash of pink when the lightning lit it, round young limbs.</p>
                        <p>She had seen the sun's red ball going down. She had heard, too, firing in
                            the distance before her, whereat she had shuddered at the great burnt
                            scar of red the sun made across the water's face. On a lonely spot of
                            the shore near Mescala she had been frightened by the sudden apparition
                            of a man looming <pb id="VAA3931-128" n="120"/> from behind boulders,
                            and had heard a boat grating on the sand. Naturally timid, she had
                            scudded away in the light from that very path of red across the water,
                            casting one glance behind her. That glance had revealed to her the man's
                            face, lonely against a background of southern sky and clouds, a face
                            about which the rising breeze blew strands of tangled hair, on whose
                            forehead sat care or something worse, and across whose cheek a scar
                            wrenched the features into an expression that seemed to her infernal.
                            The sun's scar on the water was nothing to that. She ran. She came to a
                            rocky angle of the road; turning to look again, the figure had
                            disappeared. But she carried its effect with her.</p>
                        <p>The firing before her had not ceased. The sun's red was nearly gone
                            before she heard it no more. She was afraid of the sound, and longed to
                            know. Almost she would have preferred the presence of the bullets and
                            the sight of the battle to this fearing uncertainty. She must hasten
                            lest the night should lose her. The big empty world was a strange thing
                            to her. What were all its vastness and its loneliness; its people, its
                            lands, its battles? Only let her reach Ocotlan and find him living
                            &#151; what were all these things? It had been dark like this, and
                            she had felt this sudden lostness once before, when they had carried
                            away a body from her hut, and there had been no unrolling of the
                            nets.</p>
                        <p>It was black night when she came to the river's bed, save for the flashes
                            that lifted Ocotlan out of the blackness for her, and burnt its adobe
                            walls. The clouds were over all the sky, and the measureless curtain of
                            the coming rain, had it been day, would have been seen to hang, thick
                            with torrents, over all the south-eastern lake, rolling nearer.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-129" n="121"/>
                        <p>She could dimly see lights and people beyond the stream, and, to the
                            right of the town, still farther, fires as of a camp. She found herself
                            trembling, and went down into the bed of the stream. She fell against a
                            great bulk lying on the pebbles. She groped to the right and the left,
                            and fell against others. Despairing, she wanted to weep, but could not,
                            and the lightning came and showed her that the bulks were horses lying
                            dead. As the lightning went out, a white spot caught her eye. Whether it
                            were a face she did not know, but she cried out smotheredly, and ran on
                            by a way the light had shown her, straight through the narrow strip of
                            water, and climbed up the other bank.</p>
                        <p>A little way further there were some torches of <hi rend="i">ocote</hi>
                            flaring yellow, being carried slowly here and there. She came to them,
                            and the bearers, speechless women from Ocotlan, saw her figure suddenly
                            in their midst, the wind wrapping round her the skirts the stream had
                            wet, and the flames showing the gold of her hair.</p>
                        <p>One of the women wailed and turned away, and there came another,
                            searching, weeping, turning over bodies on the ground, and crying:</p>
                        <p>"Oh my Juan! My Juanito! My <hi rend="i">niño!</hi>"</p>
                        <p>The girl knew she was in the midst of the slain. She seized the arm of
                            the crying woman and said:</p>
                        <p>"Where is the leader?"</p>
                        <p>"Heaven knows!" was the distracted reply.</p>
                        <p>Terrified at this, the girl ran on, dark shapes still about her, a groan
                            there or a curse here. A ribald young female came staggering over the
                            field with a torch and a rag of a flag. She was drunk and singing.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-130" n="122"/>
                        <p>"Dead! all dead!" and she laughed and sang again. "My Cenobio left me!
                            He's dead!" she cried, seizing the traveller's slim shoulder and leering
                            horribly on her. "He went down &#151; here!" And she thrust out a
                            thin arm tragically and pointed to the field.</p>
                        <p>"Where is the leader, Vicente?" gasped the other.</p>
                        <p>"Vicente? Ha!" shrieked the first. "Oh, God help him!" She went
                            staggering on among the fallen.</p>
                        <p>Shaking in every limb the traveller went toward the fires. She passed
                            figures coming and going, and bodies carried. A part of the army was
                            burying the dead. She came at length like a quick shadow or a leaf blown
                            by the wind, to the long line of open air camps, where
                                <unclear>the-</unclear> rest of the troops, exhausted, cooked, or
                            lay on blankets, or gambled with tossed pennies. She scanned the line.
                            He was not there. She ran along it, her throat dry. She came at length
                            to a row of adobe walls some yards in front of the camp. There was one
                            fire here, and two men were seated on the ground leaning against the
                            wall. They were Anastasio and Fortino. The relief at sight of them was
                            so intense that, when she cried to them, it was half a cry, half a dry
                            sob. She flung herself down beside them.</p>
                        <p>"Is Vicente dead?" she cried.</p>
                        <p>"No," said Anastasio, without emotion, straightening a long leg flat on
                            the ground. "Why," he drawled, suddenly, a little surprised, "how did
                            you get here?"</p>
                        <p>"I followed. Take me to Vicente."</p>
                        <p>"I think I can do that," muttered Fortino, in grim humor. "I can do
                            something, if I can't hold a line of horse."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-131" n="123"/>
                        <p>He arose and led the girl away remorsefully.</p>
                        <p>"Is my father killed?" she had asked of Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"Oh Lord, no," drawled Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>Fortino took her into the town. He muttered all the way, deeply,
                            subterraneously. They went some blocks in silence, she wrapping her <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo</hi> closely round her head and shoulders.</p>
                        <p>"No," broke out Fortino, suddenly. "No, they're not dead. But it isn't
                            any virtue of mine. I was knocked, I was. I am no man, girl. I am a
                            burro."</p>
                        <p>His bitterness was great. Parties of hastening soldiers were scouring the
                            streets and once or twice they saw where doors were being burst
                            open.</p>
                        <p>"They're looking for the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi>" grunted Fortino, "the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> it was my business to stop. He and his men
                            broke through me and my drivelling right. They've found two of his men,
                            and that's all they will find."</p>
                        <p>She said nothing to this. They came to a long, low house with eaves
                            projecting on the street. The front was flush with the sidewalk, and the
                            windows were barred with iron. A street-lamp showed carved lions' heads
                            on the massive door. They show the place to this day as the house that
                            lodged Vicente after the battle, number fifteen of the <hi rend="i"
                                >Calle del Rio;</hi> weather-beaten it is, with its many-colored
                            plasterings falling off.</p>
                        <p>Fortino beat on the door with a noise that the thunder answered, for the
                            storm was over the town. It was opened and she was let in, and Fortino,
                            mumbling, went away. The first drops of the torrent fell on her blue <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo</hi> before she entered.</p>
                        <p>Vicente was with the clergy on that night. The battle was called a
                            victory, though the leader was chagrined that the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi>
                            had escaped him. The <pb id="VAA3931-132" n="124"/> meaning of the fight
                            and the plans of the next movements were to be discussed in a parley in
                            this, the house of a priest, over whose low, flat roof loomed the towers
                            of a church. They were waiting, too, in vain, for news of the capture of
                            the fugitives. It was the priest himself who had cautiously opened the
                            door to the girl. When he learned who she was he admitted her and closed
                            it. His full face suggested a deep but suppressed glee, and in his long
                                <hi rend="i">sotana</hi> he led her, rubbing his hands nervously
                            together as he went, along corridors, round a <hi rend="i">patio,</hi>
                            to a large rear room. Vicente was there alone. They had brought into
                            that room one of those pot-like portable <hi rend="i">braseros,</hi>
                            that he might dry his garments by it; for in the man&#156;uvering of
                            the fight he had dashed more than once through the stream. The brasier
                            sat now in a corner on the brick floor, its bed of live coals casting
                            out a red glare. There was a candle on the ledge of a deep window
                            whereof the inner wooden shutters were closed and barred.</p>
                        <p>She arrived at the room's door and the priest left her. A delight that
                            was agitation filled her as she came timidly in. Her face was beautiful
                            in that moment, and wonderfully lit. The suspense was done.</p>
                        <p>"Vicente!" she cried, and sank forward, shaking and sobbing.</p>
                        <p>"My faithful one!" said he, when his first astonishment was over, holding
                            her and making her dry her dress over the coals, "if only the whole
                            cause had your spirit in it! But why did you come? I left you safe.
                            Pepita's mother promised me only this morning that you should be cared
                            for. War is not for you."</p>
                        <p>"I was lonely," said she; "and, Vicente, I am a woman now."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-133" n="125"/>
                        <p>He looked her over. She was, indeed, at seventeen a woman. Her form had
                            grown slightly fuller than it was in the old days. Her face, too, was a
                            woman's face, for all its youth and its dimples and the glistening hair
                            about it. It held in it a dreaminess that made it almost sad. He told
                            her so with a pang in his heart.</p>
                        <p>"No, no!" she cried, smiling at him. "Not with you. I was always happy
                            with you. Vicente, I could n't stay &#151; I could n't be away when
                            you were here. There is n't anything there any more; and the very sight
                            of the nets and the house made me unhappy."</p>
                        <p>"But what can this bloody war, child, have to do with you?"</p>
                        <p>"I can follow you &#151; let me! Oh, I am so lonely! And if you are
                            &#151; if it goes wrong with you &#151; I can take care of you
                            then!"</p>
                        <p>He caught her to his arms where she came willingly, and the candle-light
                            lit moisture in his eye. He sat down on a chair still holding her.</p>
                        <p>"Little girl," said he, looking into the bed of coals, "do you not know
                            how, in all the struggle and the fear, I remember and keep you as the
                            bright spot behind, whither I shall return? Where all is fierceness I
                            remember you as gentleness. Look," stretching out his hand and pointing
                            to the fire, "I can see it all, merely looking at the coals. There is
                            your face, luminous. Some love will come to you some day, now that you
                            are a woman, and it will light your face like that. There is the beach,
                            too, and the hut with its poor little thatch. Why, Clarita, if I were in
                            the blackest dungeon I could still see the waves that we played by, and
                            feel the spray, and the west wind, and my sister's hair tangled by it
                            and blown like dull gold damply over my face."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-134" n="126"/>
                        <p>She could not answer him. After a pause he continued:</p>
                        <p>"And this is why I do not want you to follow me, that I may run no risk
                            of losing you. Your poor feet have come a long way."</p>
                        <p>She put one of them out and looked at it and laughed at him a little.</p>
                        <p>"They are very well," said she.</p>
                        <p>They were small, encased in the rough shoes that the Chapala cobbler
                            made. The shoes were worn, damp, and discolored with the journey.</p>
                        <p>"Surely those little things," said he, "will not bear much. You should be
                            at home. It is better than this; and I know you have, under your
                            gentleness, a strength." He smiled. "We used to call you stubborn. You
                            would so persist in doing that which you wanted to do. You can care for
                            yourself till a better time. Your old stubbornness will not make you
                            follow me. And if the day comes when these dreams are realities, what
                            will you have me do for you then?"</p>
                        <p>"Only so have it," said she, "that you shall not have to go away any
                            more. It is very great, Vicente, to be as you are. You are not like
                            other men."</p>
                        <p>"No, it is not great; would that I could make it so. If I should die now,
                            Clarita, I should be called only an adventurer. Scarcely a star, girl,
                            shines on a path like mine. One victory cannot blind me to the dark days
                            to come. I may die like the others, for having lifted up my voice and
                            desired something different. The world seems ever to hate him who
                            disturbs its repose."</p>
                        <p>She clasped her fingers together over the charcoal and bent down till its
                            red glare made her face like flame.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-135" n="127"/>
                        <p>"Oh!" she cried, "that I too might stay with you!"</p>
                        <p>"Why," said he, laughing gently, "you are the calm over it all. And you
                            will go back and wait till the waves are still."</p>
                        <p>She thought in silence.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," she sighed after a time, "I will go back. But it is with sorrow,
                            and only because you wish it. I shall not be happy. And &#151; I do
                            not like it there any more," she added with odd simplicity. "And I do
                            not like Pepa's mother. And Pepa &#151; where is she? Vicente, I
                            want to say something to you."</p>
                        <p>"Say on," said he.</p>
                        <p>"I &#151; I am afraid of Pepa."</p>
                        <p>His face darkened.</p>
                        <p>"Why?" asked he.</p>
                        <p>"Not for myself. She is good to me &#151; but &#151; I am afraid
                            of her for you."</p>
                        <p>"She did a brave thing to-day," said he. "She rode out between the two
                            ranks, straight into the enemy. She is like a dream in the night. She
                            stirs my heart strangely, yet I cannot truly know her. She rode slowly,
                            daring them. She made them halt, and gave us every opportunity to take
                            in their number and more fully to prepare; and afterward she turned and
                            galloped back and led the charge."</p>
                        <p>His face grew much darker as he spoke. She was interested but little.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," she said gloomily; "yes, that is like Pepa."</p>
                        <p>"But you are afraid of her?"</p>
                        <p>She clasped his arm and repeated it.</p>
                        <p>"I am afraid of Pepa. I do not know; there is something that makes me
                            afraid."</p>
                        <p>"Well," he said after a long pause, "maybe there is, child."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-136" n="128"/>
                        <p>They spoke yet a little while of other things. The storm had broken and
                            was warring outside. The terror of the battle and the gloom of the field
                            she had passed through were over her, and she shuddered.</p>
                        <p>"Early in the morning," said he, "there departs a <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            from here for Chapala. It is a boat of a friend of the priest. He will
                            carry letters to Chapala, and you shall go with him. You will be safe
                            and the journey will be easy. The army is not for you."</p>
                        <p>He gave her his bed, which stood in the room's corner, kissed her
                            good-night, and left her. She sat long looking into the dying fire,
                            hearing thunder and rain in torrents without, and afterward dropped her
                            head to her hands on her knees and the tears ran down on the pink of the
                            dress. Then she went to bed and slept.</p>
                        <p>Fortino had returned slowly to the point where she had found him. He had
                            taken no interest in the silent seekers after fugitives, the occasional
                            flashing of a torch round a dark <unclear>corner-</unclear> He believed
                            the remnant of the enemy had galloped away out of the town; indeed it
                            was known that some had so done.</p>
                        <p>"They've caught two!" cried a friend, running past him.</p>
                        <p>"Eh?" said Fortino; "two;" and went on ill-humoredly. "And the rest may
                            be in Heaven or Hell. They aren't here, oh Saint Gregory!"</p>
                        <p>He came to the outskirts and thence to the wall where his two companions
                            were, and the isolated camp fire flickered and smoked. The rain was
                            coming on with more violence, and sputtered and hissed on the coals.
                            Anastasio was seated under the shelter of thatched eaves that hung out
                            from the wall. He had his sombrero down over his eyes, his lank knees
                            close to his face, his lanker arms wrapped <pb id="VAA3931-137" n="129"
                            /> round them. His red blanket, for further protection, was wound all
                            about his body, his neck, and his chin. He was the picture of indolence.
                            Off to the left were the other camps, surprised by the rain, the fires
                            dying out, the men huddled together. To the right were still the torches
                            flaring over dead bodies.</p>
                        <p>Fortino, too, sat down by the fire in the shelter of the eaves. The rain,
                            coming from behind them, left this spot comparatively dry. When the full
                            torrent broke, Francisco came dashing from the field of the slain, his
                            blanket fluttering in the wind and his sandals clapping out sharp slaps
                            on the wet earth. He leaped in under the eaves.</p>
                        <p>"What, you old figure-head!" cried he in an impertinent bantering to
                            Fortino. "You who lead and fight like a lame cock! Oh your battle! Ha!
                            ha! Ha! ha!" and he slapped his leg with vigor. "Villain, you were chaff
                            in the wind. The first big wave went right over your head as though your
                            bristles were grass on a sandy marsh. Take a lesson from <hi rend="i"
                                >me.</hi> I would inspire a rock with recklessness, I would. Men,
                            did you see me? I was the stiffest feather in your right wing, was
                            I!"</p>
                        <p>"And you beat more air than all the rest of them," observed Anastasio,
                            slowly crossing his legs another way, "I'll wager you that, and were
                            easily first when the wing flew."</p>
                        <p>"Let remorse have its own way in me, fellow," put in Fortino gloomily. "I
                            am no soldier, eh? Nor a bellows either."</p>
                        <p>Anastasio cast a pensive eye out into the rain and the night, toward the
                            field of the slain.</p>
                        <p>"Where are they, Francisco?" said he. "Where are the spoils?"</p>
                        <p>"They are out there," replied the other, shaking <pb id="VAA3931-138"
                                n="130"/> his head and staring, too, into the rain. "St. Francis, it
                            is creepy, this spoils. Now if it were day &#151; Friends, there is
                            a bad atmosphere hangs over the spoils. I moved a little in that
                            direction. <hi rend="i">Amigos mios,</hi> it seems to me doubtful that
                            spoils are made for the night. Spoils are a creature of the day-time.
                            Now I tell you I would do it &#151; I came near doing it &#151;
                            I could bring myself round to it, if &#151; Fellows, I am a man of
                            deep sympathies and stirrings of the bosom."</p>
                        <p>"You would rather take your spoils from a live man," suggested Anastasio.
                            "Yet if I did not know the stirrings of your bosom made it flabby in the
                            matter of courage, I should say you had some dead fellow's coins under
                            your blanket."</p>
                        <p>"I am afraid of nothing," cried the hot Francisco, "under the whole
                            course of the sun. Yet even a vigorous coward were something to have
                            faith in, and better than a cow of a man who chews his cud during
                            battle. What did Anastasio do? By my soul's salvation, he sat the ground
                            cross-legged during the fight. When the enemy was coming on I heard a
                            wheezing sigh some feet over my head. I turned and it was this tall
                            animal commencing to bend himself down and arranging his legs. He sat
                            himself on the hard ground, he did, in the midst of us, cross-legged.
                            And he turned loose his weapon in that condition. And when they came
                            rushing on us and had us fighting them like bees round our heads, there
                            was this long strip of human flesh, lazy as a woman, by my soul, in the
                            midst of them, shooting straight up."</p>
                        <p>"This was on account of my coolness, brother," said Anastasio. "I was
                            remarkably cool during the fight. I distinctly recall stopping a moment
                            to put <pb id="VAA3931-139" n="131"/> my blanket over my mouth to keep
                            out the poison of the coming night air. For I sometimes have a cough.
                            Besides, that is my way of going into battle. I go into it sitting down,
                            and my theory of the fight is that the rest ought to do likewise. You
                            call your line up in a long row and you make them sit down, cross-legged
                            for them to whom it is more comfortable. And when the enemy comes
                            charging on you, forbid a rise, but have the firing done as they are.
                            Thus is there no danger of a rout. No soldier, lest he disobey orders,
                            can run away, for he cannot run sitting and to get up is to disobey
                            orders, whereafter he knows he will be shot. These are my theories of a
                            battle."</p>
                        <p>Anastasio's vocabulary was frequently a matter of awe to his companions.
                            There was much silence and consideration after this speech.</p>
                        <p>"No doubt," said Francisco, venturing a straining of his own vocabulary
                            and speaking weightily, "it is a way to gain momentum."</p>
                        <p>"You," replied Anastasio taking him up, "you don't know what momentum
                            is."</p>
                        <p>To which Francisco warmly retorted:</p>
                        <p>"I know the Castilian tongue, señor, <hi rend="i">and</hi> its meanings.
                            There are some who know nothing but the tongue. There are some who are
                            all tongue. Momentum is this: A bull in a field is made mad by an
                            agitation of the blanket, so. He comes at you, his tail whizzing and his
                            eyes shut. You leap behind a very large rock, thus, the rock happening
                            to be in the field where the bull is. The bull, having got force as he
                            came on, finds himself unable to stop the movement of his body and he
                            smashes as though he were glass, on the rock, horns first. <hi rend="i"
                                >Si,</hi> señor, and what was it smashed him?" Here Francisco
                            emphasized <pb id="VAA3931-140" n="132"/> matters with a sweep of his
                            hand. "It was <hi rend="i">the momentum in the rock!</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"It is a very hard metal," said Fortino, who had not listened to much of
                            the discourse. "There are veins of it among the Triquis. The Triquis
                            mine it and carry it to the west coast, and it is shipped north, where
                            they tell me there is a nation of madmen."</p>
                        <p>"There is that," said Francisco, "a nation that speaks foolishly a
                            language that nobody can understand. They are white and their country is
                            as big as all Mexico or bigger, so I am told. They have large cities,
                            too, of madmen. And those that chance to be born of a sane mind are made
                            crazy by the rest before they come of a good age, that harmony may be
                            preserved."</p>
                        <p>"A good national policy," said Fortino; "a wisdom worthy even of a
                            right-minded people."</p>
                        <p>They had sat for some time in silence when Doroteo came round the corner
                            and entered banteringly into conversation with them. Pursuing a course
                            of clever flattery which he knew too well how to use, he presently drew
                            Fortino aside, and, with his fingers on the giant's arm, whispered to
                            him of Pepa. She had not been seen since the fight. Fortino could
                            furnish no information of her. It was then that Quiroz unburdened
                            himself to his big listener. He told him plainly of his passion for the
                            girl, his love of the bloody game they were playing, a love trebled by
                            the stake he had set before him in the person of Josefa Aranja. When he
                            finally left Fortino, not only had he soothed that remorseful man's
                            heart by praise of his fighting &#151; he had done another thing. He
                            had secured a promise that, did it ever chance in battle that Pepa were
                            cut down and in danger, Fortino <pb id="VAA3931-141" n="133"/> would
                            seize the young tigress by brute force and carry her off the field to
                            await the coming of Quiroz. This agreed, the adroit Doroteo moved
                            noiselessly away. Fortino turned to his companions. They prepared for
                            the night.</p>
                        <p>"Where is la capitana?" inquired Francisco, completely burying himself in
                            his blanket.</p>
                        <p>"She is doubtless," said Anastasio slowly, "in a church somewhere,
                            praying."</p>
                        <p>And he stretched himself at a marvellous length on the ground. The storm
                            was only beginning to abate, and ere long the three of them were
                            answering its thunders with their snores.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning the priest in the house that lodged Vicente and his
                            sister, came to Clarita's door and awakened her. She could not see
                            Vicente; he was already out with his troops. She dressed herself and was
                            given into the charge of the man in whose <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> she
                            was to be a passenger. She left the priest still rubbing his hands most
                            heartily, and went away to the lake. The storm had gone by and the sun
                            rose clear; all the world was fresh and glistening with the clinging
                            drops of rain, and the morning breeze came cool out of the mountains.
                            They found the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> riding at anchor some distance
                            out. She was lifted to a sailor's back and carried through sparkling
                            water. When all was ready a sail was hoisted.</p>
                        <p>She stood in the bow looking back at the town. The soldiers were far to
                            her right, seemingly preparing to move. Vicente she could not
                            distinguish. A white-clothed, bare-legged sailor sat in the stern at the
                            wooden rudder. Another sprawled under the boat's thatch on the floor.
                            Still a third lay high up at the prow over the water and sang a lazy,
                            melancholy <pb id="VAA3931-142" n="134"/> tune to himself, a song of the
                            Señora, the Señorita, the love that was not love but hate, the happiness
                            that was not joy, but death. Before night the mountains back of Chapala
                            and the two white towers under them rose high over the boat's bow.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
                        <p>AS Don Rodrigo and his men dashed through the right wing and into the
                            town, a last shot following them wounded the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi>
                            horse. The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> himself was unhurt. There were twelve
                            of his band left. White with rage he spurred his animal on with what
                            vigor he could muster. Quiroz's cavalry not having been, in the last of
                            the fight, very well consolidated, and not expecting this dash for the
                            town, was not so rapid at following as it might otherwise have been.
                            Smothering his chagrin as best he could, though taking a fierce delight
                            in the memory of that scythe-like sweep through opposing ranks, Rodrigo
                            huddled his flying band as close together as possible, decided on a
                            tortuous gallop through the narrow streets, an exit on the far side of
                            Ocotlan, and a dash for the mountains &#151; thence escape if not
                            pursued; if pursued, it could be but by the enemy's little cavalry, and
                            he only prayed it might follow him. With what keen delight would he burn
                            in cutting down that no more than equal foe! Once away, he swore he
                            would yet raise an army that would down this rebellion. The crooked,
                            lane-like quality of the town's streets, the fast-coming night whose
                            shadows were already thick between the rows of low adobe buildings,
                            aided the flight.</p>
                        <p>This was all well enough thus mapped out. Unfortunately there was a
                            bullet in his horse. They were in the midst of the town, circling in
                            deep alleys, <pb id="VAA3931-144" n="136"/> cutting a secret, swift path
                            out of the coming night, when he felt his beast waver, quiver under him.
                            He spurred the poor animal on, and it dashed with the rest yet another
                            crooked block. Then it suddenly reeled and fell flat, giving its
                            dexterous rider barely time to leap in safety to the ground. And that
                            rider knew his enemy was pursuing him, misled by the darkness and
                            unreadiness and by the irregular lanes of the town, but not distant.</p>
                        <p>This spot where his horse fell was in a little side cut across half
                            vacant lots, where thatched huts stood placed at random. The way was
                            lined with a long double hedge of some thickly growing tropical plant,
                            and by the deep foliage of rows of mango trees. The lane was a narrow
                            shaft of dense green. The wavering of his steed had made him, ere this,
                            last of his band. The rest, save Bonavidas and two others, were far gone
                            when the beast came down and died.</p>
                        <p>"Up behind me! Quick! Quick!" cried Bonavidas, breathing heavily and
                            wheeling his horse to Rodrigo's side. The two others, weapons out,
                            waited with impatience.</p>
                        <p>"Go on &#151; never mind me!" cried the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi> "That
                            would be but to give both of us up. Go on, I tell you!"</p>
                        <p>"We won't leave the captain," said they surlily.</p>
                        <p>"Go on, I tell you &#151; I command you! Bonavidas, the rest need you
                            more than I. In the name of God, fellows, go on! I know a sure refuge. I
                            will join you on the Guadalajara road!"</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas, being somewhat of a grim philosopher, dashed off and was gone.
                            The others lingered yet a moment, which moment cost them dearly. They
                            were ordered, pleaded with by the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> and finally
                            left him. They failed to overtake their comrades. They <pb
                                id="VAA3931-145" n="137"/> were halted some distance beyond the
                            plaza, cornered and captured by Doroteo and some others. Their comrades
                            were off, galloping across fields, thence into a rocky road, thence to
                            safety.</p>
                        <p>Of the pursuers, the most ready and the leader had been the girl. She had
                            turned her horse loose after them, and he was the best animal in
                            Vicente's forces. She heard behind her Doroteo's curses and order of
                            pursuit, and her comrades coming. She was far in advance of them, and
                            wheeled the corner of adobe walls into the first street but little
                            behind Rodrigo and his men. She leaned far forward, urging on her steed.
                            Her enemy did not gain ground before her, nor, though she might have
                            done so, did she gain on him. Those quick turns and circuits that the
                            pursued made in the dusk, she too made in following. Her eyes were bent
                            always to the front that she might not lose him in the shades. She lost
                            her <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> in that wild gallop. The long, soft cloth
                            floated away behind her on a breeze and fell over the head of a naked
                            and terrified boy, who, with other townspeople, was scampering away to
                            the safety of a hut. That <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> hangs to this day in
                            a church at Ocotlan, wonderful prodigy from the heavens, miracle dropped
                            by the Holy Virgin into the streets. It is framed in gold; and the
                            priest of the church, an old man, is he who was the naked boy, and on
                            whom Blessed Mary let fall this not-to-be-mistaken or disregarded
                            summons out of the clear sky.</p>
                        <p>When the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> men came to those groves of mango
                            trees, and wheeled into the little lane whose shadows were already night
                            and whose shaft of narrow green, like a tunnel, was a shaft of black,
                            Pepa wheeled after them. What was that wavering of beast before her? Her
                            heart bounded and seemed <pb id="VAA3931-146" n="138"/> to stop. She
                            drew her own horse to a quick halt, close under the overhanging arms of
                            the trees. She could barely see the tottering shadow some yards to the
                            fore. She heard the thud when the carcass fell, and a quick, smothered
                            exclamation in a voice she knew. She was on the ground at once, silent,
                            leading her steed with the caution of her Indian ancestors, closer,
                            closer. She kept well under the thick foliage of the mangos. She could
                            not have been seen. A few moments more, and those before her, in less of
                            the shadow, were but scarcely distinguished forms. She stopped twenty
                            yards from them, heard the little colloquy, and perceived that he was
                            left there alone. While she assimilated all this, Doroteo and his men
                            were passing in eager haste by the opening of the lane. They did not
                            even see that opening, the trees at that point nearly meeting over the
                            narrow path between. The pursuers had gone by with a sweep of wind and
                            dust, and the lane was left in the deep, living silence of a summer
                            night.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo had crept through the foliage at the path's side, and lain flat
                            on the ground; the girl stood motionless, straining every nerve that she
                            might know what he did. When silence came again, he crept back slowly,
                            cautiously. She could hear twigs crackle, and finally, when he reached
                            the path and stood up, she could barely see his form. He thought himself
                            alone. The blood rushed to her head. She found herself trembling to
                            think how easily she could kill him. Something savage in her leaped up,
                            and she pictured his death. But she laughed inwardly at herself, and put
                            the vision away.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa, thou fool," she said, "it must go beyond this&#151;to despair,
                            before thou canst do that."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-147" n="139"/>
                        <p>She let him go on till he was yet farther away.</p>
                        <p>Then she tied her horse to the trees and went after him, as silent as he.
                            Before he reached the end of the lane, he crept through the foliage
                            again to the opposite side. She was fearful of losing sight of him, and
                            crept through quickly where she was. She found herself in one of those
                            marvellous, yet common groves of unnumbered Mexican fruits; where the
                            deep black shadow of the mango still reared itself; where the orange and
                            the <hi rend="i">toronja,</hi> the <hi rend="i">cidra,</hi> and the
                            lemon, hung their unseen globes; where the <hi rend="i">papaya</hi>
                            lifted its long stem and its picture-book clusters of leaves against the
                            sky; where the <hi rend="i">huele-de-noche</hi> loaded and sickened the
                            air with that ravishing scent too sacred for the day.</p>
                        <p>There was a hut on the far side and a candle burning in its doorway.
                            Beyond the hut was another lane leading into a more prominent street,
                            and the plaza was not far distant. A certain Mexican boy of seventeen
                            years was considerably astonished before eight o'clock of that night, in
                            this very grove. He was emptying charcoal from a basket to the ground at
                            the hut's door. He was wrapped in a blanket and wore a common straw
                            sombrero. He saw no shadows out under the trees but the trees' shadows.
                            But another that fell from no tree came stealthily up behind him. The
                            charcoal was falling rattlingly, dustily to the earth, when the boy felt
                            a blow that seemed to burst every blood-vessel in his head, on the side
                            of that member. After reeling and half sitting, half falling down, he
                            gained his senses. His blanket and his hat were gone.</p>
                        <p>At night, and particularly if there be dampness or the suggestions of
                            rain in air or sky, the Mexican peon covers all of his face but his eyes
                            with his blanket. <pb id="VAA3931-148" n="140"/> He wraps the whole
                            upper half of him in that garment. He has an idea, inherited with solemn
                            belief from many generations, that there is poison in night air. He will
                            sleep by dozens in one room piled thick with snoring human bodies, with
                            all doors and windows tightly shut to keep out the foul poison of a pure
                            night breeze, nowhere purer and sweeter than on the Mexican tableland,
                            and breathe as he sleeps the nauseous exhalations of his slumbering
                            family and their cousins and their mistresses and friends. And he will
                            arise refreshed, let the heavy chemicals of his night's lodgings like a
                            fog of disease out into a clear morning, and congratulate himself on his
                            sanitary circumspection. This night was cooled by a damp breeze from the
                            lake. Lightning and thunder bespoke coming rain. Hence when the
                            scurrying, frightened, questioning inhabitants of the surrendered town
                            of Ocotlan beheld a man wrapped to his eyes in a blanket and shaded to
                            his nose with a straw sombrero, walking with calm, majestic tread
                            through the street's shadows as any Mexican walks, they recognized only
                            the customary precautions of their race. A girl some distance behind him
                            attracted more attention; and some even knew who she was.</p>
                        <p>That walk was short. Two blocks from the plaza was the house of the <hi
                                rend="i">presidente,</hi>&#151;he who had surrendered the town
                            much against his will. He was not unknown to Don Rodrigo. The house was
                            subsequently torn down. There is a <hi rend="i">meson</hi> standing
                            there now. It was built round the usual inner court, but had a long,
                            narrow strip of garden, with fruit trees, extending from this court
                            through the block to a rear street. This garden was lined along both
                            sides with stalls for horses.</p>
                        <p>The muffled man came to the rear street and the <pb id="VAA3931-149"
                                n="141"/> entrance of the garden. He was cautious again, but this
                            street was very shadowed. At a corner some distance away an oil lamp
                            hung from the middle of a wire stretched from one side of the
                            thoroughfare to the other, which lamp gave a little light. The man
                            wheeled suddenly through a wooden door that gave passage to the inner
                            side of a wall which closed this end of the <hi rend="i"
                                >presidente's</hi> garden. He had been within four seconds when the
                            girl slid through after him, scarcely seeming to open the door at all.
                            She found a way of barring it after her. As she entered, there was a
                            hubbub of voices in another street, coming toward the lamp, and the
                            resinous torches of a hurrying party of armed seekers flared round the
                            corner. She heard them come nearer, and stood holding her breath. They
                            were her friends, her adorers. She crouched down and hid, and they
                            passed on, bent on some other destination.</p>
                        <p>She arose, and went on up the narrow garden and knelt again and crawled.
                            She was among cabbages and <hi rend="i">chayotes.</hi> She crept closer,
                            closer between the lines of stables, and came to another high wooden
                            door which, through another adobe wall, led into the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio</hi> of the <hi rend="i">presidente's</hi> house. She had
                            seen it open (letting through a faint light and a glimpse of trees, wide
                            verandas, and a room door) and close again as Rodrigo passed stealthily
                            on. She came to it, but did not dare to enter. She lay down with her eye
                            at a crack of some breadth that was beneath the door.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo, still swathed, crossed under trees, and by a tinkling fountain
                            in the <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> and entered under the low, tiled roof of
                            a broad <hi rend="i">corredor,</hi> brick floored. To his right and
                            behind were a kitchen, cooks moving about over charcoal fires, and a <hi
                                rend="i">mozo</hi> cleaning <pb id="VAA3931-150" n="142"/> pots.
                            Before him was a half-opened door leading into a room where a light
                            burned.</p>
                        <p>He knocked, and the <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> came to the door. The
                                <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> was a fat, bustling, nervous little
                            man. He was sore perplexed and exasperated. He peered up at Rodrigo, and
                            Rodrigo removed the blanket and the hat and smiled a curious smile on
                            the <hi rend="i">presidente,</hi> whereat the latter started back with
                            an exclamation.</p>
                        <p>"What!" cried he, with many colors and suffocated. "You! You! Oh, Dios!
                            My Lady of the Remedies! Come in! Nay, nay &#151; stay out
                            &#151; go away! Hide yourself here. I will hide you! I will not hide
                            you! Madness! Enriqueta! My wife! My wife!"</p>
                        <p>Enriqueta, with a candle and a low dress that showed an ample neck, came
                            running out. She was quizzical, critical.</p>
                        <p>"Who is it? Who is this man?" gasped Enriqueta.</p>
                        <p>"Your husband knows me," said Rodrigo, little able to brook this delay in
                            the hiding, but amused in spite of it, "and that I need protection. God
                            grant I be worthy of it. My friend" &#151; and he turned in a most
                            confiding way to the <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> &#151; "a few
                            hours of concealment, a horse in the early dawn &#151; ah &#151;
                            I see your heart warms to it. Heaven be thanked, I have fallen among
                            friends!"</p>
                        <p>With incoherency, dashing sentences, shattered exclamations, the <hi
                                rend="i">presidente,</hi> stepping about all the time as though
                            every spot on the floor burnt his feet, explained to his wife.</p>
                        <p>"Sir," said she, with infinite and severe, though agitated propriety,
                            "this house has daughters, innocent young things, brought up in the
                            customs of Spain. You cannot be in the company of my daughters. Oh,
                            José, my husband! What will we do with <pb id="VAA3931-151" n="143"/>
                            our girls? They are kept most carefully from men. Oh, skies of the
                            morning! A man in the same house! Help me, oh, my faith! in this matter.
                            Sir, this has never happened before. In this land men see not young
                            ladies in their own house. Never has a male youth so much as passed the
                            door. And I will declare, sir, that only one of my daughters has so much
                            as a <hi rend="i">novio,</hi> and him she has had but three weeks,
                            &#151; and whether he means it or not the Lord knows, though he has
                            honored my daughter by standing every night of the three weeks under her
                            balcony; and I have seen him sigh in a way that an old lady like me
                            cannot misinterpret. But it shall be months before we let him in, and
                            then only when he has given us every assurance of honorable intentions,
                            and it shall be in the presence of her mother. I am sure I do not know
                            what I shall do. Oh, my girls! Oh, my guarded offspring; guarded like
                            jewels! My husband, I cannot solve this unless you put him in Juan, the
                                <hi rend="i">mozo's</hi> room, yonder by the garden door. And, José!
                            José! have a care for the ancient Castilian sanctity, &#151; and you
                            can lock him in!"</p>
                        <p>"We can lock in the sanctity, Enriqueta, better. Let it be the sanctity
                            that is locked in!"</p>
                        <p>Enriqueta gave a slight shriek as the two crossed the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio</hi> in stealthy haste, and dived in to guard her brood. One
                            of the latter was peering out of the door, and was speedily bustled
                            away.</p>
                        <p>"Look not on him!" cried she. "In the very house! Oh a most beautiful
                            young man &#151; a most handsome one! Cobita, my love, come away! I
                            am all trembling. There will something come of this!"</p>
                        <p>The rain was beginning to drop in a desultory way when Don Rodrigo
                            entered his room. Outside the <pb id="VAA3931-152" n="144"/> garden gate
                            still lay the girl. She watched through the crack till some minutes
                            after there was anything to see. The nervous <hi rend="i"
                                >presidente</hi> had returned to the front part of his house and
                            shut himself and his family in. She arose then, and, assuring herself
                            that there was no lock on this door, only a wooden bar with its peg
                            running through to the side toward the garden, she went back among the
                            vegetables to the street. This street door had a lock with a monstrous
                            iron key sticking in it. She stole the key. She went, then, out of the
                            garden and retraced her course to the lane of mangos. She secured her
                            horse and led him to a <hi rend="i">meson.</hi> She next proceeded to a
                            store and bought a <hi rend="i">rebozo.</hi> It was a half-hour later,
                            and in a rain now somewhat disagreeable, that, having skilfully avoided
                            the eyes of the townspeople, she returned to the garden. The thunder was
                            hammering viciously at the night. A little while more, she knew, and
                            torrents would be upon her. She put damp fingers on the garden door and
                            pushed it. It was not fastened.</p>
                        <p>The terrified <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> was too careful of his own
                            safety to do else than remain in the house. He would fasten nothing. If
                            it became proved that the refugee was there, why, it would be plain the
                                <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> had done nothing to hide him &#151;
                            the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> had slipped in unawares to the <hi rend="i"
                                >presidente.</hi> The <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> had not so much
                            as taken the care to lock the door. Hence, innocent would the <hi
                                rend="i">presidente</hi> be. "Furthermore, Enriqueta, my love," had
                            the fearful soul explained, snugly enough tucked in bed as he was, "let
                            the way of escape be open; Mary be with me and rid me of this burden,
                            the sooner the better. Lock him in these my grounds?" The virtuous
                            Enriqueta had suggested some such thing, with the <pb id="VAA3931-153"
                                n="145"/> seeming desire of keeping this jeopardizer of the safety
                            of her daughters in more unquestionable security. "No, Enriqueta; give
                            him every opportunity to take his compromising presence away at any
                            moment. He knows where my horses are, in the stalls by the cabbages. If
                            he steals one and runs away (and so, Enriqueta, I have explained to
                            him), it is no business or fault of mine; it is an unfortunate theft,
                            God help us!"</p>
                        <p>The good official had retired immediately after the harrowing event of
                            the fugitive's arrival. He had completely undressed and been wrapped
                            with care in blankets. It was part of the worthy man's plot to be
                            snoring with innocent violence whatever else happened in the rear of his
                            premises.</p>
                        <p>Pepa, perceiving there was no one else in the street, entered the door,
                            closed and locked it after her, and put the key under her <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo.</hi> It was quite dark here save for the occasional
                            lightning. She crept again among the stalls to the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio</hi> door. She listened at the stables and heard the munching
                            of horses in the dark. At the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door she lay down
                            again and peered under. She was somewhat surprised at what she saw. The
                                <hi rend="i">patio</hi> was dark, as was all of the house but the
                            kitchen. Out of a door of that last apartment she perceived the <hi
                                rend="i">presidente's</hi> virtuous wife stealthily creeping with a
                            candle in her hand. The servants seemed to have departed. Doña
                            Enriqueta's face, full of a terrified, secret eagerness, was lit white
                            by the light; her ample and bare neck exposed itself to the wanton air
                            of night; her dress skirt, having been removed, left her underskirt (of
                            a very startling stripe it was) free to display fat ankles not
                            stockinged. In the lady's other hand she carried a covered dish.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-154" n="146"/>
                        <p>This apparition cautiously crossed the court. It stopped in the middle of
                            it as though hearing a noise. It went on more cautiously. The good
                            señora was like a thief in her own house. The door of the <hi rend="i"
                                >mozo's</hi> room, whereto the fugitive had been led, was on the <hi
                                rend="i">patio's</hi> opposite side under the wide low roof of the
                                <hi rend="i">corredor,</hi> and not far from the spot where lay
                            Pepa, haughtily amused, ill sheltered from the rain, looking through the
                            crack. The apparition came in under the <hi rend="i">corredor's</hi>
                            roof, tiptoe. The lady arrived, scared and trembling, with her face
                            drawn into an expression of guilty trepidation, at the door of Don
                            Rodrigo's room. She kneeled down, whereupon the lack of stockings became
                            to Pepa the most evident testimony of her presence, and she placed the
                            dish on the floor by the door; whereon, the dish rattling a trifle, she
                            became much agitated and knocked with no composure.</p>
                        <p>"Who's there!" said a voice within, a voice disguised.</p>
                        <p>"I, señor, I!" faltered she. "Here is food; and oh! for God's sake tell
                            not my husband, nor come near my daughters!"</p>
                        <p>At this she was up, candle in hand, dashing in a panic along the <hi
                                rend="i">corredor</hi> to the door that led to her lord and master,
                            and her white ankles twinkled plumply away. That door was closed and the
                            open court with its tinkling fountain and the wide tiled <hi rend="i"
                                >corredores</hi> were deserted. At that moment there was a burst of
                            thunder and the torrent, long promised, came tumbling down. The girl
                            arose and wrapped herself more closely in the <hi rend="i">rebozo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Well," said she, "I do not have to stand this."</p>
                        <p>So she slipped into the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> and under the shelter of
                            the tiled roof by Rodrigo's door. She had just <pb id="VAA3931-155"
                                n="147"/> arrived when he slowly opened it, and, not seeing her,
                            took up the dish in silence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Buenas noches!"</hi> said she, appearing suddenly before
                            him with the bright smile of a pleasant call. "I shall come in if you
                            please!"</p>
                        <p>His muscles from his head to his feet stiffened, and he all but dropped
                            the dish. He stood speechless for a moment, then he knew he must face it
                            out. So he put back a wave of brown hair off his forehead and smiled in
                            mock cordiality.</p>
                        <p>"No one more welcome," said he.</p>
                        <p>They went in and he shut the door.</p>
                        <p>"Is there a lock to it?" said she, carelessly, turning about and looking
                            with polite interest at the iron fasteners.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, no," he replied, himself looking all over the door. "It seems I am
                            not &#151; not rude enough to have a lock. Sit down. My house, as
                            the saying is, is your house."</p>
                        <p>There was only one chair in the room, and nothing else but a piece of
                            matting on which the <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> had been accustomed to
                            sleep, and a candle on the brick floor. Rodrigo set the dish on the
                            floor likewise, bowed her to the chair, and she sat down in great
                            comfort. Then she took out the big key to the garden gate and played
                            with it on her lap. They looked at each other for fully a minute in
                            silence, he standing. He believed he knew something of the possibilities
                            of this girl's nature. She was with his enemy; she had fought against
                            him to kill him. She had discovered his hiding-place; she had a key. He
                            did not know that key, but she played with it in such an insinuating way
                            that he guessed at once what it was. The situation for him was
                            sufficiently tragic. But he expressed no such knowledge in his <pb
                                id="VAA3931-156" n="148"/> face, waiting for her to say something;
                            and there she sat, looking up at him with a most meaning composure. She
                            suddenly laughed at him a little girlish laugh.</p>
                        <p>"The señorita sees fit to be amused," said he, leaning against the
                            wall.</p>
                        <p>"It was great sport," said she. "Oh, I love to fight!"</p>
                        <p>"You did well," said he.</p>
                        <p>"And you," she replied with politeness.</p>
                        <p>There was a pause.</p>
                        <p>"Your charge into Fortino's ranks," she continued, "I liked that very
                            much."</p>
                        <p>"And I too," was his reply, a little coldly. Such conversation annoyed
                            and angered him. His spirit was too sincere to carry this on very long,
                            and his nerves were strained to a great tension. Who else knew his
                            whereabouts? How soon might this beautiful devil take it into her head
                            to call her soldiers? &#151; after which, prisons or death.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said he, "I, too, was pleased with all that."</p>
                        <p>How bitterly it rankled in his free heart he did not say; nor his grief
                            over every one of his comrades that fell.</p>
                        <p>"If I had thought of it at all," she replied, "I should certainly have
                            expected to be shot." She considered this some time. "The fire was so
                            fierce and I in the front of it. It is, after all, strange that I came
                            out unhurt."</p>
                        <p>"That is simple enough," said he.</p>
                        <p>She turned quickly and looked at him.</p>
                        <p>"So?" said she, and kicked out her little foot. Her face was
                            fascinating.</p>
                        <p>"Simple enough," he repeated, looking at the <pb id="VAA3931-157" n="149"
                            /> candle-light that was growing dimmer for want of attention.</p>
                        <p>"How is that? How is it so simple?" asked she.</p>
                        <p>"Because I ordered," he replied, and paused, stooped down, and snuffed
                            the candle with his bare fingers, which were burnt painfully by the
                            operation. "I ordered," continued he in that position, "that they should
                            not shoot at you."</p>
                        <p>Her face lost its calmness and its roguishness and much of its color. She
                            stared at him long, her eyes unfathomable. She arose suddenly with much
                            hauteur. There was no doubt of the sincerity of what she now
                            uttered.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," she said, "that is it. I am a girl &#151; I am a weak woman.
                            Call me, then, a lunatic, and have it done; for to be wild and foolish
                            as I am, and yet weak, that is to be mad. If I am to prove only that I
                            can do nothing &#151; Don Rodrigo, I prefer to have your cursed
                            bullets in me."</p>
                        <p>The emotion that was rarely, rarely absent from this girl, was beating up
                            higher and plain.</p>
                        <p>"It was not because I underestimate your daring or your purposes, or fail
                            to value the nature that makes you the unusual woman that you are," said
                            he, "that I gave the order. It was &#151; well, let me say, for old
                            times."</p>
                        <p>"And this reward," she said, bitterly, "only wounds me. I have amused
                            you, is it so, in certain days gone by? A girl comes into battle and you
                            chance to recall the fact. You will be affable. There is nothing in it
                            but that. You come from another nation, a superior nation, a nation, no
                            doubt, whose soul is as white as the faces of its people, a nation cold,
                            steely. And I am weak, out of a passionate nation, one that, having seen
                            fire, must leap in. <pb id="VAA3931-158" n="150"/> And me and mine you
                            hate. It is nothing that we can follow one thought into the grave, one
                            purpose into the mouth of hell. This to the nation that coldly moves to
                            material ends is nothing. I would have given you a thousand times
                            greater thanks, had you told your men to tear me, me first, to the earth
                            and let every horse crush me as he passed."</p>
                        <p>"And this, to you," he said, "would have been the highest way to answer
                            you when you asked me what I had for you? This would have been no
                            answer. Do you think I do not know that you play with fire as a child
                            with sand &#151; are capable of any deed that your body is strong
                            enough to carry out? You come to me here to-night and prove it, which
                            proof I do not like. Are war and death and this infernal torture of my
                            defeat only things to be chatted about as people chat while the band
                            plays in the plaza &#151; that you come and talk it over as though
                            it had been a bull-fight or a game of ball wherein we had chanced to be
                            antagonists?"</p>
                        <p>"And this is the way you take it?" said she, standing looking at him
                            fairly. "I am cold and heartless; I can speak of battles like
                            bull-fights. My blood never leaps &#151; my heart never burns or
                            aches &#151; I cannot understand the meaning of death. No; I am come
                            of a savage ancestry that slew human sacrifices to stone gods. And even
                            now, doubtless, to you the wildcat is degrading herself. She is piqued,
                            she pleads for old days; she would call up promises. I am not such," she
                            said sadly. "Promise there is none. You never said, I love you
                            &#151; neither did I. I have hated you oftener. I have come merely
                            to see, to have it burnt into me, how you look on me &#151; because
                            I am capricious, not to be trusted, liking to do odd things and have
                            power, <pb id="VAA3931-159" n="151"/> liking to look here on the key
                            that locks the garden-gate and to remember that the adobe wall is
                            fifteen feet in height."</p>
                        <p>"And you lose sight of the most prominent fact, that you are in the ranks
                            of my enemies. An hour hence, when you are tired of playing with me or
                            when I have unwittingly piqued you some other way, you may give me over
                            to those who seek me."</p>
                        <p>"Unless you kill me first," said she. "No other knows of your presence
                            here. If they come and break down the door, it is of their own
                            finding."</p>
                        <p>"If they came," was his response, "I wonder how you would fight."</p>
                        <p>"I wonder also," said she simply. "I have brought no weapon."</p>
                        <p>He began to understand her mood.</p>
                        <p>"Half wild you are," he said. "I shall not disgrace you by calling you
                            anything else. Feel myself and my civilization above you? Heaven forbid!
                            I accuse you of pleading nothing, of calling up no promises nor caring
                            to. I know you are as unfettered as though there were no body encasing
                            your impetuous soul."</p>
                        <p>"And for being here," she asked, her face burning, and her hand on his
                            arm, "I am a traitor, is it not so?"</p>
                        <p>He said nothing for a moment, a moment in which, not knowing it, he held
                            her soul, as it were, in his hand.</p>
                        <p>"You are not a traitor," he said slowly. "You are a free spirit."</p>
                        <p>He had no more than said it when he blamed himself for the words. Many a
                            time, months, years after that night, the blame returned, and remorse
                            lived with him. It would not be possible to say with complete <pb
                                id="VAA3931-160" n="152"/> fulness just why he answered her thus. It
                            was not haste; he had time to think. Doubtless it was the desperation of
                            his circumstances. That he was hiding within a few hundred yards of many
                            enemies; that they were searching for him to kill him; that she was, or
                            had been, one of them, and could give him over to his fate at any
                            moment; these were not the half of the thoughts that flashed over him.
                            The rest were: Kings shall not, cannot succeed in America. This was a
                            ground principle of his most sacred belief. Fate had cast him to crush
                            this dreamer who would be king. The part might seem small enough in a
                            nation's history &#151; but it might, too, be infinitely great.
                            Seldom had a revolution a better set of circumstances. The situation
                            seemed to him almost desperate. In all this, what was the duty of him,
                            the leader of the opposition and a republican to the core of his being?
                            Let no hasty judgment condemn him if he decided that any sacrifice
                            should be made. So he told her that she was no traitor, and called her a
                            free spirit. And considering her nature, her ancestry, the philosophy
                            that civilization advances and that barbarism cannot know &#151; who
                            can say he lied? She was at least true to her poor, torn heart. The die
                            once cast with him, he must play the game out.</p>
                        <p>"I have believed in you," he said," as I have believed in few women. I am
                            sorry you are my enemy. With an ally such as you anything might be
                            possible."</p>
                        <p>"Anything," said she, with a pathos as natural as was the beating of her
                            heart, "but a return to the old days. That is not possible."</p>
                        <p>He stood taller and looked at her. There had been, there may now have
                            been, deep emotion in him raised by this girl. He had been fascinated,
                            moved <pb id="VAA3931-161" n="153"/> to his heart's bottom, wrapped in
                            her life as a lake is wrapped in the light of the summer sun. The
                            passion had been sudden, hot. He had held it with a grip of iron, but it
                            had showed itself. He had felt it unreal, not lasting. Even in the
                            height of it he had doubted her. In the strain of his situation and its
                            desperation, looking at her now when she said that, the old fire came
                            somehow into his face. He was handsome then and every feature was lit
                            with the fire. He made no reply in words; he only (consciously or
                            unconsciously, let a higher truth be his judge) let his eyes speak
                            &#151; and she was broken.</p>
                        <p>She stepped to him quickly, the blood leaping to her face, took his hand
                            with a sudden convulsive sob, and cried:</p>
                        <p>"Trust me &#151; trust me when the time comes!" She was immediately
                            pale to her very lips, turned and ran out, and was gone; out of the <hi
                                rend="i">patio</hi> door &#151; on through the black garden
                            &#151; on to the dim lit street &#151; away &#151; away.
                            When she turned, the meaning of her words came on him, and the remorse.
                            What had his face encouraged her to do? What great sin was he, in that
                            one silent moment, guilty of? He ran after her. He called her name. He
                            must reach her. He must call her back. He must tell her it cannot, shall
                            not be, that if he cannot win it alone without this sin from her, then
                            let him rather die, there, now, with defeat branded on him. Pepa! Pepa!
                            Perhaps she heard him and feared to lose that silent promise. She was
                            gone in the garden's blackness. He went stumbling on after her, seeing
                            nothing. The rain was beating down in torrents and the thunders were
                            rolling their battles of the sky. He came toward the street door and a
                            flash of lightning lit all the rain-drenched walls and stables and the
                            dripping <pb id="VAA3931-162" n="154"/> plants at his feet. It showed
                            him, too, the door in the high adobe wall closed after her. He ran and
                            opened it and the street was empty. He turned back, in the blackness of
                            the drenched night. And at some time before midnight, aided by the storm
                            and by the fact that Vicente's little force was too small and
                            unorganized effectually to guard every avenue of the town, he made his
                            escape on the <hi rend="i">president's</hi> horse, galloping through mud
                            and water, wet to the skin, away to the mountains and the stony
                            Guadalajara road, his steed struggling and slipping, his blood burning
                            hot. Thus on this night did Pepa Aranja fall, and did Don Rodrigo commit
                            a sin.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER V</head>
                        <p>WHEN the first glimpse of dawn came in the east, the wet soldiers were up
                            and drying. A light breeze blew from the rising sun, the lake glistened
                            and danced, and there were naked backs and naked legs, white clothing
                            spread in the sun to dry, laughter and song. There was cooking, too, by
                            men and women; and, before seven o'clock, there was an hilarious feast.
                            Death lost its terrors. Shadows went away with the night. Fighting was
                            the sport of men, the red blood of existence. And with victory and a
                            crushed antagonist behind, hope and little resistance before, high was
                            the spirit of the army.</p>
                        <p>Of the eight hundred of the fight, more than seven hundred were ready for
                            the march. To these, during the night, had come recruits. The first
                            victory inspired many in the town with the desire to be part of the
                            next. The news spread to the surrounding country, and at daybreak came
                            still others &#151; sowers, charcoal burners, ox-cart drivers,
                            fishers &#151; all dissatisfied with a plodding, barren existence,
                            ready for a change and the wine of excitement. At breakfast there were
                            more than eight hundred. The new recruits were given largely to Fortino,
                            whose ranks had suffered most heavily. When Doroteo brought him
                            Vicente's order to that effect the great burly fisherman was much
                            moved.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-164" n="156"/>
                        <p>"I swear I am not worth it," growled he. "I am more fit to carry the
                            corn."</p>
                        <p>"I take it," said Anastasio, "that you will carry enough as it is. I have
                            sat here dazed at the amount of it, my appetite gone like a shirt in a
                            high wind. If I can figure, you have stowed inside of your carrion corn
                            to the amount of three <hi rend="i">almudas.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"Sixty cents worth!" cried Francisco, putting his naked legs into white
                            trousers not absolutely dry. "Nigh five <hi rend="i">reales</hi> has
                            this traitor eaten up in pure silver and in the days of famine!"</p>
                        <p>Fortino replied nothing. Still depressed, still honestly self-accusing,
                            he turned blackly to his horse.</p>
                        <p>A vital change in the condition of the troops was being effected as
                            rapidly as energy and money could accomplish it. All those who joined
                            were urged to come mounted if horses could possibly be obtained. Runners
                            were that morning sent out in the direction the army was to take to call
                            the people to arms, and, above all else, to secure horses. Some good
                            animals were obtained in Ocotlan, two of which were turned over to
                            Francisco and Anastasio. The cavalry numbered fifty-three when the army
                            left that place.</p>
                        <p>Before the start Vicente rode among the men, crying out words of
                            encouragement and greeting. They were beginning to feel that respect and
                            sympathy which victory and a silent mien will many a time inspire in an
                            army for its leader &#151; which continued success deepens into
                            love. They cheered him, standing up and waving sombreros. He took off
                            his own to them and rode on. Then, riding slowly out of the town, her
                            steed seemingly proud of its burden, her red dress dry again, and her
                            beauty <pb id="VAA3931-165" n="157"/> fresh as the morning air she rode
                            in, came Pepa. They had been watching for her. The cheer began and rose
                            and spread, till it became deafening. She rode slowly along all the
                            line, bowing and smiling at them. The enthusiasm doubled and was wild.
                            She was now, irrevocably, the genius of the army. Emotion, playing free
                            here in these troops, had enthroned her as the spirit of victory. She
                            carried her part proudly, and the cheer continued when she had
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>Thus, they being flushed with triumph, the march to the east in the early
                            morning began. The marshes near the shining lake, the reeds, the
                            cornfields and the meadows about Ocotlan, were passed. Bright they were
                            in the light of an autumn day; and even the lessening adobe walls shone
                            golden in the sun. The townspeople, still stupefied at these strange and
                            quick running events, came to the town's edge and watched the column go.
                            The <hi rend="i">presidente</hi> came too, early as it was. And behind
                            him came Enriqueta. Enriqueta stopped at the end of the last street,
                            held her hand to shade her eyes, and stared eagerly out across the
                            fields to the departing troops.</p>
                        <p>"Oh! they have not got him, my husband," murmured she. "They have not
                            caught that beautiful young man!"</p>
                        <p>And she turned back to her barred-in daughters &#151; who knows with
                            what sighs in her virtuous Castilian bosom over the quick riddance of
                            that menace to her household?</p>
                        <p>Thenceforward, for six shining days, only triumph met the advancing
                            troops. News of the victory, of the coming successes, changes, golden
                            times, spread speedily in all directions. The army arrived at no <pb
                                id="VAA3931-166" n="158"/> point to which the fame of its march had
                            not come before it. All along the way the poverty-stricken people of the
                            country, the ragged children and the sullen men, crowded to see. They
                            looked with awe on that strange woman who rode before, and with wonder
                            and admiration on the man who should come to be a king. On the whole,
                            they were not displeased with the idea. Many villages received the
                            victorious band with open arms, such opposition as they contained
                            fleeing as the band came. Even some of the officials and police,
                            disgusted with a government that had bandied them about like straws,
                            paid them when it could and let them starve when it could not, joined
                            the new cause.</p>
                        <p>Round all the lake's eastern end there was no power of resistance
                            sufficient to organize itself and strike a blow. The little army grew at
                            every step it took. Ragged, gaunt prospectors and hungry sowers of corn
                            threw away tools and came down out of mountains to be a part of this
                            unhampered progress. The loose population of many towns joined in and
                            swelled the cheers for Vicente and la capitana. Wherever the army halted
                            there was plenty for it to eat, arranged for secretly between clergy and
                            messengers sent before. And in every town the priest was Vicente's
                            friend and helper. It was the priest who made him familiar with every
                            resource of the place; who did more than any other ten men to the
                            success of the expedition; who persuaded the holders of corn, reluctant
                            to sell on credit when the cash was wanting, that the speculation was
                            safe. Thus was the good-will of the people always maintained. Pillaging
                            was instantly punished. Order was improved and made a necessity. The
                            undercurrent of power which came always from <pb id="VAA3931-167"
                                n="159"/> the church did not make itself outwardly noticeable. But
                            it was a never-failing force such as Vicente alone could rightly
                            measure, bearing him and his hopes on to the end. He knew, too, who it
                            was that most nearly personified that force. Many a time he burned to
                            break his long silence regarding his unknown hermit benefactor. But he
                            held his peace.</p>
                        <p>From eight hundred his forces grew to a thousand, to twelve hundred, to
                            fifteen hundred, to two thousand. The vigilance in search of horses was
                            not abated. In those days, as now, the country was dotted with mammoth
                                <hi rend="i">haciendas</hi> or ranches. Some of them are many
                            leagues square, containing hundreds of all sorts of domestic animals and
                            raising enormous crops of every grain and fruit known to the
                            semi-tropical climate. Near the easternmost point of the lake lay one of
                            these. It was called the Hacienda of the Good Faith. Its owner, a
                            Spaniard, long since disgusted at the throwing off of the Spanish yoke,
                            hating the half-governments that had staggered successively and broken
                            under the burden since the end of Spanish reign, took it into his heart
                            to belie his place's name and play bad faith with existing
                            circumstances. Spain being an impossibility, he hailed a king, any king,
                            with delight. He received word, before the arrival of Vicente, of the
                            need of horses. He burst into glee, swore he would lose his soul for
                            such a cause, and, forgetting how his ancestors had trampled with an
                            equal enthusiasm the very government from which Vicente was descended,
                            scoured the adjacent country, drained it and his own lands of what
                            horseflesh there was to be found, and, on the coming of Vicente, clapped
                            him on the back with an oath, put <pb id="VAA3931-168" n="160"/> himself
                            on familiar terms with the leader most odiously, and turned over
                            scarcely less than seven hundred horses to the little army.</p>
                        <p>The gift was not to be despised. It was a godsend. The cavalry had
                            already been increased to nearly three hundred; they numbered now a
                            thousand. Few, indeed, were the recruits from this half wild people who
                            could not ride, and ride well. If there were no saddle, then they could
                            ride without saddle. The high spirits of the men, having increased
                            steadily since Ocotlan, burst out. The Spaniard was carried on
                            shoulders, dropped, left on his <hi rend="i">hacienda,</hi> and,
                            possibly, forgotten. And the army went on.</p>
                        <p>It rounded the irregular points and bays that make the lake's eastern
                            end, and gradually turning westward again proceeded straight along the
                            southern coast. When they should have traversed more than half that
                            coast they should arrive at the town of Tizapan, Doroteo's native place.
                            Doroteo had promised the army a royal reception there.</p>
                        <p>Pepa, during this triumphal passage, was the same unreadable Pepa. There
                            were times when she was gay and her laugh rang out like a bird's note.
                            She would be the embodiment of a wild joy for hours. She would gallop
                            along the lake's edge, singing as she went. She would thread her way
                            among the towering rocks that narrowed the path, in untamed mood. But
                            her good spirits seemed not altogether natural. During these days the
                            eyes that watched her most constantly, like the eyes of a cat, were
                            Doroteo's.</p>
                        <p>"There is mental fever in that happiness," said Doroteo to himself.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the time, however, she was <pb id="VAA3931-169" n="161"/>
                            gloomy. This, too, was unnatural to her. She rode at times all the day
                            slowly in advance of the troops, wrapped in melancholy. She would speak
                            to no one. She did not laugh or sing. She would not even turn to look at
                            them. If any rode up and saw her face, it was clouded, and she grew
                            angry and ordered them not to speak to her. She arose on certain
                            mornings from such beds as Vicente had been able to secure for her or as
                            she had secured for herself, with the strained look of the eyes that
                            marks one who has not slept. Then on those days the presence of others
                            irritated her. A change had come over Pepa. Those near her saw it,
                            wondered at it. She was inscrutable. Most of all she was restless.
                            Nothing, nothing satisfied her now.</p>
                        <p>The column was one day advancing round an arm of the lake at its
                            southeastern shore. The mountains here descended almost to the water,
                            their peaks towering, rocky, overhead. The path at their feet was
                            narrow. The girl was in front, Vicente following her closely. Doroteo
                            and Fortino, leading the cavalry, were behind them, and the horse and
                            foot wound a tortuous way at the lake's edge. Pepa had been silent all
                            the day. Vicente spurred to her side. There was barely room for the two
                            horses, his being next the water.</p>
                        <p>"Your love for me," he said gently, "is deep and true; is it not so?"</p>
                        <p>She turned her head and looked at him. This riding in sun and wind, and
                            this continued hardship of an army's life, seemed only to have increased
                            her beauty. It was her true sphere.</p>
                        <p>"You have never doubted it?" she said, speaking unusually low.</p>
                        <p>"No. Yet true love turns first to the one it loves, <pb id="VAA3931-170"
                                n="162"/> brings every burden, tells every thought and feeling. Then
                            why are you changed, Pepa? What is it that has come over you? I have
                            watched it hour after hour. You are not the same. We are bound together
                            in so deep a destiny, and every step we are taking now means so much,
                            that there should be knowledge, harmony between us. From a dream it
                            takes on some little of the form of reality, though it be only begun.
                            And I can let my mind go on and find you a queen. Then it is vital to me
                            that something is changing you. What is it?"</p>
                        <p>She went on in silence, pale. After a time she looked up at him
                            again.</p>
                        <p>"I think," she said, "it is because I have of late finished the changing
                            from being a girl."</p>
                        <p>"Then thank the waters and the mountains," said he, with some relief,
                            "for they made you as you are &#151; a daughter of them."</p>
                        <p>They had come to the end of the narrow passage and the road was wider.
                            She suddenly gave him that old dazzling smile and galloped away far
                            ahead of him, spurring ever more swiftly; and she sang:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"Slender and strange that vessel was, and bright,</l>
                            <l n="2" rend="ti-1">Bright with the sacred serpent's glittering
                                scale.</l>
                            <l n="3">A thousand skins their million points of light</l>
                            <l n="4" rend="ti-1">Flashed from its sides all crystal clear and
                                frail,</l>
                            <l n="5" rend="ti-2">That its unearthly ray,</l>
                            <l n="6" rend="ti-2">Lighting the fog-drowned day,</l>

                        </lg>
                        <p>He followed her with eyes in which there was coming a sadness. Much as he
                            hated doubt, scorned suspicion, loved faith, Clarita's words would come
                            to him. Clarita had been afraid of her.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz too was watching her. It chanced after a <pb id="VAA3931-171"
                                n="163"/> time that, having gradually advanced some distance in the
                            army's lead, he overtook her.</p>
                        <p>"There is fever in the gazelle's eyes," said he, coming close. "She rides
                            madly. She spurs and halts and spurs again. Ah, it is weighing on her, a
                            burden in the breast. Pepa, a hundred thousand moods, each more
                            beautiful than the last, I swear to God have I counted in you in the
                            last four days!"</p>
                        <p>She did not repel him as she often had done. She smiled at him, too, the
                            dazzling smile.</p>
                        <p>"Heartburns!" she cried mockingly, and laughed a light laugh.</p>
                        <p>He wheeled his horse against hers.</p>
                        <p>"Yours are not the first or the last," said he, his eyes gleaming on her,
                            "or the only heartburns. You can move heaven and earth. I have told you
                            so a dozen times before. It is not the right nor the dreams &#151;
                            it is blood like yours that does, and daring like &#151; well, I
                            have been said to dare. Remember; there are other heartburns than
                            yours."</p>
                        <p>High rocks at a turn in the road here hiding them, he was dazzled then by
                            the expression of her face and her unusual action. She put out a quick,
                            hot hand and placed it half roguishly on his as it lay on the saddle's
                            horn. Whether it was his fancy or not, he believed she pressed his
                            fingers with hers; and she dashed away feverishly, throwing a flash of
                            the eyes over her shoulder. She left his blood leaping like fire in his
                            veins.</p>
                        <p>At noon of the fifth day they arrived thus, having increased still more,
                            at a town called Jiquilpan. There was a little body of recruits promised
                            from the mountains here. There was a messenger to arrive from the
                            monastery. There were more horses <pb id="VAA3931-172" n="164"/> to be
                            secured and a more thorough organization of the forces to be
                            accomplished. For Vicente believed that before many days his enemy would
                            have returned. He decided to remain in Jiquilpan, drilling his troops,
                            the rest of that day and all of the next, making straight for Tizapan on
                            the day after the morrow. Tizapan, he had told Doroteo, seemed always to
                            hang in his mind as an objective point, a place of meaning.</p>
                        <p>"Why?" asked Doroteo.</p>
                        <p>"I do not know. That place, its very name, has weighed on me from the
                            first. Who knows? Rodrigo may meet us there. I want to enter it in
                            better condition."</p>
                        <p>"He will have to ride like the son of the devil if he does," said
                            Doroteo.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
                        <p>TO travel by night those rockbound ways over the mountain ridge that
                            separates the lake from the leveler regions about Guadalajara, is to
                            make a lonely journey, let the night be beautiful as it may. By
                            starlight the way is uncertain and full of gloom; the peaks are vast
                            shadows against the sky, the ravines are hollows of unknown depths and
                            mystery. If there be a moon, the scene is an enchanted one. Crags rise
                            misty white at every turn; shrubbery stands a formless mass melted into
                            gray continuity; from the summit of a ridge distance unmeasured
                            stretches out before one, limitless, moonlit, drowned at last in the
                            white silence leagues upon leagues away. But if there be one of those
                            swift night storms hurling himself across the mountains, the way is, in
                            spite of that diabolic company, more solitary still. The peaks are sheds
                            to pour the water in torrents down upon the path. The thunders roar and
                            crash, fighting the crags and bursting in fury over the answering
                            ravine. The evil spirit of the lightning rips the blackness with a
                            sudden blinding glare of its unholy passion.</p>
                        <p>Beating his lonely way through a night like this rode a horseman. He had
                            his teeth ground together, his sombrero low over his face, his hair,
                            unkempt and wild, wet with rain. His horse, apparently accustomed to
                            such journeys, cared not at all for the lightning or the thunders. It
                            went steadily, desperately on, cutting its way into the thick of the
                            storm, stumbling <pb id="VAA3931-174" n="166"/> now and then, but making
                            sure progress. And to the rider the storm mattered little. Was the way
                            solitary? He and his soul were more solitary still. Was the blackness
                            like that which succeeds a burnt-out passion of the heart, the death of
                            hope? He had carried that blackness in him, was carrying it still, had
                            walked with it through the course of years. Was there no cessation of
                            the lightning's blinding tyranny, devilish glee, over his unanswering
                            spirit? Likewise had his heart grown callous to tyranny.</p>
                        <p>The hours of riding thus had little measurement, little meaning to him.
                            It may have been midnight, or earlier or later, when, having passed the
                            ruggedest portion of the way and issued out of those mountain jaws, he
                            turned at length into the more open road that leads over plain and
                            through valleys to the distant city. Hardly had he done so when he heard
                            upon that road footsteps out of the deep night behind him. He did not
                            turn, only instinctively shrank into himself and went on. The sound at
                            length was nearer, the approach of a horse that followed. The lightning
                            flashed out and he heard the animal behind him suddenly shy, it having
                            caught sight of the rider before. Then the darkness was there again and
                            the rider before and the rider behind kept on in their uncongenial
                            course.</p>
                        <p>He before, from long habit unmoving, expressionless, and from long
                            necessity cowed with a kind of buried desperation before men,
                            involuntarily urged his horse on the faster. He lost at length the sound
                            behind him. Then another flash lit all the wide, irregular valley and
                            the peaks cut clear against the glare. And the horse behind came nearer,
                            trotting a quick trot. The first rider, suddenly thrilled with a
                            sensation like unreasoning fear, spurred on and <pb id="VAA3931-175"
                                n="167"/> trotted likewise. There was a half-hour of this, the one
                            unchangeably following the other, the first shrinking like a criminal as
                            he rode.</p>
                        <p>The last rider, fugitive as he was, did not shrink, nor was there in him
                            any of the feeling of the cowed or the hunted. He had been startled to
                            see the other suddenly before him, where previously there had been no
                            one. The lightning had shown him the rugged path opening into his
                            smoother one out of the mountains, along which the other must have come.
                            That other path, he knew, could lead only to Chapala or to some portion
                            of the more easterly shore. Something in the mysterious apparition's
                            manner suggested stealth to the follower and his coming thus in the
                            night's middle from that region roused all the follower's alertness.
                            This might be some messenger of his enemies. Hence he spurred up as an
                            experiment. The other, seeming, by the intermittent glares, to crouch
                            upon his horse, spurred up also. So the trot before and the following
                            trot were continued, the first with some unknown habitual dread, the
                            last with relentless purpose. The storm was passing and the rain was
                            lighter. The flashes, too, were less frequent. The road being now more
                            secure, he in front dug spurs into his steed and galloped. The muscles
                            of his face were drawn like cords, and his ears strained to catch the
                            sound behind. The dreaded change was not wanting; the horse behind broke
                            also into a gallop. The dread of the first rider changed into a
                            burdening fear. He was no longer capable of sharp terror. Into his
                            strange mind came the query, why should he fear? &#151; what was
                            there in all the earth to cause dread to him? No matter. Dread had grown
                            to be a part of his daily life. It was the first habit of his mind. So,
                            needlessly, as a matter of course, <pb id="VAA3931-176" n="168"/> he
                            fled, and the relentless beat of hoofs followed him. He ground his teeth
                            still more, leaned over his horse's neck, and spurred on faster. His
                            pursuer spurred to equal speed. An hour of this and the horses were
                            panting. Fancying the other's pursuing pace slackened, the first rider
                            drew sullenly in and his horse trotted slowly. The clouds were passing
                            and there was the faint light of a more ordinary night. The second rider
                            drew in also, and the slow trot of the one kept pace with that of the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>The first animal regained his wind and its rider, listening always to
                            that remorseless beat, beat of the hoofs behind, regained his causeless
                            dread. There was no inconsiderable portion of the journey still before
                            him. To listen to that following tread thus calmly all the way! He
                            spurred on again into a gallop and the other followed. The gallop grew
                            faster and faster. Out from the flying clouds suddenly broke the morning
                            star in the east, brilliant as it is in these semi-tropical altitudes
                            only, a mammoth jewel, a crystalline moon. The speed of the first rider
                            had increased still more. It was now a mad course. And he who followed
                            kept the distance between always the same. Nearing the city after an
                            hour of this strange race, the course was like a flight of panic. It was
                            on a run, as though life itself were the stake, that the outlying huts
                            were passed.</p>
                        <p>When the city's streets were reached, the first, as though struck with
                            reason or shame, drew up to a more moderate pace. The other did
                            likewise. The gray of dawn was beginning to appear in the east. The
                            first rider made a circuit round the outskirts. Under other
                            circumstances the follower would not have pursued that course. He would
                            have made straight for the town's centre. But he pursued it <pb
                                id="VAA3931-177" n="169"/> now. The first light of day was coming
                            faintly into the narrow streets when the two arrived thus at the great
                            walls of the monastery. At their beginning the first rider spurred up
                            yet a little more. He flung himself to the ground and beat loudly on the
                            massive knocker at the gates, the other seeing faintly his tangled hair.
                            While the door was being opened he who had dismounted, hearing the
                            following horse close at hand, could not resist the temptation to throw
                            a hasty glance over his shoulder &#151; it was the fascination
                            induced by his dread. Then he went in and the door was closed, went in
                            carrying his gloom and his solitude with him &#151; to be still
                            under the weight that made him more like a fleeing beast than a man.</p>
                        <p>In the moment of that backward glance, the following rider had perceived,
                            by the faint coming day-light, the face of him he followed. He rode on,
                            wondering at its monstrous hideousness.</p>
                        <p>"At least," said he at last, shaking himself free of his thoughts, "that
                            little chase has brought me here an hour or so in advance of my
                            calculations. A good honest storm this was, and I am much misled if the
                            most covered part of my shivering skin is not the wettest."</p>
                        <p>An hour later the sun came up, the city began to stir, and all the
                            streets, sprinkled by hand and swept in small sections by bunches of
                            broom-straw, awoke yellow and clean into another day. The rider, having
                            found accommodations for his horse and himself, dry clothing and a
                            breakfast, strode away at seven o'clock to the main plaza. He had made
                            himself sure of the arrival of his escaped companions. He knew the empty
                            barracks they would be likely to occupy. He had found them there, every
                            man sound asleep, <pb id="VAA3931-178" n="170"/> exhausted. They had
                            arrived three hours before him.</p>
                        <p>In the plaza was a freshness not even rivalled in the mountains, a
                            glistening of glossy leaves, a swaying of fruit, the beauties of masses
                            of flowers. The two pointed towers of the great cathedral pierced a sky
                            than which Ægean's own could not be bluer, and wherein were no traces of
                            the storm that was. The bells of the clock on the long white government
                            palace were multifariously proclaiming the hour when the visitor entered
                            the wide doors beneath them. He knew the governor had a habit &#151;
                            rather an astonishing habit in this land of the late beginning of
                            business &#151; of coming to his office and laboring alone very
                            early in the morning. A peon sweeping the stone hall let him in and
                            knocked for him at the governor's door. The governor opened it.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo!" he cried with a thrill of anxiety, and led the visitor in
                            and closed the door &#151; a weary, stiff visitor, needing rest and
                            sleep, but determined and alert still.</p>
                        <p>At the period at which this history has arrived, the accomplishment of
                            desirable political facts, whatever their nature, was impeded by
                            hindrances to which it is difficult to do full justice, the labyrinths
                            of which it is not always possible to comprehend. That evil genius that
                            presided over the series of fatalities attacking the many Mexican
                            governments, nothing appeared to satisfy. It did not suffice that the
                            Republic had passed through, was passing through, gave every evidence of
                            a continuation in passing through, every kind of political disease,
                            exhausting throe, fatal paroxysm. These have been hinted at before. In
                            the midst of these must come menaces, attacks, defeats, from without, to
                            supplement ambition, undermining, <pb id="VAA3931-179" n="171"/> and
                            treason within. A huge and over-shadowing country to the north, inspired
                            by unworthy motives, answering the pressure brought upon her by a party
                            desirous of increasing the party power and the territory wherein that
                            power should be dominant, had declared war on its puny neighbor. The
                            slave principles, being then dominant, launched the army. A slave-holder
                            led it. After fifty years it is not easy to find a historian who does
                            not condemn that war &#151; for the slave power is dead. In the late
                            spring of the year of this narrative, namely, eighteen hundred and
                            forty-six, General Taylor crossed the Rio Grande and invaded Mexican
                            territory. In September, shortly before the events described in the
                            preceding chapters of this book, the city of Monterey, garrisoned by an
                            army of nine thousand Mexicans, was besieged by the American general
                            with an army of seven thousand. For several days the place held out,
                            giving to Worth his opportunity for that gallant capture of the
                            Episcopal palace on the hill. The nine thousand gave up to the seven
                            thousand. General Ampudia retreated to San Luis Potosi. The Americans
                            were coming on to the capital. Furthermore they were sending another and
                            a greater force to Vera Cruz. It was vital that Taylor be crushed at
                            once before Scott should sweep up from the Gulf. This was the news which
                            had arrived at Guadalajara not long before Rodrigo's return. And in that
                            city, as in every other city of the Republic to which the news had come,
                            there was agitation.</p>
                        <p>With these tidings came summons from Santa Anna. He was to leave his
                            government at Mexico in the hands of Farias, his vice-president. He was
                            to march at once in person, at the head of the Mexican army, against
                            Taylor. He needed and would <pb id="VAA3931-180" n="172"/> have,
                            imperial old despot as he was, every soldier that could possibly reach
                            him on his march. Guadalajara, the largest city save his own, should do
                            her utmost. She had been drained &#151; drain her again. She was
                            threatened with disaster at home &#151; the disaster from abroad was
                            more threatening. Santa Anna set out from his capital boldly, little
                            knowing it was only for a worse than useless march, to culminate in the
                            bloody defeat of Angostura &#151; leaving behind him dissent,
                            insurrection, the "Polko" attack on his unsupported government, having
                            before him the coming disastrous winter, Scott, Churubusco, humiliating
                            amputation of that great north limb of his country.</p>
                        <p>So when Don Rodrigo put in his strong plea for men and showed that
                            growing danger on the lake, there were other calls for the soldiers he
                            so much needed. Were there any soldiers? The governor, foreseeing this
                            need long, and pressed at last to superhuman effort by the news of the
                            Monterey disaster, was raising a force. How large? He shook his head: a
                            pitiable two hundred. Cavalry? Ay, cavalry &#151; not all raised
                            yet, promised partly from other towns, to be sent off as soon as
                            possible to join Santa Anna. The good, but not altogether statesmanlike,
                            executive was in his usual torn state of mind. He found himself now
                            between two dire necessities. Rodrigo declared his was the better cause,
                            brought in all his verbal artillery, grew warm and desperate, swore the
                            men by every right that danger created should be his. The exasperated
                            governor, forgetting for once his friendship for the other, lost his
                            temper. He cursed Rodrigo, Santa Anna, the United States, life, and
                            Heaven. Rodrigo considered this excusable, but declared again for the
                            men. It were better, said he, to strike an enemy at the door than to run
                            away to a <pb id="VAA3931-181" n="173"/> distant one. The governor
                            accused him of partiality to the northern invaders.</p>
                        <p>"Your blood will be boiling up in their support," said he. "This
                            whirlwind will carry you, too, Rodrigo, my friend in distress, away to
                            fight against your adopted country."</p>
                        <p>"Impossible &#151; absurd!" broke in Rodrigo. "The United States can
                            take care of itself; at all events, it needs not me. That war, thank my
                            luck and some purple dashes in the landscape of the past, is none of
                            mine. I would not be a part of it so long as there are corners of this
                            untamed land to bury myself in. I am occupied with a little war of my
                            own, and I tell you plainly it is not so little as it seems. If you
                            value your State and your safety, in the name of reason give me whatever
                            weapon you have, to strike again, and give it to me now. Your two
                            hundred men cannot vitally influence the fate of Santa Anna; hasn't he
                            enough of your fighting blood already? They may do vital work here. I
                            honestly believe two hundred good fighters can crush this uprising
                            now."</p>
                        <p>"Why, you young hothead," said the governor, "you are advising the
                            executive of a State to disobey the order of his superior; to refuse to
                            respond to the call of his country!"</p>
                        <p>"Very good," said Rodrigo, innocently unconscious of his inferior
                            position; "that is the way patriotic speeches put matters. I put it
                            thus: I am advising you to send what force you have to crush a danger, a
                            real, live, immediate danger at your door, and to think, then, of the
                            more distant one whose progress your little band of cavalry can neither
                            aid nor retard. Besides, you know enough of this country to understand
                            that in any wind you totter &#151; and the government that seats
                            you. Defeat or victory for Taylor, <pb id="VAA3931-182" n="174"/> Santa
                            Anna's government will go down with the next revolution, and you with
                            it. Santa Anna will not come to upbraid you with laxity; he will be
                            engaged in catching the ruins of his power as they fall. Politically,
                            you die shortly; so does every other officer in this swift-moving
                            kaleidoscope of governments. At least while you live do the good deed of
                            defending first your own State."</p>
                        <p>Thus did the argument continue; and, much to the chagrin and nigh
                            unbearable nervousness of Rod-rigo, it continued not merely through that
                            day, but through several days. Meanwhile, the governor neared
                            prostration, Santa Anna was marching to defeat, and Vicente's victorious
                            progress was going on. Several causes contributed to this exasperating
                            delay. The little troop of two hundred, small as it was, was not yet
                            gathered; though, in the eternal Mexican spirit of delay, it was
                            promised. There is an unalterable, to a pessimistic philosopher a fatal,
                            inertia in this nation. To do a thing promptly seems out of the province
                            of its activities. Furthermore, the governor's very doubt made matters
                            slower, for a man sure of his purpose goes more quickly at it than one
                            in doubt.</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas on the second day, renewed in strength and appearing
                            refreshingly emaciated (for that appearance did truly seem a necessary
                            accompaniment and indication of good health in him, he, when exhausted,
                            assuming a puffiness about the large eyes and in the grayish cheeks that
                            might have been taken as indicative of a bettered
                            condition)&#151;Bonavidas, praised and recommended by Rodrigo, added
                            his persuasions to the <hi rend="i">jefe's.</hi> He also went hard to
                            work, as did some of his companions, hastening the gathering of the
                            force. He even rode to towns at a short <pb id="VAA3931-183" n="175"/>
                            distance. On the evening of the third day he astonished the governor by
                            bringing in a detachment of ten unexpected and unpromised recruits. He
                            had raised them up from the dead, said Bonavidas with an uncanny
                            grin.</p>
                        <p>According to a calculation afterward proved erroneous, it seemed fast
                            nearing the time when all aid would be useless to Santa Anna. This
                            Rodrigo saw. His exertions at persuasion suddenly ceased. The governor
                            had fallen of late into a species of political trance. Word was one day
                            passed to Rodrigo's men to lie quiet till the next. This was done. The
                            governor, at length positively ill, did nothing that night. The
                            following morning Rodrigo brought him a map of what he believed to be
                            Santa Anna's route, &#151; a map of the route a force from
                            Guadalajara must take to join him, with the days marked.</p>
                        <p>"It is impossible," said Rodrigo, with a pleasant sparkle of the eye.
                            "They can't reach him now if the Americans blow him some leagues
                            nearer."</p>
                        <p>The governor ran all his fingers madly through his hair, &#151; and
                            Rodrigo's cause was won. Owing to the accumulation of delay after delay,
                            the force was not ready to start till the morning of the sixth day. That
                            day dawned bright and dry. Rodrigo and his little band of escaped
                            warriors had come to be like brothers. The twelve others were as eager
                            to be at the fight as was Rodrigo himself. They regarded the war as
                            personal property, &#151; a fine little private trouble of their own
                            wherein glory and victory awaited them on the margins of the lake
                            &#151; and revenge, too, fascinating goddess as she was. Two hundred
                            and twenty-nine horsemen, including Rodrigo, Bonavidas, and some
                            lieutenants, started away in spirits tuned high to the harmony that
                            there may be even in war.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
                        <p>THE <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> men did not direct their course at once to
                            Chapala. After crossing the divide they made a slight angle to the west.
                            Rodrigo was ignorant as to the present whereabouts of Vicente. He
                            conversed with Bonavidas and others on the journey, hearing their
                            opinions. He himself believed the revolutionist must have arrived by
                            this time at some spot on the lake's opposite shore. He did not believe
                            it would be so far west as Tizapan.</p>
                        <p>"With a good gait," he said, speaking to a soldier familiar with the
                            lake, "how much time do we need to overtake him at a point some twenty
                            or thirty miles east of Tizapan?"</p>
                        <p>"If we wanted to be in condition to fight after it," was the reply, "I
                            should say we could do it in three days. And that would mean heavy
                            riding."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo shut his jaws and rode on meditating. It was then that he wheeled
                            off to a path that leads to the lake a little west of Chapala.</p>
                        <p>"Are you going to circle it in the opposite direction?" asked Bonavidas.
                            "Not bad! The distance, I should say, is the same either way. We will
                            meet him."</p>
                        <p>"Bonavidas," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> "I am making straight for
                            Ajicjic. That is six miles west of Chapala. On this road I can reach it
                            almost as soon as I could reach Chapala, perhaps a half hour later. It
                            is already past noon. We shall reach the lake by <pb id="VAA3931-185"
                                n="177"/> three o'clock. In Ajicjic I can learn something of Vicente
                            &#151; as well there as another place. The news of his army will
                            have spread. Well, there are two ways of reaching the opposite side of a
                            lake. You can go round it or you can &#151;"</p>
                        <p>"Cross it!" broke in Bonavidas with an amazement that had a chuckle in
                            it. "But, save your soul, man, cross it with two hundred animals! In the
                            name of the saints, did you ever hear of an attempt like that on
                                Chapala?&#151;<hi rend="i">canoas</hi> &#151; low roofs
                            &#151; miserable vessels. Why, they would n't hold six horses
                            apiece. Dead, that is where the Republic's honorable army would be, in
                            the lake's oozy bottom."</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas smiled at his conceit, and his gaunt face expressed no such
                            objections as did his words.</p>
                        <p>"I can put more than six in some of those vessels," said Rodrigo,
                            determined, "if I have to pile them one on the other. Suppose he had
                            come as far as Tuxcueco. We could cross, at the slowest, in ten hours.
                            This is better than three days."</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas whistled long and low, and went on in dazed mood. Then he
                            suddenly clapped his leg. with his hand and broke out:</p>
                        <p>"We will!" cried he. "This is Sunday!"</p>
                        <p>"Which I have remembered," said Rodrigo, "and on Sunday Chapala's beach
                            is crowded with <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> for market day. I am going
                            first to Ajicjic that, if the news be right, I may begin at that point
                            gathering up ships, thence gather them all the way back to Chapala.
                            Hence, a sail on the foam. Poetical outlook!"</p>
                        <p>An eager delight lit the unhealthiness of Bonavidas' countenance. They
                            were riding over a rough trail with cacti and stones about, and here and
                                <pb id="VAA3931-186" n="178"/> there a flock of goats. To the right
                            was a seemingly endless chain of mountains, to the left, more distant,
                            rose St. Michael, low and round (behind whose bulk lay Chapala and the
                            water), and the larger head, called Angostura, lying between that town
                            and Ajicjic on the lake's edge. Between Angostura and the opposite
                            mountain chain the road led, rising to a hill, to whose summit the
                            little army came. They looked down on the lake and, nearer, small
                            irregular fields, scores of them, checkering a level stretch from
                            mountains to water. Out of these, Ajicjic's church thrust up a single
                            gleaming tower of white. Three o'clock found the troop sweeping into the
                            barren plaza of that fishing village.</p>
                        <p>To this day Ajicjic can claim no more than some two thousand souls. It
                            has, even yet, no railroad, no stage; rarely has a vehicle been seen in
                            that primitive place other than the awkward ox-cart. Its low,
                            unplastered adobe walls stand close together. The streets are alleys of
                            extreme narrowness wherein there is mud when it rains, dust when it is
                            dry, rocks and swine forever. Nigh every alley twists and turns, is for
                            a block no more than a gutter, for another block a public stable for
                            burros. Yet one may find some better quarters. The plaza, though it is
                            only a bare, brown waste, is wide. The open court before the church,
                            though it too is bare and dirty, with lonely, crumbling walls and
                            pillars about it, yet has in its centre a weather-beaten cross that
                            speaks of service to the Lord.</p>
                        <p>The troop filled the plaza. It was halted, and the inhabitants of the
                            town, struck with amazement, either shut themselves up or gathered in
                            silence round about. Groups of brown children, absolutely <pb
                                id="VAA3931-187" n="179"/> naked, sat down in the dirt, thumbs in
                            mouth, to wonder in comfort. Rodrigo and Bonavidas began the inquiries,
                            prefacing them with jocularly expressed friendship to certain
                            storekeepers and a toss of <hi rend="i">tequila</hi> here and there down
                            a willing throat. Boats? There had n't come but one boat to Ajicjic the
                            blessed day. Ajicjic was losing importance in these times. On market
                            days everybody went to the bigger market at Chapala, where the news was
                            dispersed. And this one boat? It had come from Tizapan with a load of
                            wood for the lime burners. Its captain, an ancient and withered Indian,
                            was sought out and refreshed with drink. <hi rend="i">Si,</hi> he knew
                            of Vicente. It was said the day before in Tizapan that Vicente and his
                            army had arrived at Jiquilpan and were coming. This was made very clear.
                            How big was the army? Oh Lord! it was large. But <hi rend="i">how</hi>
                            large? The bewildered old barbarian had no idea of numbers. "Very many,"
                            said he, satisfied with his information. But how many? "Oh, a hundred
                            thousand!" cried he, much put to it; "and I don't care what be the
                            government so it lets me alone &#151; Mother of the Lord! let it
                            leave me alone; this is all I want of the government!"</p>
                        <p>The government did not leave him alone. His <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> was
                            taken. Rodrigo treated him kindly and promised him no harm should come
                            to his vessel; it should be turned over to him on the morrow. The old
                            owner wailed over this; he would go wherever his ship went. Rodrigo
                            agreed. He could cross with them, but the vessel should be taken and at
                            once. So two of his soldiers were detailed to help pole it to Chapala;
                            for as yet there was no wind.</p>
                        <p>The rest rode out of the town and made away toward the latter place,
                            scanning the shore. The <pb id="VAA3931-188" n="180"/> lake was as still
                            as the rocks. Its glassy surface threw up the beams of the lowering sun
                            like a mammoth mirror. Every mountain peak hung his shadow, clear and
                            blue as himself, in its depths; and below those hanging summits lay a
                            mock sky as fathomless as its counterpart above.</p>
                        <p>"This is damnation for a wind," said Bonavidas.</p>
                        <p>"Out of that stillness a wind will come at dusk from the west," replied
                            Rodrigo, "or, at most, a little later. Till we are ready it cannot
                            remain too still."</p>
                        <p>The road led round a wide bay. A far point, extending yonder into the
                            water, marked a division from which both Chapala and Ajicjic could be
                            plainly seen. There are a few huts on this point, and the place is
                            called San Antonio. There are brick-kilns there, and this was the first
                            spot since leaving Ajicjic where <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> were found.
                            There were five of them lying on the many-tinted waters, their masts
                            wrapped tightly with the sails. They had come to be loaded with brick.
                            But Sunday is not a day to work &#151; nay, it is a day to loll in
                            the nearest market town, particularly if there be news. Here in this
                            peaceful, primitive, fishing region, people feared not thieves. The
                            vessels were deserted; the brick-kilns smoked, attended by one boy only.
                            Soldiers were detailed for these <hi rend="i">canoas,</hi> and the five
                            were brought on (pushed with long poles always provided for these
                            craft), along the edge of that next broad curve across whose shining
                            surface, three miles away, Chapala's walls crouched under St.
                            Michael.</p>
                        <p>Somewhat disappointed at having found, thus far, but six vessels, Rodrigo
                            proceeded with all speed to Chapala. The loading &#151; hazardous,
                            quixotic, unheard-of <pb id="VAA3931-189" n="181"/> plan as it was
                            &#151; must be done before the wind came. The stillness so common to
                            the afternoon during the dry season usually became roughness at
                            nightfall. His men, apprised of the bold intention of their leader,
                            liked the novelty of it. This is the spirit, said they, that wins. They
                            cheered the news. The very difficulties and dangers of the project
                            recommended it to Rodrigo. To gain two days and a half by that quick,
                            unexpected stroke, was to him to do a deed the idea of which filled him
                            with delight. He pictured to himself the queer fleet lumbering into
                            Tizapan ahead of his enemies. He vowed in his heart he would beat
                            Vicente at Tizapan or go down in the attempt. He knew one or two animals
                            had sometimes been brought across the lake in these vessels. If one
                            could be brought, why, let the thing expand &#151; go to, let us do
                            an oddity. Originality gains much. We will sail with two hundred and
                            twenty-nine! He laughed within himself exultantly.</p>
                        <p>"I am a boy again," said he, "sailing wooden butter-dishes on the
                            pond!"</p>
                        <p>Now, at the century's end, navigation by modern means is just beginning
                            to appear on Chapalac. There is one old steamer full of vermin and
                            rickety, exceedingly small. She fell over once in the water and drowned
                            many passengers. There is a new steamer talked of. The Hon. S&#151;
                            C&#151;, Her British Majesty's ex-consul general to Sweden, has a
                            little yacht that skims these waters. Otherwise the shipping is the same
                            that has conducted the primitive lake commerce for hundreds of years. At
                            the time of Rodrigo's daring deed (talked of yet in all that section of
                            the State) the only vessels were the <hi rend="i">canoas.</hi> One can
                            see them there to-day exactly <pb id="VAA3931-190" n="182"/> as they
                            were in the old times. The largest may be sixty feet in length by
                            fifteen broad. They are flat bottomed, seldom measuring six feet from
                            water to thatch. They are pitched black without. Over nearly one half of
                            the vessel there is a pointed thatched roof. Some of them to-day have
                            roofs of boards; there were none of that sort then. From the floor's
                            middle stands the single mast with a pulley in its top. One long yard is
                            hoisted to the mast's summit by rope and the pulley. To the yard is
                            attached the single square sail. This canvas is often phenomenally
                            large. It extends, when spread, far out beyond the sides of the boat, a
                            mammoth expanse of glittering white, lacking the beauty of the more
                            graceful sails of a yacht, employing the one plain principle of more
                            surface, more progress, but sometimes adorned with the vessel's
                            fantastic name painted in black across all the shining extent.</p>
                        <p>The speed of these craft is of course not high. Never, since the lake
                            came into being, has there been cause for haste here. The wind must be
                            pretty well behind; there is little of the science of tacking; there is
                            never such a thing dreamed of as sailing against the wind. The rudder is
                            a large wooden one, operated by a horizontal handle extending over the
                            boat's stern. Three sailors are ample allowance. Two can manage a vessel
                            if the weather is fair and there is no third. There are known some
                            heroic cases in which one person has sailed a <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            alone. When Cortes built his vessels in Tlaxcala, carried them across
                            the mountains, and launched them, to the Aztecs' consternation, on the
                            lake where the Aztec capital stood, he did what is agreed to have been
                            an astounding thing. It is only an instance of the fickleness of history
                            that <pb id="VAA3931-191" n="183"/> Rodrigo's less astonishing but
                            similarly original deed should be in no record. It lives only in the
                            minds of the lake people, who alone know the capacity of their boats and
                            the difficulty of managing a fleet of them.</p>
                        <p>Chapala was in her gayest colors on this day. Her market place, even at
                            four of the afternoon, was crowded. There had gone a thrill along all
                            the lake's borders at the news of the Battle of Ocotlan. This being the
                            first market day since the fight, Chapala, then the commercial capital
                            (and sufficiently removed from the present seat of war) was crowded with
                            eager gossipers. Hence, when Don Rodrigo and his cavalry suddenly rode
                            in on the scene, there was intense excitement. Before that force the
                            town was at its leader's mercy. He soon received confirmation of the
                            news regarding Vicente. He even received better information of the
                            number he must fight. It seemed there were between one and two thousand
                            horse now in Jiquilpan. A seriousness settled over his men when this
                            became known. Rodrigo sat his horse in silence and looked them over,
                            slowly. They read his mind, rallied round him, threw up caps with
                            cheers, and swore to follow him into the jaws of death.</p>
                        <p>He rode then to the beach. His expectations were not unfounded. This
                            busiest of all commercial days brought thither many vessels. They stood
                            in a long line, sterns to the shore, on the glassy water. Some lay
                            anchored farther out. The western sun, casting his yellow glare over all
                            the motionless lake, threw shadows of masts, black lines in the
                            yellow.</p>
                        <p>They were speedily counted.</p>
                        <p>"Nineteen," said Bonavidas.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-192" n="184"/>
                        <p>"And six from Ajicjic and San Antonio," replied Rodrigo. "Twenty-five.
                            Not enough. We must have thirty at the least. Bonavidas, go, you and
                            thirty men. Ride east for not a minute longer than half an hour. Chapala
                            is on a right angle that juts into the lake. Ride yonder and you will
                            strike water again. There are sometimes boats there. Seize every vessel
                            you find and pole it to the bluff at the foot of St. Michael. You can
                            return before I have succeeded in packing these poor fish into those
                            boxes."</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas and his thirty men rode away.</p>
                        <p>Where the rocky hill that stands over Chapala laves its foot in the water
                            there was, and still is, a ledge of rocks. The road led over this rise,
                            and the ledge, immediately at the shore, was a little cliff six feet in
                            height, rising perpendicularly out of deep water. The place is now much
                            altered by blasting and civilized improvement. On the very spot where
                            Rodrigo loaded his vessels (a spot some hundreds of yards west of the
                            stretch of beach and the famous old <hi rend="i">salati</hi>) there now
                            stands a beautiful modern villa. Times, even here in inert Mexico, have
                            changed!</p>
                        <p>A proclamation was speedily issued to the people. Every <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa</hi> capable of crossing the lake with a horse was to be
                            temporarily confiscated to the use of the government. Care should be
                            taken of them. They should be at the owner's disposal the following
                            morning. Those owners who so desired might send one man each or
                            themselves go, to accompany the boats. Such cargo as the vessels
                            contained would better be at once unloaded. There was amazement at this
                            beyond all saying. The crowd was thunder-struck. What impossible deed
                            did this <pb id="VAA3931-193" n="185"/> portend? There was some
                            grumbling. There was more curiosity. Rodrigo's ever-ready manner and
                            diplomacy won some favor. There was a scramble for the boats, and a
                            hasty pitching out upon the sand of such fruits or vegetables or rude
                            furniture as they contained. Hence, willingly or unwillingly, whether
                            they cursed or laughed, with two hundred armed cavalrymen looking
                            complacently on, the shippers gave up their property.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo despatched his men to the vessels, the horses being herded on the
                            beach. There was a hilarious removal of sandals and shoes and a rolling
                            up of trousers, shouts, jests, boisterous fun, and a splashing of water
                            and climbing to boats.</p>
                        <p>"Now," cried Rodrigo, "all hands to poles &#151; and may the Virgin
                            give us two more hours of calm!"</p>
                        <p>Rude little row-boats went scudding out to such <hi rend="i">canoas</hi>
                            as lay at a distance. Brawny arms and backs were strained at the poles.
                            Brown legs moving along the upper side ledges of the vessels swelled
                            with exertion as the great hulls glided slowly over the mirror of the
                            lake. In half an hour they were halted in line at the bluff, where the
                            ledge of rock, high as the boats' sides or a trifle higher, was only so
                            wide as to permit the loading of three vessels at once. The town was
                            scoured for timbers. Heavy planks fifteen feet in length were thrown
                            from the rock to the sterns, and the bridges were made. The work was
                            done with feverish energy and in what order the haste and the novelty
                            permitted.</p>
                        <p>"They can cross the bridge easily enough," said a soldier. "But they
                            cannot get under the roofs."</p>
                        <p>"Then tear the roofs away," said Rodrigo.</p>
                        <p>Hammers and timbers for levers were speedily at <pb id="VAA3931-194"
                                n="186"/> work. One by one the thatches were torn off and thrown
                            aside. A groan went up from the crowd of townspeople at this. It was not
                            to be helped. Rodrigo grimly directed the work. He had the power in his
                            hands; he had entered on this course. It would have taken a bloody
                            protest to make him abandon it. The horses meanwhile had been fed. They
                            were now watered at the lake's edge.</p>
                        <p>Out of the <hi rend="i">meson</hi> Clarita had come. She had seen all and
                            knew the purpose of it. With only the light of her eyes, the slight pink
                            flush of her face, and the absence of her dimples hinting what she felt,
                            she crossed the plaza toward St. Michael. In a crowd of townspeople,
                            going in that direction also, she was but an unnoticed unit. She made no
                            haste. She was joined, as she entered the street leading to the ledge of
                            rocks, by Pepa's mother, who came running after her. Pepa's mother was
                            worn to thinness with worry over her daughter.</p>
                        <p>"My girl will be brought home to me dead," murmured she, gloomily.
                            "Clarita, I have seen it in twenty dreams."</p>
                        <p>Clarita did not seem to hear. Neither did it appear that she saw Pepa's
                            mother or any of the crowd. She was quiet and dignified, where others
                            ran and were turbulent. She left the crowd before she reached the ledge
                            of rocks where Rodrigo was, and to which the horses were now being led
                            by threes and fours. That wonder of an insane deed made others crowd
                            about the spot &#151; her it kept at a distance. She went through an
                            open <hi rend="i">patio</hi> of a house she knew that stood at the base
                            of the little mountain. The walled court was empty, and its many
                            pomegranate trees were as still as painted ones. She sighed heavily and
                            crossed to the rear, <pb id="VAA3931-195" n="187"/> feeling as deserted
                            as this lonely court. She came out of the rear wooden door and found
                            herself at the mountain's lower rocks. Then she began to climb. The
                            mountain side was steep and strewn with boulders. It was covered, too,
                            with shrubs and flowering plants. She rose gradually, and was above the
                            roofs of the houses, so that all the town was like an irregular floor of
                            flat red tiles, the lake half surrounding it. It was as though she stood
                            on an island. She saw Bonavidas and his men riding to the northeast a
                            mile away. She saw a few <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> in that direction too,
                            round the far side of the cape on which Chapala stands.</p>
                        <p>It was not at these she cared to look. She climbed still a little higher,
                            and then went round on the mountain side till she stood just over the
                            ledge of rocks and the crowd of people. Then she watched it all. From
                            the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> and his men, the scrambling horses and the
                            distrustful crowd, she turned her eyes many times across the lake to the
                            southeast. Tizapan, Jiquilpan, lay there where those distant, hazy peaks
                            rose out of the water. Oh! that it were not so many miles across that
                            shining mirror, that she might, at least, see!</p>
                        <p>The loading of the first <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> began with vigor and
                            haste. Looking back from this distance on that time, and remembering the
                            slow movements of Mexicans, the strangest feature of the day is the
                            rapidity with which the man concluded his unusual task. The horses were
                            left saddled and bridled. There was to be no extra space for saddles in
                            these boats. The bridge of planks being laid from rock to stern, the
                            first horse was led across. He stopped in the middle, terrified, and
                            pulled back. He was cajoled, and finally dashed at the boat snorting,
                            men <pb id="VAA3931-196" n="188"/> before him pulling and men behind him
                            pushing. Other shorter boards were slanted within the vessel from the
                            high stern to the floor. The inclination was necessarily extreme to
                            leave the boat's naked bottom unencumbered. The animal, dashing in as he
                            did, instead of running down this last decline, slid. He arrived at his
                            destination with some of the skin removed from his hind legs, so that
                            his owner cursed viciously. The beast, trembling and flinching, was led
                            as far fore as possible. Across the bows and some distance toward the
                            vessels' middles are heavy staying timbers, too low for a horse to pass
                            under. Hence all the snorting cargoes must be crowded in the spaces aft
                            of these timbers, &#151; spaces comprising three fourths of the
                            boats. The horses were placed sidewise. It was found their heads, in
                            some instances, were high enough to permit their looking over into the
                            water. As so unusual a sight may terrify an animal naturally sensitive
                            as a good horse is, in many cases it was found necessary to replace the
                            halves of the thatches, fastening them perpendicularly instead of
                            inclined, to the boats' sides. The horses thus blinded were more
                            quiet.</p>
                        <p>That effect of skinned legs was repeated with exasperating frequency. It
                            made no difference to Rodrigo. The wounds were slight. He urged the
                            loading on with an indomitable energy and goodwill that inspired similar
                            qualities in his men. There was frequently much trouble. One horse,
                            having started across the planks, broke suddenly back through the crowd
                            with something like a scream, jerked him who held the bridle into the
                            water, and dashed away not to be caught. Others struggled and kicked.
                            But two hundred men ready <pb id="VAA3931-197" n="189"/> at hand can
                            accomplish much. Certain beasts were literally carried across the
                            bridge.</p>
                        <p>Thus the work went on, three vessels at a time. The three being filled,
                            each was manned and poled into the lake, and others were brought up.
                            Beasts were packed in some like cattle in cars &#151; in some,
                            tighter. There was occasionally a scuffle of loaded animals within and
                            the noise of an equine dispute. Still the bare-armed men pulled and
                            pushed, yelled and beat and persuaded, till each unwieldy bulk slid with
                            a thud to the boat's flat bottom. Nearly every minute Rodrigo looked
                            away to the west and scanned the regions of the setting sun. That sun
                            came down huge and red, and little clouds along its course lit a score
                            of colors. The air was yet as silent as the peaks.</p>
                        <p>"It will come," cried he, "and it comes quickly. On with it! Ah,
                            Bonavidas &#151; what luck?"</p>
                        <p>"Found five," said Bonavidas; "they are coming. I have found, too,"
                            continued he, "another thing."</p>
                        <p>He leaped from his horse. At that moment, pushing their way through the
                            crowd up the little ascent, came some of Bonavidas' companions bringing
                            a man in their midst.</p>
                        <p>"I found this fellow under suspicious circumstances," said Bonavidas,
                            pointing at the prisoner. "We were wading through a marsh at the lake's
                            edge, something over two miles from here round the point. There was a
                                <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> pulled up there in the mud, looking as
                            though it had n't been used for months. There were three big rocks
                            there, too, that made a corner. By St. Thomas, there was a saddled horse
                            standing hid in those rocks! The place is wild, and there is n't a soul
                            living for miles. So it was queer. We got the horse, waded out, <pb
                                id="VAA3931-198" n="190"/> and went into the boat. When we jumped in
                            this person leaped up out of a sound sleep. Well, I was taken aback at
                            his face. I can take a plain grave or a dead body or a good honest
                            murder and never flinch. But this man's countenance having the looks of
                            all three, and yet living &#151; I was taken aback. So, after
                            glaring at me like a goblin, he suddenly jumped over into the water and
                            made at the rocks. He was after his horse. The horse wasn't there and I
                            ordered a chase, and we took him. He acted like a caught rat. Said I, He
                            may be a messenger of the enemy hiding till dark. So I took him. There
                            was a little boat that I think was his, tied at the rocks, oars and sail
                            and provisions. When I questioned this man he acted deaf. He acted
                            crazy, too. He fell flat down and grovelled like a slave; then he got up
                            and that hellish face of his looked damned troubled, and he kept
                            pointing out over the water. I said, 'Come on, Señor Inferno, we'll to
                            the captain. I am somewhat of a skeleton myself'&#151; Ha! ha! So
                            here he is, and the horse and the provisions."</p>
                        <p>The creature thus described shrank like a slave indeed in the midst of
                            his captors. He might formerly have been a man of good size. He now
                            looked withered, crouching. His manner was like that of one come out of
                            the dark, one having been buried away for many years, who sees day and
                            hears voices and has nature and humanity about him for the first time,
                            and is dumb and afraid. They urged him on to the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi>
                            and he came, cowed and sullen. He was so still that, in that evident
                            dumb dread, one expecting him to tremble would have observed with wonder
                            the stillness. He pushed back his sombrero, showing long matted black
                            hair, and raised his face <pb id="VAA3931-199" n="191"/> to Rodrigo. The
                            brow and the eyes were those of a man of superior intelligence, but in
                            the latter there was no light. The chin, too, would have been strong and
                            firm, but that a distortion extended even to it. From the right corner
                            of the mouth almost to the ear stretched a great scar drawing all the
                            skin of the face's right side into revolting ugliness. Rodrigo was
                            somehow made silent by the vision. He knew he had seen that face, and
                            where. He remembered the long night of his escape and the figure he had
                            followed, the glimpse of the face at the monastery. To have seen it once
                            was never to forget it. Long since he had been assured that there was
                            some vital connection between that very monastery where Vicente had been
                            educated and the revolution. His suspicions of the man were at once
                            deepened. He must hold him prisoner. But he was softened in his
                            presence, like one who hears the hollow ravings of the insane and feels,
                            settling over him, a consciousness of the insane's blackened life. After
                            a moment's silence the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> said:</p>
                        <p>"Tell me who you are, friend. You shall not be hurt. If you cannot speak,
                            can you at least hear?"</p>
                        <p>The figure suddenly stooped down to the sand of the road and wrote in it
                            with his finger:</p>
                        <p>"I am nothing. Let me go. He will starve."</p>
                        <p>"Who will starve?"</p>
                        <p>He arose, and pointed across the water to the east.</p>
                        <p>"Crazy," said Bonavidas.</p>
                        <p>At this the dull eyes of the stranger grew lurid. He turned to Rodrigo
                            and went down on the ground again, raising his hands and distorting his
                            face still more. Then he went through in a kind of panic the most
                            indescribable movements of pleading.</p>
                        <p>There was no time to lose; and it were better to <pb id="VAA3931-200"
                                n="192"/> keep this prisoner. He might be some clever actor, an
                            enemy, and a messenger. But where to keep him? Chapala's friendship was
                            uncertain, and the jail was broken open, some prisoners having escaped
                            with the aid of friends since the withdrawal of the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe's</hi> men. There was but one thing to do, and the decision
                            was quickly made.</p>
                        <p>"Search him and two of you guard him. I will take him with me across the
                            lake," said Rodrigo.</p>
                        <p>Feeling as though he had come out of a bad dream he turned away to his
                            work. The man was searched and nothing found. He was led to the foot of
                            the mountain and kept there.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the loading had gone steadily on and the noise of it was the
                            noise of scrambling beasts and shouting men and laughing spectators. The
                            sun neared the horizon and all the west was ablaze. The vessels from San
                            Antonio arrived at five o'clock, poled slowly along the shore, their
                            pointed prows cutting the motionless lake like steel and their dripping
                            poles gleaming. At that hour the work was not half done. The five
                            additional vessels Bonavidas had discovered in his two mile journey came
                            in at half-past five.</p>
                        <p>"Bonavidas, you are my friend in need," said the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi>
                            "We are thirty sail now, if my old Indian from Ajicjic arrives before
                            the wind knocks this rickety loading scheme into impossibility. Hurry,
                            boys! Pray for yet another hour of calm."</p>
                        <p>As he spoke, round Angostura point nearly two miles from the west came
                            floating the black hull and slim mast of the only vessel that lacked.
                            There was a cheer at sight of it. It seemed now nothing could prevent a
                            happy outcome.</p>
                        <p>"Unless," said Bonavidas, "the wind comes not, <pb id="VAA3931-201"
                                n="193"/> and we are left hanging out, boxed up with a lot of horses
                            in a dead calm. Pleasant night would that be."</p>
                        <p>The two boats now being poled to the ledge Rodrigo knew. They were the
                            "Delirium" and the "Goddess Venus." As usual Doroteo's men had brought
                            their cargoes of fruit. The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> smiled a grim smile
                            at those vessels, remembering their owner, his feline manner, his
                            pointed moustaches, his animal ferocity in the fight.</p>
                        <p>"I can confiscate these," said he, "with a good conscience."</p>
                        <p>Ten horses were crammed into the "Goddess" and eight into the little
                            "Delirium," which could with difficulty hold even that number.</p>
                        <p>The girl, high up on the mountain side, still watched it all. They had
                            brought that crouching prisoner thus; would there be another prisoner on
                            the morrow brought so before his captor? If such should be, thought she
                            sadly, he will hold his head more erect than this. Two hundred and
                            twenty-nine horsemen she counted &#151; two hundred and twenty-nine.
                            How happy they were! How eager they were! Strange, strange world it is;
                            over that which is laughter to some, others, alas, must weep! She had
                            never felt so lonely; she had never seen all the earth so homeless. At
                            least the lake, the lake that was the mother of them all, might be her
                            friend. Perhaps it would bring no wind. She looked again and again
                            across the miles of water. It was to her as though she were at fault for
                            not piercing that distance and seeing under those peaks. She grew
                            restless. To see them preparing; to see them go; to watch them long,
                            long &#151; lessening sails, darkening sky, rising waves; to lose
                            them at last yonder in <pb id="VAA3931-202" n="194"/> the distance where
                            her brother was; to find herself alone in the midst of night, the army
                            gone to seek him, the darkness and the silence only for her, and the
                            bitter dreams of the things that would happen there under the southern
                            peaks. To watch one's own army with one's own blood in it march away,
                            this many a woman knows to be a bitter thing. To sit thus in calm and
                            see your blood's enemy prepare his forces, laugh over the future that
                            hangs so heavily over you, and to be unable even to go to the scene of
                            the fight, this, too, is a bitter thing.</p>
                        <p>"Oh Holy Mary!" said she, clasping her hands on her knees, "how am I to
                            sit thus and see them go!"</p>
                        <p>She, too, watched the west. She prayed, almost holding her breath, that
                            there where the mountains lowered and rounded the narrow western end
                            with blue, she might see no white mist. She was fearful when she looked.
                            It became pain to look. But her fears were of no avail.</p>
                        <p>Few are the spots where the sunsets are such as these. The red ball came
                            to the mountain's summit and seemed to rest a moment as balancing
                            himself on that jagged line of porphyry, glaring, a monstrous eye of
                            fire that poured light over all the lake till the thirty vessels,
                            outraging the region's majestic peace, were thirty burning coals in the
                            red flood. The great circuit of peaks round all the two hundred and
                            fifty miles of the water's circumference lit a thousand fires. That
                            porphyry gleamed with every shade of color from dazzling white, to
                            emerald, to blue, to purple, to the red of red blood. Fleecy clouds
                            glistened with the tints of shells: vapor banks in the west towered dark
                            with blazing edges. Streamers of flame lay stretched over the zenith.
                            Even the east answered with fleeting fires.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-203" n="195"/>
                        <p>The red ball was gone and the fires were fading. She put her hand for the
                            twentieth time over her eyes and looked away to the west. And the white
                            mist was there &#151; the mist she knew &#151; far away, fleecy,
                            beautiful; but to her it was another and a heavier grief. She knew the
                            wind was coming.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo saw it too. Nearly every evening from September to June, while
                            the dry season lasts, the wind comes up from the west. It usually
                            arrives at sunset or a little after or a little before. It is sometimes
                            much later, and rarely it comes not at all. He had counted on something
                            near a certainty. His heart bounded when he saw that mist. There were
                            six boats left to load and the one from Ajicjic was near at hand. He
                            spurred his men on to double efforts. The knowledge of a quickly coming
                            wind was like wine to them. The first three of the six <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas</hi> were brought up. The white mist was a little larger and
                            a little whiter. There came, out of the midst of the sunset's beauties,
                            a little breeze. It struck the cheek with a sudden coolness. And as
                            suddenly as a pebble might have stirred it the water crinkled like
                            crêpe. The breeze continued dallying, wonderfully light. The mist came a
                            little closer and then suddenly dispersed. Then the wind was therey
                            blowing black hair about sweating faces, cotton skirts about the limbs
                            of women, dust from the road. The crinkled water rose of a sudden in
                            small waves, and the vessels were lifted a little and sank.</p>
                        <p>The one from Ajicjic arrived and the loading of the last three was
                            entered upon. The waves from this time increased gradually and not
                            slowly. This last loading was very difficult. The planks rose and sank
                            irregularly, the vessels heaved, the horses made trouble. But a stern
                            determination entered the men. <pb id="VAA3931-204" n="196"/> Twenty or
                            thirty soldiers seized each ship and literally by main force kept it
                            from demolishing its bridge or dashing itself against a rock. The beasts
                            were hauled, pushed, carried, half thrown into the <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas.</hi> With a final ringing shout the thing was done.</p>
                        <p>The girl on the mountain could no longer sit where she had been. She must
                            stand. There was in her now a restlessness such as she had never known.
                            The wind was there; a little more and it would take them all away. She
                            mechanically counted the vessels loaded. Not all had been necessary for
                            the horses. The rest were for the men. By systematic and daring packing
                            Rodrigo had made those clumsy barks average a capacity of ten animals
                            each. He had thus used twenty-three <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> for the
                            horses. Each of these carried three soldiers besides, in many cases, the
                            owner or owner's agent. This left one hundred and sixty-one men,
                            including Rodrigo and his prisoner, for the remaining seven vessels, in
                            itself a somewhat reckless proportion. Yet these seven were thus less
                            burdened than were those that carried the horses. Clarita saw the seven
                            brought, rolling some-what, near the beach or the cliff, and the men
                            rushing for them. She saw, too, Rodrigo in the last light of the day,
                            standing on the rocks directing them.</p>
                        <p>She had known him long. This misguided man, thought she, has been my
                            friend. He is my enemy now, but he has a kind nature. She stood a moment
                            more, wretched, her heart throbbing. The peaks were the
                            same&#151;the unknown morrow. Could she stay and see it, remembering
                            Vicente's wishes, her promise, the danger? To her the question was not
                            would she stay &#151; rather could she? Was it possible to crush her
                            heart like that? The waves were rising, the men were climbing in. She
                            saw it again, the <pb id="VAA3931-205" n="197"/> vision of them going,
                            the lessening sails, the disappearance, and the blank blackness left to
                            her. She prayed then a little to the Virgin Mary, caught her skirts, and
                            went as fast as boulders would let her down the mountain. She came
                            running breathless to a boat at the rock. The men were all in save those
                            who held it from beating on the little precipice, and the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe</hi> himself. He was preparing to enter this one that rose and
                            fell on the waves. The spray dashed over her dress. They had put the
                            long planks to the stern. The bridge was fearfully unsteady. She passed
                            Rodrigo like a quick flying shadow, ran across the heaving timbers and
                            was within.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo was astounded. He ran in after her, calling her. She would not
                            reply&#151;because she could not, and dared not even turn. She went
                            on the boat's bottom away to the bow, as though she felt he was pursuing
                            her. He came, too, calling to her gently. She was shaking, then, from
                            head to foot and went down on her knees in the bow and sobbed. The last
                            of the soldiers speedily embarked. There were more than twenty men on
                            board. Rodrigo strode ahead of them and came to her. Whereat she turned
                            suddenly with her face up to him.</p>
                        <p>"Will you, then," she cried, "kill me, too?"</p>
                        <p>That cut him to the quick. He was a man meek before her from then on. It
                            had never come to him thus, that he, Don Rodrigo, was cruel to this pure
                            woman.</p>
                        <p>"What is it you wish, Clarita, little one?" said he tenderly. "There is
                            great danger here."</p>
                        <p>"But then, you will let me go! I know you will let me!" said she.</p>
                        <p>"What shall I do?" cried he helplessly.</p>
                        <p>Then she caught his hand and pleaded with an earnestness that would have
                            moved a stone.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-206" n="198"/>
                        <p>"You are my brother's enemy," she said at last.</p>
                        <p>"You are going to kill him &#151; and this is why I cannot bear to
                            stay. You were always kind &#151; you are kind enough to be good to
                            me. This would kill me, not to go."</p>
                        <p>Don Rodrigo had never been moved thus before. There came suddenly to him
                            an unreasoning desire that she should indeed go. At all events she would
                            not return. Hence, somewhat bewildered, he ordered the sail hoisted and
                            the journey begun &#151; and he let her stay.</p>
                        <p>The ship was first poled some distance out, as were the rest. They were
                            scattered, then, as widely as could be. Sail after sail went up, spread
                            its great square extent to the wind, bulged round with it; and the
                            journey was begun. The wind came from the west. Tizapan lay southeast.
                            The course was easy. A good speed will bring these craft to Tizapan
                            before dawn. The perilous plan was in full operation. Rodrigo heaved a
                            heavy sigh. He left the girl and sat high up in the bow and looked away
                            to Tizapan.</p>
                        <p>"The loads of men," said he dreamily to himself, hearing her as she came
                            and leaned over the boat's side behind him, "the loads of men are
                            somewhat safe. But if there should come a storm, heaven have mercy on
                            the loads of horses!"</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
                        <p>THE town of Tizapan lies at a short distance from the lake. The shore in
                            that region is no such distinctly marked line of beach and rock as it is
                            at Chapala. It is not even always easy to tell where the shore is.
                            Between water and land there is a stretch of marsh for several hundred
                            yards, watery, pierced by the spears of a million reeds that rise thick
                            and green to a height of some feet. Here flock ducks in great numbers.
                            The marsh is flat, bewildering, and dreary. Through its middle a stream,
                            called the Tizapan River, cuts out more than one course, having formed a
                            delta. The main course of this river, not over twenty yards at its
                            widest part, usually much narrower, is navigable for <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas</hi> for half a mile to a point where the land is dry and
                            from which the town lies yet another mile distant. The stream being
                            crooked and the curves sharp, the progress from the open lake to the
                            inner landing is usually made by poles. The lake approach to the town
                            could be easily blocked by blocking the river. Only the one course is
                            navigable. Nobody could cross the marshes. This fact was recognized more
                            than a century ago.</p>
                        <p>The town itself is like the greater part of Mexican towns, narrow and
                            crooked streets with the low houses (joined together) shutting those
                            streets in and making them seem even narrower, and the central plaza of
                            considerable size left vacant. That plaza <pb id="VAA3931-208" n="200"/>
                            is to-day filled with flowers and fruit and contains a band-stand. In
                            former times it was bare. The mountains rise only a little way behind
                            the town, jagged and huge. Before them is a stretch of rolling green
                            fields. The river, coming from the peaks, dashes down through this
                            pastoral scene with a vivacity that has laid bare a rough and rocky bed
                            whereon the water boils till it passes through the town. At the time
                            when the two small armies were approaching Tizapan, much of the summer
                            green was still on field and mountain. The unclouded sun poured his
                            light over an emerald gem of the lake's border.</p>
                        <p>Nearly a week of peace and triumph, and no sight of the enemy, had begun
                            to give to Vicente something more of a feeling of freedom. With constant
                            outlook on all the roads before and behind him, and across the lake, he
                            believed he should have ample notification of the approach of an enemy.
                            For this reason he consented to the departure of Quiroz from Jiquilpan.
                            The latter desired that he himself and such companions as he should
                            choose should constitute the advance party to be sent forward to
                            Tizapan. Such a party, which should communicate with the clergy
                            concerning quarters and food for the troops, was desirable to open the
                            way. Wherever possible, messengers had thus ridden ahead.</p>
                        <p>Tizapan, being Doroteo's native place, was naturally intimately known to
                            him. It was the largest town on the southern half of the circuit. It was
                            a centre of the priesthood. It had been the intention from the first to
                            make of it a temporary source of supplies. It held in secret large
                            stores of weapons and ammunition. Add to these considerations the fact
                            that it was intended, should it be found the <pb id="VAA3931-209"
                                n="201"/> enemy was approaching, to fortify this town and make it
                            the scene of the next struggle (for it could be rendered almost
                            impregnable) and it will be readily seen that he who should now advance
                            to that spot must be one capable of acting with intelligence and
                            authority. Quiroz was that man.</p>
                        <p>When he was sent, with assistants, Pepa Aranja, headstrong as always,
                            appeared suddenly, ready mounted also, and galloped out of Jiquilpan
                            after him.</p>
                        <p>It was thus that on a brilliant morning a party of four left the last
                            considerable town east of Tizapan and rode at a good gait between peak
                            and water toward the latter place. They were Fortino and Anastasio,
                            Quiroz and the girl. The two former rode in unsociable silence, and,
                            spurring up irregularly, found themselves at length some distance in
                            advance of their companions. Pepa was on this day dressed in dark blue.
                            She never lost sight of the value of the appearance of her clothes. She
                            carried behind her saddle a pack wherein was bound up such wardrobe as
                            she considered most effective. Her dark blue skirt was not a long riding
                            skirt. It was a dress of ordinary length. She wore high leather boots
                            under it, and the toes of these, small, were visible at the stirrup and
                            the saddle's side. Her hair, that shining black hair, was braided in a
                            thick braid down her back. It was remarkably long. Her head was covered
                            by a small, light, man's sombrero of straw tied about by a dark blue
                            ribbon. The effect of this odd and unconventional costume was to
                            increase her beauty by changing its details.</p>
                        <p>"Never the same," said the gleaming-eyed Doroteo riding at her side. "By
                            my soul, you are a thousand women, and strange ones."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-210" n="202"/>
                        <p>She had tossed the night away, restless, on a hard bed in the house of a
                            friend of Quiroz in Jiquilpan. She had not so much as closed her eyes.
                            They seemed, therefore, larger than usual, inclined to hollowness,
                            looking out at him with the fire of her deep struggle in them. Her face,
                            too, grown a little thinner, had that strained, tense expression of the
                            nervous and the extremely alert. It was, in the light of this day, a
                            face that would have held the attention of the dullest boor.</p>
                        <p>"The señorita has not slept," said Quiroz, wrapping the reins about his
                            slender fingers and his slender fingers about the reins. "What is it
                            that sits so heavy on the heart, the light, light heart?"</p>
                        <p>"It is that the world is wrong," said she. "As for sleep &#151; I
                            cannot think when I am asleep."</p>
                        <p>"Hence you toss the night long and rise looking as though your soul, half
                            tiger's, half woman's soul, were just behind your eyes. Ha! a good
                            thing, no doubt. The rose buds and the rose blows, and even that, alas,
                            is not the end of the rose!"</p>
                        <p>He said this meditatively, looking away at the dancing waters, that cold
                            look never absent from his eyes. There were, too, oh his firm chin and
                            shut jaws and about the cheeks and temples, marks of the wild life he
                            had led. There was a kind of a long-strained repose in him, even in
                            movement, that was like the silence of a steel blade.</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo," said she, turning her own solemn eyes on him, "you can read me
                            somewhat. I am restless these days, that is plain to you. I do not know
                            &#151; I grow lonely also." She made an impatient movement of the
                            head. "The world did wrong by me, putting me in a woman's body. No, I do
                            not sleep &#151; I grow unhappy."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-211" n="203"/>
                        <p>She permitted her eyes to remain on his face even long after he had
                            turned again to her.</p>
                        <p>"It springs up," said he, smiling a flickering smile, "out of rocky
                            ground. It flourishes and sways in the suns of many weeks, and blooms.
                            Well, drop the figure. The woman is suddenly there. She flaunts red, red
                            colors like the rose, and runs riot with life. And she droops and the
                            red fades. Alas! &#151; even in the desert the canker came." He
                            fastened his eyes full on her. "Pepa, there are other spots than the
                            desert. Is there, then, nowhere, no way, a satisfaction for the life of
                            the rose?"</p>
                        <p>That old burning in her temples was visible again. She looked
                            dissatisfied.</p>
                        <p>"I have looked," said she, giving him always her full gaze," and I have
                            not seen it."</p>
                        <p>That steeliness of Quiroz somewhat lessened, warmed. He let his horse
                            come nearer to hers.</p>
                        <p>"Quiroz is a gambler," said he, with a quietness in which a cynical tone
                            was barely heard. "He is a rake. I am not that man that my mother and
                            the other good women would have had me. This is because I was born a
                            little too wild. I know the surface of the earth, having wandered over
                            it; and the bodies of men, having wounded some of them. I am hard, full
                            of a cold blood that they would say came out of hell, only that they
                            have the idea hell is hot. Therefore I cannot understand anything that
                            anybody feels. A rake never feels. A gambler never knows the value of a
                            blush, the truth of shame, the canker of disappointment. No, I am
                            outside the pale. Do not fancy I cannot see the difference between
                            myself and honest folk."</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Doroteo," she said, with a little impulsive movement of the hand,"
                            not every one, not every one thinks of you so."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-212" n="204"/>
                        <p>He was singularly stimulated by her tone. He would not take his eyes from
                            her. Her face seemed to him luminous.</p>
                        <p>"If there were one that did not," said he, with an intensity half sad,
                            half fierce, "one only. A gambler takes his luck; he smiles, however the
                            play goes. But he is not altogether incapable of a longing. I am no fit
                            companion for women; but I was born with the ability to distinguish
                            them. I should like to say that to the world and let the world once know
                            that an adventurer may possess a virtue that is all too rare among the
                            sleek."</p>
                        <p>What was she thinking? Why did her face grow bright with a kind of solemn
                            brightness, and the color come to her cheeks? She looked away, over the
                            lake. The small waves danced and glittered. The blue peaks opposite
                            looked mistily dreamy. Somewhere beyond them, she guessed, Don Rodrigo
                            was coming. She brought her eyes back and smiled on Quiroz her brilliant
                            smile, but it was tenderer now, with something in it suggestive of
                            sorrow.</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo," said she," not every one is bound up in the set beliefs. There
                            are some, may be, bound to nothing, wilder than the adventurer. I, at
                            least, know there is a heart in you."</p>
                        <p>He seized her hand; which she drew away, but gently, still smiling at
                            him.</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" she cried, "you are brave &#151; you are wild as I am wild! You
                            dare the world!"</p>
                        <p>"Listen," said he, half whispering it and gleaming on her. "You too have
                            doubted the outcome of all this."</p>
                        <p>She did not reply. Whether or not she encouraged him he could not know,
                            but with the gambler's instinct, and still carrying the winelike effect
                            of her words, he risked it.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-213" n="205"/>
                        <p>"Vicente is no common man," said he. "None can appreciate him more justly
                            than can I. But &#151; there is needed something else than battles.
                            There is needed a constructive ability. Then, too, the battles
                            themselves will grow more fierce, and soon. Pepita, I am afraid
                            &#151; and I say it with sincerity &#151; that the cause needs
                            more daring, more strength than his."</p>
                        <p>Still she made no reply. She looked like one in fever. She kept her eyes
                            on him and they led him more surely than could have any words from
                            her.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa," he said, "you too have the player's instincts. Where the stake is
                            highest and action fiercest, I see you there always. Whose is the
                            dominant force in this march? Yours. Whose is the spirit that has
                            entered the army? Yours. Let me say nothing of myself. Let me shift to
                            the other view of me and say only this" &#151; he grew fervent,
                            passionate &#151; "say the thing I have longed and burnt to say.
                            Pepa Aranja, I would follow you and you only into the bottom of Hell. I
                            would perjure my soul for you. I could curse Heaven, such is my madness.
                            Give me one word &#151; no &#151; your heart, your heart I must
                            and will have. Pepa &#151;"</p>
                        <p>They were riding between boulders and the lake over a sandy path. A turn
                            round a foothill to the front had taken their companions from sight. He
                            seized her hand again as it lay on the saddle's horn. He deftly stopped
                            both horses side by side. He would not let her tear her fingers away.
                            The piercing light of his eyes had never before held such intensity.</p>
                        <p>Her struggle to loose herself was not real. She ceased struggling, sat up
                            straighter and taller, and smiled at him again.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-214" n="206"/>
                        <p>"What?" said she, with something like mocking girlishness that did not
                            cover a certain solemnity; "I am not fit to love, I am fit only to run
                            wild&#151;like an animal."</p>
                        <p>She turned her head away, blushing, and seemed to try to withdraw her
                            hand. But he held it.</p>
                        <p>"Then let me run wild with you!" he cried. "And in that wildness we will
                            accomplish, with the love of armies, things that others, without us,
                            must fail to accomplish! Pepa, do you understand me? What is birth? What
                            is blood? Nothing! Power is the law."</p>
                        <p>She looked slowly behind and before her, then again across the lake. She
                            was for a moment unreadable, in which moment, too, she looked worn and
                            thin. Then the blushes came back and the smiles, and she turned to him.
                            He saw a thing, when she turned, that lashed his passion into a fury.
                            There were tears suddenly shining in her dark eyes.</p>
                        <p>"Promise me," she said, he still holding her hand, "promise me that,
                            whatever I will, that you will do. Him who speaks thus to me and loves
                            me, I make prove himself. <hi rend="i">Ay de mi!"</hi> She laughed a
                            little rippling laugh, brought the long, shining braid of her hair over
                            her shoulder, and passed it lightly across his hand; whereat a thrill
                            ran through him. "<hi rend="i">Ay de mi!</hi> This touch of the braid is
                            the magician's touch. See how imperious I have grown, hearing your love
                            for me! Is it thus you love me? Then &#151; promise me!"</p>
                        <p>"On your woman's soul," he said, with something like reverence, "I swear
                            it."</p>
                        <p>She suddenly tore her hand from his and spurred away, laughing blushingly
                            over her shoulder.</p>
                        <p>They came round the rocky corner that hid them <pb id="VAA3931-215"
                                n="207"/> from their companions. They perceived, a hundred yards
                            ahead, the great Fortino wheeling his horse close to that of Anastasio
                            and beating Anastasio roundly with a small stick. There seemed to be a
                            quarrel on hand which the lank recipient of the beating took with much
                            calm.</p>
                        <p>"What is the matter with you two clowns?" cried Quiroz ill-humoredly,
                            riding up with the girl. "What kind of a discord is this in the
                            army!"</p>
                        <p>"There is no discord whatever," whined Anastasio as the beating ceased
                            and Fortino, red and perspiring, went on in fumes of wrath. "This big
                            lime-kiln of a man is the only one doing anything; and his vile deeds
                            are in full harmony with his character, I'll swear Heaven."</p>
                        <p>"He cavils at me," grumbled Fortino, "and has no veneration for the most
                            sacred feelings of a man. I was swearing that I would follow Vicente and
                            his fortunes faithfully into the deep sea. I would prove constancy,
                            following doggedly, which I will, too, with the faith of a dog; and I
                            will try to prove this statement."</p>
                        <p>"And I say," said Anastasio, "that he doesn't appear to know the nature
                            of faith. It is not in dogs that you find faith. I have seen many a fine
                            dog follow his master about with his soul and his faith apparently in
                            his eye, for a day. Whereas they were in his stomach; for when he was
                            fed he lay down and slept and his master might, for all of him, walk
                            straight to the tail of the devil. It is this honest view of mine over
                            which Fortino makes trouble," continued Anastasio, in a tone of
                            discouragement.</p>
                        <p>"Then you tell us, old Solomon," grunted Fortino, "what faith is; you who
                            know."</p>
                        <p>"Well," said Anastasio speculatively, removing his <pb id="VAA3931-216"
                                n="208"/> hat and scratching his head, "I should say faith is a
                            sticking to a thing till it is eat up, regardless of the wants of
                            others."</p>
                        <p>The girl had seemed not to listen. She stared away, pale, across the
                            lake.</p>
                        <p>"In your ideas of faith," said Fortino with contempt, "where does the
                            advantage to anybody else come in?"</p>
                        <p>"Faith," replied the other, "I should say is distinctly a personal
                            matter. Others may derive benefit from the example, and thus be enabled
                            to stick to the next thing till it, too, is eat up. This, friends, is
                            world philosophy."</p>
                        <p>"I will yet teach you another kind," muttered the gloomy giant. "I am a
                            poor old tanned leather hide, I am. Well, may be so, may be so. I failed
                            in the first battle. I have been ridden down by remorse for it. But
                            there will be another enemy and other days and other examples of faith
                            that can go into the sea."</p>
                        <p>He sank into a silence from which he could not be drawn during the whole
                            of the day. The girl was as silent as he. She said scarcely a word
                            throughout the long journey. She remained pale, overcast with
                            meditation, seeming unhappy. There was a little of the burning still
                            about her temples when they entered Tizapan.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
                        <p>EVENING was coming down on the town when Doroteo and his three companions
                            rode into it. The fruit orchards cast long shadows over the fields and
                            the rocky bed of the stream was cut, by adobe walls, into yellow bars of
                            light and darker bars of shade. Half way between the town and the water
                            the road that leads round the lake cuts at right angles the road from
                            the river landing to the plaza. Hence a party coming from either
                            direction along the lake's shore would enter Tizapan by the same way,
                            the mile-long road from the river. Into this last Doroteo and his
                            companions turned after crossing the stream by the only bridge. Looking
                            to the right, the north, down this narrow way, the river landing with a
                            few huts about it could be seen some hundreds of yards distant at the
                            beginnings of the marsh. The huts were dilapidated and dirty. The marsh
                            was green and flat and waste. The lake beyond lay many-colored in the
                            sunset. The entire scene was a silent, deserted one. Both to east and
                            west the lake-circling road was deserted likewise. To the left, the
                            south, toward which point they turned, the short river road was, for
                            less than half a mile, flanked by high, thick, irregular stone walls
                            beyond which lay waste land, sandy and brown, cut by mountain spurs. The
                            four traversed this distance between the walls approaching the town, the
                            river landing behind them. When the walls ceased it was to give place to
                            adobe houses <pb id="VAA3931-218" n="210"/> whose continuous extent
                            abruptly began the street at a point yet another half-mile from the
                            central plaza.</p>
                        <p>"What kind of a town, in the name of the saints, do you have here?" said
                            Fortino in a bass growl of wonder. He had never been at this spot
                            before, in spite of having lived many years on the opposite side of the
                            lake. "I will swear we have ridden nigh the sixth of a league in this
                            tunnel of a street and there has been never another street crossing it,
                            nor a break in the joined walls of the houses. This way might be a cañon
                            of rocks for any outlet I see to it. What kind of a trap were your
                            people making out of their town? An unbroken shaft from the lake to the
                            centre, is it? Why are there no streets crossing this street?"</p>
                        <p>Doroteo laughed a little smothered laugh and his eyes glittered.</p>
                        <p>"Because," said he, "behind this left-hand wall of houses runs the river,
                            and there is no bridge yet for another mile. What would be the use,
                            friend, of running a street across this one, through these walls, into
                            the rocks of the river? As for the right &#151; well, who knows? Why
                            do we Mexicans do many odd things? Why do we build our houses with nine
                            windows and then brick up five of them as regularly as the clock
                            strikes?"</p>
                        <p>"As for that part of the town to the right," said Anastasio, "it is not
                            worth getting into, and nobody gets into it that can keep out; and a man
                            once in has no occasion for coming away for he is so drunk with the
                            stench of the foul quarter that he can only sit down and smell himself
                            into his grave. So old fat cock, what do you want with a street into
                            it?"</p>
                        <p>"Does it continue thus to the plaza?" said Fortino, <pb id="VAA3931-219"
                                n="211"/> stopping his horse, looking up and down, and whistling
                            long and slowly.</p>
                        <p>"Entirely to the plaza," said Quiroz, "save for one street which you
                            shall see leading into it."</p>
                        <p>"How easily can the enemy reach the plaza from some other way?"</p>
                        <p>"From the east, whence we came, he cannot reach it at all with horses,
                            because of the river. For there is but one other bridge besides that
                            which we have used. It is beyond the plaza; or it was. A flood came down
                            in the middle of a clear day last summer and washed it away. It is not
                            yet repaired. There is one narrow spot between rocks that can be crossed
                            on foot by a board; that is all. They are working on the bridge. From
                            the other direction &#151;"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, come at the other direction. If I have any head for strategy, it is
                            from the west Don Rodrigo will ride."</p>
                        <p>"From the west he might, if he did not mind winding his horses, make a
                            cut out of the lake road, come round the outskirts of Anastasio's
                            stenches, and get into the plaza, from the west also. But the spurs of
                            the foothills come down there, making a jagged difficulty. There is no
                            regular path cut. He would lead a bad chase, and after it all have to
                            enter the town's centre by almost such another tunnel of a street as
                            this, though at right angles to it."</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si</hi>" said Anastasio, "they have taken great pains to
                            wall away the smells of this quarter."</p>
                        <p>As he rode on a heavy chuckle began to play about within Fortino like a
                            subterranean noise suppressed by the surface of the earth. And as he
                            proceeded the chuckle continued, accompanied at every internal
                            ebullition by a puffing and swelling of the bristled folds on his neck's
                            back. He grew red, too, with <pb id="VAA3931-220" n="212"/> cogitation.
                            They came, still between the walls and amidst some agitated comment from
                            the townspeople, near the plaza; and still he chuckled, at last breaking
                            out:</p>
                        <p>"A beautifully fortified trap! Oh, let the enemy meet me here!"</p>
                        <p>At a point some hundred yards from the open plaza the narrow street
                            suddenly turned to the right at right angles to its original line, still
                            keeping its walls intact. It proceeded in this new course for some
                            fifteen yards only, when it abruptly returned to its first direction by
                            making another right angle to left. At this second angle was the only
                            break in the continuous walls of the shaft, &#151; a break caused by
                            the fact that those fifteen yards between the two corners were but a
                            prolongation of another street leading from the quarter of bad smells.
                            So that one having come up the river road, turned the first corner to
                            the right, and traversed the stretch to the second corner, might then
                            continue, without a second turn, straight on into the bad-smelling
                            section, or wheel to the left and proceed along the shaft to the plaza,
                            &#151; a straight course of between eighty and ninety yards. Hence
                            it was that the tunnel-like way led south from the lake and the lake
                            road a mile to the first right angle, turned abruptly west for fifteen
                            yards, then turned again abruptly south to the plaza. In all its course,
                            save at the second turn, so peculiar is the construction of many of
                            these Mexican towns, there was not a crossing alley or path or a break
                            in the bounding walls. A person standing at any point of the stretch of
                            fifteen yards between the two angles could see neither the plaza nor the
                            street leading to the lake.</p>
                        <p>Immediately at the first angle, standing indeed on <pb id="VAA3931-221"
                                n="213"/> the corner, and on the right of the four as they advanced,
                            was a large, low dwelling of considerable dignity in the town. It was
                            roofed with red tiles and plastered neatly over all its two external
                            sides. The plaster was then colored in fantastic and brilliant manner
                            with swirls of red and streaks of green, possibly representing some
                            fearful species of marble as yet undiscovered save in the fruitful
                            imagination of the Mexican. The effect is a common one here; in the
                            duller-hued north it would be only grotesque; in Mexico, where colors
                            are born in a million variations from the very qualities of the
                            atmosphere, it is not altogether displeasing.</p>
                        <p>"My ancestral walls," said Doroteo as they rode by, waving his
                                <unclear>-and</unclear> at them with courtesy. "I was born there
                            &#151; crucifixion of my soul! &#151; it was on this spot I felt
                            the growth of my wings, and learned virtue. There is a lady in this
                            house now &#151; Heaven waste all its blessing on her! &#151;
                            who has wept over me till what fire I had was near being quenched.
                            Friends, on to the plaza that you may see the lay of the town; then you
                            are to be lodged here."</p>
                        <p>The girl scanned the gaudy walls and the low, barred windows without
                            pleasure or interest. They turned the house's angle, traversed the few
                            yards of dusty street to the next angle, turned that, and advanced to
                            the central open square. It was now dusk. Shadows of evening lay over
                            walls and bare earth.</p>
                        <p>There used to be, indeed until recently there still was, in the plaza's
                            centre, a curious <unclear>rel-c</unclear> of the last century. It was a
                            massive chain thirty yards in length, coiled into a heap upon the
                            ground. It had lain coiled there, the town's property, for some scores
                            of years. Its links were each five inches in length and half as many
                            broad. The whole must have <pb id="VAA3931-222" n="214"/> weighed
                            several hundred pounds. Years and rain and sun and rust affected it not.
                            When Fortino rode up and looked at it on that October night it was as
                            mighty and as strong as it was in its long gone youth. It seemed not to
                            have been moved for many years. It was a little sunken in the soil. It
                            was brown, scaling, and covered with dust. He leaped down, lifted a
                            link, and let it drop, and the link clanked with a heavy iron voice. The
                            girl was riding slowly, thoughtfully, round the empty plaza, followed by
                            the town's eyes, but not seeing them. Doroteo and Anastasio had halted,
                            and were looking about at the four rows of sleepy shops and houses that
                            shut in the square, the tiled sheds in their front, the dim lamps and
                            candles within, the openings of two other narrow streets from the
                            mountains.</p>
                        <p>"More wonders!" said the great Fortino from the ground, where he stooped
                            over the chain. "Quiroz, what in God's name is this?"</p>
                        <p>"A thing with a fine use," said Quiroz. "In viceregal days we were as
                            fine a fortified town as ever Europe held. You observed the only
                            approach by land. Good. There is only one by water, and that is not a
                            pathway of flowers, brothers. It is up the river. Well," and he seemed
                            to gloat over the idea, "in old times if trouble was smelled, they
                            stretched that chain across the river at the marshes. But our enemy will
                            come on land &#151; if he comes. Cavalry gallops not over the
                            lake."</p>
                        <p>A meaning grunt was Fortino's response, as he lifted the link again and
                            listened, swelling and absorbed, to its voice when it clanked rustily
                            back to its fellows. His chuckle was gone. He seemed henceforth wrapped
                            in a dream, a dream which, to judge from his features, must have been
                            hot and stifling. <pb id="VAA3931-223" n="215"/> Meditation in this
                            giant was ever like the moving of ponderous machinery. He heaved himself
                            into his saddle again, unseeing. He followed the others through the fast
                            thickening shade over the course they had come. He seemed unaware of
                            their presence. The chuckle, very much buried, began again as he
                            proceeded. They came at length to Quiroz's birthplace. The gaudy walls
                            were now shadowed. There was no sign of life. In the front nearest the
                            plaza, facing the short stretch of street between the two angles, there
                            was no door, only iron-barred windows. The door was round the corner on
                            the straight way to the lake. They turned both angles and came to it.
                            They were dismounting, when a noise burst from Fortino.</p>
                        <p>"Damn me!" cried the giant, sweating, "with a strength like mine, damn
                            me! it can be stretched across a street as well as across a river. Let
                            my enemy come!"</p>
                        <p>It was like a heavy roar, this speech, as it came out. He leaped,
                            infinite mass that he was and heavy as a falling wall, to the ground;
                            and (Doroteo having knocked with an iron knocker and the door to the <hi
                                rend="i">patio</hi> being opened by a <hi rend="i">mozo</hi>) he
                            followed the others, leading his horse and fuming. The four and their
                            steeds were within.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> bricked save for circular, stone-lined
                            spaces about many a tree, was as clean as much labor and good feminine
                            supervision could make it. The house with its wide, low, inner, tiled
                            verandas, shut in but two sides, the sides next the street. The two
                            others were closed by high adobe walls plastered white and brilliant.
                            The brick floors of the verandas, were swept to a perennial redness, and
                            the walls at their backs were as marvellously colored as were <pb
                                id="VAA3931-224" n="216"/> those without. There reigned everywhere
                            thrift, cleanliness, a thousand evidences of supervision and labor. In
                            the house of Doroteo Quiroz there was no Mexican slovenliness. Even the
                                <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> wore clothing of unimpeachable whiteness, and
                            was glistening of countenance. He was fat and sleek, too, and received
                            his master with chattering joy. He led the horses through a rear door in
                            the high white wall, to the stables. The four crossed the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio</hi> to the <hi rend="i">corredor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At this there was a cry of agitation from the voice of a woman, and an
                            apparition of sky-blue, loosely composed and fluttering in the breeze of
                            its own speed, came running out of a door, across the bricks of the <hi
                                rend="i">corredor,</hi> and fell into the arms of Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo! My little son!" cried she breathless.</p>
                        <p>She was fully fifty years of age. She had a keen, somewhat bony, white
                            face, out of which eyes of an anxious black brilliancy scanned
                            Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>"This mother of mine," said Quiroz, holding her at arm's length and
                            looking her over with a kind of gallantry that seemed not suitable to
                            the occasion, "remains the same charming one, let the years thrash away
                            as they like. Friends, here is the lady who had the honor of giving me
                            birth. <hi rend="i">Mamacita,</hi> these are friends of mine, precious
                            as gold. You are going to take them into your heart."</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo," cried she, with piercing anxiety and looking thin and
                            shivering in the loose folds of the sky-blue, "you are come now at last
                            to settle down! Your old mother knows this is the last of your
                            wanderings. They tell me you have done strange things and not been very
                            quiet; and &#151; say, Doroteo, they try to make me believe you are
                            still wild. But doesn't <pb id="VAA3931-225" n="217"/> a mother know her
                            own son? Gentlemen, you are friends of his &#151; and the lady
                            &#151; who is the &#151; Oh! I had neglected. Who is the lady,
                            Doroteo?"</p>
                        <p>"The Señorita Josefa Aranja," said Quiroz with a bow. "She is a
                            traveller. She is a friend of mine. You are to give her the softest
                            bed."</p>
                        <p>Pepa came forward in silence, and greeted the lady after the Mexican
                            fashion. She did it solemnly.</p>
                        <p>"Ah &#151; well," murmured the Señora Quiroz, ponderingly interested
                            in the girl, "this will help him to settle down. This is a good sign. A
                            girl may be&#151;may be &#151; Come in, gentlemen, and the
                            señorita."</p>
                        <p>She led the way in.</p>
                        <p>"A girl may be necessary to a reform," she added to herself. "She seems a
                            quiet one."</p>
                        <p>Within, the bricks of the floors were glazed and polished highly. There
                            were high brass candlesticks with lit candles on a table in the centre
                            of the first room. The table held, too, some extraordinary ornaments in
                            the way of paper flowers and artificial fruits of marvellous coloring; a
                            melon whose pottery slices were ever luscious, a mango of a red and
                            yellow such as paint and paint only could induce, a <hi rend="i"
                                >chirimoya</hi> cracked across its crystal top, and many more. There
                            was a high glass cylinder that protected within it some gaudy thing,
                            whose beauties were altogether without name or precedent. There was a
                            long cane-bottomed and cane-backed sofa against the wall, in front of
                            which, facing each other and placed, in relation to the sofa, at
                            non-convivial angles, were two cane rockers of no common pattern. About
                            one half the rest of the wall other straight-backed chairs, of cane
                            likewise, stood stern as soldiers. Like the parlors of many a Mexican
                            home to-day, it was well kept and clean and proper, but the
                            pointlessness of its ornaments and <pb id="VAA3931-226" n="218"/> the
                            severity of its arrangements, left no possible room for a homelike
                            appearance. It was as cheerless as the glazing of the bricks. Seldom sat
                            any one on the chairs; few visitors came to use the sofa; the fruit and
                            the flowers and the unnamed beauties wasted a perennial sweetness on a
                            desert air. The widowed mistress was more familiar with the kitchen,
                            where servants even now could be heard preparing supper; or with her own
                            bedroom, where there was a crucifix of large size, and where she spent
                            the hours waiting for the time when Doroteo's wild days should have
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>"Bring us a light, Maria!" cried she, bustling about in a
                            not-to-be-allayed agitation; "come, light this lady to the room beyond
                            my own. No, I will go myself. Follow me, señorita. Ah &#151; he has
                            come back," she continued, leading the way along the <hi rend="i"
                                >corredor,</hi> entering the room before the girl. "He has come, and
                            the bad days are over. Nobody knows a son like a mother. It is a little
                            waywardness. Why, Doroteo was always a good boy; oh, a love of a boy,
                            Señorita Josefa! He was as plump as the turkeys till he grew tall.
                            Come;" she set the girl's candle on the small wooden dresser; "it
                            worries you too. I have never seen you before, but I have intuition. I
                            judge you at once. You are sad. It worries you too, and a woman longs
                            for his quieting down, you as well as I. I will acknowledge I feel quite
                            a mother to you &#151; Ah! what am I saying! Mary guard an old
                            woman's tongue. It is a &#151; it is a sister that I feel to you;
                            and already! But nobody ever knew a boy's nature as does his mother. And
                            I, old Manuela Quiroz, know he has come to the point of settling
                            down."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, Doña Manuela," said Pepa, "doubtless he <pb id="VAA3931-227"
                                n="219"/> will," and sighed and turned to the bed. So the old lady
                            left her and went hastily back.</p>
                        <p>"A good sort of girl," she murmured feverishly. "If this could only come
                            out so! Doroteo, my love, O my boy, my good boy! I can scarcely credit
                            my eyes in seeing you. The fruit orchards are in excellent condition,
                            Doroteo. Señor &#151; What is his name, Doroteo?"</p>
                        <p>"The biggest one is Fortino. That is name enough. Can you take that vast
                            man into your heart, mother? These are both lovable fellows. Anastasio
                            is as fine a boy to be cuddled as he is long, I'll swear it before God's
                            throne; blasphemous devil that I am!"</p>
                        <p>"O son! this is harsh talk; must I return to a washing out of your mouth
                            with soap? Ha! ha!"laughing tearfully and much moved with the tender
                            recollection. "It was thus I punished him in the old days. Don
                            Anastasio, I assure you" (she had scarcely looked at Anastasio) "he was
                            so plump, he and his little legs, when he was a boy, that he gave every
                            promise of being as plump a man as yourself."</p>
                        <p>"Señora," said the extremely lank Anastasio, during a grunt from Fortino,
                            "the slenderer I am the bitterer is your remark. There is nothing plump
                            about me but my admiration of ladies."</p>
                        <p>"Oh," replied she absently, "I thought Anastasio was the big one. Come,
                            supper is called. We eat on the <hi rend="i">corredor.</hi> It is less
                            lonely for a widow; and I am then nearer the door if he &#151; if
                            any one should come."</p>
                        <p>By Doroteo's attention the men were given means of washing face and hands
                            in a pottery bowl by the kitchen, a courtesy the agitated Doña Manuela
                            had <pb id="VAA3931-228" n="220"/> neglected. Under the low tiles of the
                            wide <hi rend="i">corredor,</hi> with the night-shadows of trees just
                            beyond and the sighing of the night wind audible about, the table was
                            spread, white, inviting, candle-lit.</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo," said his mother, drawing him aside, "they are dressed like the
                            servants. These friends of yours look like peons to me. It is &#151;
                            I suppose whatever you do is all right &#151; now I would believe
                            you always, Doroteo; I always had the utmost faith in you. I never sat
                            down with peons in my life, Doroteo &#151; And &#151; and the
                            girl?"</p>
                        <p>"These fellows are to do great services. Exceptions are good things. Do
                            you forget I am in war?"</p>
                        <p>"Holy Mary! I thought you were abandoning the war! Oh! Doroteo, have you
                            not come home to stay?"</p>
                        <p>"By and by, <hi rend="i">Mamacita,</hi>" said he, stretching his lips
                            across the teeth.</p>
                        <p>"Am I, then," she faltered, "encouraging the war? I do not believe in
                            war. And the girl, is she &#151; Sh! &#151; tell your old
                            mother. I always had your full confidence; oh, yes! you always told me
                            everything. Is she &#151; is it &#151;"</p>
                        <p>She paused, her white bony face lit with her anxiety. He smiled finely on
                            her, and chucked her with a great but elegant gallantry, wherein the
                            cat-like quality of movement was not entirely lacking, under the
                            chin.</p>
                        <p>"Who knows whither blows the wind!" said he.</p>
                        <p>The girl, being called by a servant, came then out of her room,
                            deep-eyed, silent. She still wore her hair in the braid. The fishermen,
                            urged, approached, and the five sat down. Waited on by a bright-eyed
                            little Mexican girl and the sleek <hi rend="i">mozo,</hi> they ate a
                            supper that satisfied even Fortino. It chanced that <pb id="VAA3931-229"
                                n="221"/> Quiroz finished before the others. He arose, and,
                            appeasing his questioning mother by the announcement that he was off to
                            the priests (which holy purpose comforted the lady), did indeed abruptly
                            depart. The churchmen, he had assured Anastasio and Fortino, would send
                            a servant who, in conjunction with those two warriors, was to spend the
                            night gathering together provision for the army.</p>
                        <p>"God be praised," murmured Doña Manuela, when the heavy door had clanged
                            to after him (she was eating nothing but staring at the girl), "if he
                            has come to a need of the priests! A man's heart cannot be always hard.
                            He will come to the church before he dies. Señorita, you too cannot eat.
                            Ah &#151; I understand; you could tell it all to me, me who
                            understand! Women's bosoms beat the same in all the world."</p>
                        <p>The señorita did not reply. Having eaten little, she too arose abruptly
                            and went to her room. Her door closed after her; Doña Manuela and the
                            fishermen were the only feasters left.</p>
                        <p>"A good quiet girl," murmured Doña Manuela dreamily. "Señores, she seems
                            like a nice, well-mannered young lady. Oh, if it could be brought about!
                            Surely you can say things to her in his favor &#151; you who know
                            his good qualities. There is nothing so good as a good woman to settle a
                            man down."</p>
                        <p>"Marriage," sighed Anastasio, by way of saying something encouraging, "is
                            a pleasant thing."</p>
                        <p>"Nobody knows him as I do," she went on. "These wanderings are not to his
                            inclination. Oh, I know him. It is because he grew so rapidly &#151;
                            this made him restless. But these are not his true inclinations. He is
                            cut out for a quiet life, is Doroteo. Mothers know. Mothers know."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-230" n="222"/>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi>" grunted Fortino positively, between mouthfuls,
                            "mothers do know. I knew a mother among the Yaquis that had her son
                            hanged. She knew him, she did, as few knew him."</p>
                        <p>"This was terrible, Don Fortino," she replied in awe. "But Doroteo was
                            good from his birth. He used to run and pick up the oranges. He was a
                            beautiful child. And when he ran away and was so long gone, it was his
                            restlessness; and he has told me himself that he was not happy. You
                            gentlemen are kind and are friends of his. What is there we three can do
                            together to settle him down? Come," and she settled herself down in
                            fictitious comfort and coziness, making of them, as it were, a
                            harmonious group of three with a common purpose and a common care;
                            "come, we three together can work it out!"</p>
                        <p>During this conversation one subject of it remained shut in her room. At
                            the <hi rend="i">corredor's</hi> shadowed end the heavy wooden door of
                            that room was visible with a point of light issuing from the keyhole, an
                            aperture corresponding in size to the enormous key now in the possession
                            of the girl. No sound issued from that room. The other person thus
                            discussed was in the streets. He had stood a moment outside the <hi
                                rend="i">patio's</hi> entrance after the clanging of the door. The
                            night was very windy, and gusts swept up the narrow cañon of the
                            street.</p>
                        <p>"The lake must be getting high with a wind like this," said he
                            musingly.</p>
                        <p>He began to hum that same old tune about the red which he had hummed in
                            another day long ago, the day Pepa had jumped into the water. He turned
                            the corner and came into that little fifteen-yard stretch of the street
                            before the second turn. He paused there <pb id="VAA3931-231" n="223"/> a
                            moment at the window of the room he knew was hers. As he did so he heard
                            its door open and shut. He knew the tread of the person who entered,
                            came to a point near the window, and lit a candle. He did not know the
                            meaning of the absolute silence that reigned thereafter &#151; or
                            her thoughts. The window was shut. It was of solid, wooden, door-like
                            parts, with no glass. It was barred by a wooden bar within and by the
                            customary bulging iron ones without, like a prison. He went away toward
                            the plaza swiftly.</p>
                        <p>"Bah!" said he; "give thanks to whatever Catholic deity did it. I am no
                                <hi rend="i">novio</hi> that must stand outside a window.</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"'I won it straight at every whirl.</l>
                            <l n="2">She would not give it me!'"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>The streets of that odd old town were nearly deserted. They were dark,
                            too. The place lay wrapped in a primitive silence. It had grown some and
                            changed in many ways since that long-gone day when the Texcocan prince
                            saw it lying here under the peaks whereon he stood. And, while a
                            descendant, such as he may have held in his half barbaric dreams, was
                            coming to fight, if need be, over his unknown grave, and hearts beat and
                            intrigues went on, and there were signs of a fire of battle in the sky,
                            &#151; doubtless he knew it not, nor cared that the old Texcocan
                            power was dead, died with him, could rise up only like a ghost that
                            flits about and is gone. Quaint old Tizapan, strangest village of your
                            time; where mediæval Europe and ancient Mexico came and lay down
                            together, a lion and a lamb, and slept in peace!</p>
                        <p>Into the shadows of the bare plaza went Quiroz. Some of the little shops
                            were still open, but he did <pb id="VAA3931-232" n="224"/> not pause at
                            them. He crossed by the iron coil in the centre and went into another
                            street that leads toward the mountains. He came presently to the river,
                            dashing down between high, rocky walls, with the backs of houses
                            shutting it in. He paused and made an examination. The bridge was indeed
                            gone. They had been working at its repair; but, so slow is Mexican
                            labor, it would be long before a horseman could enter the town by that
                            means. A long timber gave a footpath to a rock in the centre, and
                            another long timber led to the opposite side. Doroteo did not cross. He
                            sang yet a little softly, and came back to the plaza. Besides this
                            street to the broken bridge and the one from the river, only one other
                            entered the plaza. It came in on the western side. This was the street
                            he had said an enemy from the west might reach by a tortuous circuit. He
                            turned into it. It was as dark and shaft-like as the other, save that
                            some streets led out of it toward the southern peaks, in which direction
                            lay the more ancient portions of the town. He came to a church and went
                            in. There were a few candles and many images in mysterious shadows, and
                            some women kneeling on the bare floor, wrapped in <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozos,</hi> and wailing out prayers. A priest was coming out of a
                            door near the altar. Doroteo went to him. There was a moment's
                            conversation, and the priest led him through another side door out of
                            the church, across an open court, and into a building that joined the
                            sacred edifice. The doors of that building were closed after them. For
                            some hours Quiroz was shut in with the man of the church; as he or
                            Vicente had been in many other villages. When he came out at last it was
                            after midnight; and certain later plans of the clergy were clear to
                            him.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-233" n="225"/>
                        <p>In the plaza, now dark save for the starlight and one smoky lamp, he
                            found Fortino and Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"These rumors keep knocking my head," grumbled Fortino. "How the devil
                            can they tell he is coming?"</p>
                        <p>"What? Who?" cried Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>"Why, they say the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> is coming. Here, boy!"</p>
                        <p>A boy from a small group that was gathering in the darkness came up.</p>
                        <p>"What is it they say?"</p>
                        <p>"They say Don Rodrigo is coming," said he, excitedly. "Everybody says
                            so."</p>
                        <p>"How is he coming?" inquired Quiroz, without excitement; "what do they
                            say?"</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Quien sabe!</hi> They say he is coming."</p>
                        <p>The boy ran away.</p>
                        <p>"This is the run of them," broke in Anastasio. "They say &#151; they
                            say. Nobody knows. I brand these things as lies."</p>
                        <p>"Go back to the house, you two," said Quiroz. "I shall join you at once.
                            I, too, believe no such rumors. But I shall soon know."</p>
                        <p>The two fishermen disappeared down the street toward Quiroz's home, where
                            the white Doña Manuela sat up waiting for the return of her son.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz's queries were exhaustive. He wandered into many parts of the
                            town. The rumor was certainly persistent, but nowhere could he find
                            foundation for it. He could not even discover any rider who had entered
                            the place since dark, and who might have brought the news.</p>
                        <p>"Why," said one, "they say he is coming by the lake."</p>
                        <p>"Ha!" laughed Quiroz, in scorn. "He brings only infantry if he does,
                            &#151; what is that to us?"</p>
                        <p>He went back to his home, alert, swift. He was <pb id="VAA3931-234"
                                n="226"/> puzzled by these rumors. He came to the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio</hi> door at one o'clock and went in.</p>
                        <p>"You have seen the priest, Doroteo, my son?" said Doña Manuela, coming
                            out with a candle, still dressed in the light blue dress and looking
                            wan.</p>
                        <p>"A jolly good old dog he was, too," said Quiroz, under his breath, paying
                            little attention to her.</p>
                        <p>"Will you not go to bed now, Doroteo, my son?" asked she, anxiously.</p>
                        <p>"Presently, mother, presently. Is the lady still in her room; has <hi
                                rend="i">she</hi> gone to bed?"</p>
                        <p>"I can see her light by the cracks," said Doña Manuela, with some
                            eagerness. "Ah, Doroteo, she is a beautiful creature, and a good, quiet
                            one."</p>
                        <p>"Put me down for a hearty second to that, so much so that I cannot wait.
                            I go to pay court, mother, to this quiet one, now, in the middle of the
                            night."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, my son!" cried she in consternation. "This is improper!"</p>
                        <p>"You know Doroteo too well to accuse him of impropriety," cried he,
                            glistening of eye and smiling on her. "Nobody knows a son as does his
                            little mother. Now, say I. Love and war wait for nothing."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, my son!" cried she, plaintively, as though feeling the awfulness of
                            it, but giving in because he took decision away from her. "Oh, my son! A
                            happy outcome &#151; oh, a happy outcome! This is a strange
                            world."</p>
                        <p>Fortino and Anastasio were crouched with their blankets in the middle of
                            the <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> Quiroz assured them he had been unable to
                            verify the rumors. Then he went to Pepa's door. The night was as still
                            there in the <hi rend="i">corredor</hi> by her room as it could have
                            been on the highest peaks.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-235" n="227"/>
                        <p>He knocked lightly. She opened to him at once. He went in boldly,
                            recklessly, and closed the door. The <hi rend="i">patio</hi> was left in
                            its nightly peace. Doña Manuela, somewhat horrified, stood stooped and
                            trembling, with the candle in her hand, staring at the door. Fortino and
                            Anastasio at length stretched out on the bricks and slept.</p>
                        <p>There was then a great struggle in the bosom of Doña Manuela.</p>
                        <p>"The keyhole is so very large," said she plaintively.</p>
                        <p>She went a little closer. A mother's anxiety drew her on, yet held her
                            back. Five fearful minutes she spent with her will in the balance.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, God forgive me!" cried she. "At least it is a little sin. And
                            Doroteo never keeps anything from me. Nay, nay, he tells me all; when he
                            comes out he would tell me all that passed, anyway. How good it is that
                            a mother has thus the confidence of&#151;Oh Doroteo, Doroteo! could
                            you keep aught from me &#151; me who long to know!"</p>
                        <p>She crept up to the keyhole. It really was very large. They are so to-day
                            in all the smaller places of Mexico, and the keys are of great size. The
                            girl was seated by the table whereon the candle stood. She was plainly
                            in view, with her face toward the door. Her eyes were large and black
                            and her face thin. She was staring at a part of the room the mother
                            could not see, but in which she felt her son to be. Indeed Doroteo's
                            voice was heard.</p>
                        <p>"It is merely," said he, "that they say he is coming. Only rumors, it may
                            be, but we are to be ready. Pepa, let us come at last to open
                            speech."</p>
                        <p>The old lady was so agitated by the mystery of these words she could not
                            hear the reply. There <pb id="VAA3931-236" n="228"/> was other
                            conversation within. At length she distinguished this from the girl:</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo Quiroz will keep to me his promise more surely than to the God
                            he no more than half believes."</p>
                        <p>Full of wretchedness Doña Manuela awaited the answer to this slander;
                            would fain have defended her son from so blasphemous and unexpected a
                            remark. She saw a strange and dazzling smile on the nervous face of the
                            girl within. She heard her son step nearer the table. She still could
                            not see him.</p>
                        <p>"But is the promise, then, to be mine only?" cried he. "You give me
                            smiles &#151; you give me no other proof. I follow you like the lost
                            one that I am, caring for nothing so that I be under your eyes. You are
                            a gambler, in your soul, as much as I. How do I know I am to have, for
                            my promise and its fulfilment, one caress from the lips that can smile
                            so? I will have it &#151; I will have it now! <hi rend="i">Muerte de
                                Dios!</hi> if I have held you once I can wade through fire. Come,
                            words are nothing to Quiroz."</p>
                        <p>He came very near her. She was suddenly on her feet. At first, like a
                            panther and looking majestically beautiful, she held him off by the very
                            look. But in that moment she learned more of the man with whom she had
                            to deal and of his desperation than she had learned in all her previous
                            acquaintance with him. Her face was like white flame; but it gradually
                            softened. It was no less white, but there was a change in the light of
                            the eyes. She looked as though she would smile, but she did not. At
                            least he sprang to her. For one second she was in his arms. Then she
                            pushed him away.</p>
                        <p>"Now go!" she cried.</p>
                        <p>The scene had thrilled the older woman at the key-hole <pb
                                id="VAA3931-237" n="229"/> with many emotions. She had barely time
                            to run hysterically away to the <hi rend="i">corredor's</hi> far end,
                            the candle tottering in her hand, her face alternately burning and
                            turning haggard, when Doroteo came suddenly out and closed the door. He
                            was the same swift, feline Quiroz; but he was hot about the forehead. He
                            carried with him a picture of the girl throwing herself down on a chair
                            by the table, burying her face in her arms.</p>
                        <p>"Oh my son!" cried the shaking Doña Manuela, running unsteadily to him.
                            "Be careful; be careful what you do. Passion is a wild thing!"</p>
                        <p>Passing her he patted her once on the cheek, lightly, delicately; with
                            less desire to keep alive her pitiable faith in him she would have
                            called it coldly.</p>
                        <p>"Never fear &#151; go to bed, <hi rend="i">Mamacita."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He went to Fortino and awoke him. Anastasio slumbered on.</p>
                        <p>"Fortino," he said, speaking with hard pointedness, "I was mistaken about
                            the other bridge, I went there to-night. They have completed it. Vicente
                            could cross there and beat the enemy to the plaza if the enemy came. I
                            am going out now to hunt the rumor down. Sleep on; you will need your
                            strength. If I find reasons I shall send this long slumberer on a gallop
                            to Vicente before dawn. By the new bridge an army can reach the plaza
                            and fortify itself and an enemy not know it is there. Adios!"</p>
                        <p>"Give me a swing, then," growled Fortino, "at the chain. The scheme
                            begins to grow on me. I know I shall win back my repute."</p>
                        <p>Doroteo was gone and Fortino sat up long pondering with the mien of a
                            Jove or a Saturn.</p>
                        <p>The broken Doña Manuela, full of doubts and terrors but straining her
                            faith still, poor woman, <pb id="VAA3931-238" n="230"/> grasping in her
                            lonely soul at every straw, went slowly and bent into the glazed,
                            homeless parlor and sat down stiffly on one of the straight chairs. She
                            seemed to have no idea of retiring. She sat there for a long time.</p>
                        <p>"He will tell me all," she sighed. "He knows the love of his mother. If
                            anything goes wrong I fear the girl will be the cause of it. Oh yes, he
                            always tells me everything, does Doroteo."</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER X</head>
                        <p>TO this day the trip between Chapala and Tizapan is often made between
                            dusk and dawn in those same flat-bottomed <hi rend="i">canoas.</hi> To
                            be afloat in the lake's middle on a moonless night is to have no sign of
                            shore on any hand. Many times the waves out there rise to great heights
                            and those frail barks are tossed about like chips. Shipwrecks and loss
                            of life are far from unknown.</p>
                        <p>The same wind that had swirled about Quiroz in Tizapan's narrow streets
                            was filling thirty square sails on the darkening waters. They flew over
                            the waves like so many night-birds, silent. The west grew dark; even the
                            highest edge of the highest cloud put out its light. The strangely
                            freighted vessels spread out for a distance of some two miles. As they
                            are not the easiest craft to manage it was well not to let them come too
                            near one another. Chapala's few lights gradually disappeared; only the
                            stars remained. There was, at nine o'clock, no shore; there were no
                            mountains; only each little ship to itself plunging into the night, a
                            ghostly company of white wings on every hand, and rising waves beating
                            against pitched sides and flinging spray over man and beast. In the main
                            the horses had become as quiet as could have been hoped, though an
                            unusual lurch sometimes caused a scramble of hoofs and some equine
                            expression of distress.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-240" n="232"/>
                        <p>"Did you know there is iron on the prow of this thing?" called a soldier
                            from the black depths of the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> which Bonavidas
                            commanded, a <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> loaded with men only. "What did
                            they put iron on it for? This is the biggest and the fastest, too. If
                            anybody should get in front of this prow, holy fathers! we would cut
                            into him!"</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas, like some lean prowler of the night, moved always from one end
                            of the vessel to the other, bending that bony visage of his over the
                            water and watching the other sails. Some of his companions under the
                            unremoved thatch at length sang low and melancholy songs in that
                            peculiar, restrained falsetto of the Mexican peon.</p>
                        <p>The next boat, some rods to Bonavidas' right, was the little "Delirium,"
                            wherein were three soldiers, a servant of Doroteo, and eight horses.
                            Beyond this, a full black quarter of a mile, flew the sail of the <hi
                                rend="i">jefe.</hi> The <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> with his invigorated
                            mood of youth gone, sat high on the prow of his vessel looking away to
                            the fathomless southeast. The majority of his companions had congregated
                            at the stern with the man at the rudder. The prisoner was there too,
                            crouching in their midst. Others lay asleep, unseen, under the
                            thatch.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> turning about and seeing her
                            indistinctly, "if I would let myself think, I would come to believe you
                            have made a criminal of me."</p>
                        <p>She was standing again at the boat's side on a coil of rope which made
                            her high enough that she could look over into the water. He could barely
                            make out the outline of her body; the shapely head with the <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo</hi> over it was more plainly seen. Now and then the wind
                            caught a strand of her hair and blew it about her face. She had spoken
                            no more.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-241" n="233"/>
                        <p>"I knew you before this, Don Rodrigo," she said, "and you were kind. You
                            believe you are doing right &#151; and crime is not the word."</p>
                        <p>"Gentle judge," said he, half to himself. "But I am mistaken then
                            &#151; misguided &#151; wrong."</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said she with simplicity.</p>
                        <p>He whistled a little to himself, softly.</p>
                        <p>"Heigh-ho!" he replied. "Let us not talk of this. Let us talk of the
                            first day I saw you. Why had you run away from the <hi rend="i"
                                >meson?"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"I was lonely," said she. "I wanted Vicente."</p>
                        <p>"And you had not seen him since you were &#151; how old?"</p>
                        <p>"Four."</p>
                        <p>"This is a faith," he mused, "that ought to move mountains. To carry his
                            face in your mind so long, and to go straight to the place where he was.
                            There is something supernatural in a child."</p>
                        <p>The boat was rolling a little more and the spray came over them.</p>
                        <p>"Let me make you a bed under the thatch. You are not used to this," said
                            he.</p>
                        <p>"Not yet," she replied. "I have been to Tizapan before, and in the
                            night."</p>
                        <p>"Where will you go there?" he inquired anxiously. "I am sick thinking of
                            it. You &#151; you, in the heart of the trouble!"</p>
                        <p>"I will go to Doroteo's house. His mother is very good."</p>
                        <p>"And Doroteo?"</p>
                        <p>"No. He is not good."</p>
                        <p>"This, at least," muttered Rodrigo, "is a satisfaction."</p>
                        <p>"Why?" asked she.</p>
                        <p>He was confused at this.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-242" n="234"/>
                        <p>"Because &#151; because it leaves you more admiration for the rest of
                            us poor wanderers."</p>
                        <p>"I have seen this prisoner," she said thoughtlessly, "before."</p>
                        <p>"I would n't listen to a secret from her," said the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe,</hi> "if my life depended on it. Don't tell me anything,
                            little girl, I prefer to find it out myself."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, this is nothing. I merely saw him on the shore when I was going to
                            Ocotlan."</p>
                        <p>"When were you at Ocotlan?"</p>
                        <p>"The night of the battle. I was very glad you were whipped. But," she
                            added quickly, as though afraid she had offended him, "I was also very
                            glad they had not hurt you."</p>
                        <p>"You would have liked them to take me prisoner."</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said she.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, now we understand each other," he replied. "Why did you go to
                            Ocotlan?"</p>
                        <p>"To find brother Vicente. I tried very hard, but I could not stay."</p>
                        <p>"Again. You went again! And how did you go?"</p>
                        <p>"I walked. It took all the day and into the night."</p>
                        <p>"This might be a fairy story," said he dreamily, "and you the good
                            princess. Is there then one, one in all the world, that can keep faith?
                            And here you are a third time going to him, and these last were after
                            many years. And you are a fisherman's daughter from the lake where
                            civilization lives not. Yet the greatest thing in earth shines from
                            you."</p>
                        <p>He could see that she turned her face to him. If she had been on the
                            point of replying she checked herself. In a silence somewhat prolonged
                            he believed her eyes were still on him. Then she surprised him by saying
                            suddenly:</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-243" n="235"/>
                        <p>"I have seen something not very happy in you many a time, Don
                            Rodrigo."</p>
                        <p>He made no response. The fear that she had been rude still hung in her
                            mind, and she found herself wishing he would speak, but he did not. They
                            chanced to be looking toward the southeast.</p>
                        <p>"You know the island that lies out there," she said after a time, in
                            order that the silence might be broken. "They say it is haunted. Did you
                            not go there once, Don Rodrigo; and what was it that you found?"</p>
                        <p>"I was but just now thinking of it," said he. "I sailed there from the
                            other end of the lake. That, too, is a matter I would rather put out of
                            my mind, because of a thing I may have to do. I would rather speak of
                            you, you who wander your little world over after Vicente like a lost
                            soul. You are no smaller than the greatest wanderers nor your wanderings
                            any less than theirs. A hundred thousand souls have been cast adrift on
                            this same sea whereon you are alone. Oh, pitiful creation! Yet I think
                            there was never another so pure as you."</p>
                        <p>"What is there in a little barbarian like me," she said, "that keeps you
                            thinking of me, and seemingly full of interest, when it is only that I
                            am lonely and go to find my brother."</p>
                        <p>"Heaven record that simple remark! and I will answer it saying, What is
                            there in God to interest a man, when it was simply that God was lonely
                            and came to earth to find his brother. I tell you again you carry in you
                            the greatest thing that lives."</p>
                        <p>"You think too much of me," said she, looking away over the waves toward
                            Tizapan.</p>
                        <p>"If I saw much of you I think it might be so indeed. I should need some
                            angels to watch over the wrecked pieces of my heart, lest it get
                            together again <pb id="VAA3931-244" n="236"/> in spite of itself. Why do
                            I think too much of you, and why do I keep speaking of you? It is
                            because I think we are in the same way of life, if it be that at all;
                            and that these waves we are cutting through on this reckless project
                            have their counterparts in something deeper. I am going on to find
                            something too; though there is less hope of my success than of yours,
                            seeing that I do not know what I am hunting. Hence, if facts in the
                            scheme of the universe make tones in a harmony, by such faith as I have
                            we are listening to the same music &#151; and it has saddened us
                            both alike."</p>
                        <p>There was a new throbbing in her gentle bosom. She was so pure, so true,
                            so open to emotion. She looked at his form again, black against the sky,
                            and at the silent sails dim about her; and the wind she had hated came
                            and blew gently on her cheek. She thought of Vicente, of all the past.
                            She remembered the pressure of Rodrigo's hand when he had first led her,
                            years ago, back to the <hi rend="i">meson.</hi> She could not help it
                            &#151; her heart was very full &#151; and a tear came to her eye
                            and rolled in the darkness down her cheek.</p>
                        <p>"I wish that you were not his enemy," she said in a voice that made him
                            silent. "We would be friends, the three of us."</p>
                        <p>Who can blame him if, for a moment, he felt little and guilty, and would
                            have given some years of his life to fulfil her wish?</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the vessel had come gradually nearer that of Bonavidas, between
                            which and Rodrigo's sailed the "Delirium." Rodrigo came down to the flat
                            bottom, steadied the girl's arm with his hand, and led her under the
                            thatch, for the ship was now rolling greatly and the waves were growing
                            too high <pb id="VAA3931-245" n="237"/> for her to stay where she was.
                            He had them strike a light and light a candle under the thatch; and the
                            best spot was chosen for her. There were many of those rude soldiers who
                            were glad enough to lend their blankets for her bed. With several of
                            these he made her a place to sleep and she lay down. The last thing she
                            saw before the light was put out was the eyes of that prisoner. He was
                            crouched in the stern between his keepers. His face looked ashen in the
                            faint candle-light; and it came over her with a thrill that the dull
                            reflection of the rays from his eyes was like that from the eyes of her
                            mother that night long ago, just before Fortino had carried her away. So
                            it was little she slept. She lay in silence, seeing nothing, hearing the
                            wash of the waves.</p>
                        <p>In that second boat to the left there was growing some agitation.
                            Bonavidas had a thing to annoy him.</p>
                        <p>"To the devil with that little 'Delirium'!" cried Bonavidas. "What kind
                            of a damp-headed fool has hold of her rudder? Holloa! You adobe men! Do
                            you want to make corpses of us? Don't you see you are getting too near?
                            Pull away! Pull away! The waves beat in this direction. You're too near,
                            I say!"</p>
                        <p>His voice, battling with the wind, went across the water to where the
                            little "Delirium" was pitching fearfully. Another voice, faintly heard,
                            came back:</p>
                        <p>"I can't manage her. She has something wrong with her rudder."</p>
                        <p>"You've <hi rend="i">got</hi> to manage!" cried Bonavidas. "You can't
                            transfer to anything in this lake but to the bottom of it. Lord have
                            mercy on that boat, boys! Steer us off to the left."</p>
                        <p>"I can't," came his steersman's reply out of the <pb id="VAA3931-246"
                                n="238"/> gloom. That official was growing desperate. "The wind has
                            changed due south and it's too high. If I turn a hair's breadth more
                            we're over; that's the end of it."</p>
                        <p>"For God's sake!" cried Bonavidas across the water, "keep away or we're
                            into you!"</p>
                        <p>"No. We're five rods ahead of you," was the reply.</p>
                        <p>The "Delirium's" sail could indeed be seen rapidly coming closer. It was
                            rising and falling in frantic response to hostile wind and waves.
                            Already the vessel was out of the track of the wind. The great square
                            canvas occasionally flapped wing-like, then bellied with a burst of
                            force that made the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> stagger. The danger
                            increased and the inability of management. Bonavidas and his men,
                            yelling warnings, beheld the other boat head straight across their
                            course. The sail loomed up like a ghost before. Under it could be heard
                            confusion of men and horses. Bonavidas himself leaped to his rudder and
                            there were others with him. They strained every muscle against the
                            wooden bar to wheel round the "Delirium's" right. Their sail was dropped
                            and the yard fell with a crash. It was too late. A great wave beat them
                            back. The "Delirium" staggered in front. She was close at hand. Her sail
                            was over them like a dense white mist which had suddenly come out of the
                            night to bury them. There was a moment's suspense and the crash came.
                            The iron-bound prow of the bigger vessel was heard grinding its way into
                            the other's side. Her force was such that she wheeled her smaller
                            antagonist half way round, tore a gash like a long wound in her stern,
                            swept away her useless rudder and went on, leaving the helpless hull a
                            wreck behind.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-247" n="239"/>
                        <p>The thing had come so suddenly that no one was ready for it. It was a
                            quick terror out of the midst of a good progress. The "Delirium" had
                            answered to her name. She had suddenly gone mad. She was as wild in
                            those few desperate seconds as her owner, but to less purpose. She
                            floated now a doomed ship. The water rushed in at her wounds; she
                            drifted, whirled, and beat upon the waves. Within there was a mixture of
                            animal and human insanity. The shock had made the horses like so many
                            demons. Packed as they were, they struggled and fought for life in the
                            darkness. They broke halters and became a confused mass. There were four
                            men in the vessel; they cried in frenzy. One, a soldier, was knocked
                            among the horses and trampled a score of times by iron hoofs. Two leaped
                            into the water. The fourth was paralyzed with fear. He stood high up on
                            the bow as silent as death. The vessel could hold up but a moment
                            longer. The animals, in an excess of their frantic struggle, burst more
                            of the wrecked planks into fragments. The stern went down as suddenly as
                            rock sinks, and the prow shot up. Its one stupefied occupant clung to it
                            with his last despair. For a second it hung as though suspended. Then it
                            sank, carrying him with it amidst the scream of horses. The damage was
                            done, and the "Delirium" was no more. One horse only could be seen, by
                            the straining eyes in Bonavidas' vessel, to come to the surface. It beat
                            about pitifully for some minutes and sank. The man who was trampled and
                            he who clung to the bow were not visible. The latter was Doroteo's
                            servant who came in charge of the boat. The two others swam toward
                            Bonavidas. They were skilful and of cool heads. They were at length,
                            with much difficulty, rescued by ropes and drawn into the <pb
                                id="VAA3931-248" n="240"/> larger vessel. That larger vessel had
                            come off unscathed.</p>
                        <p>"Thanks to the iron," muttered Bonavidas.</p>
                        <p>This accident chilled his crew and their companions. They had witnessed
                            the spectacle, a spectacle horrible beyond telling thus in the midst of
                            the lake's blackness. Only one other vessel was close enough so that its
                            occupants knew of the misfortune. About the others the night wind
                            whistled and the waves beat as before, and no sound that was greater
                            than that of wind and waves, came from the wreck. The other vessel was
                            Rodrigo's. He had them bring him as near and as swiftly as possible. He
                            heard the news then, shouted to him by Bonavidas. He said nothing at
                            all. He sat high up on the bow again and looked steadily across the
                            waters into the southeast.</p>
                        <p>The waves were highest at one in the morning. Before that hour he lay
                            down in the boat's bow, directing his steersman to awake him at the
                            first sign of dawn or at the dying of the wind. He had that rare faculty
                            of snatching a few hours' profound sleep in the midst of excitement.
                            After some time there was a little gray in the east, and such of the
                            ghostly company of sails as had been hidden by the night began to appear
                            across the waste of waters in the first of the day. Rodrigo did not need
                            to be awakened. He was suddenly up, over the prow again, scanning the
                            lake. Before him the long line of peaks, like an immeasurable shadow,
                            rose out of the south. One of his soldiers, who chanced to be familiar
                            with the lake, was called to him.</p>
                        <p>"How long before we arrive at Tizapan?"</p>
                        <p>"I should say not before seven or eight o'clock."</p>
                        <p>"Then we have made poor time," said the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-249" n="241"/>
                        <p>He descended. The east was now turning golden, and day was at hand. He
                            went in silence under the thatch on his way to the stern. The girl lay
                            asleep with a peon's common gray blanket over her. That strange, rich,
                            auburn hair of hers, shining already in the early light, lay flung out
                            on the boat's bottom. Her face was beautiful but sad. It lacked its
                            dimples and the pink flush. He could not resist the temptation to pause,
                            and stood over her looking at the picture she made in sleep. The
                            carrying out of the unheard-of project was near completion. He had made
                            the bold, new stroke. He had gained much time, and hoped to surprise his
                            enemy. Perhaps this very day would see war and blood &#151; for him
                            victory or defeat or death. And this girl had come into the middle of
                            it, and every stroke he made was anguish to her. For a moment he was
                            sickened. But the face was sufficiently full of peace.</p>
                        <p>The northern mountains had become an inseparable, sierra-like line of
                            distant blue. Chapala, far behind and under them, was invisible.
                            Tizapan, only a few miles away, was visible, its green marshes, its
                            indistinguishable mass of adobe walls. Before seven o'clock the river's
                            mouth and the miles of reeds were reached. There was many an eye
                            strained toward the land; but the land was as free from the presence of
                            an enemy as it was when the old prince first looked down on it. There
                            was, from that distance, not a living being to be seen.</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas' vessel was in the lead. He sailed straight into the stream,
                            where the waves were at first inconsiderable, then lacking. The river
                            here was twenty yards in width. It was deep and of still appearance,
                            though flowing swiftly. Its water was yellow with clay. It was flanked,
                            as though by walls. <pb id="VAA3931-250" n="242"/> with dense green
                            reeds among which could be caught the glimmering of the watery marsh.
                            The river turned, making many sharp bends. So the sail came down, and
                            the poles were taken up. Rodrigo, to be on hand for the directing of the
                            others, anchored his vessel outside the mouth. One by one, as they
                            arrived, they plunged into the murky flood of the little stream.</p>
                        <p>A mile in, Bonavidas arrived at dry land. He passed the huts, whose
                            ragged inhabitants were already congregated in wonder. It was seen, too,
                            that the fleet's approach had caused more excitement in the town than
                            had at first been visible. The path thither was soon lined with
                            hastening pedestrians come to see the prodigy. The greater part of the
                            inhabitants of Tizapan, however, remained at home and looked to the
                            barring of doors and windows.</p>
                        <p>Bonavidas arrived at the last spot possible. His boat could go no
                            further. There lay just before him, then, one other <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa,</hi> deserted, sail-furled. It was the only vessel in the
                            river not belonging to the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> fleet. Bonavidas was
                            now in the midst of a dense field of cane that stretched narrowly
                            between road and marsh. He cast out his cable and tied his vessel
                            against the shore. It was speedily unloaded of its cargo of men only.
                            The second and the third poled round the last bend, nosed the first, and
                            tied also. Others came. They were packed in the river as tightly as the
                            beasts were packed in them. Some of them in this narrow portion of the
                            stream, were even too long to turn stern to shore; wherefore the
                            difficulty of unloading was trebled.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on landing, Bonavidas and his men dashed off in search of
                            planks for gangways. There was at that time, as indeed there still is, a
                            place below <pb id="VAA3931-251" n="243"/> the huts on the marsh's edge
                            where <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> were built and launched. There were three
                            in construction there when the soldiers arrived. Timbers were thus more
                            easily obtained than they had been at Chapala. Enough were discovered to
                            make rough gangways for ten boats at once. Slowly the clumsy craft came
                            on, one by one. The river was a thread of strange beads. The crowd,
                            congregating at the main landing, had food for wonder, looking down as
                            they were on cargo after cargo of saddled beasts.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> behind that of Bonavidas were immediately
                            attacked with vim. The planks were up and the work again began. The
                            horses were brought out, worse for wear, stupefied or snorting, but in
                            the main still ready for service. They became then so entranced with
                            freedom that the herding them was no simple matter: as boys will shout
                            and leap about after an unwonted confinement.</p>
                        <p>Half of the vessels were now either unloaded or ready to be. The <hi
                                rend="i">jefe</hi> still remained a mile away at the river's mouth,
                            trusting the landing to his lieutenant and anxiously looking out for the
                            safety of every ship. It was at this time that a surprise came to
                            Bonavidas. He was dashing about at the edge of the thick cane, directing
                            and planning, when he heard a call from within the field. In that moment
                            he chanced to be alone. He stopped, turned, and peered in among the
                            dense growth of sweet, green stalks. He caught a glimpse of scarlet
                            hidden some yards in. The sun blinded him and he put his hand over his
                            eyes and looked again. There were other hands, slender, small hands, in
                            there, holding back the cane, and there was a girl's face, eager and
                            drawn, peering at him. He went in and was hidden from view. He came to
                            her and recognized her.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-252" n="244"/>
                        <p>Long since had the shrewd Bonavidas wondered about this girl. Her coming
                            to Rodrigo's lines before the fight at Ocotlan had been more than a
                            passing event to him. He had noted, on that occasion, every feature of
                            her face; most of all had he marked its changing expressions. That had
                            been a queer occurrence to Bonavidas. He had fancied some things then.
                            When the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> remnant fled through Ocotlan,
                            Bonavidas alone perceived her following. Many a time he had thought it
                            strange that, with her start and her horse, she had not made the chase a
                            more successful one for her companions. Once, later, he had bantered
                            Rodrigo in a sepulchral way about that young tigress. Rodrigo's manner
                            on that occasion was food for thought. In the head of this pale
                            lieutenant there had been and were many speculations.</p>
                        <p>The two were now hidden as effectually as though shut in by walls.</p>
                        <p>"Do you know me?" whispered the girl.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Si,</hi> I know you."</p>
                        <p>"If what I say seems to you worth it, will you act without telling the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> it was I who came?"</p>
                        <p>"If it is n't absolutely necessary."</p>
                        <p>"It shall not be necessary," said she almost angrily. "He would do
                            nothing if he knew it came from me. This I shall make clear to you. Come
                            nearer."</p>
                        <p>He did so, and she fastened her great black eyes on him and began
                            whispering. She caught his hand, too, after a time, and held it with a
                            firm grip. For a quarter of an hour he did not remove his gaze from hers
                            &#151; because he could not.</p>
                        <p>From his companions, laboring on the river bank, Bonavidas had
                            disappeared unnoticed and as suddenly <pb id="VAA3931-253" n="245"/> as
                            though he had gone through the earth. He was inquired for and called. He
                            did not come.</p>
                        <p>"He has gone down the river looking after other <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas,"</hi> said they.</p>
                        <p>The work went on and the quarter of an hour passed. Twenty vessels had
                            arrived and eleven were unloaded. Bonavidas suddenly appeared again,
                            coming from the field of cane. There was even an unusual pallor on his
                            extraordinary visage. He seemed in a blank dream. He stood looking dully
                            at the horses and the boats.</p>
                        <p>"Blood of the Cross!" muttered Bonavidas; "may there be others happier
                            over it than she. If I ever saw hell in a woman's face &#151; and
                            her hand was as cold as lake water."</p>
                        <p>He climbed to one of the <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> that was still
                            thatched. He stood on the roof and looked across the fields to Tizapan.
                            There was a red spot going yonder between the stone walls and
                            disappearing into the town.</p>
                        <p>A half hour later the last of the <hi rend="i">canoas,</hi> a
                            weather-beaten, faint little thing, came slowly into the river's muddy
                            mouth, and Rodrigo's vessel, poled, entered behind it. The thirty were
                            at length drawn up and the line, as close as vessels could be, was
                            complete. The last of the unloading was carried through with extreme
                            haste.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo's first care, when his vessel was made fast a little below the
                            huts, was his prisoner. He had him brought to shore and guarded. His
                            next was the safety of the girl. She would land at once, she said.</p>
                        <p>"And leave me and go to Tizapan," said he, helping her out.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," she replied, not looking at him.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-254" n="246"/>
                        <p>"They say Vicente is not there."</p>
                        <p>"He will come," said she, "and I shall wait. Or if he does not, I can go
                            where he is."</p>
                        <p>"You are sure Doroteo's mother is your friend?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh yes."</p>
                        <p>"At least I must send some one to take care of you."</p>
                        <p>"No, no &#151; I do not want any one. I know the way."</p>
                        <p>"Then good-by. God bless you."</p>
                        <p>There was a little of the pink in her face. She did not lift her eyes to
                            him. She shook hands hastily and said "Thank you." She put her <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo</hi> (it was a dark gray one this time and her dress
                            was gray) more carefully about her with that inimitably graceful
                            movement of the Mexican woman, and went sadly away alone along the dusty
                            road. Some of the auburn hair, escaping from the <hi rend="i"
                                >rebozo,</hi> glistened like gold in the sun. Thus she too, like
                            Pepa, passed between the stone walls and entered the town in the early
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>The unloading was at last accomplished and the <hi rend="i">canoas</hi>
                            abandoned, lying there in a long, ugly line, ungainly things. But the
                            ungainly things had done much, and a wonder went down in the annals of
                            the lake, and among these simple folk Don Rodrigo's name lives on.</p>
                        <p>Some provisions had been brought from Chapala. More were bought at the
                            huts. A breakfast by no means satisfactory was made; the troop was
                            gotten together and hastily mounted, not much worse for the unusual
                            night. As for the horses, of all the more than two hundred but three
                            were found seriously disabled. Rodrigo made diligent inquiry among the
                            people concerning his enemy. The spectators as a <pb id="VAA3931-255"
                                n="247"/> whole made a crowd sufficiently gaunt and tattered. He
                            learned from them only that Vicente was hourly expected.</p>
                        <p>Previous to the departure of the troop there was a conversation of much
                            purport between the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> and Bonavidas. The latter
                            drew his chief aside.</p>
                        <p>"We are to hold the plaza, this is the scheme?" said Bonavidas.</p>
                        <p>"Yes. We have there an open space seventy-five yards square. An enemy can
                            approach only in thin lines."</p>
                        <p>"Good. We will go the roundabout way to the plaza. We will not take this
                            street."</p>
                        <p>"Why?" said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> eying Bonavidas, whom he knew to
                            be a man of reason. "There is no trail the other way. It is two miles
                            farther and over rocks, and the enemy is not here."</p>
                        <p>"I don't want to go this way," muttered Bonavidas, with a half comic
                            feigning of sulkiness.</p>
                        <p>"Come at it, Bonavidas; quick. What do you know?"</p>
                        <p>The lieutenant led the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> further away and whispered
                            with him for some minutes. Whatever arguments he employed, they were
                            effective. He knew how to use his tongue, and to the using of it the
                            peculiarities of his countenance never failed to add force. It is enough
                            to say that, though every other point was elaborated and the next few
                            hours mapped out clearly, he was shrewd enough to make no mention of
                            Josefa Aranja.</p>
                        <p>When the little cavalry moved, they did not proceed by the straight way
                            from river to plaza. They turned into the lake road to the right. They
                            turned again out of that to the left. They cut a new path, and a
                            difficult one, at the foothills, and came at <pb id="VAA3931-256"
                                n="248"/> length to the town's opposite side, where that other
                            street, the only other one save that whose bridge was broken, led into
                            the plaza from the west. They had brought their cowed prisoner with
                            them. The tiny Tizapan jail faced the plaza and was empty. Rodrigo took
                            immediate possession of that prison and, glad to free himself for the
                            time of all thought of his captive, put him in it. That silent person
                            slunk into its farthest corner and was locked in.</p>
                    </div3>
                    <pb id="VAA3931-257" n="[249]"/>
                    <div3 type="chapter">
                        <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
                        <p>IT has been said there was one other <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> in the river
                            when Bonavidas came into it. It belonged to a sharp-eyed Indian who
                            sailed from Mescala for Tizapan the previous morning. The morning wind
                            being from the east, he had drifted toward Chapala that he might pick up
                            the west wind at night and thus arrive at his destination. Having been
                            becalmed during the long afternoon within sight of Chapala's beach, his
                            keen eyes had made out that loading of horses. The sight inspired him
                            with haste. He was, when the wind came, far in advance of Rodrigo. His
                            vessel was a swift one. He arrived at Tizapan, with news burning his
                            tongue's end, at two o'clock in the morning. Running up the long street,
                            the first man he met therein was Doroteo, to whom he told the news. The
                            unheard-of deed seemed at first impossible even to the reckless Quiroz.
                            But he knew the Indian, and, after many questions, became assured of the
                            truth of his report. Then he suddenly burst out:</p>
                        <p>"Damnation! I could do it myself."</p>
                        <p>He stood for a second struck with wonder, turned about, broke into a
                            silent run, and left his informant standing in the street. The latter
                            went on through the town, and such prowlers as were up and in groups
                            about were put in possession of that which he knew.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-258" n="250"/>
                        <p>It was still not three o'clock, and some time before the first of dawn,
                            when Quiroz entered the door of his own <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> Fortino
                            was again asleep in the middle of it, wrapped in his blanket. Anastasio
                            had not wakened. The light had disappeared from the parlor. The mother
                            was shut in her bedroom with her crucifix. Quiroz went to the girl's
                            door and knocked gently. The candle was still burning inside. She opened
                            it and came out. He whispered to her and they entered, closed the door,
                            and sat down on opposite sides of the candle, looking at each other.
                            They staid thus for a full half hour, wherein they talked together
                            constantly, usually in whispers. The course that had been begun in the
                            case of Pepa Aranja, some years before when a new <hi rend="i">jefe
                                politico</hi> came to Chapala, that had arrived at a precipice on
                            the night after the fight at Ocotlan, came to its bad end at the cliff's
                            bottom during that half hour. Toward the end of it she laid a still,
                            cold finger on the hand of Quiroz and said something in a tone rather
                            hard and unlovable. Oddly enough, that very tone put the culminating
                            touch to her long fascination of Quiroz. When he came out she looked
                            haggard. He shut the door and left her within.</p>
                        <p>He went to Anastasio and touched him on the shoulder. The long fisherman
                            sat up and would have spoken. Doroteo flashed a lighted wax match into
                            his face and put his finger on the other's lips. So, after getting up
                            slowly and stretching his limbs &#151; a formidable process
                            &#151; Anastasio followed Quiroz in silence across the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio.</hi> Fortino was not disturbed. The two went to the rear
                            door of the court, opposite that which led to the street. This they
                            opened and went through, finding themselves in a <pb id="VAA3931-259"
                                n="251"/> larger, ruder, unadorned square, about which were stalls.
                            The <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> was asleep in a stall that was like the
                            others save that it was made for him instead of for a horse. At Quiroz's
                            direction the <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> was not disturbed. Anastasio's
                            horse, in a stall opposite, was, at Quiroz's direction also, led out and
                            saddled by Quiroz himself and the fisherman. All was performed with
                            silent speed and a stealth that fitted well Quiroz's lithe body.</p>
                        <p>"I am not any town clock," complained Anastasio. "I want to know why I do
                            things."</p>
                        <p>The horse being saddled, Doroteo took the complainer by the shoulder and
                            gave him full, pointed directions in that confidential tone that is a
                            fine flattery. He told him of the fleet. He explained to him the meaning
                            of the news of the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> coming.</p>
                        <p>"Vicente is to leave Jiquilpan this morning at dawn or earlier. You will
                            meet him half way. Rodrigo will arrive here a full hour before Vicente
                            unless you do miracles. That it be no more Anastasio will see. Make it
                            less, boy, make it less. Ride like a devil. Tell him he cannot hope, in
                            spite of all effort, to arrive here before the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi>
                            Tell him it is the opinion of Quiroz that the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi>
                            will draw up in the plaza and hold that. Tell him to ride straight up
                            the river road. There is no other. I find I was right about the other
                            bridge. It is down, and the one we crossed is the only one. And this is
                            the only approach. The street is narrow and they will have us at a
                            disadvantage; therefore a heavy swift charge is the only stratagem. Tell
                            him to gallop straight into the plaza and lay to it. Tell him that
                            Fortino, the girl, and Quiroz will lie in hiding till he come, but our
                            liberty is worth not one <hi rend="i">centavo</hi> after nine o'clock.
                            If I discover <pb id="VAA3931-260" n="252"/> there is some other stand
                            made than that in the plaza I shall send my <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> out
                            to meet him and give him full knowledge of the ground. If the enemy be
                            in the plaza Fortino and I shall be on the look-out for Vicente. We
                            shall be mounted here at the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door. Tell him we
                            shall ride out and join his van as he comes, and the dash at them shall
                            be as strong as horses can make it. Tell him the Indian claimed there
                            are one thousand horse. This is a lie. He says, too, there were thirty
                            sails. Tell Vicente Quiroz figures that only the Almighty could put more
                            than two hundred horses and two hundred men in thirty <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas.</hi> Tell him, then, they will have the advantage of
                            position but we can overwhelm them with numbers, and that, above all
                            else &#151; and I charge it on you, you long patriot, not to omit
                            this &#151; if I send no word that they are not drawn up in the
                            plaza," &#151; and here it was as well that, for the darkness,
                            Anastasio could not see the infernal gleam of Quiroz's eyes as he
                            finished, "then the end depends on the momentum of the charge."</p>
                        <p>A feeling of exhilaration came into the fisherman. He sighed a long,
                            preliminary sigh. He swung his interminable leg across the saddle and
                            spurred his steed. Doroteo went before him across the rear court to
                            another door still farther to the rear. This door was a full block away
                            from the front street. It, too, opened on a street, &#151; a narrow,
                            dirty thread of a street, &#151; which, to the right, led into the
                            quarter of stenches whereof Anastasio had spoken, and to the left gave
                            entrance, half a block away, into that thoroughfare already mentioned as
                            a continuation of the little stretch of fifteen yards on the south side
                            of Quiroz's house, the fifteen yards <pb id="VAA3931-261" n="253"/>
                            between the only two bends in the way from river to plaza.</p>
                        <p>"Now ride!" cried Quiroz, smotheredly, as the horseman made his exit
                            through the door.</p>
                        <p>Anastasio did so. He turned to the left into the thread of a street. He
                            came to the continuation of the fifteen yard stretch, and turned to the
                            left again into that. It was still dark, and this street was empty. He
                            rode past the opening of the last eighty yard course to the plaza on his
                            right, past the south side of Doña Manuela's unhappy home on his left
                            (from which side looked forth Pepa's barred window with a little
                            candle-light shining through the chinks), turned to the left a third
                            time, and was in the straight way to the river landing. He had thus made
                            almost a complete circuit of the house to reach this course. He went by
                            the shut <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door and its high white wall at a
                            gallop. He put spurs into his animal, and was out of the town and into
                            the course between stone fences. He came thus to the lake-encircling
                            road and wheeled into it to the right. And some of the people at the
                            cluster of huts, aroused long since by the Indian messenger with the
                            news, beheld, at some time before dawn on that early fall morning, a
                            shadowy, lengthy horseman flying away toward Jiquilpan.</p>
                        <p>There was a blacksmith's shop across the alley opposite that rear door of
                            the stable courtyard. Doroteo stepped to that shop after the
                            disappearance of Anastasio, and tried the smoky wooden door that led
                            into it. The door was weak, and, apparently, the place was not occupied
                            at night. Doroteo stepped back into the stable courtyard of his own
                            domains, and shut and barred the entrance. He came silently to the rear
                            door of the dwelling's <hi rend="i">patio</hi>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-262" n="254"/> and entered that, closing it likewise.
                            Fortino was still asleep. The girl's door was still closed, and there
                            was no sign of his mother. The wind was fallen much. The breath of early
                            morning stirred the trees in the clean court, whose silence was
                            unbroken.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz kneeled by the great man wrapped in the blanket on the bricks, and
                            shook him violently. Fortino awoke with a loud grunt.</p>
                        <p>"Pretty dog you are," said Quiroz, affably and softly. "Oh, a good old
                            dog. Dreaming, as a slender young girl dreams, he was, over her lover,
                            while wonders go on and the enemy comes."</p>
                        <p>Fortino rolled heavily, and with excitement, into a sitting posture.</p>
                        <p>"Is the brute on hand!" roared he, with a roar that Doroteo
                            smothered.</p>
                        <p>"The brute is on hand, and Fortino will retrieve his repute. Awake out of
                            these girlish dreams, graceful gazelle."</p>
                        <p>"Where is Anastasio," growled Fortino, snorting like some awakened bull
                            and staring about. "And come at the news. If I fail again on this day
                            &#151; no, if Heaven is still alive and breathing I shall not
                            fail."</p>
                        <p>"Anastasio has gone. He is more wakeful, more alert. I have received word
                            from a <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> whom I once employed, and who lives in
                            Tuxcueco (which, as you know, is on this same southern shore to the
                            west), that Rodrigo is coming. This same <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> came
                            knocking at the door not half an hour ago, having ridden nearly all of
                            the night from his home in a gallop. Don Rodrigo and something less than
                            one thousand cavalry are on the road. They left Tuxcueco after midnight.
                            They do not gallop. They keep their horses fresh. They will arrive <pb
                                id="VAA3931-263" n="255"/> here before the middle of this sweet
                            morning, do you hear? Fortino, dreamer that you are, poet in soul who
                            conceives great deeds, Fortino, your day of action is at hand."</p>
                        <p>The other was up, with his form swelling.</p>
                        <p>"Give me a way that is honest and sure and proves me a man of faith. What
                            is it? Is it the chain? Oh, Son of Mary! my muscles have this night
                            dreamt of the chain!"</p>
                        <p>"It is the chain," said Quiroz, softly, laying four slender fingers on
                            Fortino's breast. "And give thanks for your strength. There is not one
                            other giant in the whole lake region that has muscle enough. Anastasio
                            has this moment ridden off at a gallop toward Jiquilpan with the news
                            for Vicente. He will meet our forces in the middle of the distance. He
                            carries my map of the way and my plans. From the estimate of the
                            messenger who tells me the start and the speed of the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe,</hi> and from my own estimates, Vicente can easily reach
                            Tizapan an hour before him. For this I have sent Anastasio, that he may
                            come full speed. The messenger, too, has seen the map of the town that
                            Rodrigo is using. He says it is Rodrigo's plan not to attempt the
                            perilous and almost impossible way round the foothills; for he has
                            received no word of Vicente's approach and believes himself at least a
                            day ahead of us. He knows, too, of the broken bridge of which I have
                            told you. But he does not know that it has been replaced. He therefore
                            believes that our forces cannot reach the plaza save by this same street
                            from the river. He intends, then, to come up this street. He intends, if
                            the way be clear, to advance and fortify himself in the plaza's middle.
                            But listen &#151;"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-264" n="256"/>
                        <p>Quiroz came very near, keeping his fingers on the other's breast. The
                            perspiration was beginning to come out on the giant's face.</p>
                        <p>"Rodrigo will learn, before he arrives, that his enemy is ahead of him.
                            My map to Vicente marks out the way round, east of the town, to the new
                            bridge. Besides, Anastasio and others of our forces know the circuit
                            perfectly. It is through orchards; there are no roads; but it is easy.
                            Vicente will never enter the river road. He will turn out of the lake
                            road before reaching this one. He will come into the plaza by the street
                            toward the southern mountains, which street leads over the new bridge
                            which Rodrigo believes to be wanting. Do you begin, you slender dreamer,
                            to have visions of the outcome? I figure Rodrigo will arrive something
                            before nine. He will learn at the river, if not sooner, that we hold the
                            plaza. He is a bold and quick fighter. He will not pause. Vicente and
                            his forces will be drawn up in the central square in compact, broad
                            lines. He will have every gun aimed at the narrow throat of the street.
                            The advantage will be ours. Rodrigo will sweep up this street which you
                            call a tunnel; and a tunnel it is, and it shall be a tunnel leading to
                            the glory of Fortino. Mark me; no enemy can see round a corner. My
                            house's wall is at your disposal, and there is a garden's wall opposite.
                            My boy, do you follow?"</p>
                        <p>That buried chuckle that seemed at times to boil within the fisherman's
                            body began to be audible. It rumbled and shook him. It grew heavier and
                            louder, and his folds of flesh were agitated by it.</p>
                        <p>"Come," said Quiroz, and, cat-like, went away to the street door. He
                            paused and went to the <pb id="VAA3931-265" n="257"/> stables, and
                            returned with a strong rope. Then he went out.</p>
                        <p>He was followed by Fortino, who, from the house to the plaza, and from
                            the plaza back to the house, never ceased to chuckle. The news of the
                            approaching fleet was now spreading, and there were new groups on the
                            street hurrying hither and thither or going to the river. They were not,
                            however, so numerous as Quiroz had feared. For his plans the leading of
                            this fisherman through the streets had some peril in it and he knew it.
                            He held Fortino's arm. He hurried him with all speed, and passed those
                            who passed him in fear of the news being spoken. This was the one narrow
                            edge whereon his course went. Once over this, and the giant still
                            blinded by his lies, he believed he could manage the rest. There were
                            other things that blinded Fortino, &#151; his eagerness, his wounded
                            vanity about to be satisfied, his subterranean joy. It is doubtful that
                            cannon could have taken his mind from his laborious cogitations as he
                            went unseeing, unhearing, into the central square.</p>
                        <p>The square was still dark and nearly empty. They came to the coil of
                            chain, and Fortino stooped and felt it caressingly. He ran the rope
                            round its lower coils. Then he knelt with his back to it, and put his
                            hands behind him, under the chain. Quiroz assisted. The rest of the rope
                            was passed over Fortino's head, placed across his broad breast, and
                            knotted again at the chain, after the manner of the ropes of <hi
                                rend="i">cargadores</hi> to this day. The giant swayed a little
                            forward. The mass came up slowly. Quiroz's hands steadied it, and the
                            lifter, holding his breath, was on his feet with the iron coming up, up.
                            He was at length straight and the burden secure.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-266" n="258"/>
                        <p>"She weighs," muttered Fortino, "some hundred and fifty <hi rend="i"
                                >kilos."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Even so great a weight is not really formidable to a very strong Mexican.
                            But as Fortino went ponderously through the darkness his tread on the
                            earth was like the tread of a monster. On the return there was less
                            danger of his hearing the news, for he was even more preoccupied; yet
                            Quiroz, close at his side, scarcely breathed for anxiety. Certain groups
                            and hastening couples discussed the unheard-of fleet. Quiroz broke in
                            with loud remarks to his companion and drowned the voices. Some came
                            near enough to note the burdened man. But the darkness permitted none to
                            recognize the nature of the burden, and a heavily laden <hi rend="i"
                                >cargador,</hi> even so early in the morning, was not a sight worthy
                            of much comment when there were other greater wonders at hand. When at
                            length the two arrived at the centre of the fifteen-yard stretch between
                            the two angles of the street, and at a point near Pepa's window, and
                            some seven yards from the first corner, the carrier paused, knelt slowly
                            down, and deposited the chain on the ground close against the wall of
                            Quiroz's house.</p>
                        <p>"Nobody will steal that," said he, huskily, mopping his brow. "They could
                            take the house first."</p>
                        <p>There were still little beams of light coming through the chinks of
                            Pepa's window. The two speedily turned the corner and entered the <hi
                                rend="i">patio</hi> door. Quiroz not only locked it, but put its
                            only key in his pocket. He led the fisherman into the larger court of
                            the stables, across that and into the little lane into which Anastasio
                            had ridden. As he did so the first of the dawn was in the sky.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-267" n="259"/>
                        <p>"Burst in that door," said he, pointing to the smithy.</p>
                        <p>Fortino did it with evident pleasure. It was a matter of no difficulty to
                            his shoulder. They struck a light within. Fortino seized anvil and
                            hammers; Quiroz loaded himself with bars of iron. Thus burdened they
                            retired across the lane and re-entered the stable court, the door of
                            which Quiroz locked, pocketing that key also. In the court's middle the
                            stolen property was deposited. A portable <hi rend="i">brasero</hi> and
                            charcoal were brought from the kitchen. The maid-servants sleeping in
                            the next room were not awakened by Doroteo's silent tread.</p>
                        <p>"It'll be some trouble heating it with that," said Fortino. "Why couldn't
                            I have done it in the smithy?"</p>
                        <p>"This is better, boy," said Quiroz, whispering. "Secrecy &#151;
                            secrecy is the word. You can heat it by hard blowing of the fire. There
                            are <hi rend="i">ocote,</hi> matches, and a <hi rend="i">soplador.</hi>
                            Now &#151; have you it clear in your head what you need?"</p>
                        <p>"Clear as glory, and here it is."</p>
                        <p>Fortino then laid out his plans to Quiroz with as much fervor and as
                            tingling a pleasure as ever would-be poet displayed in reading his verse
                            to his friend. Quiroz approved.</p>
                        <p>"Make the hook first," said he. "That must be on the opposite side in the
                            wall of the garden of a good neighbor of mine. The wall must be scaled
                            by a ladder, which deed you must do before it is well day, that you may
                            attract less attention. At it, oh my aspiring soul! Glory shall be
                            yours!"</p>
                        <p>And the giant went to work with a force and a haste that made his flesh
                            only some degrees less hot than his furnace.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-268" n="260"/>
                        <p>Before the lighting of the fire Quiroz went across the court to his
                            sleeping <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> and awoke him.</p>
                        <p>"Come," said he.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> followed him into the <hi rend="i">patio,</hi>
                            whereupon Doroteo shut and locked that door also, and pocketed his third
                            key.</p>
                        <p>"Stay here in the <hi rend="i">corredor</hi> a little," said Quiroz; "I
                            shall presently need you."</p>
                        <p>So Fortino was left alone with his chuckling and his labors of glory.</p>
                        <p>Quiroz was again with the girl. It was a half hour after this, and there
                            was now a very little light in the street, that Pepa, let out by Quiroz,
                            who locked the door again after her, went away toward the river. While
                            Doroteo was absent she had changed her dress, and he saw, as she came
                            out in the dawn, that it was red.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                        <p>TO the man in whom there is something of the dreamer it seems there is
                            also likely to be certain bitter compensations for the pleasure of his
                            dreams. Just so much as he is capable of rising into the mood of a
                            rarefied medium, just so much is he likely to be wont to sink into moods
                            of doubt and darkness. For a time the doubt becomes that kind of
                            sickness of spirit which, like the morbidness of the sleepless, sees
                            health nowhere, and can only believe in health by a kind of unimpressive
                            hearsay. This is the price of the dreamer's exaltation. What it was that
                            sunk Vicente into a bad mood when he left Jiquilpan, he himself did not
                            know. There had come into his mind at times some shadow of sorrow
                            concerning the girl, &#151; he would not have called it doubt. He
                            was given, too, to a deep and comprehensive speculation always, which
                            may have been often too far beyond the immediate task in hand. Otherwise
                            he might have doubted Quiroz, for he knew something of Quiroz. Yet,
                            thought he, to what cause could an adventurer better cling than this?
                            The very nature of his progress and his project seemed to him certain to
                            hold Quiroz. Then, too, it is hard for a man of Vicente's nature to
                            realize perfidy of the blackest kind till he sees it proved. Hence,
                            wherein he was weakest was wherein the church and its training had given
                            him some little of the nature of the <pb id="VAA3931-270" n="262"/>
                            churchly philosopher who loses sight, in bigger schemes, of one small
                            criminal in his way.</p>
                        <p>The mounting of his troops had been pushed steadily on. He now had horses
                            for a large majority, &#151; a number approaching fourteen hundred.
                            As his force marched out of Jiquilpan shortly before dawn, this cavalry
                            rode in advance of the smaller infantry. The sense of coming danger was
                            heavy on Vicente as they went. He was in the lead &#151; silent.
                            Somehow his thoughts would not mount over this day and go on to victory.
                            They wandered rather in the past and stopped short this side of
                            Tizapan.</p>
                        <p>"And he set cherubim and a flaming sword that turneth every way,"
                            muttered he. "Ay, the strong man will come &#151; before the century
                            ends. But what are you, with your old Aztec blood, that you should pass
                            those cherubim and that sword?"</p>
                        <p>He became restless with that sense of danger over him, and eager to dash
                            into it and have it done. The sun came up, and the day over which his
                            thoughts could not leap was begun. It was scarcely an hour later that
                            Anastasio's thin figure and flying horse burst with ungainly speed on
                            his view. The message was delivered and communicated to the troops. They
                            had been advancing some hours at a brisk gait. They were somewhat
                            stunned by the news of that bold move of Rodrigo's, but when they knew
                            Doroteo's estimate of the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> numbers they shouted
                            and laughed over it, and were eager to be on. Vicente only smiled when
                            he heard of the fleet. He knew now that the greatest speed might be all
                            too slow. He abandoned the infantry, with the command that it should
                            follow as rapidly as possible. He ordered the cavalry forward with such
                            speed as was at all compatible with the distance.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-271" n="263"/>
                        <p>The line galloped on, grinding the trail into dust that swirled in clouds
                            behind. An hour, and there was many a horse in a lather, but the beat of
                            the gallop ceased not. Vicente himself, at the front with Anastasio, set
                            the pace. Anastasio's horse, because of its long journey hither, began
                            to give out. It could not stand this continued charge. Anastasio fell
                            behind. That lank rider found himself at length the last of the line.
                            Francisco, in a brotherly mood, conceived with extreme suddenness and
                            acted upon with unwonted alacrity, lagged likewise, using great and
                            highly unselfish energy to assist his comrade on with his steed. A
                            terrible passion fell on Anastasio, a thing exceeding rare to that
                            languid fisherman. Whereas for years previous he had not felt anger, it
                            was as though the years heaped it all now within him. Hence, raging over
                            the prospect of dropping far behind and seeing none of the fight (a
                            prospect by no means so annoying to Francisco), he beat his animal with
                            clattering vigor, employing for this purpose arms, feet, knees, spurs,
                            even the whole of his legs. Finally, when the horse would, in spite of
                            all torments, stop still for a siesta in the road's middle, Anastasio
                            got off and threw rocks at it. Francisco's excessive sympathy at this
                            pass was worthy of a more appreciative object. He paused likewise,
                            industriously absorbed in his condolence. He was so furiously berated by
                            Anastasio for this misplaced zeal, that he at length reluctantly pursued
                            the flying troops. Hence it was that the deserted philosopher entered
                            Tizapan a half hour after the last of the cavalry had disappeared in the
                            narrow street.</p>
                        <p>By half-past eight, such was the speed of the forced gallop, the troop
                            was within less than two leagues from the town. It was here that another
                            messenger <pb id="VAA3931-272" n="264"/> met it. He was Doroteo's <hi
                                rend="i">mozo,</hi> riding at a hard gallop also. The line was not
                            halted; the messenger merely fell in with it. He handed a paper to
                            Vicente, who read it as he rode. It was this: <text>
                                <body>
                                    <div type="letter">
                                        <p>They are drawn up in the plaza, watching the streets.
                                            They are a little over two hundred, all mounted. They
                                            believe you are near and that they have no time to
                                            fortify. Come straight up the river street, which is
                                            open. We will join you. Victory is ours. But it depends
                                            on the vigor of the charge, for their position is bad
                                            for us. Hence, ride hard.</p>

                        <p>The news was passed back and the order for a lessening of speed. The last
                            two leagues were covered on a brisk trot only, that the horses might be
                            a little fresher. The town was then suddenly at hand. Before entering it
                            a halt was ordered. The leader believed it unnecessary to attack his
                            enemy with his entire force, a force whose numbers would have produced a
                            congestion in the street and plaza embarrassing if not fatal. He
                            therefore chose less than a third of his cavalry to accompany him in the
                            first charge. He formed them five abreast; commanded the reserve to
                            proceed to the town and remain in waiting in the street; and gave the
                            word to advance.</p>
                        <p>They came to the river road that cuts the lake road at right angles.
                            Vicente wheeled into it, seeing the mud huts, the marsh, the rising
                            ducks, the glistening mirror of the lake, and thirty empty <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas</hi> lifting slim masts from the river. The cavalry beat up
                            between the stone walls to the town. The order was given that the charge
                            in full gallop, boldly, should be entered on at once when the first of
                            the low adobe houses that lined the street should be reached. A last
                            black doubt swept, then, over Vicente. He remembered <pb
                                id="VAA3931-273" n="265"/> afterward that even as they struck the
                            gallop there came down over him some sense of the rottenness of the
                            whole human fabric. He was filled with a calm ferocity after that. He
                            felt like a spirit leaping into fire. He found himself saying again, as
                            they began the last mad charge through the shaft:</p>
                        <p>"And he set cherubim and a flaming sword &#151;"</p>
                        <p>The town had till then lain in comparative silence. It had been, as it
                            were, hugging itself in a chill anticipation. The streets were long
                            since deserted. There was indeed a band of more than two hundred
                            horsemen drawn up in the plaza, with weapons aimed at the river way. The
                            only other bridge, that had led into the plaza from the other direction,
                            was as lacking as it had been when Doroteo saw the place of it in the
                            night. By the third street, from the west, Rodrigo had come. As he rode
                            into the plaza Bonavidas had been unable longer to keep back the source
                            of his knowledge. Rodrigo turned white as he listened. Remorse fell on
                            him as though he had been a criminal. But he was there. His men were
                            there. The enemy was at hand.</p>
                        <p>There was silence without the house of Quiroz. The iron chain was still
                            in the street, though there had been, earlier, a change in the position
                            of it. The swirls of extraordinary colors shone as gaudily on the walls
                            as though they expressed some type of self-assurance and vanity. The
                            colors had been the first in the street to come out of the obscurity of
                            the night. The earliest dawn had had its first, silent sport with the
                            green and the red. Not long after hat earliest dawn, and when the street
                            was still dimly and grayly lit, Quiroz and the giant had come stealthly
                            out of the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door, closed it, and rounded the
                            corner into the fifteen-yard stretch where the chain <pb
                                id="VAA3931-274" n="266"/> was still coiled against the wall. They
                            crossed the street here to its opposite side. There was then (and in
                            some parts of the same town there are still similar ones) a small fruit
                            orchard of pomegranates, <hi rend="i">aguacates,</hi> oranges, etc.,
                            mingled with a little coffee. It was walled in on two sides by houses,
                            and on the side next the street by a thick adobe wall as high as the
                            houses themselves and, like them, capped with tiles. Over the tiles'
                            tops were seen the tops of trees stirring a little with the morning's
                            breath. The great Fortino bore a ladder, and there were iron and
                            instruments in the hands of Quiroz. This little turn of the street was
                            deserted. Its dust and stones seemed to be asleep in the dim gray.</p>
                        <p>The ladder was put against the garden wall opposite the house, and the
                            two climbed up to the tiles and pulled it after them. They then lowered
                            it within and descended. The trees cast a deep shade. The scent of
                            orange blossoms was strong, and the slick leaves of coffee, even in the
                            gloom, had begun to shine. There was no sound save that of the men
                            themselves or the occasional falling of a purple alligator pear from
                            some unseen height. Then the sweat, which with him was ever a mental
                            product, came out on the ox-like Fortino and he seized the tools and
                            began digging in the adobe wall at a height a little lower than a man's
                            shoulder. Quiroz stood over him urging him on in suave whispers.</p>
                        <p>"They will know," said Quiroz, "that Fortino, the slender, conceived it,
                            executed it, and wears his glory as he wears his grace. Let other heroes
                            be like this. There will be no strutting out of Fortino. It is to keep
                            faith, to redeem pledges, to establish again that repute that the
                            sensitive mind felt gone. Ah, these are the world's noblemen! At it, my
                                <pb id="VAA3931-275" n="267"/> boy! &#151; you are a foot and a
                            half through. I should say you are more than half the distance. This
                            wall is never a nun's finger thicker than a <hi rend="i">vara.</hi> God!
                            this place might be a nunnery and we getting into it, an idea
                            sufficiently full of poetry if I had time to carry it out."</p>
                        <p>"Give me only ten minutes," growled the giant, hoarsely.</p>
                        <p>Three quarters of an hour after entering, the two and the ladder were
                            again in the street, which had grown lighter. They passed some excited
                            men and women who came a moment too late to see from whence they had
                            taken that means of ascent which Fortino again bore on his shoulder.
                            They rounded the corner to the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door and went in,
                            at which moment the huge one burst into a private and fearful laugh that
                            was a kind of monstrous exultation. And from the garden wall, where they
                            had worked, protruded some inches into the street a heavy iron hook
                            capable of withstanding a mighty strain, for it was but the curved end
                            of a bar that ran three feet through the solid adobe and was clamped on
                            the far side.</p>
                        <p>In the house Doña Manuela was again to be seen, and still in the light
                            blue. Doña Manuela's hair, turning gray, was arranged but loosely, and a
                            curl, grayer than the rest, fell down on her cheek.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Doroteo!" cried she, running out to the <hi rend="i">corredor</hi>
                            as the men came in. "I was driven very unhappy, for you and the girl
                            were gone! Where were you? And be very careful, my son, lest you take
                            some false step that you would regret till the day of your death, which
                            Mary grant it may be here in your bed and peaceful."</p>
                        <p>"I am more careful than St. John when he wrote <pb id="VAA3931-276"
                                n="268"/> books and recorded visions, <hi rend="i">Mamacita."</hi>
                            He led Fortino to the rear <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> let him through, and
                            whispered: "At it again, thou patriotic heart, and let purgatory's
                            flames be slower!"</p>
                        <p>"This is true," said the anxious lady as he returned to her; "wild and
                            uncareful ways were ever unnatural to you, Doroteo. But I am sometimes
                            afraid you may be led astray. She is really a quiet girl, Doroteo? Is
                            she a good girl, such as your old mother would want you to keep company
                            with?"</p>
                        <p>She passed her hand over his face, looked up at him, eagerly, and ran her
                            fingers under his sombrero and through his hair.</p>
                        <p>"I have never seen anything about her that any Castilian or Moorish
                            traditions could blush at," said he. "She will be coming back, and as
                            modest as white violets, I'll swear by any kind of an image."</p>
                        <p>An hour later, during which hour there had been hammering in the rear
                            court, the street door, which Doroteo had not again locked, was opened
                            and Pepa came in. She carried a set expression of the features during
                            those hours, and a deep and strange gaze was in her eyes, a gaze that
                            frightened Doña Manuela, true-hearted Doña Manuela, who, though all she
                            thought was mistaken, though she clung only to false old beliefs
                            concerning that handsome son than whom there could have been no greater
                            stranger to her on the sad face of the earth, still held the great good,
                            the glory that will shine because it is faith when the earth is dead.
                            She had made many little fluttering plans about going to Pepa, when Pepa
                            should come in, and putting her arm about her and having a good,
                            satisfying talk with the girl. But when she saw Pepa, the fluttering
                            changed and she could not approach her.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-277" n="269"/>
                        <p>Doroteo locked the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door after the girl. She said
                            nothing to him of her success, but he knew it from her face.</p>
                        <p>"Is it ready?" asked she, her eye burning, but with a tone not soft or
                            satisfied, and on hearing which Doña Manuela went away slowly under the
                                <hi rend="i">corredor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"The garden, yes &#151; a minute more and the other likewise. The red
                            again! Passion of God! &#151; I love you in red! I made it a rule
                            when I was still a boy that I would never play any color but the red.
                            There must be a red fire in my very soul, else I am born near hell and
                            hear the crackle of the blaze. I am like a bull, that the color maddens
                            me. I never see it that something in me does not stir as though it would
                            leap. I can shut my eyes any time in the night and see a red stream,
                            like blood, flowing hot through my brain. Ideas, people, deeds,
                            associate themselves to me with colors, and if the color is red, the
                            idea, the person, the deed is mine or I will die getting it. Pepa, if I
                            shut my eyes and think of you &#151; <hi rend="i">Muerte de
                                Dios!</hi> there was never a color so deep, so maddening as that. It
                            is as though my soul were suddenly a mass of flame. You have dressed
                            thus for me on the great day!"</p>
                        <p>He went away to the door of the rear court. She had not smiled at him,
                            and when he turned, having said she had dressed in red for him, there
                            was a high scorn on her face. He came back with Fortino, who was
                            absorbed in his deed to as great an extent as the mass of his body was
                            great. Fortino carried more tools and more iron, and there were still
                            noises in him, and when he passed Pepa he emitted heat like the
                            lime-kiln to which Anastasio had compared him. He went with Doroteo to
                            Pepa's room and the two <pb id="VAA3931-278" n="270"/> entered it, she
                            following. Doña Manuela, bewildered and bent at the far end of the <hi
                                rend="i">corredor,</hi> scared at the tools and the iron, came
                            slowly up, trembling and murmuring:</p>
                        <p>"Oh Doroteo! Oh Doroteo!"</p>
                        <p>The room Pepa had occupied was the corner room; that is to say, its east
                            side was upon that part of the street which was the straight stretch to
                            the river, its south side was on the fifteen-yard stretch between the
                            two angles. There were two windows in it, one in each of the two sides
                            named. The east window therefore, looked out on the straight way over
                            which cavalry would pass before reaching the first corner. That window
                            was, indeed, not far from the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door, which led
                            out into that way and faced in the same direction. The south window gave
                            view across the street to the garden from whose wall protruded the iron
                            hook. Mention has been made of the bars that protected these windows.
                            The feature is a common one &#151; nearly a universal one &#151;
                            in Mexico to-day. From the high top to the low bottom near the floor,
                            there extended over the outer sides of these two apertures iron bars a
                            few inches apart, like the bars of a jail. These were bent at the ends
                            to right angles, and the ends were inserted deep in the outer adobes
                            surrounding the windows and fastened securely; so that the plane of the
                            bars was a few inches beyond the plane of the wall. On this account one
                            could stand on the broad sill and, looking up and down the street, see
                            the whole of it, which view would have been impossible had the bars been
                            flush with the wall. This, too, is the common arrangement to-day.</p>
                        <p>The hook in the garden adobes was opposite a spot corresponding to one
                            nearly in the southwest <pb id="VAA3931-279" n="271"/> corner of the
                            room, to the right of the south window as one looked out, and some seven
                            yards from the street's angle, for the apartment was large. To this
                            corner went the giant in his labors of glory. Here, too, he assaulted
                            the plastering (tinted blue and with lines and stencil-figures of red
                            and brown) and came to the adobe and assaulted that, the drops running
                            from his face, his throat giving out grunts. Doroteo and the girl stood
                            silently behind him and Doña Manuela crept to the door. Then she cried
                            out:</p>
                        <p>"Oh my son! This will make an ill appearance. Doroteo! Doroteo! what is
                            it? What terrible thing are you going to do? I have felt it all night
                            that you would do something that you would regret. What is the meaning
                            of this awful hole?"</p>
                        <p>It was at this moment that there came a knocking on the iron knocker of
                            the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door. She did not heed it, perhaps did not
                            hear it. Pepa was as still as a mute, watching the tools in Fortino's
                            hands. It would have taken a many times more ominous knocking than that
                            to wake Fortino from the internal frenzy of his dream. For indeed the
                            knocking was a little timid. Doroteo, who had stood near the east window
                            as though guarding it, gave no appearance of perceiving the knock.</p>
                        <p>"The truth is, mother," said he, "that my enemies are coming up this
                            street to sack the town. Fortino, this patriot here, is going to stretch
                            the big chain across for a little impediment. The idea is masterful and
                            all Fortino's."</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi> let them come &#151; let them come!" muttered
                            Fortino from the corner.</p>
                        <p>"Oh Doroteo!" cried the old lady, throwing herself upon him. "I beseech
                            you to leave the war alone! &#151; Come, come &#151; your life
                            shall be quieter!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-280" n="272"/>
                        <p>There was a second knocking on the iron knocker at the door, louder but
                            still unheeded.</p>
                        <p>"You would make a coward of me, mother," asked he blandly, "when the
                            enemy comes to sack the town and carry you off?"</p>
                        <p>"No," she answered with sadness, "they would n't want a poor old soul
                            like me." She sank into a painful revery, still clinging to him, during
                            which there was a third knocking, louder and still more prolonged. "Is
                            it necessary to the war, all this, and the terrible hole?" asked she.
                            "Doroteo, I wanted you to follow the natural bent of your nature and
                            &#151; Oh Holy Mary! is that hook out there in Don Ana-cleto's
                            garden wall for the chain? Why Doroteo! if some of the horses trip on it
                            the riders will be killed!"</p>
                        <p>The fourth knocking, irregular, like that of one in great haste and
                            growing fearful. Doroteo moved to the window and looked out, saying:</p>
                        <p>"Not likely, <hi rend="i">Mamacita.</hi> Ah, it is the auburn-haired one.
                            How in the name of miracles did that little bird flutter here?"</p>
                        <p>He and Pepa exchanged glances, and Pepa went out, followed quickly by
                            Doña Manuela.</p>
                        <p>"Auburn hair, did he say?" murmured the latter. Whose? &#151; was it
                            hair he said? Ah! Clarita! Clarita! Oh little lady &#151; how did
                            you come &#151; and you had n't forgotten me!"</p>
                        <p>"I came in one of the boats," said Clarita, admitted by Pepa. She was
                            tired and wretched. She had grown very much afraid at the door, thinking
                            no one would come to let her in, being alone in the town without
                            friends, and all the danger and the fear of battles, and the fear for
                            him accompanying her. "I came because I &#151; I wanted to come.
                            This <pb id="VAA3931-281" n="273"/> is all," said she, taking off the
                            gray <hi rend="i">rebozo,</hi> whereat the auburn hair shone.</p>
                        <p>"But you have come to a terrible place," groaned Doña Manuela. "Come
                            away; I will give you something to eat."</p>
                        <p>"Only a little coffee, Doña Manuela. Pepa, Pepa! I did not know you were
                            here. Then Vicente, too, has come? Pepa, I think you are not well; you
                            do not look well. There is Doroteo in the room, too &#151; oh tell
                            me, has Vicente come!"</p>
                        <p>Doroteo had stepped to the room door and closed and locked it.</p>
                        <p>"He has not come," said Pepa, "but he is coming in an hour."</p>
                        <p>It was like a soft spring day in the midst of winter, this coming of the
                            gentle one. She walked across the <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> clothed in
                            her faithfulness and her innocence, and none of the crime came near her.
                            She ate a little in the kitchen, wept over and fondled by Doña Manuela,
                            whose whole heart and all its frozen fears and longings melted with a
                            rush before Clarita; to all of which Clarita smiled a little and had the
                            dimples out, and was eager, in her sadness, for the hour to pass.
                            Meanwhile Pepa stood just outside the door of the room wherein Fortino
                            was at work, and kept her gaze, a hard one, on the kitchen, and guarded
                            the secret. Afterward she went to the kitchen door and said
                            abruptly:</p>
                        <p>"Did the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> say how he would come to the plaza?"</p>
                        <p>"No," said Clarita, "I did n't talk to him about that."</p>
                        <p>Pepa went back to the door of her own room relieved. Then Clarita's
                            arrival was of less moment than she had thought probable. Clarita, too,
                            would <pb id="VAA3931-282" n="274"/> suppose Rodrigo's course to be up
                            this street. Yet it were best to keep her away from Fortino till the
                            work should be done. Quiroz came and spoke a moment to Pepa, and
                            returned and again closed the door.</p>
                        <p>"Do you know who has come?" he was now saying to the sweating fisherman,
                            kneeling down and laying a hand on the other's shoulder as he worked.
                            "Clarita. She came by one of my own <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> from
                            Chapala. She has seen Vicente, and she, soul of honesty, is our witness
                            that Vicente has arrived. She came from the plaza and he has sent her
                            here for safety. Have you kept your ears alert, my mountainous one
                            &#151; have you listened for the tramp of horses?"</p>
                        <p>"I have listened and there has been no horse pass by this street," said
                            Fortino, coming to the outer air at last and completing the hole with a
                            grunt of satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>"And why? Because the scheme goes on as Quiroz said. Vicente has entered
                            the town by the other bridge. At this moment his spurs are clinking in
                            the plaza. Do you know, old hungerer for deeds, I long since sent my <hi
                                rend="i">mozo</hi> to lie in wait for Rodrigo at the lake road from
                            Tuxcueco and (for my <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> is unknown to that doomed
                                <hi rend="i">jefe</hi>) to tell him of Vicente's readiness. Hence
                            Rodrigo is no such fool as not to be in full gallop when the pretty play
                            is made. Come &#151; out; and up with the chain."</p>
                        <p>"No," said Fortino.</p>
                        <p>"What is it now!"</p>
                        <p>"I shall out and prepare, <hi rend="i">si señor,"</hi> said Fortino. "But
                            the chain comes not up till the horses are on it. Ha! ha! Give my strong
                            arm one good last chance!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-283" n="275"/>
                        <p>"Fortino, Fortino, my boy, can you be sure of it thus? It would take
                            strength like that of a bull and a speed straight out of Heaven!"</p>
                        <p>"Fah!" thundered Fortino, going to the door. "I shall not risk their
                            seeing it and pulling up. Ha! ha! Ha! ha!"</p>
                        <p>Laughing wildly he went out across the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> and into
                            the street. He turned the corner and came to the hole he had made
                            through the gaudy wall. He lifted an end of the coil that lay there and
                            passed it through the aperture to Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>"What are you doing?" cried a last passer-by, hurrying away to
                            safety.</p>
                        <p>"It is not any of your damned business!" cried Fortino, and returned to
                            the <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> and into the room, still laughing.</p>
                        <p>So they clamped that chain end immovably inside the room with strong
                            iron, which, before it could break through, must tear out a good fourth
                            of the wall; and it may be as well to remind the reader again that the
                            adobe walls of a good house are of great thickness and solidity.</p>
                        <p>It was approaching nine o'clock when the fisherman again went out on to
                            the street, his form swelling and his eyes seeing nothing. The houses
                            might have been pearl, so full of an exaltation was he, a righteous,
                            faithful exaltation, a desire to do good, strong deeds in an honest
                            cause &#151; ay, the streets might have been paved with gold.</p>
                        <p>Doroteo locked the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door after him and went and
                            locked also the door of the room wherein he had worked. So that chosen
                            apartment was left empty with its clamps of iron and its chain end and
                            its hole in the wall. Quiroz handled the two heavy keys for one
                            hesitating second. Each was monstrous, that of <pb id="VAA3931-284"
                                n="276"/> the room especially so, being a foot in length and of
                            heavy metal. There were reasons why Quiroz deemed it best that his
                            person should not be encumbered by such a weight of iron. It was in that
                            second that Pepa went out by the rear door that led into the second
                            court. She proceeded thence into the alley and streets Anastasio had
                            traversed. Quiroz cast a glance at the kitchen. His mother was still
                            there with Clarita, but she would be hovering over him in a minute
                            more.</p>
                        <p>He slipped into the glassy and unhome-like parlor and hid the two keys
                            amidst the artificial fruit, the cracked crystal <hi rend="i"
                                >chirimoya,</hi> the slices of melon, the china mango &#151;
                            buried them in that uninviting heap of painted lusciousness. Then he
                            came stealthily out and, as silently as the girl had gone, went through
                            the back court and into the alley by the smithy. He did not lock those
                            two rear doors but closed them, leaving a quicker retreat if it should
                            be needed. At the smithy he turned to the left in the lane and came,
                            after a few yards, to that prolongation of the fifteen-yard stretch by
                            which Anastasio had entered the latter when he rode past the house and
                            away. Quiroz, just before coming to the first of the fifteen yards,
                            found Pepa, like a red statue, standing at the corner of the street that
                            led into the plaza. She was waiting there, hid from the view of any one
                            in the plaza itself, but being so near the corner that merely a step
                            would be sufficient to bring the gleam of a red dress to the eyes of
                            those waiting. Quiroz passed her, singing softly:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"She staked her love upon the red &#151;"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>He passed by the opening of the street that led into the plaza and,
                            looking thither, saw cavalry standing. <pb id="VAA3931-285" n="277"/> He
                            went on and entered the fifteen-yard stretch, in the middle of which was
                            Fortino. Fortino's laughter had sunk into the subterranean chuckle. The
                            chain of massive links was stretched across the road, but lying on the
                            ground. It was almost twice as long as was necessary. So he (standing
                            against the garden wall and by the hook) held it near its middle, the
                            useless portion being coiled at the wall's foot. But even so much of
                            that unbreakable line of iron was of great weight, and the hook was
                            nearly as high as his shoulder.</p>
                        <p>"Can you do it?" said Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si, lo haré,"</hi> was the untroubled response.</p>
                        <p>The street was so narrow that the distance of seven yards to the first
                            corner would prevent Fortino's being seen by the approachers till they
                            were near rounding the turn. Fortino was cogitating on this point.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si</hi> &#151; but they must be nearer than that
                            &#151; nearer than that," muttered he.</p>
                        <p>"No!" cried Quiroz with passion. "In the name of all that is holy, up
                            with it before they make the turn!"</p>
                        <p>"Not so!" grunted the preoccupied Fortino.</p>
                        <p>"I tell you yes," whispered Doroteo. "At least leave it to me. Give your
                            attention, man, to the chain. I will tell you when to swing it up. Wait
                            not too long!"</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Vamos a ver,"</hi> responded Fortino.</p>
                        <p>When Quiroz had left the house he had for a moment forgotten the
                            properties of a mother's eyes and ears. Doña Manuela, in the kitchen,
                            had seen his stealthy entrance into the parlor and had heard the slight
                            rattle of the crystal fruit. When he went out, she ran after him,
                            calling him:</p>
                        <p>"I want you with me, Doroteo!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-286" n="278"/>
                        <p>But he had not heard and was gone. She came back and, Clarita having
                            drunk her coffee, Doña Manuela, followed by the girl (who was beginning
                            to be frightened by the lady's manner), ran to the parlor and, knocking
                            the crystal <hi rend="i">chirimoya</hi> to the glazed brick floor where
                            it burst into a score of pieces, discovered the keys.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita!" cried she, "they are leading him into a secrecy that is as
                            unnatural to him as it is painful to his mother. Come, I feel that I
                            must open the door of the room."</p>
                        <p>And she went to it, the sky blue dress fluttering. In her fulness of
                            heart and desire to talk of the nature of Doroteo, she had not at all
                            explained to Clarita the matter of the chain. She had chattered on as
                            though the other knew of it, and Clarita was by now quite bewildered.
                            The door was unlocked and the two went in, and the old lady with fear
                            and trembling pointed at the end of the chain clamped against the wall
                            in the corner.</p>
                        <p>"These are the awful things he is led into. Oh, Clarita, my little
                            friend! my little friend!"</p>
                        <p>Clarita stared at it. Then she came a step nearer the south window and
                            looked out and saw Fortino, the huge, the ugly, standing against the
                            opposite wall, his loose white trousers flapping in a little breeze, his
                            blue sash brilliant, his head bare, his eyes staring in a trance at the
                            corner, the chain in his hand. Quiroz was near him. The street was as
                            silent as though the town were dead. The sun came into it and was yellow
                            on the stones, the earth, and the adobes; the breath from the lake
                            lifted the dust aimlessly and swirled it about in little funnels. She
                            was horrified. She felt all the blood in her veins as though it stood
                            suddenly still.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-287" n="279"/>
                        <p>"What are they going to do, Doña Manuela?" asked she, whispering it.</p>
                        <p>"Why, they say their enemy is coming and they will stop him," cried the
                            other. "Oh! I cannot look &#151; yet, yet &#151; I will have to!
                            I cannot &#151; yet I cannot refrain. Nay, nay, I will not
                            look!"</p>
                        <p>Clarita's face turned suddenly gray. She had been too young, too sincere
                            and innocent, to dream of it before &#151; but had she had time to
                            think she would now have known the great, new thing that was born in her
                            heart. Don Rodrigo and his men were to plunge into that trap. She went
                            to the east window, the window that gave view toward the river, and
                            stepped up on its ledge and looked down. Far away there were horses
                            galloping here at a fearful speed. She was sick and clung to the iron.
                            "At least," said she, "it will save my brother. Oh Vicente! Vicente! the
                            chain will save you!" So she stood, fascinated, unable to move, and
                            prayed to Mother Mary, while Doña Manuela, seeing by the girl's face
                            that the moment was come, crouched in the room and covered her ears and
                            her eyes with her hands.</p>
                        <p>The galloping troop came on and its speed seemed increased. They were
                            within two hundred yards of her when she recognized him. The knowledge
                            came to her like the stab of a knife, but it gave her thought and
                            swiftness. She leaped from the window with a cry, ran from the room and
                            to the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door, the one idea, to stop him,
                            crystallized in her brain. She pushed and beat upon the door. It was
                            locked and the terrified Doña Manuela had the key.</p>
                        <p>"The key! The key!" cried the girl, rushing frantically upon her. The old
                            woman could not realize it or obey. It was too late. The horses' gallop
                            was heard close to the spot. Clarita ran again <pb id="VAA3931-288"
                                n="280"/> with a wild despair to the east window and seized the iron
                            and called. It was he indeed. He was close to her. He was passing her.
                            Madly she shrieked his name &#151; the gallop drowned it and he had
                            gone by, pulling up slightly to wheel the corner, wheeling it out of her
                            sight. She was not one to bury her face. Her terror was too vast. She
                            was at once at the south window, springing to its sill, seeing the
                            chain, crying to him piteously.</p>
                        <p>Outside there had come to Fortino too the sound of the hoofs. He gave one
                            more fierce laugh and steeled his mighty muscles. The cavalry came
                            bursting round the corner upon him. He waited till the last second. He
                            heard Quiroz's shrill scream, "Up with it! Up with it!" and felt
                            Quiroz's fists beating his great back. He put out all his monstrous
                            strength and the line of iron links swung up. He saw, then, Vicente's
                            face, a fine, set, white face, and the eyes bent ahead. He recognized
                            it, yet he did not recognize it. The time was too short. The great deed
                            was too strong on him &#151; bewilderment could not stop it; and
                            Quiroz was screaming in his ears. Confused, he saw Clarita in the window
                            beating the bars she could not break, pale as death and screaming. His
                            neck swelled in bristling folds and his muscles were steel. The chain
                            swung up and a link of it fell over the hook, and the cavalry, which in
                            that second had rushed on to its doom, crashed against the unyielding
                            iron barrier. Vicente in front, was thrown forward, over his horse's
                            head, over the chain, falling stunned in the street beyond. His steed,
                            with those beside it was hurled back on haunches and the riders were
                            cast to earth. The next beasts were upon them, and the next and the next
                            dashed into the struggling heap Men shrieked and went down amidst
                            trampling hoofs <pb id="VAA3931-289" n="[]"/>

                            <pb id="VAA3931-290" n="281"/> The whole distance to the corner and
                            beyond it became one fearful mass of indiscriminate ruin; till, owing to
                            the fact that there was necessarily some little distance between each
                            successive five and the following five, the onward charge was at length
                            stopped with all but less than one hundred pulled short in the river
                            road, safe but panic-stricken, turning, fleeing.</p>
                        <p>At the moment of the shock the red dress had appeared suddenly in the
                            street that led to the plaza. A moment more and the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe's</hi> troop was down on the ruin. There was scarcely a shot
                            fired, for there was scarce need of it. In the main, Rodrigo's men
                            leaped from their horses and secured their prisoners. Those at whom they
                            would have shot were round a corner, and there was no wading through
                            that mass of man and beast. Vicente was picked up and carried into
                            safety as were many more, and guarded. The work of extrication went on,
                            and the mass was untangled. Rodrigo found himself trembling as he
                            worked, as though from fear; and, looking up once through the bars of
                            the window, he perceived the form of a girl lying there as though dead,
                            and he saw that her hair was auburn.</p>
                        <p>On Fortino the terrible mistake, for mistake as yet he believed it, broke
                            with a force beyond bitterness. The giant was rendered mad. He cast his
                            eyes about like a dying ox. He saw the red dress of Pepa among his
                            enemies. He grasped at the last straw to save his honor. He remembered,
                            in the midst of that infernal confusion, that he had once promised to
                            carry that girl out of danger, if danger should arise. He believed her
                            beset by enemies. With a hideous sound that was more of a roar than a
                            cry, and seeming crazy as the craziest lunatic, he burst through the
                            enemy, man and horse, with a force like the force of a warship. He swung
                            his arms and broke limbs as <pb id="VAA3931-291" n="282"/> he went. He
                            came to the girl, and seized her from the ground, lifting her with a
                            grip it would have taken ten men to loose. He plunged then with her,
                            through the last obstruction, crying out something in a strange Indian
                            tongue, and went striding away. She called to him and pleaded with him,
                            and all but cursed him. She writhed and tore at his hair and face. It
                            had no more effect on that striding giant than would have had a swarm of
                            flies.</p>
                        <p>"Fortino can do something! O my Lord! He can take care of <hi rend="i"
                                >ladies!</hi> This is the field for the cursed &#151; ladies
                            &#151; ladies!"</p>
                        <p>He strode on, turned the corner into the little lane, and came to the
                            smithy, still crying out, still heeding not the writhings and the
                            protestations of the girl. He opened the rear door and bore her through.
                            He crossed that court where he had forged the iron, and came to the <hi
                                rend="i">patio</hi> door. He mistakenly thought it was locked. With
                            his last fury he dashed at it with his shoulder. It was not a strong
                            door, and it burst like glass, and he tramped through. He went under the
                                <hi rend="i">patio's</hi> waving trees and over its brick pavement.
                            Doña Manuela was running to him, tottering. He heeded her not. He clung
                            to the girl. He bore her under the tiled roof of the <hi rend="i"
                                >corredor,</hi> and all but flung her into the room where Clarita
                            lay. Then, himself remaining outside, he banged the door to, locked it,
                            and hurled the key into the air a hundred yards away. He sat down, after
                            that, with his back to the wall, and blubbered.</p>
                        <p>"There, O woman!" cried he to the haggard lady. "There is your prize! I
                            promised I would marry her. So help me, pinnacles of Heaven, I will
                            marry her to the Archangel Gabriel, if you but speak the word. Damn me!
                            Damn me!"</p>

                            buried ones. The cloister, in its holiness, fostered, perchance, some
                            unholy things. Here, as in the open world, doubtless some who rose did
                            it by crushing some who fell; at times he who rose even crushed
                            himself.</p>
                        <p>At Tizapan one may see the marsh, the river, the lake and river roads. He
                            may behold, even in the midst of change, the street, the house, the
                            spot. These are not all; there is a less important thing, &#151; a
                            jail wherein a speechless prisoner was confined on that same day; in
                            which, though it was no dungeon, he was as buried as certain old
                            monastery secrets, clerical hopes, crimes of the cloister.</p>
                        <p>The prisons of these small towns were usually of primitive sort. That in
                            Chapala even now is of but one room. The Tizapan jail was, at the time
                            of the disaster to Vicente's troops, of a similar simplicity. It was
                            located in the centre of the town, on the main plaza, being behind
                            Rodrigo as he waited there with his horsemen. Its floor was a space of
                            hardened earth not more than fifteen feet square. There were no windows,
                            only the large door of iron bars that led into the plaza. It was to this
                            place, as <pb id="VAA3931-293" n="284"/> the only security immediately
                            available, that the man captured at Chapala by Bonavidas had been
                            brought. He had entered with the same oppressed, slavish manner,
                            doggedly, not looking at his captors. Had Rodrigo then found a half hour
                            to question him, he might have decided there was no point in his being
                            held, and let him go. But, with no clear purpose, for he had no clear
                            idea of him, the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> locked him up till more
                            important matters should be done with.</p>
                        <p>On entering, the creature had crept to the far corner, and sat down on
                            the floor, after which, till four o'clock of the afternoon, he glared at
                            the door. When Rodrigo's men had drawn themselves up in the plaza with
                            clicking hoof and clinking spur, he had not moved, being like the insane
                            who sit in a strained silence. When there had come the sound of a
                            disaster and a panic somewhat distant, and when Rodrigo's horsemen had
                            galloped away, he still had not moved, only glared with something more
                            nearly like fire in his dull eyes. After that there were many sounds
                            from many directions. Hours went by and the noon came, and no one
                            approached the cell. Its inmate was buried away from all that action,
                            and the things going on in the world were only a distant din to him.
                            Wherefore the jail was like the material form of certain mental
                            influences which had made the world only a distant din these long years.
                            For a man's mind may be his surest prison.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon he slowly removed his sombrero from his
                            head and laid it on the floor. The hat was the color of jet. His hair
                            was black and tangled, as always, and long enough to reach his
                            shoulders. After a time he put his hand into <pb id="VAA3931-294"
                                n="285"/> the pocket of his tight black trousers and drew it out
                            empty; then he sat motionless for another space; after which he put his
                            hand in the bosom of his shirt, also black, drew out a handkerchief and
                            untied its knotted end, displaying a few coins and a white pocket-knife.
                            He tied the coins in the cloth again, and put the little bundle back in
                            his bosom, retaining the knife with purposeless manner. Later, having
                            opened the blade, he marked with its point on the dirt floor. The
                            afternoon light came abundantly in at the iron door and the marks showed
                            clear in the earth. He made, slowly, the figures 1819, and sat and
                            looked at them. Then he made them again in another place, and smaller:
                            1819. He made them a fourth and a fifth time. He did it laboriously,
                            completely absorbed. He covered, at last, all the space within his reach
                            with those figures. They were repeated behind and before him, to his
                            right and left. When there was no more room without moving, he ceased
                            for a time, and went over the rude display carefully, lingering, glazed
                            of eye, at every number. After this he slowly arose and began working on
                            the walls, and a space of a yard square became pretty well covered with
                            the same figures. He was still marking 1819 in the adobes when some one
                            came to the iron door.</p>
                        <p>He did not so much as turn. He stopped making the figures, and stood
                            still with his hand lifted against the wall. The door was opened, the
                            new comer entered, and the door was closed. The mute still stood in an
                            incomprehensible immovability, as though stunned, and the figure behind
                            stopped and gazed at the numbers on the wall and the floor. Then the
                            mute began again, marking, still not having <pb id="VAA3931-295" n="286"
                            /> turned, and cut 1819 once more with jagged irregularity.</p>
                        <p>"Has all this that you mark a meaning, friend, and is it this that makes
                            you dumb, or are you only amusing yourself?" said the man behind.</p>
                        <p>The mute turned and beheld Rodrigo standing in the last light of the day.
                            There was no reply.</p>
                        <p>"Come, man," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> throwing off a certain
                            sombreness that he had worn, becoming easier of manner and advancing;
                            "whether it is that you fear me, or that you have for some reason come
                            to fear all men, or that you are acting with a genius that I could wish
                            to transfer to a land where there are good stages &#151; I do not
                            know. Frankly, you do not look like a spy to me, nor have I expected to
                            gather much out of you. I have to dispose of you somehow. I am come to
                            see if I can gratify myself by letting you go. I have brought ink and
                            paper and pen that you may write, and time is limited. Now pen it out,
                            plainly, and give me your deeds and intentions."</p>
                        <p>The mute's eyes held a slumberous fire as he took the paper, which fire
                            did not render the distorted countenance less hideous. He made, not
                            without difficulty, the words:</p>
                        <p>"Take me back across the lake."</p>
                        <p>"But I cannot be so free with you," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> "for
                            I have other matters. Write me something of yourself."</p>
                        <p>The mute, crouching to the floor in an attitude of fear, penned out:</p>
                        <p>"He will starve. He was ill."</p>
                        <p>"This same thing twice," said Rodrigo. "Who is he?"</p>
                        <p>The mute thought long and stupidly, and then <pb id="VAA3931-296" n="287"
                            /> sighed, &#151; that kind of sigh that seems beyond all anguish,
                            to which a groan would be but as the expression of relief. Then he
                            wrote, very slowly:</p>
                        <p>"The worse than God. The stronger than Hell."</p>
                        <p>"Thou poor fool," muttered Rodrigo, stooping, too, and fastening his eyes
                            on the other's, concentrating all his mind to read him. "There is no God
                            nor any hell that will starve. It is you, wrecked heart, and I, chip in
                            the sea, that starve. Come, friend, what is this to you? What will it
                            matter to you if he starve?"</p>
                        <p>Something startling swept over the other's face. He wrote again:</p>
                        <p>"Then I would follow her. I would do it then &#151; do it. I would
                            walk into the sky. I am a slave. Let me go. Take me back across the
                            lake."</p>
                        <p>"If it is your hallucination that some one binds you, why not let him
                            starve, if this be his tendency? This will free you."</p>
                        <p>The other sank into the dull unreadableness again. He began after a time
                            to rewrite the sentence, "Take me back." He did not finish the last
                            word, becoming abstracted, and presently returned once more to his slow,
                            rapt marking of figures. They stood out on the paper once, twice, thrice
                            &#151; 1819.</p>
                        <p>There came another person to the door. Dusk was coming on. The plaza was
                            shadowed and the jail was growing dark.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo," said a suave voice without, "this is a secluded spot for a
                            little conference. Let me in."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo stood up. He saw that the man outside was Doroteo Quiroz, his
                            handsome figure having approached noiselessly. His lips were pressed
                            tightly together, and his moustaches were visible in <pb
                                id="VAA3931-297" n="288"/> the half light as black points. The two
                            looked full at one another for a moment; then Rodrigo walked gravely to
                            the door, which he had locked after entering, and let the visitor in.
                            Quiroz's manner was full of the Mexican superficial politeness and
                            elegance.</p>
                        <p>"Do me the favor, then, señor," said he, bowing with his fingers on his
                            breast, "to extend me the hand of a brave <hi rend="i">caballero</hi>
                            and a victorious one."</p>
                        <p>He stretched out his own, and with scarcely perceptible hesitation
                            Rodrigo took it, somewhat coldly.</p>
                        <p>"We are of different races," began Quiroz. "Good. We could thus combine
                            what is fair and amiable out of north and south. You know me for a
                            Mexican. You are expecting fair words and no deeds. Quiroz is a gambler.
                            This freely. But I am going to give you a proof that he can go to a
                            point without wavering. Hence, listen to me: for whatever folly there is
                            in me, if ever in my life I meant what I said, may Mary die and the
                            church be proved a harlot if I am not in earnest now. I will speak in
                            the presence of this idiot here, for I know him. He has been a crazy
                            shadow on the lake for many a month. They say he is the ghost who haunts
                            Prison Island. You will learn nothing from him but you do not need
                            to."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo stood up tall and still, his customary whiteness of face slightly
                            more marked. He kept a somewhat cold gaze on Quiroz, and at times there
                            was the bare suggestion of a sneer on his lips, but, withal, his manner
                            had in it a certain proper deference and attention.</p>
                        <p>"Go on," said he.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo, you are a fighter. The man who <pb id="VAA3931-298" n="289"
                            /> created a new idea and carried it out as you did, is one to whom I am
                            pleased to doff my hat. You are no dreamer. You are a man of action. So
                            much for my views of your ability. Pardon me if I say that you as yet
                            have no knowledge of Doroteo Quiroz. Do you fancy I put myself on a
                            plane above my deserts? Far from it. There is no veriest prop of virtue
                            who knows more surely than do I that the word to be applied to me is
                            traitor &#151; unblushingly. I plead guilty; yet I would have you
                            recall that there are more kinds of traitors than one, and a treason may
                            be built on an honest foundation. Why did I enter Vicente's scheme?
                            Because I am a gambler. I pretend to be nothing else. My one unalterable
                            ambition has ever been to gain for myself, strictly for myself, the
                            greatest power and the richest success possible to me. Vicente's was the
                            biggest game at hand. I had no more than entered it when I saw his
                            weakness. For he dreams too much. This I know. I am as honest as truth
                            when I say that I believed success impossible to him. That kind of
                            nature will come to the day of ruin sooner or later. Well, am I to be
                            blamed for cold judgment? No; for judgment with me is as spontaneous as
                            an emotion. You can call a man mistaken for his judgment &#151; you
                            cannot call him criminal. We praise constancy; we talk much of faith. In
                            God's name, is it constancy to wreck a previous and constant course by
                            clinging to that which will wreck it? Half the condemned treachery in
                            the world is constancy to an idea that was dominant before the thing
                            betrayed was born, an idea that thus had the precedence. My previous
                            ambitions would brook no continuance with Vicente. To wreck him a few
                            weeks or months before his inevitable <pb id="VAA3931-299" n="290"/>
                            wrecking of himself was but to make less his ruin. In this, do me the
                            favor to observe, I was true to myself, which is called the first
                            virtue.</p>
                        <p>"Ay, Quiroz is a gambler, but the gambler is telling you simply a
                            mathematical fact when he says that the man who knows me thus, who does
                            not consider me honest, and yet perceives whereto I am indomitably
                            constant, can steer his course with mine with the safety of faith. Don
                            Rodrigo, a revolt like this is not the measure of my ambition. Mexico is
                            tottering. Santa Anna has left the capital sapped of its powers and is
                            marching to Taylor and a sure defeat. Meanwhile I am here with more than
                            a thousand horsemen at my back. For what have you done? You captured the
                            leader and some forty others, dead and living. The rest fled. When a
                            path could be cut through the street, your lieutenants pursued the
                            fugitives. They captured scarcely a dozen. The rest are scattered. But
                            you know as well as I that I have means of gathering them up. They will
                            come when I call. You, Don Rodrigo, are at the head of two hundred.
                            Listen. I have no desire to try issues with a man like you. I would
                            rather we try them together. We are here on the lake's southern side.
                            Mexico City is not so very far to the southeast. It is left without an
                            army. It is ever in a weakened state of discord. Come; the time is ripe.
                            We gather recruits on the way; for I know the people. He who marches
                            into the capital now with two thousand men is its master. I tell you
                            again Taylor will defeat Santa Anna. The Americans will come on. We
                            cannot fight them; we shall not try. They must then deal with him who
                            holds the government. The United States will not dare annex the country.
                            She has too many <pb id="VAA3931-300" n="291"/> troubles of her own. I
                            have studied this matter long since. She will likely rob us of some of
                            our northern provinces. Well, who remains with the rest?</p>
                        <p>He paused; he lifted a steady hand and drew out the point of his
                            moustache. Then an audacious smile played on his features. Rodrigo said
                            nothing. He held his eyes unmoved and stared straight into those of
                            Quiroz. The shadow of disdain was still on his lips, and his face wore
                            something of hauteur.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo, you are a man of deeds, and you love power. That leader who
                            marches in while the army is away &#151; to him shall the power
                            be."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo was silent for some moments.</p>
                        <p>"Quiroz," said he, coldly, "for what you have done the government thanks
                            you. I myself cannot be insincere enough to do so, nor to agree with
                            you, nor to act with you; for I find you most eminent in ability to do
                            that thing which the Greeks called making the worse appear the better
                            reason."</p>
                        <p>With this Rodrigo turned somewhat stiffly away, as though to continue his
                            conversation with the mute, who had not moved. If there was any
                            resentment in Doroteo the gloom did not permit that it be visible on his
                            face. He was too much Quiroz to show it in words.</p>
                        <p>"This is final?" said he.</p>
                        <p>"This is final," replied Rodrigo.</p>
                        <p>"Then do me the favor," said Quiroz, with his teeth shut and a smile
                            glittering on his face, "to offer me, in parting, the hand of a
                            gentleman."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo offered it.</p>
                        <p>"Excellent to be frank," said Quiroz. "Well to go straight to all points.
                            And in leaving (in <pb id="VAA3931-301" n="292"/> which," and he gripped
                            the other's hand with extreme force, "my purpose is to gather up my
                            troops), &#151; in leaving, allow me to express rather a
                            strengthened than a diminished faith in your abilities, señor. <hi
                                rend="i">Adios. Hasta la vista!</hi> I am sorry that I can make no
                            use of the esteemed gratitude of the government."</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Adios,"</hi> said the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This stilted conversation being finished, Doroteo went out. If there had
                            been, in his reference to his troops, any hint of a threat, he was not
                            the man to have let it appear in his tone or his face. Whatever gall was
                            in him as he departed, the elegant Quiroz, the deceiver, would not speak
                            it out, even by a word, even in the midst of his bitterest resentment.
                            There can be no doubt that the highest lustre of his scheme faded with
                            this failure. But he bowed himself out with grace and went his feline
                            way. Outside, however, could one have seen his face he would have noted
                            keen hate and steely desperation in it. He was resolved that, despite
                            all obstacles, the scattered force that had been Vicente's should at
                            once be his.</p>
                        <p>Referring once more to the threat that the reference to troops might have
                            contained &#151; that reference hung in Rodrigo's mind when Quiroz
                            was gone. He stood in the almost dark jail, staring into the darkness.
                            He meditated thus for some minutes, with something of a turmoil under
                            the calm that sat on his face. He must not risk losing his advantage. He
                            had that instinctive tenacity which is a characteristic of his people;
                            this, added to a natural determination, completely to fulfil the task
                            intrusted to him.</p>
                        <p>"There is no prison in Guadalajara that is sufficiently <pb
                                id="VAA3931-302" n="293"/> safe," he mused. "The strongest was
                            wrecked in the last revolution. The other is yet unfinished. That nest
                            of troubles is no place for him. Even the journey thither might be
                            disastrous, for it would be through a country of his allies."</p>
                        <p>He gazed yet other minutes into the darkness. He went out then, procured
                            a candle and matches, and returned. He entered, locked the door, and lit
                            the candle. The mute was still crouched in the darkest corner, his
                            sombrero again on his head, pulled down far over his face. Only the chin
                            and the scar were visible when the match was touched to the candle. He
                            held the paper in his hand as though he had been staring at it in the
                            dark. Rodrigo came and kneeled down before him, putting the candle on
                            the earthen floor. He saw, too, that the pen and the ink were at
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>"You wish to be free," said Rodrigo, in a low tone.</p>
                        <p>There was no reply, but the man lifted his face and looked at him.</p>
                        <p>"You wish to be free, is it not so?" said Rodrigo.</p>
                        <p>The mute took the pen and wrote as before:</p>
                        <p>"Take me across the lake."</p>
                        <p>"Listen," was the reply. "I will take you across the lake. I will do it
                            to-night. We will start at once, and when we arrive at the opposite
                            shore you shall be free. All this if you can do one thing for me."</p>
                        <p>The figure before him distorted the scar into something that might have
                            been a smile, horrifying as it was.</p>
                        <p>"Do you know an island between here and Mescala which they call Prison
                            Island?"</p>
                        <p>The mute was as still as stone, with a dead color on his face.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-303" n="294"/>
                        <p>"An island," continued Rodrigo, "whereon there are ruins of great
                            buildings and nothing else. Come &#151; you are a kind of bat on the
                            lake; do you know it?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes," wrote the mute, his hand shaking.</p>
                        <p>"Have you been there?"</p>
                        <p>There was no reply, only glassy eyes and the scar.</p>
                        <p>"Man," said Rodrigo, whispering, and with sternness, "do you want to be
                            locked in a blacker prison than this and to stay there? You know this
                            island; I have heard that you do. Answer me quickly and plainly if you
                            want freedom or mercy."</p>
                        <p>"I know it," wrote the other in mute fear. "I have been there."</p>
                        <p>"Do you know its coasts and whether there is a cove that might serve as a
                            harbor? Could you <unclear>stee-</unclear> a <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            into safety at that island, avoiding the rocks, landing us without
                            danger, even in the night and with waves?"</p>
                        <p>With that rock-like silence again his only expression of emotion, the
                            other, after a long time of <unclear>dul-</unclear> pondering,
                            wrote:</p>
                        <p>"I know it."</p>
                        <p>"You could do it in safety?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes."</p>
                        <p>"Friend," said <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> "let me give you full warning. I
                            am your comrade if you treat me well. Do as I wish and I shall send you
                            on to the opposite shore, and you shall be free. If you fail me
                                <unclear>o-</unclear> deceive me, I am more likely to kill you than
                            to <unclear>le-</unclear> you live. Mark me. I, too, know the location
                                <unclear>o-</unclear> the island. Any attempt to steer us away is
                            use less. I, too, have been there, but I approached from the other side,
                            and I have no knowledge <unclear>o-</unclear>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-304" n="295"/> the rocks and the shore. So I take you
                            for the landing. Get me safe on that island and you are free. If you
                            wreck me &#151; well, I can swim and shall have as good a chance as
                            you. Now I am going to trust you. I do not believe you will play me
                            false. Freedom it is, my man. Will you go?"</p>
                        <p>"When?" wrote the other, his hand shaking again.</p>
                        <p>"Now."</p>
                        <p>The distortion of the mute's visage was then unintelligible. It may have
                            meant mad delight &#151; it may have meant abject terror. He was
                            able to write, "Yes," and Rodrigo arose and left him with the candle;
                            and the slow waving flame with its blue rings round it cast light on the
                            creature's face and over his body, and displayed an agitation such that
                            it must have struck awe in any that saw it.</p>
                        <p>Scarcely half an hour went by before there came steps again at the door.
                            It was unlocked, and Bonavidas and another entered.</p>
                        <p>"Come on," said Bonavidas, taking the mute's arm and compelling him to
                            arise. "Save us! he is stiff as a corpse. Brace up &#151; this is no
                            march to the grave, though we are both good candidates for it. I dare
                            say the worm that has you at last, my stiff prisoner, will have feasted
                            on me first; but he will still be far from fat &#151; ha! ha! Bitter
                            will have been his first disappointment, and, if I am a judge of fowl,
                            as bitter will be the next &#151; for the arm of this skeleton is
                            thin."</p>
                        <p>His companion shuddered a little and wrapped a purple blanket round him,
                            covering the half of his face. The three went out. There was not much
                            stir, and few people were in the plaza. The wounded and the excitement
                            were farther back in <pb id="VAA3931-305" n="296"/> that quarter of the
                            town nearest the mountains. Eyed by only a few passers-by the three
                            entered the street to the river. Farther ahead in its gloom, faintly lit
                            by an oil street lamp, could be seen a squad of soldiers with a prisoner
                            in their midst, moving in the same direction. Whereas the mute went
                            crouchingly, with face buried under his hat, that other prisoner walked
                            with something of stateliness. Those who saw his face on that march said
                            it was not like the dark faces of Mexico &#151; one would have
                            thought he came from some other land &#151; that his carriage was
                            marked by a gentle pride, and his eyes were so deep and so strangely sad
                            that a child, looking on them, wept and ran away. There was a wound,
                            too, on one temple, and his left shoulder and arm were bandaged and
                            carried stiffly.</p>
                        <p>It was thus it chanced that Rodrigo, Vicente, the mute, Bonavidas, and
                            some twenty soldiers, met that night on the river's bank, where the
                            marshes stretched out into darkness and the waves could be faintly
                            heard. The wind was from a little west of south; not the best for the
                            journey, but, if it should last sufficiently long, serviceable. Some of
                            the <hi rend="i">canoas'</hi> owners had sailed away; but haste is not a
                            characteristic of the land, and there were novel things in Tizapan to
                            see. More than half of the craft that had threaded their way to the
                            landing in the early morning were still there. The party that now
                            arrived selected two of the best.</p>
                        <p>The huts were deserted. The town lay yonder, black and silent; the night
                            was a starry one. Certain townspeople, few in number, came stealthily
                            after the party of soldiers to see, and stood in the gloom at a little
                            distance from the river. With something more nearly like reverence than
                            authority, <pb id="VAA3931-306" n="297"/> for he could not control his
                            sentiments nor the moving of his heart which a certain majesty of
                            bearing in his prisoner had caused, Rodrigo ordered Vicente into the
                            second of the two boats and manned that vessel with half his twenty men.
                            Some weapons and ammunition were put therein also. He himself went to
                            the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> in front. He was silent, chilled. He could
                            not go in the same vessel with his captive; it would take, said he, a
                            vaster strength than he had. Bonavidas was left in control of that rear
                            ship.</p>
                        <p>The mute and certain other weapons and ammunitions, together with stores
                            of provisions, were put in the forward boat, which was manned by the
                            other soldiers. All being aboard, the poling was silently begun, and the
                            dark, winding course down the river between the walls of reeds was
                            entered upon.</p>
                        <p>The few townspeople turned back to the things of unhappy interest in the
                            town, where the rest of the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> men, under a
                            trusted soldier chosen for that place, guarded some less important
                            prisoners in a great adobe hall once used as a storehouse for golden
                            fruit, product of summer suns and mountain torrents and the free air and
                            the free soil of a land of curious liberty. The destination of the
                            vessels was known only to those in them and to some of the soldiers
                            behind. The secret was locked and the guide was mute. There were
                            adequate instructions left, also, concerning immediate notification of
                            any new events, and bonfire signals explained and well remembered. In
                            the stern of his ship the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> stood, not rejoicing
                            over victory, not happy with success. There was the picture in the <hi
                                rend="i">jefe's</hi> mind of a small woman with strange hair and a
                            face sorrowful as he had last seen it in the improvised hospital, where
                            they revived <pb id="VAA3931-307" n="298"/> her brother, bandaged his
                            wounds, and let her come in.</p>
                        <p>It was well that, the last vessel being some twenty yards down stream,
                            the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> vision was only a vision and not the woman
                            herself. There had crept down to the bank, after those other
                            townspeople, a slight figure unseen by the others. The others were gone
                            when she ran silently to the landing and saw the two vessels,
                            indistinguishable bulks of gloom, going away yonder in the reeds, and
                            heard the soft, soft plash of the poles in muddy water. She wanted to
                            cry out, but could not. She sank down, not burying her face, but gazing
                            out over the flat marsh and the unseen lake. She sat there some long
                            hours after every sound had ceased, and the silence was like death.</p>

                            absolute misery like the theoretical absolute zero of the thermometer,
                            the great Fortino was at that degree, a point of dead, cold despair,
                            where there is no motion, which motion would be heat, heat of anger, or
                            hope, or thrilling recollection, a point whereat the unimaginable
                            depression is like the frigidity that cannot be felt, that would freeze
                            the very nucleus of the first cell that should begin to stir into
                            thought or emotion, &#151; a point, however, from which reaction is
                            not altogether impossible.</p>
                        <p>Toward noon of the day of the disaster, he had trod across the brick
                            pavement of the <hi rend="i">patio,</hi> where the round ball of his
                            great shadow mingled with the flecking shadows of trees. He had entered
                            the rear court through the remnant of the door he had shattered, and
                            being in that barer and drearier space, with the anvil and white ashes
                            of a charcoal fire not far distant, he had sat himself down on the
                            ground by the stables and had stayed there. When Doroteo had come and
                            begged that the silent monster volunteer some information as to the key
                            of the room wherein the girls were locked, he had not appeared to
                            respond even in thought. His face assumed the beginnings of a look of
                            scorn that he should be assaulted with details at a time like this. The
                            scorn became frozen and went out, and there was <pb id="VAA3931-309"
                                n="300"/> nothing more to be drawn from him. As the key had been
                            hurled in some unknown direction through the high clear air of that
                            memorable morning, the door to which it had belonged was at length
                            broken open by Doroteo and his <hi rend="i">mozo,</hi> during which act
                            Fortino was not present, being still sitting by the stables; nor did he
                            know or care when the good Doña Manuela, trembling like a reed in a
                            wind, expended her motherly care on her of the auburn locks and brought
                            the girl to.</p>
                        <p>There was little of any sort of movement during that day in the rear
                            court of stables. Doroteo passed through it several times, quick,
                            absorbed. The <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> came and fed some animals and said
                            something to Fortino, whom he eyed with curiosity. But Fortino did not
                            reply. Then, for hours, there was nothing but the horses, the adobes,
                            the bare earth, the anvil and the <hi rend="i">brasero</hi> over which
                            the sun poured its yellow autumn flood. There, too, was directed the
                            great man's gaze. The anvil's shadow grew longer as the hours went by,
                            the light about it became yellower, and at length the shadows of western
                            objects beyond came and took away the yellow. The dusk came on. But
                            Fortino did not cease to stare at that mass of iron and the chalky pile
                            of ashes, which last an evening breeze lifted and made white dust. They
                            came and begged him to eat; but he would not. Doña Manuela came
                            likewise, at length having the servants bring dishes and set them before
                            him. They remained untouched. So the lady sighed, and, with her head
                            turned looking at Fortino, she and the sky-blue dress and the gray hair
                            went back into the front <hi rend="i">patio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It grew dark, and the night wind swirled among the stables. The early
                            stars gave way to later ones. <pb id="VAA3931-310" n="301"/> Odd birds,
                            common in these parts, flew silently overhead and hissed short, quick,
                            startling hisses at him out of the night, as though to warn him or to
                            awaken him or to make uncanny jests at him. At some time after midnight
                            he rolled over heavily and sunk into a sleep that, for its broken
                            snorings and its nightmares, was a thing dreadful to hear. When, in the
                            early morning, the <hi rend="i">mozo</hi> came to feed the horses,
                            Fortino was again sitting erect. Later there was a second attempt to get
                            him to eat, as fruitless as the first. In this Doña Manuela again
                            participated, full of anxiety for the poor man's mind, though not well
                            comprehending what was the matter with him.</p>
                        <p>"Alas! alas!" cried she at length, in despair, "this good, large man will
                            starve!"</p>
                        <p>Anastasio was one of those who heard this remark. Neither he nor Fortino
                            had been sought after by Vicente's captors, Quiroz having left the
                            impression that the fishermen were a part of the treason. The
                            philosopher had but just now entered by the rear alley, and the early
                            morning beams fell on his long body and showed his languid calmness. He
                            had not been seen here till now since he rode away so swiftly, more than
                            a full day previous. He came sauntering in much as he sauntered anywhere
                            else. He stood and gazed at the inert Fortino in thoughtful mood.</p>
                        <p>"No, señora," said Anastasio. "He will not starve. I should say two
                            months from to-day, if he be still here, there may be call for
                            alarm."</p>
                        <p>"Oh! but señor!" cried the anxious lady with much earnestness, "he has
                            eaten nothing for twenty-four hours!"</p>
                        <p>"Señora, have you, then, not heard of the camels? <pb id="VAA3931-311"
                                n="302"/> They say a camel will live many days off his humps. And
                            whereas he does well on two, Fortino has an infinite number; and better
                            yet, the other beast contends with the drawback that the space between
                            the two is vacant. Fortino has this advantage, that all the spaces
                            between his many are filled up, so that his figure presents a smooth and
                            reassuring surface. I should say there is nutriment enough in Fortino to
                            last two moons."</p>
                        <p>The lady finally withdrew, she and the servants carrying the untouched
                            dishes, and Anastasio sat down in front of the giant.</p>
                        <p>"Bravery is a good thing," said he, and paused, calmly meeting Fortino's
                            lurid gaze with his own. He made his remarks at a considerable distance
                            from each other, and in the nature of speculations. "Faith, too, works
                            what I should call &#151; wonders. To wade into the sea, I will be
                            sworn, is more glorious than it is wet, which is saying much. Fortino,
                            if you do not take something you will be eating your bodily ability. But
                            if he who works not shall not eat, he who eats not need not work,
                            where-in there is comfort. I have thought many a time, which is best,
                            glory or idleness? But I didn't know anything about the former, so I
                            stuck to the other, being aware of its good points. Yesterday was a fine
                            day. You should have seen the lake on yesterday and heard the note of
                            the dove. The lake sparkled, and the dove, she sang."</p>
                        <p>Fortino rolled heavily into a slightly different position, gazing at the
                            anvil, and something like a smothered groan was in him.</p>
                        <p>"Our comrade in bravery," said Anastasio, "where is he? Francisco is
                            &#151; "</p>
                        <p>There was a cautious creaking at the rear door <pb id="VAA3931-312"
                                n="303"/> that led into the alley, and the door was slightly opened.
                            A head came through, showing a gaunt face of stealth and terror, and
                            eyes like dollars.</p>
                        <p>"Come in," drawled Anastasio with whining impatience, &#151; "come
                            in, brother; there is no cavalry here."</p>
                        <p>Francisco cautiously closed the door behind him, and, looking ever to all
                            sides, as though in fear of treachery, crept up and sat down.</p>
                        <p>"I am afraid of no cavalry," said he, with a faint attempt at bluster.
                            "I&#151;I&#151;oh, friends! where is the enemy!"</p>
                        <p>"Can it, then, be that you were out of the fight? This accounts for the
                            misfortune."</p>
                        <p>"If every man had had <hi rend="i">my</hi> discretion, friend," cried
                            Francisco, "there would have been no misfortune. I know when to make a
                            retreat with dignity. There is one thing about me, if I am a fisherman
                            &#151; I learn the art of war rapidly."</p>
                        <p>"At a gallop," said the long one. "Fortino, awake, till I give you the
                            history of this man of valor. When we came on to the town, I having
                            delivered my message (with a faith, Fortino, speaking of faith, that
                            classed me immediately with angels), I having delivered it, had trouble
                            with my horse. Francisco was riding near the front. It was convenient,
                            when he had learned of the enemy ahead, for Francisco suddenly to
                            conceive and bear a prodigy of brotherly love, which led him to drop
                            behind to assist me. And the farther behind we lagged, beating my steed,
                            the kindlier was Francisco. When at last my horse stopped I was ungentle
                            enough to curse this brother, and he went on. He was the last member of
                            the cavalry when it entered the street. From a long distance away <pb
                                id="VAA3931-313" n="304"/> on the lake road I saw him lumbering in
                            last, and his speed was not high. He was out of my sight in the town
                            something less than one minute. Ah &#151; he learned the art of war
                            in that space of time. Francisco is peculiarly quick at learning. I saw
                            him issue, having learned the art, like a rocket from a newly blessed
                            house, and there was a blue vapor arising from him as he came on. The
                            rapidity of his learning increased as he advanced; his horse's nose
                            pierced air like the point of a bullet. He wheeled into the lake road a
                            full half mile ahead of the next fugitive, and bore down on me so that I
                            had barely time to pull a little to one side. I heard him crying out to
                            me before he came near: 'Fly! Fly!' Then he swept by with a wind that
                            raised my sombrero and blew my hair across my cheek, shrieking: 'I will
                            &#151; save &#151; my &#151; honor!' I perceived then that
                            the rest were coming, and, Francisco having become a little smoke in the
                            distance, and the others having likewise fled past me in confusion, I
                            said to myself, sitting meditating on my steed, 'There is agitation in
                            the town.' Finding at length that the horse would no longer balk, but
                            would go on at a slow gait, <hi rend="i">'Si,'</hi> said I to myself, 'I
                            will go in where the agitation is.' When I was on the point of entering
                            the town I saw that sickly man that is with the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi>
                            dashing out with troops in pursuit. I was feeling tired at that time,
                            and in need of quiet. So I drew up at the roadside and sat with both my
                            pistols aimed at the comers and resting easily on the saddle's pommel;
                            and they dared not touch me, I did fill them so with dread. Said the
                            sickly one as he went by on a gallop, 'Put up your guns, child, there
                            are bigger birds than you!' <hi rend="i">'Si,'</hi> said I, 'but they
                            fly high. Francisco, <pb id="VAA3931-314" n="305"/> for one, flies
                            exceeding high.' When they were gone, and I came on in and saw the scene
                            of the trouble, and thought again of the fugitives, there was one point
                            that was a great comfort to me. 'There is one thing they will never
                            get,' said I, pleased. 'They will never catch Francisco's honor.'"</p>
                        <p>"I tell you, idiot, it was my discretion that saved me. Fly? Did not they
                            all fly? That there was some terrible thing ahead I knew, and I saved my
                            abilities for another time. I was cool, I was calculating. There are
                            times, fool, when it is best to be wise!"</p>
                        <p>Francisco was recovering himself, and he uttered this principle with a
                            great gesture.</p>
                        <p>"And wherein did I next show wisdom?" he continued. "Listen, you who were
                            two miles from the fight. As soon as I was round the first point of
                            rocks toward Jiquilpan, my horse stumbled and threw me. The rest caught
                            up with me and passed and scattered into the mountains, or went on. Then
                            I heard the enemy coming. So I beat my horse away, and he went off crazy
                            toward Jiquilpan to distract attention from me who remained behind. This
                            is a science called in war, strategy. It is by strategy that great
                            things are done in war, and by strategy that great men occupy their
                            minds. And not everybody, let me tell you, señores, has mind enough so
                            that strategy can occupy it; no, señores. It was by strategy that the
                            big fight at Hannibal was won, with the rings. I have read history and I
                            know how to employ principles. So the horse went galloping off to
                            distract attention. The distracting attention is one of the leading
                            things in strategy. Next I leap straight into the lake, and dive. There
                            were rocks there, and I dived to the <pb id="VAA3931-315" n="306"/>
                            other side of them. This again was good strategy. If I had stayed this
                            side of the rocks I might have had to come up for breath at the wrong
                            time. Many great strategies have been thus ruined. When the enemy was
                            gone I came out on the bank. I confess I was sore from scraping myself
                            on a boulder. Hence, I limped into the mountains, and lay down and hid,
                            and I saw the enemy come back. And, owing to my strategy, he did not
                            have me. I am not any fool, brothers. At night I decided that the heroic
                            thing was to come back. And I have limped some three miles during the
                            night. I was hungry. I slept a little outside the town and have limped
                            in here. I did it boldly &#151; I was not terrified. I walked in
                            like a lion, señores."</p>
                        <p>"You appeared so, indeed," said Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>Fortino had no more than barely heard, if indeed he had done so much. He
                            was dumb.</p>
                        <p>"There are some ideas about yesterday," said Anastasio, "that confuse
                            me."</p>
                        <p>No one replied and the three were as though thinking.</p>

                            <hi rend="i">"Si,"</hi> continued the long one, "there are things that
                            mix me."</p>
                        <p>"You did not mix in the things, ha! ha!" broke out Francisco with the
                            knowledge of a fine bit of humor.</p>
                        <p>"My horse had not learned the art of war," was the chilly response. "He
                            kept my discretion to the rear, instead of whizzing there with it
                            afterward. <hi rend="i">Si,</hi> there are matters of directions,
                            messages, and deeds, that are not clear. If this great body here could
                            speak he might tell me why he blocked the way. But never mind, we will
                            lay it on to the Holy Virgin."</p>
                        <p>The great body revolved slightly, but ponderously, <pb id="VAA3931-316"
                                n="307"/> and Fortino's eyes, inflamed and swelled, looked out of
                            Fortino's unshaven face at Anastasio like the eyes of a gorgon.</p>
                        <p>"When Doroteo gave me my message," said Anastasio meditatively, "he made
                            no mention of anything wrong with Fortino. Was it, Fortino, that you had
                            slept in the night air? I left you slumbering like a babe. Were you
                            dreaming, even then, of that treason?"</p>
                        <p>A rage like a burning furnace was suddenly born in the giant. He grew
                            inconceivably hot. He arose with an awful majesty. He stamped the ground
                            and strode to and fro before his wondering comrades.</p>
                        <p>"Treason! Treason!" he growled like some wild beast. "Who talks of
                            treason! Who dares call me traitor! What message did you carry, blot on
                            earth?" He strode nearer and shook his huge fist in the face of his
                            unmoved torturer. "Stand up and give me your own perfidy. What message,
                            worm! worm! did you, then, carry away when you left me asleep in my
                            untouched honesty!"</p>
                        <p>"Make it plain &#151; plain say I," broke in Francisco. "It has
                            puzzled me too. But I have not learned even what happened. Come at it,
                            friends; his demand, Anastasio, is just. Was it some strategy?"</p>
                        <p>"What was it?" repeated Anastasio, on whose acute mind much of the true
                            situation had long since dawned. He spoke with a labored innocence. "It
                            was the message Quiroz gave me &#151; what else? And I, too, carried
                            it away in my untouched honesty. I have already said that I showed a
                            faith that was pleasing to the Lord."</p>
                        <p>"But what was it, worm!" roared Fortino.</p>
                        <p>"What, then, did he tell <hi rend="i">you,</hi> lime-kiln?" was the
                            response.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-317" n="308"/>
                        <p>"Just, too," put in Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"He told me, damn you, that you had gone to warn him of the enemy's
                            coming."</p>
                        <p>"This is white truth," said Anastasio. "This is pure innocence. He was
                            right. Doroteo's honesty, too, was untouched. We were a good honest
                            trio, and this also, I dare say, pleased the Lord."</p>
                        <p>"He told me, too," continued Fortino, bending over and holding his fist
                            always before the other, speaking in growls and roars, "that Vicente was
                            to come over the other bridge, the bridge toward the mountains and take
                            his stand in the plaza."</p>
                        <p>"Ah, brother, but the other bridge is gone. I went yesterday, when the
                            dew fell, and looked at the place. Brother," he repeated with infinite
                            gentleness, "there <hi rend="i">is</hi> no other bridge."</p>
                        <p>"But he told me," cried Fortino with a great gasp and burning to the
                            roots of his hair, "that the bridge was rebuilt!"</p>
                        <p>"I wonder if this, too," whined the long one, "pleased the Lord."</p>
                        <p>"He said &#151; he said &#151; that the enemy was coming up the
                            river road! Tell me, then, what your message was, and tell me quick
                            &#151; I can stand no more!"</p>
                        <p>"While you lay slumbering like a babe, brother, he told me that the enemy
                            should be in the plaza and I should direct Vicente up the river
                            road."</p>
                        <p>"I can swear," said Francisco excitedly, "that this same message
                            Anastasio delivered with speed and honesty."</p>
                        <p>The full realization of the treachery broke slowly over the giant's
                            ponderously moving mind. He turned about in his smothered rage and
                            stared like a crazy one at the house of Quiroz. Then his eyes <pb
                                id="VAA3931-318" n="309"/> went wild and swept over the unmoved
                            Anastasio and the excited Francisco. The perspiration suddenly poured in
                            streams from his face and he strode away heavily, like a mighty
                            mechanism, toward the rear door that led into the alley. He came to the
                            anvil and seized it up. He turned and lifted the mass of iron in both
                            hands high over his head. For a second he held it there, a statue of
                            some enraged Hercules ready to crush the world. Then he hurled it with
                            the force of a field-gun straight through the clear morning air, over
                            the heads of his comrades, till it crashed into the wall that divided
                            the stable court from the house's <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> It tore a
                            hole in that wall big enough for a child to hide himself in, and sent
                            the adobes flying shattered. The hurler turned majestically about and
                            proceeded toward the alley. He came to the door, turned again, and shook
                            his fist at the house and stamped the dust of the accursed place from
                            his feet, crying hoarsely:</p>
                        <p>"Let me see you no more!"</p>
                        <p>He went out and banged the door so that one of its planks split from top
                            to bottom, and they heard him going away crying:</p>
                        <p>"Son of hell! Son of hell!"</p>
                        <p>He trod thus out of the town and to the borders of the lake, and there
                            where there was loneliness and the morning sun and breeze and the
                            plaintive note of the dove, he sat himself down by the marsh.</p>
                        <p>His two companions remained for some time where they were.</p>
                        <p>"I had foreseen," said Francisco at last, "that it was some
                            strategy."</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER III</head>
                        <p>THAT some one else on the premises of Quiroz had passed as bad a night as
                            had Fortino, the giant could not know. The day before, during all the
                            hours that succeeded the catastrophe, Pepa had not left the house. She
                            had stayed chiefly in her room; when she had come out it was in silence.
                            Clarita perceived a great change in her erstwhile vivacious friend.
                            Pepa, during that day and the night that followed it, was a haunted
                            woman. Somehow the horror of the deed had been too great, too monstrous,
                            for one so young as she.</p>
                        <p>She was not incapable of remorse. It was not so much that she was
                            faithless or irresistibly wicked. It was rather to be considered
                            entirely from the opposite view-point, &#151; she loved
                            overpoweringly, and in her love was a passion really mad; her nature was
                            not trained either by heredity or environment to collect the scattered
                            elements of good in her character and make a chain to resist the evil
                            course of her love. During that day she did not venture out to find him
                            whom she loved, and who, she believed in her unsophisticated mind, had
                            encouraged her to the deed, had even silently offered her the reward.
                            She did not venture out simply because, long to as she might, she could
                            not. She found herself powerless, dreading seeing him as much as she
                            desired it. For now that the deed was done, and she had seen it, its
                            hide-ousness was visible to her. There crept into her untutored <pb
                                id="VAA3931-320" n="311"/> heart some instinctive fear that that
                            white man &#151; he who awed her and won her, and whose race and its
                            civilization were mysteries to her &#151; might be revolted by this
                            treachery. She dared not think that out &#151; she only felt it. So
                            she was afraid and wretched all that day, full of her love and her
                            hopes, recalling over and over the night at Ocotlan and his face when it
                            held out promises to her. Hence, for the time, the treachery and the
                            wildness were gone, as though she had been two women.</p>
                        <p>All that day she found herself perversely and persistently trying to hear
                            nothing of that which went on in the town. In her revulsion of feeling
                            she would listen to nothing. Doña Manuela and Clarita, after a few
                            attempts at drawing her out (they were in ignorance of her part in the
                            drama, though Clarita feared her as always), held instinctively aloof.
                            Quiroz found he could make nothing of her, and went away pondering on
                            this new mood, realizing that he might never get to the bottom of this
                            strange woman, and, for that very reason, fascinated the more. She shut
                            herself up before it was dark, and was not again seen till morning. She
                            lay dressed, realizing every minute that she might be losing the last
                            chance to see Rodrigo, but nevertheless, because of that silent,
                            instinctive fear, unable to move. For something like twenty hours out of
                            her life she lost her daring. Hence the night was one of an emotion that
                            it is hardly too extravagant to call agony.</p>
                        <p>When dawn came, she having slept but little, it seemed that the light of
                            a new day brought her somewhat back to herself. She arose, and that very
                            action revived her. She felt her old daring and spirit somewhat
                            returned. She made her toilet with her mind full of half-formed purposes
                            and her blood <pb id="VAA3931-321" n="312"/> high. She was less of a
                            woman, doubtless, than she had been in her sullen silence of the day
                            before; but she was Pepa once more. She was sorry she had let all the
                            day and night go by in inaction. Then, it being still early, about the
                            time, indeed, when Fortino was shaking the dust of the place from his
                            feet, Quiroz knocked, was admitted, and told her of the departure of the
                                <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> with his prisoner.</p>
                        <p>"I tried, incomprehensible and ever-maddening woman, to let you know of
                            this last night, but you would not respond to the tapping of a lover's
                            fingers on your door. 'The fair one is asleep,' said I; 'and after all,
                            what matter? The thing is done; why trouble one's brains about the
                            destiny of this <hi rend="i">jefe?</hi> Let the fair one sleep.' Which I
                            did, though I longed to read your dreams."</p>
                        <p>There was but little change of expression on Pepa's face, for she was
                            again nearly mistress of herself; but that little Quiroz perceived. And
                            with her subsequent questions and actions there came to him the first
                            vague suspicion of a possible truth &#151; but it did not form
                            itself into a positive doubt.</p>
                        <p>"Where have they gone?" asked she, quietly.</p>
                        <p>"Where else but to the city?" responded he.</p>
                        <p>"But the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> is sometimes original. It would be, so it
                            seems to me, folly to go to Guadalajara. Yet I believe there he has
                            gone. On the other hand, it would be like him to stop on the island. He
                            could hold that against many <hi rend="i">
                                <unclear>canoa-,</unclear>
                            </hi> and the rocks and waves would help him; but the project is a
                            little reckless. What matters it? He and Vicente are gone; and permit
                            me, in the last bottom of my heart, to curse that <hi rend="i">jefe
                                politico."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>She came and laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>
                        <p>"Then you have failed," she said, fastening on his <pb id="VAA3931-322"
                                n="313"/> the eyes that began to dance with light. "He would not
                            join in the great scheme. You are bitter over this, Doroteo. It has
                            disappointed you more than you will say. The canker of it is still in
                            you."</p>
                        <p>"There was some tameness in him," said he. "It seemed to me like an omen.
                            I used to quit the game when I felt like this. But since it is so, I am
                            glad he did not stay. I should have been tempted, when I gather up the
                            army, to whip him for a kind of devilish delight I should take in it.
                            Now, what do I care; what does Josefa Aranja care? She trusts me; she
                            knows I can pick up this scattered force. Pepa, I will do all that I
                            have sworn to do or die."</p>
                        <p>"Then at it," she said firmly, and dazzling him with the smile he had not
                            seen for many hours. "Go. If I am inspiration to you, remember now how I
                            send you away. I call you a hero. I put my hands on your shoulders, so.
                            I look into your eyes, so. I give you all hope, all promise. Go now; do
                            not delay one hour. For you carry with you my love."</p>
                        <p>She half whispered the last with an odd pensiveness. He was glittering of
                            eye and full of bounding blood. He would have seized her and kissed her,
                            but she broke suddenly away, and, with a touch of coldness, bade him
                            leave her.</p>
                        <p>"Then, pretty tigress, I am to have no pledge?"</p>
                        <p>"Tigress is a good word, in books; you have used it before; but it is not
                            I. Pledge? Rapacious Quiroz! Look; when I arise a few mornings hence and
                            step to this window and see you riding up the street with an army at
                            your back, then you may have it &#151; never, never, never till
                            then!"</p>
                        <p>So he left her, fired with his enthusiasm, the canker and the omen no
                            more in his mind, reckless and stealthy Quiroz. The <hi rend="i"
                                >mozo</hi> saddled a horse for him <pb id="VAA3931-323" n="314"/>
                            and Doroteo, not so much as taking leave of his fluttering mother,
                            mounted it in the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> and rode away.</p>
                        <p>It was not long after that that Pepa found Clarita alone under the trees
                            of the <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> The sad Clarita sat on a bench there,
                            deep in her troubled thoughts, a silent girl, almost a hopeless one. The
                            flecks of sunlight coming through the mass of leaves, made shining spots
                            of gold on her hair. Pepa came up quietly. She was again the old lovable
                            Pepa. She put her arm tenderly round Clarita's waist.</p>
                        <p>"What are you dreaming about so sadly?" asked she.</p>
                        <p>"Vicente," said Clarita.</p>
                        <p>"You knew that they took him away last night?"</p>
                        <p>"I saw him go," was the reply.</p>
                        <p>"No one knows where he has gone unless it be you, Clarita. Do you
                            know?"</p>
                        <p>"I do not know. But I know where it may be." Pepa smoothed the other's
                            hair.</p>
                        <p>"Where?" asked she. "To Guadalajara?"</p>
                        <p>"No, I do not believe they would take him there."</p>
                        <p>"Then where?"</p>
                        <p>"To Prison Island."</p>
                        <p>"Why?"</p>
                        <p>"From something Don Rodrigo said when we were coming," said Clarita.</p>
                        <p>Then she told her what it was. There was a long and earnest conversation
                            after that between the two. There was suddenly born a purpose in Pepa's
                            mind, but before she could speak it, Clarita herself had urged the deed;
                            for in the latter's feminine heart there was bravery of its kind, and,
                            least expected of all perhaps, an ingenuity and creative talent, not
                            exceedingly prominent but, in the one great subject, <pb
                                id="VAA3931-324" n="315"/> capable of conceiving and doing. There
                            were plans laid, and a course was determined on. A half hour later
                            Clarita arose with new light and hope in her face. She went alone into
                            the rear <hi rend="i">patio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Where is Fortino?" she asked.</p>
                        <p>"He went out of that door," replied Anastasio, "and I heard him making
                            the river road shake with his walking on it."</p>
                        <p>She returned, went into the street by the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> door,
                            and proceeded toward the river. She asked several whom she passed for
                            news of him. One had seen a very large man yonder by the shore. Thither
                            she came, finding him sitting in a small bare space between the lake
                            road and the marsh, his eyes fixed on the dark water that lay silent
                            among the reeds. The flat marsh was green and shining in the morning
                            sun, with the river winding through it a glistening band. There was
                            little wind. Doves in the trees were still making their sad sounds, of
                            all in nature fittest music to the scene.</p>
                        <p>The fisherman did not hear her approach. She came where he sat, and laid
                            her small hand on his shoulder. He turned his head slowly, and looked at
                            her, without much evidence of recognition.</p>
                        <p>"Fortino," she said gently, "you are very wretched over yesterday. At
                            least I, Fortino, do not believe that it is you who are to blame. I
                            think I even know who is, and, except that I was so weak from grief and
                            did not know where to turn, and Doña Manuela was kind, I could not have
                            stayed in his house. I cannot return thither. Fortino, do not despair.
                            There is always a way for the faithful one, and you are Vicente's
                            friend. Listen to me; I will tell you how we might do something, at
                            least come where he is, so that you can let him know you did not mean
                            it. <pb id="VAA3931-325" n="316"/> I, too, will tell him that, and we
                            will not feel hard against you. Do you hear, Fortino?"</p>
                        <p>He looked into her tender eyes. The animal-like man melted before her,
                            and that odd old Fortino actually wept, of a sudden, like a child. Then
                            she continued, putting her hand on his, being very sorry for him:</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo and some soldiers and two vessels went away across the lake
                            last night at dark, taking Vicente. I saw them. Nobody knows where they
                            went, but I have good reasons for thinking it was to the island that
                            lies out there seven leagues distant. And this is why. When we were
                            coming, Don Rodrigo and I talked of the island, and he said he had been
                            there. He said, too, he did not like to speak of it, for, if the course
                            of the war took a certain turn, he might have to do what he should not
                            like to do. I did not understand him, but I think now he was thinking of
                            the capture of Vicente, and it came over him that there might be the
                            safest spot; for they say much of the old prison remains. Fortino, you
                            do not believe it is haunted, and are not afraid of ghosts?"</p>
                        <p>"Not I," muttered he heavily, beginning to think.</p>
                        <p>"You have never been there?"</p>
                        <p>"No."</p>
                        <p>"Would you go, Fortino, if I wanted you to, and take me &#151; me and
                            Pepita?"</p>
                        <p>Pepa had so managed the affair of the day before that none of the
                            directions to him or any other save Quiroz had come from her. She had
                            been the unseen power. Hence Fortino had not definitely connected her
                            with the treachery. But he did not like her.</p>
                        <p>"I don't want to take the other one," said he.</p>
                        <p>"Why?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-326" n="317"/>
                        <p>"Nothing. I don't like the other one."</p>
                        <p>"Well, but she wants to go. I do not know any reason why I should not
                            want her to. You know &#151; you know, Fortino, she and Vicente are
                            &#151; were lovers. It would be only right that she go."</p>
                        <p>She was smothering her own suspicions, trying to be good to Pepa in her
                            own sorrow.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, I want you to take us both. You can get two other sailors. You can
                            take my father and Anastasio."</p>
                        <p>"No," groaned he; "they taunted me."</p>
                        <p>"This was very wrong of them," she said thoughtfully. "Well, there are
                            others. And we shall take food for three days, for we may not find him
                            at once. I was once out five days, going from place to place with my
                            father, and sleeping in the <hi rend="i">canoa;</hi> it was a good
                            journey, and I liked it. We will go first to the island. If he is not
                            there, we will go on across the lake, and learn where he is. Then, if
                            they have taken him too far away, at least," and her voice broke, "we
                            can go to Chapala and be at home. There is nothing to be done, Fortino,
                            by staying here. You want to tell him that you are still faithful; that
                            it was no fault of yours, only your faith. We will find him; even there
                            may be some chance to rescue him, for you are very strong."</p>
                        <p>"I would break down the gates of Heaven to do that, Clarita," said
                            he.</p>
                        <p>"Then you will come?"</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,"</hi> he replied, arising with a mournful dignity, and
                            seeming to the small girl very large indeed, "I will go. But the wind is
                            wrong. I think we shall have to wait till night for a wind. It has
                            changed since I sat here. The sky, the clouds, the very air are against
                            me, wreck that I am."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-327" n="318"/>
                        <p>"Then," said she, "we will go when the wind comes."</p>
                        <p>She thanked him fervently, and gave him her hand, and then, wrapping the
                            gray <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> about her head and shoulders, went on into
                            the town. She went to Quiroz's house only to report to Pepa. She would
                            not stay there. She went to an inn at the plaza, and remained in it all
                            day.</p>
                        <p>Thus it chanced that, when a southern breeze sprang up toward six o'clock
                            that evening, and the sun had lit his flames in the west, another <hi
                                rend="i">canoa</hi> was poled down the river and sent out into the
                            lake, where the white square of canvas caught the wind, and a journey
                            was begun toward a barely visible speck of black in the distant middle
                            of the great basin.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
                        <p>THERE is but a vague idea among the inhabitants of the lake borders
                            concerning the origin and the age of the ruins that are still to be seen
                            on Prison Island, ruins which, by their massiveness, by their evidences
                            of a complete and elaborate system, form a startling contrast to the
                            simplicity of the life of the surrounding shores. One need only chance
                            on that deserted spot in the middle of the lake to know that a powerful
                            and civilized nation came and pushed its institutions into a primitive
                            one.</p>
                        <p>The island is three-quarters of a mile long and less than a quarter of a
                            mile wide in its widest part. At some parts the width is less than an
                            eighth. It is curved round a small bay on the western side, the side
                            toward Chapala and from which Chapala's towers are barely visible. It is
                            a rocky and rugged piece of land, stern, unpromising. It rises more than
                            one hundred feet above the water and its summit is somewhat flat. Its
                            sides are steep and strewn with boulders. In places at the shore lie
                            vast quantities of broken rocks heaped or strewn in chaos. The place has
                            repelled men for many years. The prison is too gloomy, too stern. They
                            thought it haunted.</p>
                        <p>There are a few large trees on the summit, but the most prevalent plant
                            is the great, zigzag bush of the flat-leaved cactus that bears the juicy
                                <hi rend="i">tuna.</hi>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-329" n="320"/> These plants stand in thorny clusters
                            that rise high in air and cover spaces of many square yards, defying
                            penetration. They cling, too, down on the steep sides and drop red fruit
                            into the waves. But they leave much of the summit bare. There are some
                            wild goats leaping among the stones. Many a carrion-eating black bird of
                            great size, being a kind of vulture, hovers about ruined wall or empty
                            moat, or flaps a sluggish wing over the roofless cells.</p>
                        <p>Toward the northern end stand the ruins of a stone Catholic chapel. The
                            roof lies broken on the floor. The naves are empty. The walls are
                            discolored by time and let in the sunlight through yawning gaps. There
                            is no altar, nor any pulpit, nor a vestige of priesthood, nor any memory
                            of those that came in at the high arched door and knelt. There is a
                            large open square near by whose surrounding walls, fifty yards in each
                            direction, are mouldering and covered with herbage.</p>
                        <p>A full half mile away, at the southern end, the end toward Tizapan, are
                            the remains of an edifice much larger and curious of construction. It
                            was like two tunnels built above instead of under the ground, of stone,
                            rising fifty feet in height, the tunnels parallel, divided only by a
                            single wall that was common to both. There was no communication between
                            them. There were no partitions. The tiny windows were thirty feet above
                            the ground and the arched roofs let in no light. Each long passage
                            measured twenty yards from end to end. Each might have held many
                            prisoners and, thus occupied, even beneath the ground there could
                            scarcely have been a more loathsome dungeon. The appearance of this
                            building from without, is strange in the extreme. Its position, too,
                            arrests attention. It is high on the <pb id="VAA3931-330" n="321"/>
                            bluff over the water. The island at that end narrows and that section of
                            it whereon the building stands is cut off from the rest by a deep moat
                            that extends entirely across the land. The moat is now dry; the
                            drawbridge is wanting. In one of the two high pillars that stand at the
                            place of the bridge is an inscription stone. The inscription is
                            chiselled away.</p>
                        <p>Between the church occupying the island's one end and the vaulted
                            building occupying the other, and situated in the centre of the widest
                            portion of the island, stands the largest edifice. It is nearer the
                            vaulted one than the church. A space of some one hundred yards separates
                            this prison from that of the tunnels. It is exceedingly large and
                            square, being made of long rows of cells extending successively round
                            the four sides of an inner open court. None of the cells has doors
                            opening out to the unwalled island. Some of them have doors opening into
                            the court. Others have not even these, nor any windows, only one narrow
                            door leading into a second cell which, windowless, leads into a third,
                            thence to a fourth. The fourth may open into the court. Thus there are
                            series with but one entrance for each. The last of a series, with its
                            door locked, must have been a hole of horrors to him who occupied
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Nearly all the walls stand firm and strong, though blackened. The greater
                            portion of the roofs has fallen in and lies in ruins. There is a reason
                            for the intact condition of the walls. There is a place where it seems a
                            prisoner has tried to dig his way out, which place shows the
                            composition. He began with the plaster coating and came to a layer of
                            brick. Doubtless he was overjoyed that it was brick instead of stone.
                            After concealing his labor for some time, in peril of being shot, he
                            came to a wall of solid <pb id="VAA3931-331" n="322"/> rock. The stones
                            of it are exceedingly large. They are square cut, fitted with nicety. He
                            failed to go further. If one starts boring in from outside he will come
                            to brick also. So the real wall of stone is buried between walls of
                            brick. The whole is two yards thick.</p>
                        <p>The court in the centre is forty yards square. It is wild looking,
                            deserted. From without one low passage leads into it between cells. To
                            reach that passage a deep moat must be crossed, a moat which surrounds
                            the entire prison. It is now dry and the bridge is gone. In two corners
                            of this edifice narrow spiral staircases rise to the summit of it,
                            issuing in towers. These corners, time-stained, give the last touches to
                            the mediæval air that is over the whole of the island. But the mediæval
                            power is gone.</p>
                        <p>Farther toward the eastern shore there are ruins that are more completely
                            ruins. Here must have been a building as large as that just described.
                            But it was much older. Its walls are all down, rounded heaps like
                            earthworks. Out of the summits of the heaps grow large trees. Again,
                            between the square prison and the prison of tunnels, stands a lone
                            tower, high and square, with stairs in it. Past this a paved road,
                            doubtless convict made, leads from the one prison to the moat that cuts
                            the island in two at the other, and continues beyond.</p>
                        <p>On the western side, the side of the bay, the side toward Chapala, the
                            ascent, though steep, was such as to allow of the building of a winding
                            roadway up. It is broad and well paved, the slow, slow work of many
                            hands. One cannot see it without picturing to himself the lines of
                            wretches that toiled in bondage up the long incline. At its foot by the
                            bay are the remnants of a stone landing-place. Here is a spot <pb
                                id="VAA3931-332" n="323"/> more nearly like a harbor than is any
                            other of the shore. Here the <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> &#151; the
                            same in those old times that they are to-day &#151; discharged their
                            unhappy cargoes. At the landing, with its base beaten by the waves, is
                            another lonely tower. It is Roman in appearance. It is massive, lifting
                            a heavy dome.</p>
                        <p>To him who, in that olden time of tyranny, brought his enslaved Aztec
                            body and his crushed Aztec soul to this spot, hope must have perished,
                            and the day, though it were the fairest that the fair lake knew, been
                            black. For, though he should penetrate the rock and cross the moat,
                            though he should evade the sentries on wall and in tower, freedom yet
                            would not be his till he should swim ten miles to Mescala on the north,
                            or twenty to the south, there where Tizapan lies unseen under her
                            peaks.</p>
                        <p>Before dawn of the day last spoken of there was the unwonted presence of
                            two <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> in the little bay, sailing in lonely,
                            disturbing the old solitude, being poled at length, sails down, to the
                            ruins of the dock beside the tower. The wind was falling and the waves
                            were gentle. The morning star was up in the east. The guide had done his
                            duty, though with the lessening breeze there was no such need of him as
                            the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> had anticipated. Besides the anchors at the
                            bows, ropes were run out of the sterns and tied at the tower's base. The
                            tower itself rose gloomy, its dome cutting a half circle out of the sky.
                            The rocky promontories of the island, too, shut out half the starry
                            expanse. Men disembarked and stood about on the rocks, chilled by the
                            place. It was new to them all save to the guide and the leader. The
                            prisoner was brought to land, guarded. He, too, stood looking at the
                            tower. He had said not a word since he entered the <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa</hi> with Bonavidas. He said <pb id="VAA3931-333" n="324"/>
                            nothing now. He stood aloof, silent, the night hiding the expression of
                            his face. When the men, the weapons, the ammunition, and the provisions
                            were at length safely landed on the remnants of pier, the prisoner was
                            heard to sigh heavily.</p>
                        <p>The guide, whose scarred face had been seen at times during the voyage by
                            the light of a candle and had been observed to show signs of excitement,
                            was on the point of landing. Rodrigo's voice sounded odd and loud,
                            breaking on the silence:</p>
                        <p>"Keep to your vessel, friend," said he. "I shall not pay you by leaving
                            you in this solitude. I promised to see you over. So I will. Bonavidas,
                            have you chosen your men?"</p>
                        <p>"They are ready enough," was the reply.</p>
                        <p>"Take, then, this vessel. It is the fastest. The wind will not last you
                            many hours more. So make for the nearest coast. Take this silent friend
                            with you and give him his liberty when you arrive. Then you and your
                            three companions get you to the governor as fast as any beasts you can
                            steal or buy or borrow can travel thither. Give him first the letter,
                            and in the name of haste get an answer from him at once and bring it,
                            that I may know my next step. And remember this, as I have told you: If
                            there is to be any delay, if I am to hold this desert spot so much as a
                            day after your return, he is to send me a cannon or two to do it with.
                            Go on and make haste."</p>
                        <p>The mute was crouched on the stern of the vessel. He hesitated. He felt
                            Rodrigo's hand on his shoulder and suddenly flashed eyes at the <hi
                                rend="i">jefe</hi> that were luminous in the darkness.</p>
                        <p>"Thank you friend," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> "and farewell."</p>
                        <p>The mute descended within, went creeping to the bow, and lay down there,
                            where it was black, on the <pb id="VAA3931-334" n="325"/> boat's bottom
                            under an unused sail. Bonavidas and three others entered likewise. The
                            boat glided out impelled by poles. It lay for a moment rocking yonder on
                            the waves. Then the canvas went up and caught the breeze. With the four
                            soldiers in the stern and the mute in the bow, the vessel began its
                            journey in the first of the dawn.</p>
                        <p>None of those left behind spoke. The march up the old winding roadway of
                            cobblestones began, Vicente, strong and elastic of step, leading the
                            way. He seemed to hasten to this new condition as though it were part of
                            his own necessary course. The steep way led between walls of rock and
                            clusters of cacti. They issued at length on the island's top under
                            certain trees, and the lake and the round tower were far below. Under
                            these trees, they halted him and, a guard being left, Rodrigo and some
                            others went away and disappeared. They were gone an hour, during which
                            it grew lighter, during which, also, the prisoner stood, seemingly
                            unseeing, and looked at the east where the sun would rise out of the
                            water. When at last the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> returned there was red in
                            the sky and the clear freshness of a new day in the air. Rodrigo had
                            examined the island from end to end. He knew his course. He was, too,
                            sick at heart.</p>
                        <p>"Come," said he to Vicente, constrainedly. "I must plunge into it as into
                            cold water, and have it done. If you knew half the bitterness this
                            business causes me, we might yet be friends."</p>
                        <p>Vicente turned his eyes on the speaker.</p>
                        <p>"Why, we are sufficiently so," said he. "We follow different laws, that
                            is all. At least you are a man. There be some that are not men."</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> was startled to see the other's one unbandaged
                            hand held out to him. He took it in <pb id="VAA3931-335" n="326"/>
                            silence and turned, and Vicente followed. They went to that great square
                            prison, across whose moat at the only opening the soldiers had dragged
                            the trunk of a tree. When the prisoner finally entered and felt the
                            presence of the walls about him, the sun was rising and burnishing the
                            lake and a track of yellow gold led across the water straight into its
                            great eye.</p>
                        <p>He was taken through the stone passage and into the open court. Its floor
                            was covered with weeds, shrubs, and cacti. Among these the party went,
                            crossing to the western wall. On this side there was one of those series
                            of cells already mentioned, whereof a single cell only gave exit into
                            the court. The second opened only into the first. It had a small,
                            deep-barred window. The third led into the second and the fourth into
                            the third. These two last had no other doors nor any windows. They had
                            been dungeons.</p>
                        <p>The innermost of the four, that one most dungeon-like, was still roofed.
                            It was situated in the far southeast corner of the ruins. To pass from
                            it through the three others, and thence to the only exit, one must
                            traverse a distance of some thirty yards, for the cells were long. The
                            partition between it and the third was intact and the open doorway very
                            narrow. Between the third and the second were the rotten remnants of a
                            heavy wooden door strengthened by iron bands. The second cell was
                            roofless and the partition between it and the first was partially down.
                            The exit into the court was another narrow doorway with no door. Guards
                            at this passage were thus in command of the four cells.</p>
                        <p>They put him in that series, and some soldiers took their stand at the
                            entrance. Rodrigo, eager to be away from a spot that was loathsome to
                            him, <unclear>too-</unclear>
                            <pb id="VAA3931-336" n="327"/> the rest of his men to the shore again,
                            whence the provisions were to be carried to the summit. Those provisions
                            were, for the most part, of that very store that Fortino and Anastasio
                            had seen to the gathering of in Tizapan. They were, in the main, taken
                            to the ruins of the church. It was there Rodrigo made his quarters. He
                            would not stay longer than need be in the prison. The church was
                            cleaned, fuel was collected, duties were assigned, and the wait for the
                            governor's orders was begun, &#151; a wait that, to him who was
                            master of the spot, who loved freedom and deeds and action, was
                            nevertheless a wait of unalloyed misery, the hours of which were
                            depressing weeks.</p>
                        <p>"Pray God I may receive orders to-morrow," said he, "and that I be not
                            forced to the worst."</p>
                        <p>Vicente had walked into his prison with his never-absent, unmoved
                            calmness, whatever else his face bespoke. They asked him where he wished
                            his bed. He traversed the first and second cells, looking at their
                            desolation. He pushed open the rotten door to the third, and the hinges
                            grated echoingly. He traversed the third and the fourth. The last was
                            darkest and most depressing, but its floor was intact. He desired, said
                            he, to sleep there. So the place was cleaned as well as could be. It was
                            paved with large square stones. Blankets were brought and put in the
                            farthest corner, according to his directions, and a candle was placed
                            beside them. He was left alone.</p>
                        <p>He strode slowly back and forth for hours from the southern end of the
                            innermost cell to the northern end of that which gave exit to the court
                            where the guards sat. At one o'clock they brought him something to eat,
                            as they had done at nine. All the afternoon he stood in the second cell
                            at the barred window, looking out over the weed-choked <hi rend="i"
                                >patio.</hi> At <pb id="VAA3931-337" n="328"/> night, having eaten,
                            he shut himself up in the rear cells.</p>
                        <p>He did not sleep. The hours went by, passed by him in unhappy thought.
                            And it was characteristic of his unsullied nature and the strong and
                            faithful clinging to his one purpose, that not his failure or his danger
                            was the cause of bitterest grief to him, but rather the sorrowful fact
                            of the treachery that had brought them about. He tried to put the memory
                            of that away. He wished, finally, that his wounded head and shoulder
                            might pain him more poignantly, that he might thus be unable to think.
                            But the treachery was yet uppermost. There was one subject of thought,
                            however, that finally banished even that.</p>
                        <p>As he had neared the island a burst of light had come over his brain. He
                            had watched the course of the vessel with unseen intensity of interest.
                            There were other things meant by that heavy sigh which escaped him on
                            the pier than mere sadness. It meant, too, relief of what had been
                            nearly excitement. When he had risen to the island's summit he had
                            scanned every rock, though he had seemed to see nothing. Arrived at that
                            summit it was not the coming day alone that he saw. Entering his prison
                            he had strained his powers of recollection. He had not, however, been
                            gratified. He had seen nothing that he remembered. But his situation, he
                            felt, was nevertheless strange and incongruous. The possibilities of it
                            filled him with an unreasoning anticipation. When the sun at length
                            rose, therefore, and he came, after a sleepless night, and looked,
                            hollow-eyed, through the bars into the desolate court, it was not on a
                            day altogether without hope that he gazed, nor on walls that meant
                            nothing but imprisonment. Yet having gazed thus at certain black wings
                            that drooped over a turret <pb id="VAA3931-338" n="329"/> opposite, he
                            sighed again, a sigh of pain, and turned and paced among the ruins.</p>
                        <p>"Fool," said he; "fool you are and have ever been. Now that your dream is
                            wrecked, you would look for miracles to spring from the ruins of a
                            prison."</p>
                        <p>That day also passed without incident. And the second night, to be nearly
                            as sleepless as the first, closed in.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the vessel in which Bonavidas was hastening his message to
                            Guadalajara and on which Vicente's destiny hung, had rounded, in that
                            first dawn, the rocks that mark the bay's eastern arm, and made for
                            Mescala. It was still nearly dark when the last of the island's coasts
                            was left behind. Just after passing that last headland, a spot where
                            bold rocks stood out of the water and the land was broken with stony
                            confusion, the four soldiers being at that time in the boat's stern and
                            the sail somewhat hiding the bow, one of the four believed that he heard
                            a splash in the water to the front.</p>
                        <p>"What was that?" said he, leaning over the side. "There was a noise in
                            the water."</p>
                        <p>The others leaned and looked also. It was too dark to see.</p>
                        <p>"I did n't hear anything, nor you either," said Bonavidas, coughing dryly
                            and spitting up something, which result of the cough he did not make
                            manifest to his comrades. He turned, then, deathly pale, but smiling his
                            same uncanny smile.</p>
                        <p>"I, too, heard it," said the third soldier, who was at the rudder.</p>
                        <p>"And I," said the fourth, "but it was only a fish. They say the <hi
                                rend="i">vagres</hi> jump out of the water so, and I have seen a <hi
                                rend="i">vagre</hi> five feet long."</p>
                        <p>"It is not so," answered the first. <hi rend="i">"Vagres</hi> never jump
                            out of the water."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-339" n="330"/>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Vagres,</hi> I tell you, jump most astonishingly high."</p>
                        <p>"Children," said Bonavidas, "the argument is purposeless. Jump or no
                            jump, what odds? Call it a mermaid; mermaids are prettier than <hi
                                rend="i">vagres."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The discussion was dropped. The breeze continued light. There was fear
                            lest it should die before bringing them to shore. The high blue saw of
                            the mountains seemed to grow higher and nearer with exasperating
                            slowness. Day came and the yellow sun; the lake was a mass of flashing
                            ripples. When the vessel stood half-way between the tiny and distant
                            island and the vast and distant mountains of the shore, one of the
                            soldiers left the stern, where he had been playing cards with a
                            companion, and, stooping under the thatch, went to the bow.</p>
                        <p>"How is our freight, &#151; the mute?" called one from the stern.</p>
                        <p>"I don't see him," said the other.</p>
                        <p>"He is under the sail."</p>
                        <p>"He is not under the sail."</p>
                        <p>"I tell you he hid himself under the sail."</p>
                        <p>"If you can see fish where there are none, you may see him under it,
                            then. I tell you, friend, there is nothing under the sail."</p>
                        <p>The two who were not at the rudder followed to the bow. The sail was
                            thrown aside and lay flat on the floor. There was no possible place in a
                            vessel like this to hide. The bow was empty. The soldiers gazed at one
                            another.</p>
                        <p>"Well, may Moses comfort me!" ejaculated Bonavidas.</p>
                        <p>"He has slid over the side in the dark and dived yonder by the island,"
                            said the fourth soldier.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si, señor,"</hi> said the first. "That was your <hi
                                rend="i">vagre."</hi>
                        </p>

                        <head>CHAPTER V</head>
                        <p>RODRIGO determined that the night watches should not be left entirely to
                            inferiors. Uncongenial as the whole task had grown to be, he would yet
                            watch all points himself. He inaugurated the custom of making in person
                            at least three slow circuits of the entire island each night. Thus would
                            there be less possibility of a fleet's surprising him.</p>
                        <p>It was still dark on the morning of that second day, and he had but just
                            returned to the church from his last inspection of his guards, when one
                            of the latter came to him. A <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> said the soldier,
                            had anchored off the southern point. The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> arose
                            and, following the guard, went and looked at the ghost-like vessel,
                            which could scarcely be seen lying on the waves. Some intuition, born of
                            a new interest in his life, or perhaps his knowledge of her nature,
                            turned his thoughts at once to Clarita. Moody, dark of mind, he gave
                            orders that the vessel be watched, and returned to the church. He lay
                            down and passed sleepless hours till day.</p>
                        <p>"The 'little one,'" he muttered. "She would go into the great abyss to
                            find him."</p>
                        <p>At daylight, the waves being smaller, the mysterious <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa</hi> was poled into the bay. Rodrigo had doggedly refrained
                            from watching its arrival. He had remained at the church, receiving word
                            of its movements. He mastered his own perversity at length and came to
                            the island's upper edge. The vessel <pb id="VAA3931-341" n="332"/> lay
                            there at the ruins of pier with the ripples lapping its sides. There was
                            a sailor sitting on its stern eating a <hi rend="i">tortilla.</hi> There
                            was another doing something with a sail. If there was any one under the
                            thatch, the thatch of course hid him.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo observed these things at a glance; but they took none of his
                            attention. His eyes were nearer. She was there, the little one, toiling
                            slowly up the long ascent of old cobblestone roadway, a cactus or a
                            boulder now hiding her, for she was very small, so far down there. The
                            gray <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> was over her head and shoulders, and the
                            hair was hid from the light of the morning. Strange as her coming was,
                            perhaps her companion seemed stranger yet, merely that so great and
                            rough a man should be her companion. For Fortino was climbing up, too,
                            by her side, Fortino the huge, with a demeanor of deep seriousness, of
                            depression. His sombrero seemed exceedingly high. His white peon shirt
                            and his loose white trousers were a trifle soiled and his sandals a
                            trifle worn. Round his waist was the blue sash, still brilliant. He was
                            assisting her, holding her arm in a stiff and unwonted gallantry.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> sighed and turned back. He entered the church
                            and sat down on a heap of the fallen roof with his back to the door.
                            After a time the new-comers had reached the summit, for he heard her
                            high voice asking for him.</p>
                        <p>"We will go, if you please, señor, to Don Rodrigo."</p>
                        <p>A soldier came into the church.</p>
                        <p>"Shall I bring them in here?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said the <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ruins seemed stern to her, inspiring her with awe; and she shuddered
                            at the birds, though she was not conscious of seeing them. The doorway
                            of the church was large and she and Fortino turned to it. <pb
                                id="VAA3931-342" n="333"/> The giant stood stolidly staring at the
                            back of Rodrigo, who had arisen yonder at the altar place.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo," said she timidly.</p>
                        <p>He turned and looked at them. Her first impression, and it was a
                            startling one, was that Rodrigo looked older than she had thought him.
                            He forced himself into a strained cordiality, white and serious of face.
                            He came across the floor among bricks, stone, and mortar. He held out
                            his hand.</p>
                        <p>"Come in &#151; at least we can be equal in a church. Fortino, my
                            friend, you have brought this girl to a dreary place."</p>
                        <p>"Señor," said Fortino, standing glaring at Rodrigo with bloodshot eyes
                            and speaking with despair, "you may be a brave man, but I am no friend
                            of yours. I am not anybody's friend. Damn me, he who takes Fortino for a
                            friend is cursed."</p>
                        <p>"At least come in," said Rodrigo, and they followed him toward the place
                            of the altar, a movement rather of nervousness than of purpose
                            &#151; for the sky was the roof wherever they went.</p>
                        <p>"Don Rodrigo," said Clarita, turning her eyes on him and letting the <hi
                                rend="i">rebozo</hi> fall to her shoulders as she stood, like a
                            figure in some gray stone, before him, "is Vicente here?"</p>
                        <p>"He is here, little one," said he. "He is in the prison over there."</p>
                        <p>Whereat her eyes filled with tears, though she did not hesitate, but
                            spoke as before.</p>
                        <p>"I have brought Fortino, señor, because we thought he might be here, and
                            if he had not been, we should have gone home. Don Rodrigo, it was
                            Fortino who put up the chain. But Fortino is not a traitor; he did not
                            mean it. Fortino is loyal and very good. He was told that it was you he
                            was to stop. You <pb id="VAA3931-343" n="334"/> will not think less of
                            Fortino because he would have injured you, for you know he was on the
                            other side. And when he found they had deceived him, he was very ill,
                            and it weighs on him very much. And I was &#151; I was &#151;
                            sorry for him, for it weighed on him so. I saw he was &#151; he was
                            not what Vicente might think him; and I said &#151; I said I would
                            bring him &#151;" she faltered and looked at the big Fortino
                            &#151; "I would bring him here, and, if Vicente were here, I knew
                            you would let him talk to him, so that he can tell Vicente that he did
                            not mean it. This will be a great happiness to Fortino. This is
                            &#151; this is why I brought him, Don Rodrigo."</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo was awed into silence by the simplicity of that wonderful
                            statement; nor did it strike him as incongruous, this small girl's
                            bringing of this giant over the water. He stood and looked at her as she
                            gazed anxiously up at him. She seemed to him beautiful.</p>
                        <p>"Little girl," sighed he at last, "if any man could refuse you this
                            &#151; alas! he would be no more a man. I think I read that you
                            came, too, because, as at other times, you could not stay away. You too
                            wish to see him?"</p>
                        <p>"Is he comfortable, señor, and is he where he can have a little room and
                            light and food, and where he can sleep?"</p>
                        <p>"It is the best I could do, Clarita. He has all these things."</p>
                        <p>She stood in strained silence for a time.</p>
                        <p>"Can I stay here in the church?" asked she.</p>
                        <p>"Why &#151; it is a dreary and a hard place."</p>
                        <p>"It will do. Fortino can bring food from the boat and watch at the
                            door."</p>
                        <p>"God pity me!" cried Rodrigo. "You too, then, wish to stay!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-344" n="335"/>
                        <p>"I do not want to go away, señor," said she.</p>
                        <p>"But how will you sleep &#151; how will you live?"</p>
                        <p>He knew there was a quick fire born in him and that his heart was not all
                            eagerness that she should go away.</p>
                        <p>"Have you forgotten, señor, that we are very poor here by the lake and
                            the houses are little, and that I have slept all my life on the ground?
                            I will stay. I cannot go away. I could sleep, señor, if I must, on the
                            rocks outside."</p>
                        <p>"You may have the church, Clarita," said he, sadly; "and I think the
                            Virgin will forget that it is ruins and come."</p>
                        <p>"I knew if you were here," said she, "you would be good to me. I am not
                            afraid."</p>
                        <p>"I shall take this friend now," said the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> "to
                            Vicente. And you &#151; though I dread it &#151; you too will
                            come?"</p>
                        <p>"No. I will not come. And I believe I do not want him to know that I am
                            here. You will tell your men that Vicente is not to know. Fortino, you
                            are not to tell him that I am with you. For if he needs me, Don Rodrigo,
                            I know you will come and tell me. I do not want him to know, for it
                            would add to his unhappiness. He would be afraid for me."</p>
                        <p>The two went out, Rodrigo leading, and Fortino following silently in a
                            perspiration but without any of the customary flames in his face. She
                            came to the door, wrapping the <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> round her head,
                            and sat down on a stone and watched them go, her eyes full of her love
                            and her wretchedness. She had made a sacrifice that one should not try
                            to measure when she decided she should not go also. When she saw the two
                            arrive at the prison she cried in her heart:</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-345" n="336"/>
                        <p>"I, too, wish much to see him!"</p>
                        <p>They felt it necessary at the prison to search Fortino. They found
                            nothing. Rodrigo ordered one of the guards to accompany the fisherman
                            and be present at the interview. He himself returned to the church. The
                            girl had gone inside. She was standing by the far wall, wrapped in
                            thought, and he came near her.</p>
                        <p>"Señor," she said with emotion, and put out her hand with a little
                            impulsive movement that was new to him, "I wish to tell you again that I
                            know that in your heart you are not any enemy to us, only that you were
                            on the side that you thought right. I say this because I can see that
                            you are oppressed and are sorry for me, and because I must thank you
                            again for being as kind to him as you can be &#151; and to me."</p>
                        <p>He took the hand a moment.</p>
                        <p>"Have I been kind to you, Clarita? It seems to me I have been only
                            cruel."</p>
                        <p>"You are kind, indeed you are kind!" she said, eagerly, frankly, with the
                            tenderness that made her greatly fear to hurt any one.</p>
                        <p>He had her sit down on a smooth stone where of old priests had chanted.
                            He himself sat down a little way from her.</p>
                        <p>"You could not stay away," he said, turning his brown eyes and knitted
                            brow toward her, speaking musingly.</p>
                        <p>"No."</p>
                        <p>"You would have come had it been the sea instead of the lake."</p>
                        <p>"I do not know," said she, "for the sea is very wide. I should have
                            wanted to try."</p>
                        <p>He was silent a long while. He was borne away on a stream of strong deep
                            thought and emotion.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-346" n="337"/>
                        <p>"Clarita," he said, after a time, "I am lost again in wonder at your
                            faithfulness. You do not know how different you are &#151; you never
                            saw the world. If it had half of your steadfastness it would be the
                            world no longer. There are books in my country that are full of stories
                            of Mexican faithlessness. It is a habit, and a bad and constant one, to
                            call your people faithless. The opinion is prated much, and believed
                            much. I even had it myself. Well, I have seen Mexican treachery. There
                            are villains here &#151; there are villains everywhere. But there
                            are true ones too. I have seen a faith, a strength of soul, on the
                            lake's border such as I never knew in any other part of the wide world.
                            Let my nation plume itself no more on honesty. I think there are many at
                            its very head who could learn the art of life from you."</p>
                        <p>"Señor, you rate me very much too high. I do not want you to think thus
                            of me. Tell me something about your life before you came here. It must
                            have been sad."</p>
                        <p>She said it with so much tenderness that he was drawn out of himself. He
                            had come to that time when a man would throw himself away to empty his
                            heart.</p>
                        <p>"A part of it was bitter, little one. How could you understand that
                            another woman was untrue?"</p>
                        <p>"I have seen women," said she, thinking of Pepa, "of whom I was
                            afraid."</p>
                        <p>She arose and came and sat nearer, a very natural movement.</p>
                        <p>"Tell me," said she.</p>
                        <p>He waited some minutes.</p>
                        <p>"I lived in a city," he began, "in the east, and my father was a man of
                            wealth. I was a little wild <pb id="VAA3931-347" n="338"/> of spirit,
                            Clarita, and I went away from home and travelled over the west. In a
                            western city I met a girl with whom I thought I fell in love. Well
                            &#151; it is like so many other stories. There is no need to tell it
                            all. She was beautiful &#151; or I thought she was. I think it was
                            her eyes that won me &#151; large gray eyes. I gave her everything,
                            my heart and my faith. I believed in her as though she were myself. All
                            my life I had seen the worship of money and hated it. Because I had some
                            wealth I had seen the falseness of many friends. Well, at the deepest
                            moment I saw hers also. That is all, little girl. There is no romance in
                            this, just dull bitterness. She may have thought she cared for me. It
                            was really the money; for she went away and married some one else who
                            had more of it. This turned me against everything. I was always extreme
                            in my acts and feelings. I thought for a time that every one was false.
                            So I wanted to go away and bury myself. I came down here, for I knew it
                            was a country different and full of solitudes as well as of turmoil.
                            That was eight years ago. I was sad nearly all of the time; I could not
                            forget her. I was glad to be with another race and learn another
                            language. At last I knew she was unworthy of so much sorrow, and I
                            became more careless. I have led a pointless, purposeless life. I had
                            come to Guadalajara in a sudden new spirit of action. I wanted to fight.
                            I joined the little army there and in some troubles some of the city's
                            gendarmes were killed. So they policed many of the streets for a long
                            time with soldiers. This is how I chanced to be a gendarme for a time.
                            Then one day there came into my life a strange little Mexican child with
                            a blue <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> over her head."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-348" n="339"/>
                        <p>She said nothing for a long time, looking at the ruins scattered on the
                            floor; there was the flush of pink slightly in her face, but the dimples
                            were no more there, for in these days she did not smile.</p>
                        <p>"I am sorry," said she at last, haltingly, and paused for another
                            silence. She added after a time:</p>
                        <p>"Was she very beautiful, this other woman?"</p>
                        <p>"She seemed so once."</p>
                        <p>"Was she &#151; was she &#151; very white?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, she was very white."</p>
                        <p>Clarita drew the <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> more closely about her and
                            sighed.</p>
                        <p>"And she was tall, too," she said after a time; "tall and white and
                            &#151; different. Ah, no wonder you loved her!"</p>
                        <p>"Clarita!" cried he, "to be tall and white is nothing! I could love these
                            things no more. Don't you know, don't you know, strange dream-child that
                            you are, what alone it is that I could come to love?"</p>
                        <p>"Then," said she, turning a little away, "if it was not right for you to
                            care for the other, perhaps God had a purpose in all of it."</p>
                        <p>"I have denied it many times," said he. "There was no purpose for me, no
                            thread to follow out. I seemed drifting. I said to myself, there was
                            under my life none of that power of fate that is the source of the deeds
                            of other men. But I was wrong. Alas! I might have known it, seven years
                            ago, for even then, once, I felt the stream that was bearing me. And now
                            &#151; now I am blind no longer."</p>
                        <p>"I too," she said falteringly, trembling, not daring to look at him,
                            "have felt thus. Tell me more of that other girl you love. I know you
                            are very sorry she was not good, and I &#151; I too am sorry."</p>
                        <p>"Clarita!" he said arising, "I am sorry no more. <pb id="VAA3931-349"
                                n="340"/> I wanted to tell you what it is that I could love
                            &#151; faith, truth. The peace that I wished to find in the world
                            when I came away, did not satisfy me. It must be in a person, in a
                            woman. And at last I came here; and I found that the beauty of this
                            place had embodied itself in a girl; and the fact came over me with such
                            depth of knowledge and such sweetness of emotion that at first it was as
                            though it had been with me always. Clarita, by this very confession I am
                            lost. My miserable state is this: That I have found my first love was
                            not love but shallowness, that, having grown older, love, the true, the
                            living, has come to me. In this I am haunted and crushed by the
                            knowledge that I am bound to a course that is anguish to her I love, may
                            be worse than anguish."</p>
                        <p>She had arisen in deep emotion, and had walked away toward the church's
                            far corner, whither he followed her. There were hewn stones, broken,
                            lying at her feet, and the wall was damp and black. She put her arms up
                            on it, and leaned her face against them, burying it, and stood, her
                            breast heaving.</p>
                        <p>"I have not dared to ask before," she said, her voice coming unsteadily,
                            "but you must tell me. What are you going &#151; what will be done
                            with &#151; him?"</p>
                        <p>He sat down on a stone and held his head in his hands.</p>
                        <p>"You would not demand of me that I free him, after &#151; after all
                            that happened &#151; and be called a traitor."</p>
                        <p>She lifted her face from the <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> and looked at him,
                            and a great burst of pity came from her, so that she started to him, but
                            turned back and buried her face again against the wall as though she
                            were a very little child.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-350" n="341"/>
                        <p>"Oh, it is not mine to demand!" she said. "I am not anything &#151; I
                            cannot &#151; I cannot!"</p>
                        <p>"Clarita," he replied, "it is yours, and yours only. For I am powerless.
                            You think yourself weak. You have in you the power that is greatest and
                            strongest of all earth's powers. And because I trust you &#151;
                            because I love you &#151; I would believe that whatever you did or
                            said was right. I do honestly think that if you told me I did wrong to
                            keep your brother, and asked me to let him free, I should walk now to
                            the prison and open the door, though I ruined my life by doing it.
                            Speak, little one &#151; the moment is yours."</p>
                        <p>She looked at him fearfully. He had not raised his head. She was holding
                            her breath. Her <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> had fallen again to her
                            shoulders, and the flood of hair was unbound. Her face seemed almost
                            pure white in the light from the gaping roof; every drop of blood
                            forsook it. There was absolute silence for many seconds. Her brain began
                            to burn with mad thoughts. She closed her eyes. She raised her small
                            hand above her head, and grasped at the damp stones. There came, then,
                            from the walls of the prison, the clear soft notes of a dove, that
                            inimitable sound that carried in it all nature, all beauty, the very
                            meaning of the morning. And the sunlight, pouring through the open roof,
                            was coming slowly down the western wall.</p>
                        <p>She gasped and cleared her brain, and her old self came back.</p>
                        <p>"I cannot &#151; O Holy Mother! &#151; I cannot!" cried she. "Don
                            Rodrigo, I could not wish you to do this."</p>
                        <p>"I knew," said he, "that you could not."</p>
                        <p>"What will happen to him, Don Rodrigo?"</p>
                        <p>"It is beyond my power to decide," he replied. <pb id="VAA3931-351"
                                n="342"/> "I have sent a message to the governor, and the answer
                            could not come, at earliest, before to-night. It must be as the governor
                            says."</p>
                        <p>Strangely enough, she had never thought of the worst. She did not think
                            of it now; she dreamed only of some possible prison where she could
                            come, at least, and sit sometimes outside the door.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita," and he arose again and came near, "you cannot love me. I would
                            not dare to ask it. I am a monster to you. But, hopeless as it is, and
                            bound as I am, I will open my heart once for all. I love you as I never
                            could love any other being. I shall love you till I die."</p>
                        <p>She sobbed.</p>
                        <p>"And the other," murmured she, "she who was tall and white. O Don
                            Rodrigo! you are blind, you do not know &#151; for Clarita is
                            little, Clarita is ignorant. In your own land they call us savages. That
                            we can be true &#151; this is all we have, and this, to your people,
                            is nothing. Ask of your heart, and do not trust it, but go away when all
                            this pain is ended, and forget me, or remember me only as the little
                            brown one who merely knew to follow Vicente, and stay by the prison
                            where he is &#151;"</p>
                        <p>He could endure no more. Against his will he seized her in his arms and
                            held her.</p>
                        <p>"There is another still," she sobbed, "for I have not been blind
                            &#151; Pepa is here!"</p>
                        <p>He let her from him. He was suddenly cold. His face lost color. The
                            remorse swept back on him.</p>
                        <p>"Where?" said he.</p>
                        <p>"In the boat."</p>
                        <p>"Why did she, too, not come here?"</p>
                        <p>"She would not." Clarita was burying her face again. "She sulked in the
                                <hi rend="i">canoa.</hi>"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-352" n="343"/>
                        <p>After some time of silence he shook off the depression Pepa's name had
                            caused.</p>
                        <p>"You yourself must know," said he, "that there can be nothing between me
                            and this woman. God pity her &#151; I never loved her."</p>
                        <p>"But she loves you."</p>
                        <p>"For which," he replied, biting his lip. "Heaven be merciful to her. I
                            cannot speak of these, these who are nothing to me. I can think only of
                            you. Yet am I a monster to you; tell me it is so. Even thus your voice
                            must have some soothing quality in it."</p>
                        <p>She broke down and sank to the ground. He sprang to her, unable to
                            restrain himself. He kneeled and held her with his arms round her
                            shoulders and her head against his breast.</p>
                        <p>"Then tell me only this," he said. "If, when this horror is done, there
                            be at last, by some impossible chance, a way that leaves me free and
                            makes me not the cause of your greater grief &#151; could you then,
                            oh my heart! come to tell me that you loved me?"</p>
                        <p>She was shaking against his breast, weeping. She did not struggle; she
                            rested there a brief moment. In that moment they were united, as truly
                            as though the old days of that old chapel had come back and the priests
                            were there and the boys in white swung censers that cast sweet fragrance
                            to the vaulted roof. But she did not admit it. Her sobs ceased and her
                            grief came back, and the fear of the future. She arose as though
                            frightened, wrapping the <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> round her.</p>
                        <p>"Oh! I cannot tell!" she cried. "We must wait. I cannot speak &#151;
                            I cannot think &#151;"</p>
                        <p>She went away, out of the church, and nearly all that day she sat on the
                            rocks in the most solitary <pb id="VAA3931-353" n="344"/> part of the
                            island, where the autumn sun found light in her auburn locks and the
                            water below her glistened.</p>
                        <p>Fortino, too, that great and wretched giant was seated on the rocks; but
                            on those just outside the central prison door. Fortino had not entered.
                            When they had searched him before allowing him to cross the moat, he had
                            stood and looked at the moat itself, at the walls, at all the gloomy,
                            depressing place. Then they had told him he could enter.</p>
                        <p>"Is he in there?" asked Fortino hoarsely.</p>
                        <p>"Yes."</p>
                        <p>He could not realize it.</p>
                        <p>"He is in this &#151; this hell?" muttered he.</p>
                        <p>They assured him Vicente was within.</p>
                        <p>He stood like a monolith for many minutes and stared in tragedy of spirit
                            into the place.</p>
                        <p>"Here!" he said in a smothered growl of grief. "In this &#151; in
                            this! And I, I did it!"</p>
                        <p>They were in much wonder, watching him. His face suddenly blazed red and
                            he turned red eyes on them.</p>
                        <p>"No!" he cried, "not yet! I cannot yet enter here. Let my damned soul
                            first grow to it!"</p>
                        <p>He backed off some twenty yards and sat down on a rock and stared at the
                            prison's door for eleven miserable hours without food or drink, without
                            uttering a word or moving his eyes. The noon beat down heat on him. The
                            afternoon cast his shadow longer and longer on the stony earth. The
                            evening breeze came and cooled some of the hot sweat from his face. The
                            sun went down in a sea of red light, and the night came. They had given
                            Vicente his supper and the prisoner had retired to the last of the four
                            cells, when Fortino finally arose.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-354" n="345"/>
                        <p>"Perhaps I can do it now," said he.</p>
                        <p>They led him across the moat and through the passage into the <hi
                                rend="i">patio,</hi> thence to the door of the first cell. He fixed
                            his eyes ahead of him. He strove with prodigious effort not to see any
                            of the ruins. He halted in a profound revery at the door.</p>
                        <p>"Come in," said the guard who was to accompany him, "and follow me."</p>
                        <p>He started, awakened, and plunged into the first cell after his leader.
                            The latter held a torch which cast flickering light through the
                            apartments, so that shadows and flames seemed leaping and sporting among
                            the ruins like ghosts. Fortino held his breath and, suffused with
                            misery, stumbled into the second cell. The guard pointed to the door.
                            Fortino put his hand on it, and it creaked and swung open. He entered,
                            followed by the other, and it emitted a dull sound as it closed after
                            them. Into the third cell from the fourth came the dim light of
                            Vicente's candle. The huge man paused and feared to enter. He came to
                            the door and stumbled on a stone, and suddenly burst out in a thunderous
                            oath.</p>
                        <p>"What is it, man?" said a calm voice in the fourth cell. "Come in. Defile
                            not your mouth with blasphemies. There are others more unhappy than you,
                            whoever you be."</p>
                        <p>Fortino came and stood at the door and looked. The guard was with him.
                            Vicente was seated on the blankets with the light on the floor before
                            him. He was not looking at the door, he was looking into the flame of
                            the candle. His face's profile was turned toward Fortino and the light
                            cut it out of the gloom as out of rock. It held a peace in its sadness.
                            Fortino could not go further. He stood and gazed. The prolonged silence
                            led Vicente to turn his head. <pb id="VAA3931-355" n="346"/> He had
                            thought it only a guard. He saw the unmistakable great form. He arose
                            and stood as still as the other, and fastened a deep eye on the
                            giant.</p>
                        <p>"Well," he began, "this is Fortino. This is he who fished and fought.
                            Thus far would my memory go. I will say to myself and mayhap come to
                            believe, that after Ocotlan Fortino died. Yes, this belief will I carry
                            to my grave. It will be more satisfying. Then are you, man, who come
                            where I am a prisoner and stand in the door of my cell at night, the
                            ghost of that old Fortino who fished and fought and died, and was a
                            friend to me? Or are you that other man who wielded your strength when
                            you were dead?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, Body of God!" cried the great one, coming a little nearer. "You,
                            then, too, curse me with it! For which, hear the old lime-kiln say, I
                            blame you not &#151; rather would bless you for it! What did I do? I
                            came across the lake to find you. Why? To enter your prison, wherever in
                            Purgatory it might be! What has the day been to me? I sat through it all
                            outside the door with hell-fire in me, because I dared not come in. I
                            have now come in. Why? That you may trample, if you so desire, my
                            swine's body under your feet, or cut my cursed flesh in strips. I am a
                            madman, an animal, a fool. I am any one, or all of these things, or any
                            other such as have not reason or responsibility or blame. But one thing
                            I am not, so help me or so slay my soul whatever gods there be or
                            mothers or sons of gods or eternal damnations &#151; I am not a
                            traitor! What did they tell me? That I was doing it for you. I did sweat
                            blood with that great hope. I did pour out my soul drop by drop while
                            the iron was heating. Who conceived the deed? I &#151; and my soul
                            is already with the devil <pb id="VAA3931-356" n="347"/> for it. Who put
                            me at it and told me you were waiting in the plaza and your enemy was
                            galloping up the river road? Who but that son of the damned, Quiroz, who
                            beat me on the back and made me a maniac? Señor, I am done; I say no
                            more. I blame you not. You were deeply wronged and your greatness is
                            ruined. Hate me &#151; <hi rend="i">si,</hi> hate me! I long to be
                            loathed &#151; already am I damned. I shall carry away with me a
                            never dead faith in you. I shall want and need no reconciliation or
                            soothing from you. I shall tramp out. Would that my big hulk could shake
                            down these walls! May nobody ever remember this bungling giant! Good-by,
                            sir!"</p>
                        <p>He turned about, having been in his speech like some awful engine, and
                            made for the door.</p>
                        <p>"Stop!" cried Vicente. He came to the other with quick steps and laid his
                            hand on his shoulder.</p>
                        <p>"What do you want?" growled Fortino in hoarseness.</p>
                        <p>"To tell you, Fortino, that I am as ready to see that I judged you
                            wrongly as you were to help me. Then this great form has in it a heart
                            as great; and this is what I had believed of you. Why, man, there is a
                            relief comes to me with this news, that, compared to my grief before, is
                            like happiness. Forgive me my bad thoughts. I am grown morbid. I seem to
                            have been, too, peculiarly blind. Nothing but the sight of you yourself
                            in the midst of the treachery could have made me doubt you. Tell me not,
                            man, to forget you. Call me rather a friend who shall never forget. You
                            come in the darkest hour when the world seemed rotten and traitors the
                            inhabitants of it. You walk in on my loneliness and my despair, and
                            prove to me that honesty still lives. Fortino, when you can measure the
                            worth of this to me, you <pb id="VAA3931-357" n="348"/> can measure your
                            own good and come to perceive that you have undone the mistake you
                            made."</p>
                        <p>The perspiration again rolled down Fortino's countenance.</p>
                        <p>"But the mistake got you in," muttered he, glaring about at the walls,
                            "and the good will not get you out."</p>
                        <p>Vicente led him to the light. Fortino's desire to go was overcome. The
                            two sat down on the stone floor with the candle between them casting its
                            white light up over the clear strong features of the dreamer and over
                            the coarse visage of the giant, whereon the sweat glistened in beads.
                            They talked thus for a long time, the presence of the guard not
                            hindering them. And when at last, more than an hour later, they
                            separated, it was a somewhat soothed yet rather a broken old giant that
                            came out, crossed the stony space to the church and, blocking its wide
                            doorway with his form, slept.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
                        <p>NEARLY all morning Josefa Aranja remained under the thatch of the <hi
                                rend="i">canoa.</hi> She sat on a rude chair that was on the boat's
                            bottom. She held her head on her hand, and her eyes were fixed on the
                            ends of the rafters where they came down over the sides and the thatch
                            let in light by chinks. There were no sighs from her; neither did her
                            face bespeak any grief. But it was a face extremely intense with other
                            expressions. She saw little, planning to see little. Of such things as
                            there were to hear, she heard all.</p>
                        <p>She arose and walked back and forth over the space of two or three steps
                            under the thatch, without coming out from either end of it. She
                            stretched her arms up over her head for exercise and dug her fingers
                            into that soft roof, and presently pulled out handfuls of it and threw
                            the material on the floor. She laughed to herself. She frowned. She sat
                            down again and waited. She arose and came out from under the roof and
                            was in that part of the vessel which was farthest away from land, the
                            bow. She had her back to the island and, leaning over the anchor chain,
                            gazed dreamily away across the lake to Chapala's pigmy towers. She gazed
                            thus for more than half an hour, and the breeze blew over her face. She
                            still heard everything and the face was as intense as before. She sang a
                            little after a time, softly to herself or to the ripples; which ripples
                            lapped and kissed under her face and were singing a <pb id="VAA3931-359"
                                n="350"/> song like hers, being old ripples round an old island
                            which they lapped and kissed when Quetzalcoatl was here in truth.</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"When Quetzalcoatl bade the tribes farewell</l>
                            <l n="2">The fog lay thick and gray o'er all the sea.</l>
                            <l n="3">The tide crept on o'er sinking rock and shell</l>
                            <l n="4">And sluggish waves beat slow and ceaselessly.</l>
                            <l n="5" rend="ti-1">On the enchanted ground</l>
                            <l n="6" rend="ti-1">Gathered they trembling round,</l>
                            <l n="7">Where, in that god-made, glistening boat stood he!"</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>Having sung all the song, slowly, softly, not thinking of it, she
                            suddenly turned her head with a quick furtive movement and scanned in
                            one sweeping glance the whole of the island, her eyes piercing and deep
                            and her face flushed. There was a soldier or two whom she did not know,
                            high up on the summit. There was another carrying a bag of something up
                            the steep road. At the tower by her boat two others were doing something
                            with provisions that as yet had not been removed to the top. One of the
                            sailors of the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> in which she had come (Fortino
                            had engaged the two in Tizapan, strangers to him) was seated yonder on
                            the rocks at the shore, still eating <hi rend="i">tortillas.</hi> The
                            other was here, by the boat. There was nothing else to be seen, save
                            rocks and cacti, sky and lake. A frown gathered on her forehead. She
                            pressed her teeth tightly together and turned away to the water. Then
                            she sang again and at length flashed her old smile suddenly at
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p>"He will come," said she.</p>
                        <p>She waited another hour. No one came. She frowned then again, blackly,
                            and went in under the thatch, where she sat down and stayed as still as
                            revery itself, resting her head on her hand and looking <pb
                                id="VAA3931-360" n="351"/> at the chinks of light. She was, in her
                            heart, restless in the extreme. She was too wild for much waiting. It
                            was possible they had not told him, yet she would hurt herself in the
                            perverse way of love by believing that he knew she was there. She wanted
                            to leap out and range that rocky spot and be, with her life and her
                            smile, mistress of it. But she stayed doggedly in the boat. She would
                            not go out, not she, if she sat there till she died &#151; at least
                            thus she thought for a time. But Pepa's thoughts and purposes seemed
                            ever born of her blood, not of her brain. And blood flows in varying
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo above, thought of her during that day, in spite of his new great
                            thoughts of another. He even felt a pity for her; for which she would
                            have given him no thanks. She would have preferred that he feel simply
                            cold, which at times he did. He set his teeth and his will. What had he
                            to do with this woman? He was then weighed suddenly with remorse; for he
                            was the cause, though not willingly, of her treachery. He struggled long
                            between a stern will against seeing her and some half morbid belief that
                            he owed her at least a meeting and a little recognition. But the latter
                            would be useless, absolutely without point. Better let it stand as it
                            was; he could do nothing for her. Yet the half morbid idea lived.</p>
                        <p>A small, material, prosaic fact decided the matter. At four of the
                            afternoon, when all the other hours since the morning's middle had been
                            passed in a hard, stern silence by him, and in a half sullen burying of
                            herself by her, it chanced that, whether he would or not, he had to
                            descend to the ruins of the pier and the tower to examine and give
                            directions concerning the last of such cargo as his two vessels had
                            brought. Possibly the half morbid idea had <pb id="VAA3931-361" n="352"
                            /> some weight in leading him down. But that idea died as he went; and
                            he was as silent and as stern descending as he had been above.</p>
                        <p>There lay the bungling old vessel under him with the round tower
                            standing, black, near it. The face of the bay was moving from north to
                            south with the never progressive movement of countless small waves. He
                            looked only once at the boat, while he wound his way down; after that he
                            saw it no more. At the bottom he strode across the space artificially
                            flattened by old-time convicts, and came upon the rock whereon stood the
                            tower, entering it like a gloomy and haunted one, instead of with his
                            natural lightness of step. But a fierce power emanated from him and he
                            examined the bags of food and ordered his two men up with them in a tone
                            that was new. Each took a load and departed, climbing the steep. Rodrigo
                            remained in the tower till they should return, feeling himself foolishly
                            exasperated at doing so. He went and sat down in the high arched
                            southern doorway.</p>
                        <p>This tower has been called round. Such is the first effect on the eye. It
                            is really octagonal, of thick stone walls. In each of four of the eight
                            sides is a very large entrance, arched and leaving a good third of the
                            octagon open to the airs of the lake. There are mediæval looking slits
                            in the other four sides. The roof is round indeed, being the half of a
                            sphere, with no pillars. The rock on which this edifice stands is just
                            large enough for it, and juts into the lake; so that the doorway wherein
                            Rodrigo sat was over the water. Whereas this was the southern door it
                            was the northern one opposite and behind him that gave view to the
                            vessel lying a few yards distant. As always, the occupant of that vessel
                            had heard all that <pb id="VAA3931-362" n="353"/> there was to hear.
                            Rodrigo was sitting staring at the water when a girl in a red dress came
                            and looked in at the door behind him. She caught her breath, raised her
                            hands, and put them up on either side of the doorway and stood. She bit
                            her lip. She flushed hot and was immediately pale. Rodrigo did not move.
                            She sighed a soft gentle sigh. Rodrigo continued staring at the lake.
                            She disappeared, then, simply stepping a little to the west and, with
                            the wall between her and him, stood on the rock's narrow ledge over the
                            waves.</p>
                        <p>The two soldiers were returning. They entered, and the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe</hi> told them where to put the rest of such things as were to
                            be taken up. The two gathered up the last of the cargo and went away
                            with it. The tower's floor was as bare as its time-eaten walls. Rodrigo
                            had arisen, and was standing in the middle of it. There came the soft,
                            dreamy notes of a little song from outside, sung as to one's self,
                            carelessly, as might sing a maiden sewing in her room or wreathing
                            cherry blossoms idly.</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"In such fair bark did Quetzalcoatl go,</l>
                            <l n="2">Watching his people on the lessening shore.</l>
                            <l n="3">And were they human eyes that watched them so?</l>
                            <l n="4">His face, his form, a god's resembled more!</l>
                            <l n="5" rend="ti-1">White robes clung round his frame</l>
                            <l n="6" rend="ti-1">Lit like a winding flame &#151;</l>

                        </lg>
                        <p>He was transfixed. The song floated in so gently, so purely. He could see
                            the black-hulled vessel lying a little below him, with its mast rising,
                            slim and naked, as high as his head. He set his jaws hard. He would not
                            go to her; he would stride away. But it was too late. She had taken a
                            step, a careless, idle one. It chanced to bring her to the <pb
                                id="VAA3931-363" n="354"/> ledge of rocks just outside the door. She
                            was indeed wreathing something as she sang, some kind of green branch
                            with white flowers, whereon her eyes were fastened. She halted in
                            beautiful unconsciousness, with the door framing her complete, slender
                            figure, the water and the vessel and the rocks for a background; and
                            very far away were Chapala's two white spires. Her profile was toward
                            him. The color on her cheek was delicate, a light flush alternating with
                            the clear white-brown of the lighter Mexicans. She was bareheaded and
                            her shining black hair was smoothed back and braided to her waist.</p>
                        <p>She turned her head a little, wreathing the flowers, and changed the
                            song:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"White is the sky of dawn &#151; as white her breast;</l>
                            <l n="2">Blue is the sky of noon &#151; as blue her eye;</l>
                            <l n="3">Red is the sunset in the deep red west &#151;</l>
                            <l n="4">As red her cheek as the red sunset sky."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>She halted with a little jump and exclamation, startled, suddenly seeing
                            him.</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" she cried, "you frightened me."</p>
                        <p>She went on with the flowers. It did not win him; rather it sickened
                            him.</p>
                        <p>"Now that you are here, Pepa," said he, with forced manner, after they
                            had been silent for a little, "here in this bad spot, if there is
                            anything I can do for you, let me do it and be free to ask. At least I
                            may find a place for you better than the boat. And do you" &#151; he
                            had some grim pleasure in saying this, "you doubtless came also
                            &#151; to see Vicente?"</p>
                        <p>She turned dancing eyes on him and swung the wreath she had made
                            carelessly in the air. She said nothing.</p>
                        <p>"I presume you may see him," continued Rodrigo.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-364" n="355"/>
                        <p>"I do not want to see him," said she, lightly, like a child, and coming
                            inside. She looked at the walls. "What a good, wild old place!" cried
                            she, clapping her hands.</p>
                        <p>"For what is the wreath?" he asked.</p>
                        <p>Then she dazzled him with that old smile, and said, frankly:</p>
                        <p>"For you. I did n't think of it before." She laughed a rippling laugh.
                            "To whom should a wreath be but to the victor? Don Rodrigo, if you would
                            kneel down I would make a knight out of you &#151; oh, to say
                            nothing of crowning you! Señor, you did exceeding well. And the island
                            is a good kingdom. I have read of smaller kingdoms and worse. Is it a
                            tingling feeling to be a king? No &#151; deeds! deeds! These are all
                            that tingle! Oh, señor &#151; do you know, as I leaned over the boat
                            and looked just now at the water, the water itself was talking about the
                            deeds! And all last night the wind laughed in the sail!"</p>
                        <p>"The wind and the water, then, Pepa, and you as well, gather more
                            happiness from the deed than do any others."</p>
                        <p>"Then is the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> dreaming bad dreams? Don Rodrigo, is
                            there come some canker to you in the midst of your victories? Away with
                            it &#151; kill it &#151; think not. This land of sun was never
                            made for thought. Feel only &#151; let the blood rush on. Ha!
                            &#151; you are master of the lake. I think you could be governor if
                            you wished &#151; general &#151; king &#151; emperor. Pretty
                            dream! No, no, Pepa is no blind one. These things dazzle not the cold
                            race of the north; and Don Rodrigo wandered into Mexico with a sigh upon
                            his lips. Peace, not battles; freedom, not power; quiet and the deep
                            life, not empire; love and the <pb id="VAA3931-365" n="356"/> dreams,
                            and waters, winds, and mountains &#151; these, and not ambition. Ah,
                            there is more color in your Anglo-Saxon face! There are some can read
                            you aright. And these things are higher and better."</p>
                        <p>She paused and mused, and went on with that little touch of sadness that
                            came so much into her words.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, better and higher. Blood and the wildness, action and madness,
                            these wear away, these die. And one looks for that which shall not die;
                            one longs for that which shall live on, live on forever. And what is it?
                                <hi rend="i">Ay de mi!</hi> &#151; who knows? Even I would find
                            it, Pepa, the mad. Even I, when the fever and the restlessness are gone,
                            shall wander on the earth seeking something, wondering what is that
                            great, beautiful thing that I want, and when will it come, white and
                            satisfying. Don Rodrigo, you are from civilization &#151; we are
                            savages. To you, then, it may come, the great white thing may be to you.
                            To us &#151; to me who am half wild, of course to me it will not
                            come, and I shall go on wandering round the borders of the lake, and
                            die, knowing it never. <hi rend="i">Ay de mi!</hi> Strange world! To him
                            who has shall be given &#151; so the wreath is yours; and I, who
                            have not, give it to you. This is all I could do to add to your victory.
                            This is all I ever &#151; is it true? &#151; is it all I ever
                            gave to you?"</p>
                        <p>"This is not all. You gave to me first, love. Let me make no excuses and
                            plead no cause. Till the last day I shall hate myself that I let you
                            give it. I do not love you. This plainly, once for all. I never loved
                            you. So, even were I willing (and if I could I might yet wish to repair
                            some broken things) I could give you nothing in return. You gave me,
                            secondly, your honesty and faithfulness, &#151; rather you threw
                            them away for me. For this, too, I shall ever feel remorse. I should
                            perhaps say at once, coldly, that the <pb id="VAA3931-366" n="357"/>
                            deed we did together revolts me. This is all. I come, then, to the iron
                            duty. Tragedy alone can be the result of communication between us. So I
                            sever our connection. Wherefore I shall go through life knowing myself
                            hated by at least one. But I see no other way. And one last thing to
                            you, &#151; you were simply mistaken. You were not wicked, for you
                            do not know wickedness. I shall never blame you. I shall blame myself. I
                            shall forget that part of you that mistook. I shall remember only that
                            part that loved. I have done. Pepa, I can never speak to you, I can
                            never see you again."</p>
                        <p>He turned and went toward the door. She staggered. Her face was
                            bloodless.</p>
                        <p>"This &#151; this is the end?" she gasped.</p>
                        <p>He hesitated, suffering sharp pain, half inclined to turn and soften the
                            parting. He went on, then, out of the door and down the rock. She was
                            like a mad woman. She swayed and stumbled to the door after him. It
                            swept over her in black despair &#151; all that she had done for
                            him, all that she had thrown away for him, the fears she had had that
                            there was something in his civilization that would condemn her, the
                            secret knowledge deep in herself that she was despicable. She believed
                            in that moment she must fall and die. She cried out, stifled, after
                            him:</p>
                        <p>"Rodrigo &#151; Rodrigo &#151;"</p>
                        <p>He began to climb. She came out, and, seeming to have lost her mind,
                            crawled slowly down the rock where she might easily have walked or run.
                            At the bottom she stretched out her arms to him, and cried his name
                            again. He was half way up, sick to the bottom of his soul. She sat there
                            on the ground between the tower and the boat, and watched him as he went
                            higher on the prison road, the ripples at her <pb id="VAA3931-367"
                                n="358"/> back, the rocks before her, the sun glistening on her
                            shining black hair and her red dress, her eyes raised. He came at last
                            to the summit. He did not turn or pause. Going on, the crest of the
                            island hid him; he was gone.</p>
                        <p>She crept to the boat &#151; lost. She climbed in and lay down on the
                            floor. He had been right. He should be hated by one. Such was her
                            nature. When her mind somewhat regained its powers, the revulsion came.
                            As strong as her love had been, so strong was the new passion &#151;
                            ay, stronger. She lay there, seemingly stupefied, till the sun went
                            down, and the night came. Her brain was a sea of fire. Her blood seemed
                            molten metal in her. And there was but one thought &#151; hate
                            &#151; hate.</p>
                        <p>The evening breeze, blowing through the old tower, found the wreath of
                            white flowers on the floor.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
                        <p>IN the hour in which Fortino, under the eye of the guard, had conversed
                            with the prisoner, the giant had kept his tacit promise, and made no
                            mention of Clarita. But he had told Vicente, casually, of the presence
                            of Pepa. The news had startled and deeply interested the hearer. He had
                            put many questions. She had wanted to come, she had seemed unhappy, she
                            had evidently wished to be where the prisoner was; she had said she
                            would make no attempt to see Vicente till Fortino should have done so.
                            She had stayed in the boat not seeming in a lively mood. This was all
                            the information Fortino advanced or apparently cared about.</p>
                        <p>What light shade of doubt had come over him concerning that unreadable
                            girl, left Vicente when Fortino was gone. He had not seen her in the
                            street at the time of the accident &#151; would not have had
                            sufficient cause, in that moment, to connect her definitely with it if
                            he had. He had blamed the men only, with merely the shadow of a doubt
                            concerning her. But if she had been in Quiroz's devilish scheme,
                            plainly, thought he, she would have remained far from this spot, with
                            Quiroz. Yet she had deserted that steely-eyed traitor and his
                            machinations at the first moment. She had followed Vicente with the
                            immediate, never-daunted spirit of action that characterized her. She
                            had trusted herself on the lake at night with sailors; she had braved
                            the waves and <pb id="VAA3931-369" n="360"/> the rocks of an unknown
                            spot, determined to find him. What other purpose was possible to her? He
                            could conceive of none; for on his infrequent visits to Chapala in
                            earlier days he had not been permitted to see that the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe</hi> was not looked upon by Josefa Aranja as an enemy. So
                            there was, then, one other faithful to him. She was daring, too, besides
                            being loyal. She was of a remarkably sharp mind, many times too sharp,
                            indeed, though neither he nor Fortino knew the true degree of that
                            acuteness. If by any seemingly impossible chance there should come
                            opportunity of escape, the prisoner at least believed he knew that one
                            of his quickest witted allies was at hand to help him. But he grew
                            hopeless at the thought. There could be, said he, no such impossible
                            chance.</p>
                        <p>Pepa's beauty was ever before him after that, transfigured in the shadows
                            of his cell. He recalled her as she was in the old days, with her
                            fascinating personality infusing ever fresh life into him. His old
                            affection for her, grown into his present love, swept over him with
                            redoubled force. It was a love always mingled with his dreams, being a
                            part of ambition and great designs and therefore like the love of an
                            older man, one who has grown with it into a condition wherein he is not
                            so continuously in poignant consciousness of it because it is embodied
                            with other elements of his life &#151; therefore becoming more true
                            and lasting. Doubtless because of the very quality of being a maturer
                            and less fiery love, seeming to her only an undercurrent to his
                            ambitions, it had failed to win anything lasting from her, failed at
                            last utterly. But he loved her. Here in his loneliness, buried in these
                            stones, the knowledge of her coming was like balm. The prison was more
                            bearable after that.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-370" n="361"/>
                        <p>There was something half congenial in the very flame of the candle. She
                            had sent Fortino before her to find him and speak to him, and prepare
                            the way for her. And he had waited all day for courage to enter. So she
                            had not come. She would try to see him, doubtless, on the morrow, and
                            they would permit it.</p>
                        <p>At midnight, after dreaming thus in a not unalloyed sadness, while the
                            candle's flame sank in the wax and the wax ran slowly down to the square
                            flat stones of the floor, he blew out the light and lay down in the
                            corner on his blankets. The spot was dry and had been made clean. He was
                            accustomed to sleeping on rude beds or without beds. Yet he did not fall
                            asleep for hours. He was in one of those strained moods in which one's
                            nerves seem verily to hold the body up from its resting-place, so that
                            the muscles will not relax. There was no tower clock in these solitudes
                            to mark the quarters with double beat. He could not reckon the time.
                            Even with Pepa before him the hours seemed thrice their real length.
                            Wakefulness finally wore him out. He sank into sleep in a darkness as
                            absolute as the walls were solid.</p>
                        <p>It was four in the morning when he stirred, troubled. He turned and
                            sighed heavily in his sleep. He had dreamed of a slight noise. His
                            slumber was lighter. He dreamed of it again &#151; a scraping sound.
                            He turned still more, the mind on the point of awaking. The dream was
                            then that of a dull thud, the gentle settling of a stone. He started
                            into a sitting posture broad awake.</p>
                        <p>There was a light in the cell, issuing from a candle held in a man's
                            hand. And the man himself stood in the opposite corner, silently. He was
                            dressed in black from feet to neck. He was bareheaded. There <pb
                                id="VAA3931-371" n="362"/> was an accumulation of earth and mold
                            over all his person, staining his shirt, his hands, his face. Earth,
                            too, was mingled with his tangled black hair. The prisoner knew not
                            whether he dreamed or saw a reality. He knew that face. He had not seen
                            it since he was fourteen years of age, but the monstrous ugliness of it,
                            the haunting scar, had stayed with him. Hence that sudden apparition in
                            his sleep was like a recollection bursting from the haze of the past.
                            Years were blotted suddenly out, as though they died and left the sense
                            of death. He was back in that other night when the only mother he had
                            known had died, and Fortino had carried her away in the darkness, when
                            they had torn him from the terrified Clarita and brought him so
                            mysteriously here where his life changed. When there rises a past event
                            which was of deep significance, the subsequent years, though they sink
                            away, leave a pale halo round it, dress it in a garb that is unearthly,
                            so that the event becomes the key to a new state of the heart, like
                            music, and the event is different, potent, a new event.</p>
                        <p>There was no move from either for many seconds. On the face of the
                            apparition remained the cowed slavishness. But there was a change in it.
                            The forehead seemed smoother, the eyes held light. There was evident in
                            the very awe and silence so habitual to him, something new and vast. He
                            stooped and remained crouched on the floor, glaring at Vicente. The
                            latter then found his nerves and his voice.</p>
                        <p>"How did you come?" he said, slowly. "Or are you real?"</p>
                        <p>The mute suddenly stood up again and, in silence, threw his arms into the
                            air with a movement of profound exultation, wherein the face was as
                            though <pb id="VAA3931-372" n="363"/> bathed in fire. Then its dead
                            color came back, accented by earthen stains, and, seemingly crushed with
                            fear, he crept, like the insane one that he was, over the floor to
                            Vicente's side. He spread out his ten fingers slowly before him. They
                            were long and covered with earth, the nails being black with it. He
                            looked at them and the scar was stretched into that which may have been
                            a smile. He took from his bosom some scraps and half sheets of paper,
                            scrawled with characters. Kneeling on the floor he gave the first to
                            Vicente.</p>
                        <p>"I shall be free. The years shall be nothing. The world shall be nothing.
                            I can follow her."</p>
                        <p>"What do you mean?" said Vicente, profoundly moved to hope. "These are to
                            me but words. Speak that which shall be of some comfort or some meaning
                            to me. Who are you? From where do you come? As you came can I too not go
                            and be free? I know you as one who took me over the water one memorable
                            night thirteen years ago. Speak, for if there is to be light in this
                            darkness, I can brook no delay. Do you come from that hermit who was
                            your master, and are there tidings? Control your mind, man, and give me
                            hope."</p>
                        <p>The mute thrust out another torn paper, fastening his dull eyes on
                            Vicente and seeming to emit some of the crushed intensity of his strange
                            being from those orbs. The words were these:</p>
                        <p>"You also are as I am. For thirteen years you, too, like myself, have
                            been in this almighty power. There was no other god to me. There was no
                            other hell. My soul was mastered. It wished to but it could not die. It
                            dreamed of death. Death would have made it mad with joy. But he was the
                            god of it. Thus also with you. Thirteen years only <pb id="VAA3931-373"
                                n="364"/> with you. Twenty-seven with me. But you too are a slave.
                            We shall be free."</p>
                        <p>"Where is he?" cried Vicente, smothering his voice. "Give me more meaning
                            than this, and quick. I swear to you if your coming means freedom you
                            shall have your reward. Is he here?" He shook the other's shoulder
                            fiercely, rising to his feet in suppressed excitement. "Take me to him
                            if there be a way."</p>
                        <p>The mute was unmoved. He held out another paper, a larger one. It was as
                            follows, written finely and closely in the same hand. The ink was hardly
                            dry.</p>
                        <p>"In every one of the twenty-seven I would have slain him. I could not.
                            His mind was god. It ground me down. It held me without speech. He has
                            never left this island. He is here now, in the other prison. When I last
                            went for food he was ill. He is old. He had not the right medicines, nor
                            food for more than two meals. I was returning with these things and
                            awaiting a wind when they captured me. I told them he would starve. They
                            did not heed. It was horror to me. The almighty mind was dragging me
                            back. But the others held my body. To starve him was terror; yet I
                            wanted to starve him and be free; yet I dared not. I was held two days
                            and two nights before we came here. There was no boat or food here for
                            him. Nor could he walk for being old and ill. They would have sent me on
                            and called it being free. I dared not go. He was dragging me back, so
                            that I knew he was not dead. I got out of the boat in the dark and swam
                            back. I crawled, dragged by him who was not dead, under the rocks to the
                            other end. I went into his cell afraid. I fell down and fainted in the
                            almighty <pb id="VAA3931-374" n="365"/> power. Afterward I heard him
                            crawling from the cot, cursing in his throat. I felt his fingers on my
                            neck. But he did not kill me. He dragged me back. So I went and stole
                            food and liquor in the night from the tower. Last night. He will die.
                            His body is weak but his mind is the same. So we are slaves yet. To-day
                            I lay and thought, while he groaned. To-night I wrote these to you. I
                            knew we should be free when his mind dies &#151; and I can follow
                            her. I know how I shall follow, and how soon, when he is gone. I know
                            where she will be waiting. Then I began to come. I did not begin soon
                            enough. It took so long. I knew the place always, but I had not come in
                            for years. The tunnel is so long and all the top has fallen, and earth.
                            So I had to dig through piles of it and crawl over stones. It took me
                            four hours. When I came under the floor I went back for these papers and
                            I am adding this last about the tunnel. He does not know you are here. I
                            told him nothing. He thinks I let him starve because he is weakening and
                            losing his power on me. This is why he crawled to me to strangle me. But
                            he knew he would then starve. We shall be free."</p>
                        <p>The meaning of this burst on the prisoner. His mind was suddenly alert.
                            He was bent on action with a haste imperious. He was down on his knees
                            at the mute with both hands on his shoulders. He brought his own face
                            close to the other's and bent his powerful eyes on the insane one's.</p>
                        <p>"Come," he said in low, deep command. "Come at once with me. I must see
                            him before he dies. We shall be free indeed, but take me there at
                            once."</p>
                        <p>The other shook in his old dread.</p>
                        <p>"You are afraid I shall kill him," said Vicente, <pb id="VAA3931-375"
                                n="366"/> reading him and falling in with his illusions. "Fear it
                            not. I do not dare. He is dragging us &#151; he is dragging me too.
                            Come. We dare not wait."</p>
                        <p>The other's long, cold fingers closed in a grip of great strength on
                            Vicente's wrist, and, his eyes always on Vicente's, he was drawn up.</p>
                        <p>"Where is the stone? Show me the way &#151; he is dragging us both
                            &#151;" The mute was stooping in the corner. "He is drawing us with
                            his almighty mind &#151;" The mute was straining his back. "He will
                            die and we shall be free &#151;" A flat stone over which Vicente had
                            walked a score of times came up. "But we dare not kill him. Come. Come.
                            Go you first and lead me &#151;" The mute leaped into a hole and
                            disappeared. "We shall be free."</p>
                        <p>The candle was passed to the leader and Vicente lowered himself. The mute
                            replaced the stone. From the hole they descended irregular steps some
                            fifteen feet. They were then in a passage far underground, six feet in
                            height, four feet in width, arched of roof, which roof had been of
                            stone. Some of the stones had fallen; others remained jutting out of the
                            mold overhead. The candle-light cast a glare over a blank wall behind
                            them and the steps at the side, and lost itself to the front in the
                            shadows that marked the passage leading into unseen regions to the
                            south. The mute cast a fearful glance back at the follower and met the
                            latter's compelling eye. The exultation came again into the insane one's
                            face, and the scar, a thousand times more hideous buried thus in the
                            earth, shining white out of the gloom, was stretched into unwonted
                            prominence. The journey was begun &#151; the mute silent and steady
                            of foot, Vicente agitated in spite of all possible self-control.</p>
                        <p>The original purpose of this tunnel, which leads <pb id="VAA3931-376"
                                n="367"/> from the central prison to that on the southern headland
                            of the island, passing under both moats, has been and will doubtless
                            continue to be, a matter of speculation to the few visitors to that
                            lonely spot. It may still be seen, even entered, by the lifting of the
                            stone. It could not, however, at this date, be traversed without much
                            excavation, for more of the roof and some of the earth that was over it
                            have fallen in. It seems altogether improbable that it could have been
                            dug by prisoners attempting an escape, for, in addition to the
                            difficulty of conducting such a work and disposing of the earth in
                            secrecy (though such works have been done) the passage is larger than
                            one thus undertaken would be likely to be. Furthermore, it was roofed
                            with stone. It is as straight as intervening rocks would permit,
                            passing, so nearly as one can judge, along the line of, and beneath that
                            surface road, which has been referred to as leading from the one prison
                            past the square tower to the other.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that this in itself was a secret prison, one
                            compared to which other dungeons would seem cheerful. However tenable or
                            otherwise such a theory may be, it is certain that in two places there
                            are small square rooms excavated out of the earth and the rocks far
                            underground and leading into the tunnel only. There are also certain
                            places that may have been other such cells. More than this, in the two
                            that remain apparent there are human bones. But this latter fact in
                            itself need not be taken as of such weight as might at first appear,
                            when are considered the methods still in use in certain parts of the
                            republic of disposing of human remains.</p>
                        <p>The thought of that possible line of dungeons, the ideas the bones
                            suggest to the mind, are too revolting. <pb id="VAA3931-377" n="368"/>
                            One prefers some more charitable theory. Mexico shows many strange
                            things. In Yucatan is a graveyard where skeletons are exhibited in pots,
                            labelled, where skulls line the walls and bones are strung on cords. In
                            the City of Guanajuato every tourist is shown the underground passage
                            filled with its ghastly array of mummified bodies. In the City of Oaxaca
                            there is a tunnel leading for a considerable distance from a monastery
                            to a church, the entrances being secret, the purposes unknown. There are
                            in Mexico City itself many freaks of architecture the study of which
                            would infinitely reward the pains, many a church of mysterious
                            associations, many a house long since called haunted from some
                            peculiarity of its construction. Wherever mediævalism pushed its way it
                            left these mysteries of the builder's art, for its mind was morbid.
                            Whatever the purpose of that passage in Prison Island, whatever the
                            scenes enacted there, the passage remains and speaks not.</p>
                        <p>The mute and his follower proceeded. The ground was damp with mold. Naked
                            rocks, jutting into the tunnel, looked black and gaunt in the light. The
                            leader's haste was extreme, becoming like the haste of excitement. At a
                            distance of some forty yards the candle cast a gleam into one of those
                            cells already referred to. The bones flashed out of the gloom to the
                            left and a skull lay in the door. Neither man seemed to see them. At
                            sixty yards or more the same sight revealed itself to the right. There
                            were places where the journeyers crawled over heaps of stone. It became
                            apparent that the mold and stains upon the mute's person were not
                            causeless. Vicente himself gathered earth as he proceeded.</p>
                        <p>They came at length to a spot where the roof was intact and marked by a
                            line of stone masonry, the <pb id="VAA3931-378" n="369"/> stones running
                            transversely to the tunnel's direction. It seemed to Vicente that this
                            roofing was much higher than the rest. He looked more closely and
                            perceived that that portion of the real roof had fallen in (the mute was
                            even then crawling over it with difficulty) leaving this other exposed
                            above it. He peered up. There was a chink between the stones and he saw
                            the sky and a star. He was looking through the bottom of the moat that
                            cuts the island in two. That faint glimpse of the freedom of skies made
                            his heart bound. He followed the mute, who had crawled over the
                            obstruction and was hastening on in silence. Having traversed a distance
                            of some one hundred yards they arrived at the tunnel's end, a blank wall
                            of natural rock. There were steps here and they went up. The steps led
                            to a natural opening where two buried boulders left a
                                <unclear>ch-ink</unclear> between them, the one rock protruding
                            beyond the other somewhat concealing the passage as the wings of a stage
                            conceal the entrances. The irregular steps curved as they ascended, and
                            the climbers, passing between those boulders, issued of a sudden in a
                            cell.</p>
                        <p>The mute was leading. There had been no light in the apartment and the
                            candle flame broke on complete darkness. They were nearer the surface
                            and the air was fresh. Once inside, the chink that had admitted them
                            between the two rocks was almost invisible, owing to the lapping of one
                            boulder over the other. Vicente had no more than set foot on the floor
                            of the cell when he experienced that sudden wheeling about of directions
                            which one so often experiences when he has been in unknown quarters, has
                            become confused as to the cardinal points, and finds himself again at a
                            familiar spot. The whole cell circled half round. He perceived the place
                            he <pb id="VAA3931-379" n="370"/> had seen that other night when he was
                            a boy. Recognition swept over him, accompanied for a moment by a
                            blinding mist of recollection. It was as though this had been, in the
                            old times, a spot of enchantment. The shelves were there &#151; the
                            wine bottle fallen empty on its side. The table and the books were the
                            same &#151; the bench was there also. He turned and saw the cot.</p>
                        <p>The mute was standing in the cell's middle with the candle held over his
                            head, its light falling on Vicente and on the bed. That light cut a face
                            out of the gloom over the couch like the face of a cameo. The body lay
                            at full length. The face was white with a distinct, unusual whiteness.
                            It was old and heavily lined but its lean features were strong, even
                            masterful, drawn though they were with pain and sickness. The eyes,
                            burning, stared at Vicente. The lips were parted in excitement and the
                            hermit's breath could be heard short and fast. A long hand uncovered
                            itself and clutched the blankets. Staring still at Vicente's face the
                            old man was suddenly half up, his features distorted in a fierce joy
                            that would scarcely let him gasp:</p>
                        <p>"You &#151; you!"</p>
                        <p>He was shaking from head to foot. He put out a lean limb with its foot to
                            the floor and would have come on to the unexpected visitor, tottering,
                            arms outstretched, had not Vicente prevented him.</p>
                        <p>"Lie down," said the latter firmly but gently, putting him back in bed
                            with much difficulty. "You are too weak."</p>
                        <p>"What, then," cried the hermit ravingly, "led you here at last, you, my
                            hope, my life, blood of my old soul! Have you come to see me die?"</p>
                        <p>"Heaven is with you," said Vicente, kneeling down <pb id="VAA3931-380"
                                n="371"/> beside him, conscious that death could not be far from one
                            who looked like this. "Give me your hand. You should not fear death; you
                            do not fear it. Thank God I am brought before you leave me! Señor, your
                            work is done &#151; done, and I am here. I have felt your power and
                            your help every moment of my life since first I saw you. In the dark
                            hour of my fortunes I have come to give you thanks. You shall have your
                            reward."</p>
                        <p>The other again started up.</p>
                        <p>"Why is the hour dark?" cried he. "What have you come to say? Speak! The
                            last they told me was of continuous victory. Oh death of my old torn
                            heart! Has this, too, failed me!"</p>
                        <p>"They captured me," said Vicente calmly, "in Tizapan, through treachery.
                            They brought me here and imprisoned me in the other prison. This man
                            came to-night and showed me the tunnel, and I have followed him."</p>
                        <p>"Captured you?" cried the hermit, seizing the other's shoulders and
                            fastening his fiery eyes on Vicente's face. "Then what is that? Nothing!
                            Ha! ha!" wildly. "Prisoner? Who can be a prisoner here but he who is
                            captive to the mind? The island is honeycombed. You are free! There is
                            no prison here." The speaker would sit up, in which posture he swayed
                            and shook in weakness and excitement. "Victory will come back! And they
                            dreamed they could hold the church on the church's island! Son! Son! The
                            arm of the Lord is yours!"</p>
                        <p>"Then in His name lie down and calm yourself," cried Vicente. "I will not
                            let you die."</p>
                        <p>"I will not lie down. Death is on me and I must speak before he comes. I
                            have felt his hand. Yet, I cannot die till I tell it all; yet I must
                            haste to tell <pb id="VAA3931-381" n="372"/> it lest I die. This shall
                            be my great peace. Oh! thou Blessed Mary! Thou hast brought him, here at
                            last! I longed for you. I dreamed of you night and day while death was
                            coming. Must I die, I said, and he not know? Must my lips shut on the
                            knowledge and be not opened, when I have sat here or trod these stones
                            or lain on this couch so many years dreaming of the day of the church's
                            victory when at last I should tell you and love should be unburdened of
                            its secret. Yet first let me show you your freedom. You see this mute
                            who stands there with the candle. He shall lead you out. Look &#151;
                            there are the steps by which you first entered this place long ago. They
                            led then to a door at the end of the shaft of this prison. They lead
                            there still, but the door is barred by tons of ruins. You came in with
                            ease. You could not go out were you a hundred times as strong as you
                            are. But I was ready for the event. Five years ago I saw that the walls
                            and roof about that door must fall, and my entrance be perhaps cut off.
                            I went through the tunnel you have traversed to-night and looked at that
                            prison. I said to myself, These walls are stronger but these too may
                            fall and block the way. To dig through earth, said I, is easier than to
                            dig through stone; and it may fall and bury me alive. So I put this
                            slave to work. Half way up those other stairs which you to-night
                            ascended, you will find another fissure in the rocks. He dug there,
                            slanting downward. This prison is over the water and the distance to the
                            shore is not great. The rocks hindered him, but I made him labor on. In
                            two months he did it, alone. There is, therefore, another tunnel,
                            leading down from this cell to a spot not seen from other portions of
                            the shore. Its opening is under the precipice whereon stands this
                            prison, with <pb id="VAA3931-382" n="373"/> rocks guarding it and cactus
                            hiding it. Then this slave dug in the lake and made a cove for his boat.
                            I was safe; I dared the very earthquakes; and one of them came. I was
                            here alone one night when the shock rocked these stones. I heard a crash
                            like thunder and I knew that another portion of the ruins had come down,
                            as had fallen so many, as all will fall at last. I tried the door. It
                            was blocked. I sat till morning and this slave returned. He could not
                            enter in the old way, so he came up from beneath. I keep always ink and
                            paper for him to write. He told me that the greater portion of the end
                            of the prison that is over us had fallen down about my door, burying it.
                            I was not sorry. I was prepared, and I was the better hid. Through the
                            way this slave has dug, you too shall find freedom. Victory again! Oh!
                            thou Mother of God, I give thee thanks! The mute's boat will carry
                            you."</p>
                        <p>This long speech had not been uttered thus consecutively. The speaker was
                            too weak. He paused many times, gasping. At the last words there was an
                            extraordinary motion of despair from him who had till then stood in
                            absolute motionlessness, holding the candle. He put the light on the
                            floor, and fell down before the couch.</p>
                        <p>"What is this?" muttered the hermit, turning his eyes on the crouching
                            one. "Take your pen, man, and write."</p>
                        <p>The other, livid, arose and secured the necessary materials from the
                            shelf. Vicente held a candle and the mute wrote:</p>
                        <p>"The boat is not there."</p>
                        <p>"How!" cried the trembling old man, bending on the writer a look that
                            seemed to make him shrivel. "What treason is this, you who have left me
                            here to <pb id="VAA3931-383" n="374"/> starve? O death! this is thy
                            hand. I have lost my powers. Let me die &#151; let me die! Where is
                            the boat?"</p>
                        <p>"On the other side," wrote the mute, scarcely able to make the letters.
                            His exultation was gone. There could have been imagined no more abject
                            creature.</p>
                        <p>The scene was one of pain to Vicente. He broke in at this point, and,
                            pitying the insane one, told such of his story as he knew, showing that
                            no blame could be attached to that helpless and speechless man, who
                            seemed, in his slavery, to have believed himself culpable. The hermit
                            sank back in despair at this news. He lay meditating with his thoughts
                            burning in the orbs that never lost fire.</p>
                        <p>"But for this," continued Vicente, "there is a remedy; and the mute can
                            yet play his part and free me. There came to this island to-day
                            &#151; rather yesterday, for it must be near morning &#151; two
                            of my friends with a <hi rend="i">canoa:</hi> the fisherman Fortino, and
                            the girl, Josefa Aranja. With them are two sailors. I would trust that
                            man with my life, and the girl's wits are beyond measurement. If I leave
                            the escape with them it can be effected. Will this man carry them word,
                            and will he do it in secrecy?"</p>
                        <p>The hermit, again in excitement, partly arose, resting on his elbow.</p>
                        <p>"It is not," said he, "that he will or will not. Death as yet has none of
                            me!"</p>
                        <p>"Then shall I write a note," continued Vicente, arising, restless, eager,
                            absorbed in his plans, and pacing the floor as he spoke, "with the
                            details of escape therein. This man shall deliver it either to the girl
                            or to Fortino. No &#151; he does not know them. Then it shall be
                            done thus. There is but one woman on the island. He cannot mistake her.
                            You will <pb id="VAA3931-384" n="375"/> find her, man, sleeping in the
                                <hi rend="i">canoa."</hi> He came and laid his hand on the mute's
                            shoulder, and looked into the mute's dull eyes. "I shall probably see
                            her tomorrow, but so guarded that I can say nothing. To-morrow night you
                            will go and find her. You will communicate with her in secret, giving
                            her the note. We need not fear. She will make the contents known to the
                            fisherman, and my orders will be obeyed. It can be done! It shall be
                            done! The <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> shall come to the tunnel's opening,
                            and I shall enter it and sail to that point of the shore to which the
                            wind can most quickly take us. You are the man to help me. Will you
                            go?"</p>
                        <p>"He will go," said the hermit.</p>
                        <p>Whereat the mute sat down by the wall, and, drawing his hat over his
                            face, remained still.</p>
                        <p>The hermit's manner underwent a change. He lay back in an intensity of
                            thought that made him for a long time silent, while there were evidences
                            on his face of a mental struggle. He was extremely weak, and breathed
                            with difficulty, so that during his subsequent narrative he paused often
                            to gain strength. He kept his eyes always fastened on the face of
                            Vicente who came again and stood by his side.</p>
                        <p>"Dawn is coming," said Vicente." What medicines have you, and before I
                            leave you, what can I do?"</p>
                        <p>"Nothing," said the other, rousing himself from his revery, "you can do
                            nothing so grateful as to listen to me and bear with me. Come &#151;
                            let me touch your hand &#151; Ah, it is the hand of youth. Yes, I am
                            to come to the end, if not to-night, tomorrow, or to-morrow night. I am
                            as ready as I should ever be. Let God judge that readiness, and, if I
                            must be punished with the fire, let the fire come <pb id="VAA3931-385"
                                n="376"/> quickly. I will give you a little history first, which I
                            have buried in these ruins, longing always to give it to you. Boy, I am
                            a pitiable old man, if a stern and a hard one. The stern and the hard
                            can love as deeply as the tender. You, at least, for a reason you shall
                            know, will not judge me too harshly. And the mute there, if he will
                            hear, let him hear. He knows it already as though it were his blood.</p>
                        <p>"I am a pure-blooded Spaniard. I was born in one of the Basque Provinces.
                            I was raised by the church and for it. It is man's greatest protector
                            and his only hope. It shall yet be free and master. I entered the
                            Guadalajara monastery in 1810, while Hidalgo was yet victorious. His
                            victories fired me with resentment and with a burning desire to crush
                            the rebels. As revolution bore on, and I saw the Spanish power totter, I
                            only, among all my brethren, knew the greatness of the danger of the
                            church. I began to regret in bitterness that I had entered the
                            monastery. I longed for freedom and action."</p>
                        <p>A fit of coughing stopped him. He choked, his frame shaken. Having
                            recovered himself, he proceeded:</p>
                        <p>"I desired war, that I might fight for the church. I was restless to
                            sally out and meet those who, though they carried her banner, were
                            undermining her. The thoughts and the duties of the cloister could not
                            confine my mind. Retirement, cried I, for others. These walls are not
                            for me. The desire became, with time, a purpose. I was on the point of
                            casting away my monkish habits. I had already made plans for the raising
                            of troops. I was in communication with the government. My project was
                            not altogether frowned upon by the clergy. If I was <pb id="VAA3931-386"
                                n="377"/> mad enough to do it, said they, they would assist me; for
                            they believed that my plans were far-reaching, that, with their help, I
                            could rouse this northern section of the land to resist the new
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>"I was now known to the clergy throughout many States. The danger to the
                            church was grown more apparent. The time was ripe. Then was it my bad
                            fortune to fall ill. I was confined to my cell's bed for a full year.
                            When I at last recovered, Hidalgo had long since fallen, there was a
                            lull in the storm of revolt. The church began again to repose in a
                            fancied safety. I longed yet to act. But the time had passed. I tried to
                            return to my former quieter pursuits and to confine my mind to the
                            duties and the thoughts of religion. I doubted many times whether I was
                            meant for that life. I had in me too much of the fire of youth, too
                            unbridled a nature; for I was bold. My mind, too, possessed some unusual
                            powers, and they called my eye, in monkish jest, the demon's eye. It was
                            in my nature to be second to none. In rank I was many times outclassed.
                            But my mind would dominate for itself without rank. I found by the very
                            force of my will, or my personality, or my sternness &#151; I know
                            not what to call my power &#151; that I could bend the wills of
                            those about me. Some deemed me a wizard, or in league with the devil,
                            which thought was folly. Where is there a community or a group wherein
                            some one mind is not the leader?</p>
                        <p>"After some years I found the force of my nature was really, though not
                            nominally, the master of the monastery, and thus the wielder of power
                            that extended far beyond its walls. You see me weak and fallen. Boy, boy
                            &#151; I was a lion in those days! At my tread priests trembled.
                            During those years I <pb id="VAA3931-387" n="378"/> kept my eye ever
                            fastened on the revolt. At times I believed the country needed me, and I
                            was on the point of action, but the immediate danger would pass. Many
                            things, too, baffled me. Where my personality could not extend its own
                            immediate power, there grew up the belief that my influence was
                            sinister, so there were machinations in the church against me. Thus does
                            she ever defeat her end, dividing against herself. Oh, Mother of the
                            world! Keep thyself intact and thy parts consistent, or thy doom is
                            sealed!</p>
                        <p>"At last, revolution growing fiercer and the danger that I alone
                            perceived in its fulness, more threatening, I pleaded with the clergy in
                            many parts, showing them by all reason that with permanent liberty from
                            Spain on a continent of republican institutions, the power of the Church
                            must become subordinate. Many saw the truth. Others were for
                            temporizing; for holding aloof till the complete success of one party
                            should warrant our support of that party. Still others were for crushing
                            both parties and establishing an independent monarchy. I went to work,
                            then, against prodigious odds, to bring out of the chaos a party to
                            support me and an army to fight for Spain. My plans were again maturing.
                            I could brook the cloister but little longer. I was ready to throw away
                            my clerical garb and take the field."</p>
                        <p>He was again forced to pause. He lay breathing heavily. It was long
                            before he could muster strength to proceed.</p>
                        <p>"In the year 1818 came the great new thing into my life. I have told you
                            of your mother. She was then nineteen years of age. I saw her first one
                            moonlight night in November. I was standing in the door of my cell,
                            dreaming of my coming course <pb id="VAA3931-388" n="379"/> of action in
                            the world. I saw the prior crossing the <hi rend="i">patio</hi> by the
                            fountain and the book. Behind him came that which was unwonted in those
                            walls &#151; a woman. Her mantilla had fallen to her shoulders,
                            leaving her head bare. The moonlight fell on her masses of black hair
                            and her young face. The last thing my eyes shall behold in this world
                            shall be that scene. The prior came into the <hi rend="i">corredor</hi>
                            and asked me to admit them into my cell. I did so, and she sat down, we
                            standing. She turned her eyes to me. Boy, they were deep as the sea.
                            There was the mystery of life and death in them. I seemed to be looking
                            into an unfathomable past, or an unfathomable future. She was beautiful
                            as no other human being I had ever seen was beautiful. She called
                            herself Eulalia.</p>
                        <p>"She told us, then, with an infinite sadness, her story; why she had
                            sought the monastery, why she had persisted, through all objections, in
                            entering. She laid before us, indeed delivered to us, all the proofs of
                            her lineage. She had come from San Pedro, where she had hid. Her father,
                            through whom the line descended, had died, and her mother had followed
                            him into the grave. She was the only child. She had lived, then, nearly
                            alone, having only one old lady, whom she paid to stay with her. She had
                            been lonely. She had brooded and dreamed of the power and the right
                            represented in her person. She had watched the revolt and the progress
                            of events, and it had seemed to her that now while the country was
                            seeking change, and old institutions were breaking up, now was the time
                            to strike.</p>
                        <p>"Her nature was deep. It had in it that peculiar melancholy, fascinating
                            sadness, that we call qualities of the Aztec. She was gentle, yet great
                            of nature. <pb id="VAA3931-389" n="380"/> She shrank from, yet longed
                            for power. Above all else, the traditions of her family and her duty
                            concerning them were sacred to her. She told us with a memorable
                            simplicity, that she loved no one, was beloved by none; that love alone
                            could bring children to her. She had now no prospect, no wish of
                            marriage. Even did she marry, how many years must pass before a son
                            could grow to manhood and fight the battles of his ancient race! She had
                            seen the country tottering round her. She had dreaded letting pass
                            perhaps the only chance, the one momentous time, for striking. So she
                            had come to the church, known to support monarchy, known to contain a
                            party of no little strength who favored a new and independent throne.
                            She had come, too, to that institution of the church most secret,
                            keeping secrecy most inviolable. She was weary of the world, said she,
                            weary of the burden of sorrow and exile descended through so many
                            centuries to her, borne now by her alone. She could not bear it longer;
                            she gave it to us. If we deemed it best to act, we would do so; if not,
                            we would keep her secret for her.</p>
                        <p>"I was astounded and deeply moved. We kept her many days, hid her there,
                            in the monastery till the facts could be made plainer and we should have
                            no doubt. We came to believe her. There was then communicated to the
                            powers of the church in many places, a hint of a royal personage ready
                            to take the throne. We did not divulge her identity or her place of
                            concealment. It was seen at once that a considerable party could be
                            brought to espouse her cause, but for one thing &#151; that she was
                            a woman. Nor did they yet know the heir was a woman, for this fact, she
                            begged, should not at first, in sounding <pb id="VAA3931-390" n="381"/>
                            the church, be revealed. Ah, she was a woman indeed, a girl &#151;
                            not a statesman. Had she been a man there might have been hope. I had
                            espoused the cause of Spain. I had bitterly opposed independence, either
                            monarchical or republican. I saw now plainly, indisputably, that her
                            cause was hopeless, chiefly because she was a woman and could not
                            herself act, but must leave others to act for her, which is weakness in
                            so rugged a land as this; also because I knew, saw with trembling, that
                            the deeper current of the land was then setting against monarchy. So I
                            should naturally have opposed her.</p>
                        <p>"At first I held my peace, while investigating her claims. In that
                            investigation I saw her often. Alas! my youth and my fire! And I think
                            it would not have been necessary for me to see her often. Once, surely
                            once, were enough, even were it only as she crossed to my door in the
                            moonlight, by the fountain and the book. Whatever hopes, whatever
                            emotions or passions I had till then in my life experienced were as
                            nothing, were dead, when Eulalia came to me. I knew then to what
                            fierceness of love all my strange powers of heart and mind could be
                            converted. War and the church were suddenly dwarfs. Action and control
                            of men were pigmies. There towered up in my life, overshadowing all,
                            crushing all, an edifice reared on a tempest, whose fall must be ruin. I
                            leaped to sustain it, to make it stable, real. I would have cast away
                            the world, only to take her and hold her. What were schemes of conquest
                            to me then, parties, lineages, thrones? So my course was checked and my
                            dream of action died.</p>
                        <p>"By the power I wielded in the monastery I was with her much alone in her
                            concealment. Ay &#151; and she grew to love me. My heart must then
                            have <pb id="VAA3931-391" n="382"/> compelled love in the coldest breast
                            that calls itself a woman. We were seized by that new force and whirled
                            away in it. We were blind to days and weeks. The sweet madness ran riot
                            and, in that one deep, true, God-given union, we drank life to its
                            dregs. When we came a little to ourselves her party was clamoring for
                            action. Those who hung from me were awaiting my words and wondering at
                            my delay. From that awakening her cause was mine, though I was sickened
                            for all deeds, hated the world, knew in my heart's bottom that to try to
                            raise her throne was folly."</p>
                        <p>Again he paused exhausted. He stretched out a thin arm and pointed to a
                            spot on the floor. Vicente, turning, found a bottle of liquor, doubtless
                            stolen by the mute. A swallow of this revived the narrator.</p>
                        <p>"I now speak of one of whom I loathe to speak, one whom it has taken
                            these many years and all that old power of mind to crush, so that my
                            life is wasted. There was another monk, named Ignacio Mendez, who loved
                            her. It was he who had carried her her meals since first she came. He
                            was of a silent and sinister nature, but of a manner that convinced and
                            an eye that spoke of strength and purpose. He grew out of himself with
                            love for her. Half he lost his reason. He was desperate, but cunning. He
                            told her of his love, pleaded with her to go away with him &#151;
                            this before she had given her heart to me. She repelled his advances. I
                            think he dreamed of force but dared not use it. He could gain no word of
                            encouragement. She shut herself from him and would not be seen. Then it
                            was she loved me, and Mendez saw it. He perceived the progress of my
                            power over her, of hers over me. He burned with jealousy. I have found
                            him many times at night <pb id="VAA3931-392" n="383"/> stealthily
                            creeping about her door or mine. I longed to kill him. At length all the
                            monastery could not but see my position and his. Scandal was rife,
                            though it did not go beyond the walls. But my power was such that no
                            one, not those above me, dared to murmur; and my love, God be my
                            witness, was strong, mastering, constant.</p>
                        <p>"When we awoke from the first blindness and perceived that there was a
                            party in the state clamoring for action from each of us; when we turned
                            to each other and realized that strife was not for us, that all we
                            wished was to sink out of the world we had known and be at rest
                            together; then remorse fell on her. She saw the falseness of our
                            situation. She could not bear it. In this state, believing that she had
                            been my ruin as well as her own, she suddenly disappeared one night,
                            bribing the porter to let her out. That was in December, 1818.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, when it was discovered that she was gone, the monastery
                            was searched. She was not found, and the porter at last admitted the
                            fact of the bribe. There was, however, another thing discovered that
                            filled me with terror. Ignacio Mendez was not there. That creeping
                            master of cunning, always watching her with jealous eye, had followed
                            her. I was overwhelmed with grief and misery. I feared, for her, the
                            worst, for I believed I knew him who had followed her. I know now that
                            my fears were needless. She hid herself so effectually that all his
                            efforts were vain. He did not find her. She swore to me before she died,
                            and I know the oath was sacred, that she had not seen him, had hated his
                            name. On that morning of the discovery the prior found a letter from
                            Mendez to him, wherein the hypocrite pleaded forgiveness for this sudden
                            unauthorized departure, saying that in <pb id="VAA3931-393" n="384"/>
                            his heart he had committed a great sin by looking on a woman with love,
                            that remorse had fallen on him, that fearing permission for a pilgrimage
                            might not be granted in these times of wars, he had been unable to
                            disobey the dictates of that remorse and had gone to tread barefoot all
                            the stony way to Guadalupe as a penance, that the Holy Virgin might
                            perhaps grant forgiveness.</p>
                        <p>"I was infuriated. I broke all bounds and burst out of the monastery. I
                            searched the land for her for months, letting ambitions and wars shift
                            for themselves, or die in such confusion as they might create. I cared
                            for nothing but to find her, save that Mendez, too, in my despair and
                            madness, I longed to seize and crush. I dare not think what crime might
                            then have stained my hands had I discovered him.</p>
                        <p>"After the long weariness and the long failure I returned. My power in
                            the church was gone. I was deemed a traitor, at best a broken penitent.
                            I had no heart for action, no desire for deeds. It would have taken long
                            and great labor to secure support, even had I wished to act. I buried
                            myself, exercising none of my powers, doing nothing. The force that had
                            won me ascendency over men's minds cared no more for that ascendency but
                            lay dormant in me, ready only to spring forth to rescue her, or to crush
                            Mendez. With that dream I slept, awoke, and lived, to force him to the
                            earth. Murder was no more in my mind, now that days of thought were
                            plentiful; rather would I have dominated him with my will.</p>
                        <p>"Thus the greater part of the new year passed and the new republic was
                            becoming more than a name. I cursed it in my heart, but would not rouse
                            myself from my apathy to combat it. In July of that year Mendez suddenly
                            returned from his pilgrimage. <pb id="VAA3931-394" n="385"/> He brought
                            relics from the sacred hill, and he being obsequious, they began to
                            believe the story of his penance. He was received and made to do other
                            penance. I saw the gloom of failure in his face. I believed that he too,
                            like myself, had failed to find her, and that he had gone to Guadalupe
                            to give color to his tale. I felt joy, seeing his gloom. He was a
                            changed man. He went about dull-eyed. I think he was dreaming of her. I
                            determined to give myself the secret morbid happiness of crushing his
                            mind. I now believe he had already begun losing his reason with grief at
                            not finding her. 'What!' said I, 'this worm dares grieve for her
                            &#151; does he then think that I, too, have had no grief?' Worst of
                            all, his constant and fixed belief now was that Eulalia had loved him.
                            This he even said to me, swore it, taking a hateful comfort from it. I
                            began to call out again those mysterious powers of my mind. The long
                            days and nights, the silence and the secrecy of the monastery, lent me
                            occasion to bring about my desires. I haunted him. I maddened him. I
                            finally cowed him with these old eyes, then young and fierce.</p>
                        <p>"You would ask me how this could be accomplished, and what was the nature
                            of my power. I answer that I know not. It was born with me. I had ever
                            found that my mind and my will were more powerful than those of the
                            majority of men. Did I but exercise my influence on them I could secure
                            obedience. There is nothing supernatural in this. Every man could thus
                            influence some one. I chanced to have a power that influenced many. If
                            history could but reveal it, there would be found many minds like this,
                            and certain forces that dominated great events would be explained. What
                            I might have <pb id="VAA3931-395" n="386"/> done had my life been
                            different God alone knows. He alone can judge me for throwing the power
                            away.</p>
                        <p>"I saw the effects on Mendez. I was bending him by haunting him and by
                            willing it. Perhaps I myself was half mad, so that, on his nascent,
                            grief-born insanity, I exercised a crushing fascination. These things I
                            do not know. But I was fast making his life but a kind of mental
                            dependency of mine. He feared me. He was drawn by me. In silence I
                            commanded his movements, and in silence he obeyed. My hatred for him
                            never abated. I was absorbed in the loathsome task, for otherwise life
                            would have been empty to me. This is one curse of the cloister. If a
                            passion or a crime or a fall comes to one, there is no chance for the
                            open, clear breath of life to flow in and cure, to bring new thoughts,
                            hopes, purposes. One is left to brood on the one stain till the whole
                            course, to the brink of the grave is stained.</p>
                        <p>"Before dawn on the twenty-third day of September, 1819, it being still
                            dark, there came a tapping on the door of my cell. I arose and found the
                            porter of the street gate. He had long been, secretly, my friend. He
                            knew of my love for Eulalia. He came in in excitement and whispered to
                            me that she was at the door. I bade him let her in and bring her to me
                            at once; and I dressed myself in agitation. I had scarcely finished when
                            she crept in alone, out of the night. She was haggard but beautiful yet
                            with that deathless beauty. She was weak and staggered. I caught her in
                            my arms, where she sank, helpless. I was trembling so that I could
                            scarcely stand, so I laid her on my bed and knelt beside her. She told
                            me, in two sentences which she could hardly <pb id="VAA3931-396" n="387"
                            /> speak, where she had hid from me and in what loneliness. Torn with
                            doubt I asked if Mendez had found her. She swore to me with death on her
                            lips that she had not seen him, nor had she so much as conversed with
                            any other than the woman who lived with her and had hidden her. One of
                            the monks understood the practice of medicine. I hastened away and
                            brought him. As we entered the cell together I saw that hated Mendez
                            crouching outside by the fountain.</p>
                        <p>"When the child was born she was rendered insane with delirium and
                            shrieked. The physician sent me for certain other medicines. I was
                            filled with horror. I ran out and across the <hi rend="i">patio.</hi>
                            Mendez was still by the fountain, and the morning light was beginning to
                            appear. When first the physician had come, a knife had fallen from
                            Eulalia's dress. I picked it up and gazed at the shining blade, scarcely
                            daring to think of the deed she had doubtless believed she might find
                            necessary. This dagger I still held in my hand as I dashed across the
                            open court. Doubtless my anguish had weakened my mind and the last of
                            Mendez's liberty and hate and cunning came up in him. As I passed him he
                            laughed an exultant laugh. I turned with curses on my lips, whereto he
                            responded and swore that the child was his. The black lie so maddened me
                            that I was like a demon. 'Slave!' I cried, 'Slave forever!' Uttering
                            which, I struck at him with the knife blindly. He dodged, but was too
                            late. The blade laid open a gash across his cheek and, entering his
                            blasphemous mouth, cut his tongue so that the half of it hung as by a
                            thread. I paid no more heed but ran on, secured the articles needed and
                            returned, planting myself at the door ready to defy the world.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-397" n="388"/>
                        <p>"All the other rooms about that <hi rend="i">patio</hi> were at that time
                            empty, and as we had kept my door closed and the walls were thick and
                            the distances in that monastery great, no one else was yet aroused. The
                            shrieks of delirium had soon ceased, but the delirium itself seemed
                            fiercer. Once more the doctor sent me away. I went, passing the figure
                            of Mendez as he crawled, dazed and bleeding, through the long corridors
                            to his own apartment. It was necessary on this errand that I should go
                            to the extreme opposite side of the monastery.</p>
                        <p>"When at length I returned, all was silence. I hastened to my cell. Its
                            door was open. I went in and stood aghast. It was empty save for the
                            child."</p>
                        <p>At this point the speaker paused longest. His breath was hoarsely
                            audible. He lay staring up at Vicente utterly unable to proceed. When at
                            last he went on his voice was weaker.</p>
                        <p>"I ran to the door and the physician was approaching. I cried to him and
                            he came running with water. He had been only to the fountain, had left
                            her scarcely ten seconds. In that space of time she had arisen in her
                            delirium, weak as she was, and disappeared. We knew she must have taken
                            the nearest passage, else the doctor would have seen her. We ran its
                            length. It led, after some windings, to the front and out. We came to
                            the open space between the buildings and their inclosing walls. The
                            great door giving exit to the street was open, and the porter, stiff and
                            motionless with fear, was staring out like a mummy. The gray light of
                            dawn was slowly growing and the south wind blew over us. We heard cries
                            in the street without. She had, in her sudden insanity, staggered all
                            this distance in some feverish dream that she must escape. She had <pb
                                id="VAA3931-398" n="389"/> beaten on the door and seemed so like one
                            from the grave, that the porter, in horror, had let her out. We were in
                            the street at once. We were too late. She had fallen dead and there were
                            three gendarmes lifting her. I learned afterward that she had cried out
                            many times that the monks had murdered her. The officers would not
                            listen to us. They were sullen and seemed inclined to arrest us, but had
                            no authority for so doing. The prior was now aroused and came out with
                            others. He recognized her and spoke to the officers. 'At least,' said
                            he, 'let the body be brought into the monastery.' As the gendarmes had
                            no vehicle and it was some distance to headquarters, they consented,
                            that she might not be left in the street. When we were at length within
                            and she was placed upon a bed and her features composed, the reality of
                            the fact of her death broke over me with crushing force. I sank down and
                            buried my face beside her. Then, knowing that she was beyond my call,
                            that the monks would see to her decent burial, and that it was only a
                            question of time till the matter would be taken up by the civil
                            authorities, the monastery searched, the scandal spread far and near,
                            myself and Mendez likely arrested, even, in those corrupt,
                            revolutionary, and church-hating times, accused of murder &#151; I
                            decided at once upon flight. The world was nothing to me; let me bury
                            myself away from it, now that she was dead. But I would take Mendez. My
                            hate riveted me to him. He should not remain to declare she loved him.
                            By nature was he my slave, my slave should he be.</p>
                        <p>"The purpose crystallized at once in me, and my determination pushed its
                            way morbidly to its end. I took the prior to his cell. I reminded him
                            how it was that the child was heir to a throne and that the <pb
                                id="VAA3931-399" n="390"/> time would come when he would be needed.
                            I pleaded that the tenderest care should be taken of the son of one who
                            could not now expend that care himself. I secured his promise, aroused
                            his enthusiasm. I told him of my prospective hiding-place, that I should
                            bury myself forever from a world that I could see only to curse. I knew
                            he would keep my secret. I went then to Mendez's room. He was weak with
                            loss of blood, but, when I had bandaged his wound and given him
                            stimulants, he could obey me. He seemed forever crushed. He followed me
                            like a dog, partly because I mastered him, partly because he, too,
                            sought flight.</p>
                        <p>"There were horses kept within the monastery walls. We took two, and,
                            with some provisions, went out of that rear entrance which is seldom
                            opened. Before sunrise we were out of the city. We rode straight for the
                            lake. We passed that first night in the mountains over Mescala. The dumb
                            Mendez here made his last effort to break his bondage. He would have
                            left me. I had brought a pistol and he had none. I told him I would kill
                            him. They had called my eye the devil's. I used it then as though they
                            had spoken truly. I bent him down and he stayed and followed me. In the
                            night we stole a boat and sailed here.</p>
                        <p>"The weeks and months that followed were a silent struggle. I mastered
                            him. I made his mind only a part of my own. His tongue was useless and
                            he could not speak. His hopes were dead. His brain succumbed to mine. He
                            believed still, even now believes, that she loved him. For which I hold
                            his bondage unbreakable. When the store of provisions we had brought
                            from the monastery and increased upon the way was exhausted, I ventured
                                <pb id="VAA3931-400" n="391"/> to send him back. This was the test
                            of my power. Our horses we had abandoned, so he went on foot. He
                            journeyed only at night. He, too, is ever afraid of capture and trial
                            for an offence that his mind cannot recall. As for me, I know the danger
                            is long since passed. At the monastery he secured provisions, and wrote
                            them certain orders I had commanded him to write. As the father of the
                            child who might one day be their hope, they respected and obeyed me.
                            They made all necessary arrangements for the mute's regular journeys.
                            Mendez returned, and when I heard his oars here at the shore one morning
                            of deep anxiety, I knew he was conquered and the island life
                            assured.</p>
                        <p>"I turned to that life with a longing for a peace I never found. From
                            remaining here for fear of being taken, I came to remain because I did
                            not wish to go. The death of Eulalia caused an investigation and
                            trouble. I was searched for but not found. The unsettled condition of
                            the country rendered a continued prosecution of the inquiry impossible.
                            The matter died out of men's minds. But I hated the world. This cell
                            came to be my home. I would not go. I heard of the child often. He was
                            strong and had been carefully tended. When he was one year old, having
                            in this spot matured my plans, I had them bring him to the shore. I
                            sailed with him then, the mute being my only other companion, to
                            Chapala. I wanted him to be raised freely on lake and among mountains,
                            that he might know the people. I engaged that a good woman should keep
                            him and the priest should overlook his care and give me information of
                            him. I had seen the independence of this country become more assured. I
                            had perceived both the republican spirit and the danger to the church
                                <pb id="VAA3931-401" n="392"/> growing. My interest in the world
                            thus much returned, to rear my child, my boy, son of my great love, to
                            be what his nature demands. This absorbed me, this has been my dream, my
                            life. And now that I die I free you from this prison &#151; oh my
                            son! my son! And victory shall be yours. And thus let these old, old
                            eyes, buried so long in the earth's rocks, weep tears of joy that,
                            though I be dead, my one great love shall live on and rule forever!"</p>
                        <p>Vicente had long since fallen to his knees by the cot. He buried his face
                            beside that of the hermit and cried, brokenly:</p>
                        <p>"My father!"</p>
                        <p>The dawn was beginning to shed gray light over the island when the
                            prisoner, pale, changed, crept back through the tunnel, issued like one
                            dreaming in his cell, lowered the stone, and threw himself down on his
                            blankets.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
                        <p>ABOUT seven o'clock of the previous evening the wind, for the first time
                            in three days, had swerved somewhat from the west toward the north. It
                            was then that a sail went up not far from Mescala where a naked mast had
                            been waiting for the change for some hours. A <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            with four men on board began a slow journey south, in which direction
                            stood the rocks of the island. The vessel rose and fell as lightly on
                            the small waves as she had when she sailed in the opposite direction.
                            For it is worthy of note that no cannon or weapon of defence other than
                            the arms of the men, weighted her. The breeze being light, the
                            traversing of the course to the island required three hours. It was
                            therefore about the hour of ten, when, under a starlit sky and frowned
                            on by the towering half circuit of the island's promontories, the <hi
                                rend="i">canoa</hi> glided into the bay, and silently dropped her
                            sail.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi> strained almost to the limit of endurance
                            between hope and fear, had been watching for that sail. Clarita was in
                            the church. It was during the intolerable hours of waiting that a new
                            thought had burst on her. It was doubtless the intense anxiety and the
                            gloomy manner of Rodrigo that had brought that new, black knowledge. In
                            her unthinking fear and her simplicity she had not followed out the
                            possibilities of Vicente's circumstances to their revolting end. But she
                            now suddenly realized that death itself <pb id="VAA3931-403" n="394"/>
                            might be his punishment, that this was Rodrigo's fear. The effect of
                            that thought was to benumb her mind.</p>
                        <p>The boat had been in the bay scarcely a quarter of an hour when the <hi
                                rend="i">jefe,</hi> with the news it brought sunk in his brain,
                            stiffly climbed the ascent from the pier. He carried the governor's
                            message with him. It was written informally and read thus: <q
                                direct="unspecified">
                                <p>"You have done well, a service that shall not die. You have rid
                                    the state of a great danger. If I live and have power your
                                    reward is sure. There is now but one course, and I wonder that
                                    you have not already pursued it without my order, knowing my
                                    faith in you. Can there be but one end to a traitor and a rebel?
                                    Why do you hesitate? If such men are to live, Mexico is founded
                                    on sinking sand. You are to shoot the rebel with no delay. Only
                                    one thing I suggest, which you are to do, if you find it
                                    practicable. Let the execution take place, not on the island,
                                    but in Chapala, Tizapan, Ocotlan, or at least some other place
                                    which has given him followers, and is a centre of revolt.
                                    Chapala itself, as his own town, is preferable. Thus will the
                                    example of his death be held up before the rebels as a warning,
                                    not hid in the lake's middle. The moral effect will be trebled.
                                    You say his army is scattered. Remain only till you are assured
                                    it will not organize under another leader. When this becomes
                                    clear, return. If the contrary occur, I doubt not you are
                                    capable of dealing with the situation. To prevent further
                                    trouble, a show of clemency is now our best weapon. We are in no
                                    condition to inaugurate a wholesale punishment. Therefore send
                                    to every town a proclamation promising pardon to all such as lay
                                    down their arms. God with you. There is happiness in the capital
                                    over your victory. When you return flushed with your triumph, we
                                    will crown your brow. Till then, in the name of the people of
                                    the State of Jalisco, receive my thanks."</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> came alone to a point half-way between the
                            ascent's summit and the church; and sat down on a rock, dazed. The stars
                            of the low west, whereto he stared, seemed burning red. To him the
                            experience of emotion, happy or unhappy, was bound up with the desire to
                            take it to her, as though the experience and the desire partook of one
                            another's identity. True love becomes a mammoth endeavor to absolutely
                            unite the whole existence with that of the loved one. Recalling this,
                            the struggle that went on in Rodrigo's breast as he sat there with the
                            church and her on his left and the gulf on his right, becomes clear. For
                            a new love is ever half mad. To observe that to share this grief with
                            her in anything like sympathy was impossible &#151; is not to the
                            point. To be sure, she must learn of it. This would be almost to crush
                            her. She would come thus only to bear a sorrow of her own &#151; not
                            to share his. Hence, to unburden his misery to her was impossible,
                            useless, so far as relief to either was concerned. It only remained to
                            communicate the fact, letting each bear the separate grief. But love
                            does not act on such principles. Rather it cuts all down and says: Let
                            us bury this terror by blindly rushing together, <hi rend="i">with
                                it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After half an hour (which stood out like a jagged rock in the course of
                            his life ever after) he arose, without reasoning or thinking, and went
                            slowly toward the church. Movement cleared his brain somewhat, and a
                            purpose began to form itself. He came to the church door and paused. The
                            first and only impulse to go away came to him, and died. He stepped in
                            front of the vacant, arched entrance, beside which Fortino, heavily
                            breathing, lay wrapped in his blanket. Rodrigo, longing for her and
                            pitying <pb id="VAA3931-405" n="396"/> her, looked in. He knew she would
                            not be asleep. She would be waiting in anguish for the news.</p>
                        <p>He had expected that he should have to call her out or secure a candle
                            and go in. He was surprised to perceive that, at the church's far end
                            where the altar had been, there was a candle already lit, placed on a
                            stone. And Clarita was kneeling before it with her back to him. In the
                            hour of her need and her dread, the fact that this was a church had been
                            of comfort. He knew she was praying in the silence, there with the light
                            falling on her face, and her <hi rend="i">vebozo</hi> carefully wrapped
                            round her head and small figure. He came only half-way in and could
                            proceed no further, overcome. She heard his tread among the ruins, and,
                            still kneeling, turned her head quickly so that he could see her face in
                            the candle-light, and looked at him. She perceived that he was deathly
                            pale, gaunt-looking, standing thus staring at her. He could not come on;
                            he was halted by his mission. So he merely sat down slowly on a stone.
                            That the disaster had come with his entrance was plain to her. She could
                            not arise. That the last weight was falling on her as she looked at him,
                            was as plain to him. So they did nothing &#151; simply remained
                            silent at some yards from one another.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to him hours that they sat thus, while the candle's flame waved
                            blue and yellow, and the slow-circling stars stared through the gaping
                            roof. Doubtless the time was in reality short. Just as he was beginning
                            to feel he could bear it no more, he saw her sway and fall forward. He
                            was beside her at once, lifting her. As she had been on her knees, and
                            had fallen with her arms under her face, she was in no wise hurt. Nor
                            did she quite faint. Perhaps the very poignancy of her grief prevented
                            her from <pb id="VAA3931-406" n="397"/> losing consciousness. She soon
                            sat up. Much as he longed to, he could not bring himself to hold her in
                            his arms. She herself had, perhaps unconsciously, pushed him a little
                            away.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita," he said, his voice strained. He paused, and she was not
                            looking at him. "Clarita, I cannot do it. I have decided. I cannot and I
                            will not. I have some little influence. I will write again. I will do
                            all in my power to change the order. But I would not have you hope; for
                            I, I do not hope. Then, at the last, if it cannot be changed, some one
                            else must do what I cannot. This shall never be mine, nor any more
                            battles and cruelties. I shall go away."</p>
                        <p>"Write it!" she cried, seizing his hands in wild eagerness. "Oh, you
                            will! You will beg for me &#151; you will plead for me!"</p>
                        <p>"I will do what I can," said he, without hope.</p>
                        <p>He arose from beside her.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, thank you! thank you!" she cried, passionately.</p>
                        <p>He conquered the impulse to take her to his heart and soothe her; and
                            went away. He had brought writing materials for the purpose of sending
                            orders to his troops at Tizapan. He secured what he needed, including a
                            lantern, and descended to the shore of the bay. Pepa's candle in her <hi
                                rend="i">canoa</hi> was lit. Her sailors were sleeping among the
                            rocks. Bonavidas's boat swayed near the octagonal tower, anchored a
                            little way out, its occupants seeking rest on the shore. The other of
                            the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> two <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> lay farther
                            off. Rodrigo, having entered the tower, wrote the following somewhat
                            stilted reply to the governor: <q direct="unspecified">
                                <p>"If my past services and my friendship to you may excuse this
                                    temporary disobedience to your orders, let them. <pb
                                        id="VAA3931-407" n="398"/> Your command to execute the
                                    prisoner is received. I do not wish this to be your final
                                    decision. I do not wish this man to be killed. I do not think it
                                    necessary. That his nature is noble and not that of the
                                    adventurer should count for something. It is my strenuous
                                    desire, greater than any desire that my life has hitherto borne,
                                    to spare his life. As I have broken his power and captured him,
                                    may I not, then, plead for him? To execute him would be to lose
                                    to the world one honest man, whereas honest men are rare. To
                                    spare him will be to give life to a rare soul, which in you
                                    would henceforth outshine all virtues and all deeds. He can be
                                    taken to Guadalajara, if you have a prison you consider safe. If
                                    not, he can be taken to some other city, many leagues away. Let
                                    him be imprisoned till you know there is no danger from him.
                                    However long this be I shall desire no lighter punishment. And I
                                    ask you for this commutation of sentence with my every power of
                                    pleading in the asking. My heart is bound up in this request.
                                    You speak of reward. I want none, &#151; I can take none,
                                    &#151; but this. If you can grant it, your every other order
                                    &#151; you know it well &#151; will be obeyed to the
                                    letter. If you cannot, I am come to the point of being
                                    constrained to say that, our friendship notwithstanding, I must
                                    sever our connection. If you must adhere to your order, I cannot
                                    and will not execute it. I say this with deference. I cannot and
                                    will not. It shall only remain to me, then, to resign my
                                    position and to depart. I should leave the country. But I shall
                                    be faithful to my trust till this moment come. For, I shall send
                                    at once, the wind being now favorable, for all my men from
                                    Tizapan. I shall meanwhile be vigilant in my guarding of the
                                    prisoner. My troops shall arrive here ready to carry out the
                                    dictates of your command, convey the prisoner to Chapala under
                                    strong guard and execute him, provided your response continues
                                    with the same decision. Meanwhile I shall adhere thus obediently
                                    to your order as it is, to wit: My men on this island shall be
                                    ever <pb id="VAA3931-408" n="399"/> ready to execute the
                                    prisoner. If, before your response comes, there arise any danger
                                    of his rescue, he shall be shot here and at once. I shall
                                    consider this much due to the oath I have taken before you.
                                    Finally, understand me well, if you cannot change your sentence,
                                    let there be brought in company with the letter that informs me
                                    of that fact an order conferring the power of <hi rend="i"
                                        >jefe</hi> on some one here who can execute that sentence;
                                    or, if you do not choose one of my men, let him whom you do
                                    choose come with the order. I shall withdraw in his favor. I
                                    thank you for those things you did for me. I shall remember our
                                    friendship."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>His consciousness that he was pleading in a manner exactly opposite to
                            that which had characterized all his former vigorous urgings on the
                            governor, made his sentences somewhat unnatural. That the request itself
                            was abnormal and almost impossible to grant, made them lack strength. As
                            he wrote, the cool night wind swept in at the wide doorways and the
                            waves came and dashed themselves in that old, eternal suicide against
                            the rocks at the tower's foot. When he had written it and read it over,
                            he wrote an order to the leader of the little force in Tizapan to the
                            effect that, provided he were not definitely engaged in the overcoming
                            of some danger, which danger should be immediate, he should secure <hi
                                rend="i">canoas</hi> at all costs and hazards, and sail for the
                            island with his men at the earliest hour possible.</p>
                        <p>This done, Don Rodrigo descended from the tower and found Bonavidas and
                            his men outside. To the astounded lieutenant he told the governor's
                            order and his objections. He gave the last paper he had written,
                            containing the order for his troops, to one of Bonavidas's
                            companions.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-409" n="400"/>
                        <p>"I am sorry," said he, stiffly, "there is no rest for you to-night. The
                            three of you must carry this order to Tizapan at once, while the wind
                            from the north lasts. Make all possible speed. Bonavidas is not to
                            accompany you. He is to remain here, for I shall need him with me."</p>
                        <p>Wrapped in gloom, Don Rodrigo ascended to the summit, where he stood and
                            watched the vessel go. That <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> being poled round
                            the island to the southern end (where the prison of the two ruined,
                            tunnellike passages reared its high and black mystery), was pushed out
                            on deeper water and sailed away toward Tizapan. It has already been said
                            that these boats cannot sail save with the wind pretty well in the
                            stern. The breeze, having been found favorable for the journey from
                            Guadalajara to the island, was found unfavorable for a return toward
                            that city. So the sailing of the second <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> which
                            was to retrace that course, was postponed till a change of wind.</p>
                        <p>In explaining his purpose to Bonavidas, Rodrigo had led that wily
                            lieutenant to a point some distance from the shore, and had spoken in
                            whispers, so that his voice was inaudible to all but Bonavidas himself.
                            But in giving his orders for the journey to Tizapan the <hi rend="i"
                                >jefe</hi> had stood not far from Pepa's vessel, and, there being no
                            cause for secrecy, had spoken in an ordinary tone of voice. Pepa, as
                            earlier in the day &#151; though now it was burning hate that
                            sharpened her senses, whereas before it had been another and a somewhat
                            better passion &#151; if she saw not, heard.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to say what course, under different circumstances, the
                            hatred and vengeance of such a one might have taken. She had lain for
                            hours on the boat's bottom. At times she had been weighed with sorrow or
                            pierced by pain. She had even felt <pb id="VAA3931-410" n="401"/>
                            stinging remorse. She had sunk at times into stupor. She had needed
                            love, longed for, ruined herself for it. She had lost that and herself.
                            At first, even with the revulsion and the hate, she wanted to die.
                            Suicide, however, was an end to which she would never come. Then the
                            hate grew, minute by minute, hour by hour. Revenge was natural to her.
                            Ordinarily one would expect murder to be the end of that hate. Indeed
                            she thought of it, her heart leaped to it. Fascinated and
                            horror-stricken, she almost longed to do it. The nature that could do
                            what she had already done, could not be wholly incapable of that other
                            crime. It is not to be considered unlikely that, had he who had rejected
                            her been of her own race, he would have been compelled to fight for his
                            life, or more likely have been given no chance to fight, on that very
                            night, a night so hate-crazed as it was to her.</p>
                        <p>But it is not always possible to say that hate is all hate and no love.
                            She doubtless loved him still. Most potent fact of all &#151; he was
                            that white one, he of the other race, he to whom all of her wildness was
                            nothing. Could the knife or the pistol conquer such a one, although it
                            kill him, and satisfy her? His nature still awed her. It had ever
                            baffled her, making her feel that her different battery of powers was
                            ineffectual against that man of another race. To slay, to wreak
                            vengeance, that was associated in her mind with her own personality, was
                            therefore a part of that system which had ever been powerless to produce
                            an effect on him. So she strangely halted at the deed, as though it
                            would not have in it the essence to satisfy her. At all events she would
                            not be capable of any deed whatever for some hours. All was too
                            feverish. Midnight or the early morning would suffice. She would then
                            plan.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-411" n="402"/>
                        <p>She heard him come to the tower and she crept to the boat's end and saw
                            him writing. She could have killed him with ease, for she had her weapon
                            as always. She turned sick and sank to the floor again. After a time she
                            heard him give the order to sail for Tizapan. During the feverish hours
                            pictures of Quiroz had at times presented themselves to her mind. His
                            fierceness, his cat-like cruelty, seemed to her qualities that roused
                            answering ones in her. Quiroz loved her, though she cared little for
                            him. Quiroz would kill, too, where she feared to kill. The dashing,
                            reckless, dangerous course of Quiroz appealed to her, in the hours of
                            hot blood, as the only course wherein she could bury this sorrow, drown
                            or crush this great pain. Who has not felt it &#151; that desire to
                            do away with what is painful by dashing into long dangers? It is
                            possible, had Quiroz been then present, he could have gotten her away.
                            At all events, whatever happened, she suddenly realized that Quiroz was
                            her only friend on earth, that, after revenge or without it, a career
                            with Quiroz was the only thing that opened itself. For to do nothing
                            after these days of fire, was as impossible to her as it is impossible
                            to sheathe a flame and preserve it living. And all the world would
                            loathe her, save Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>She saw the <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> ascend to the summit. She perceived he
                            had left all his writing materials in the tower, even left his lantern
                            burning. He had forgotten them all; he had forgotten the tower and that
                            which had happened there. She saw an opportunity to communicate with
                            Quiroz. The vessel about to depart could not come back before to-morrow
                            night at earliest &#151; probably would be away longer. She did not
                            believe Quiroz would have returned, as yet, <pb id="VAA3931-412" n="403"
                            /> to Tizapan. He could come here later in another vessel. She would
                            not, could not, depart with Clarita, that pure and grieving reminder of
                            her perfidy. She could not go alone. Quiroz could be duped, at least,
                            into getting her away. Beyond that she did not think. Meanwhile her
                            plans for revenge could mature or die. She hated as recklessly, here
                            with the wind blowing over her, as she had on the boat's bottom. She saw
                            a plan clearly. If she should nerve herself to the terrible deed, let it
                            be done on the following night, or when she should see Quiroz's sail at
                            hand, have Quiroz's <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> in which to leap and escape,
                            and Quiroz's approbation and daring to lend her firmness.</p>
                        <p>All this was the product of but a moment's thought. She was at once in
                            the tower. She heard the soldiers preparing to embark. To do so one of
                            them must wade to the <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> then pole it in. So she
                            was allowed a short time for her purpose. She wrote thus: &#151; <q
                                direct="unspecified">
                                <p>"Doroteo Quiroz: As you hold my heart, so I love you. You are
                                    wondering, where is this wild one? A resolve came to me to try
                                    my powers on the obdurate <hi rend="i">jefe.</hi> I wanted,
                                    where you had failed, to win him and his troops to this our
                                    great cause. I was idle and wasting time. I cannot bear to be
                                    idle. I said, I will win this other force and this leader while
                                    Doroteo is away. I am on Prison Island and he is here. He is
                                    weak-hearted and no man for us. He will not join, though I have
                                    urged it long. And I curse him as do you. So come for me. Come
                                    at once. I have no other means of return. I await you, to go
                                    with you. To the earth's end or to the sea's bottom Pepa is
                                    yours."</p>
                            </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>She hastened out of the tower. She could not trust this letter to the
                            soldiers. She awoke one of her own sailors, one of those Fortino had
                            picked up <pb id="VAA3931-413" n="404"/> The man was ready to do
                            anything for money. She paid him and assured him Quiroz would pay him
                            more. He was to go to Doroteo's house and wait till he should see the
                            message in that warrior's hand. The man agreed. He went to the soldiers
                            and, with some trouble, secured passage. They thought he was deserting
                            his ship. Pepa casually informed them that she had given him permission
                            to go, for she did not need him. So they finally took him; and when the
                            vessel sailed out toward Tizapan with Rodrigo's eye following it into
                            the shadows, it bore Pepa's letter concealed in the sailor's loose white
                            shirt.</p>
                        <p>The night passed and the day came. It was afternoon before the more
                            ordinary wind from the southwest came up. Three soldiers then departed
                            with the <hi rend="i">jefe's</hi> other <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> for the
                            shore and Guadalajara. The boat in which Fortino and the girl had come,
                            and which Pepa had been occupying, was now the only vessel at the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>Clarita and Fortino prepared a silent and gloomy breakfast, dinner, and
                            supper on the shore by the tower &#151; <hi rend="i">frijoles,</hi>
                            a little pork, some <hi rend="i">tortillas</hi> and sweet bread, and
                            fruit. Clarita barely touched food. Even Fortino had no appetite. He was
                            wondering what he should do now. If the girl would stay must he, then,
                            sail away and bring her provisions till she would go? Well, he could do
                            that. She had never thought of the running short of food. The <hi
                                rend="i">jefe,</hi> she knew, would care for her. She thought only
                            of Vicente. Pepa came to one or two of these meals, and ate a little
                            more heartily than did the others, but with her eye, dark and burning,
                            cast out over the lake, seeing nothing that was real, seeing only
                            visions, the form and the import of which it was well <pb
                                id="VAA3931-414" n="405"/> her companions knew not. Pepa was as she
                            had never been before, and it was as though the spirit of tragedy walked
                            with her.</p>
                        <p>All that day the prisoner paced the floor to and fro. The calmness of his
                            face had given place to a strained look that had in it an unwonted
                            sorrow. He too saw visions, deeds of the long ago, crimes and monastery
                            walls. He was waiting, too, for Pepa. Surely she would come to-day.
                            Every hour he thought he heard her footstep. Why did she wait &#151;
                            why did she not come to comfort him? Noon came straight into the
                            cactus-choked <hi rend="i">patio</hi> and he saw her not. The afternoon
                            wore on and he was restless and oppressed, with the meaning of the
                            coming night scarcely bringing an alleviation of the weight. Evening
                            approached and she had not come. What was it, then, that she had sailed
                            here to do? Why did she not come to him? He argued at length that they
                            had not permitted it. He fought against the shadow of his old
                            unreasonable doubt. At nightfall, she not having come, he groaned within
                            himself and cried:</p>
                        <p>"What are my hopes &#151; what is my faith? What soul cares for me or
                            would see me free? My birth was black; let death come to me black as my
                            birth. To whom can I trust my freedom? For she came not. Yet to her I
                            must trust it &#151; there is no other."</p>
                        <p>Again night came down on the lake.</p>
                    </div3>
                    <pb id="VAA3931-415" n="[406]"/>

                        <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
                        <p>THE unexpected had occurred on the lake's southern side. This was not the
                            first time that a force so easily and quickly raised, had vanished as
                            quickly. The personal power that holds men together and produces
                            enthusiasm, being removed, dissolution may be immediately at hand. An
                            army needs a head to hold it together. It falls to pieces without it.
                            Most fatal fact of all, it was believed among that scattered band that
                            Vicente had been long since lodged in a Guadalajara prison, and that
                            nothing but storming and taking that great city could rescue him. In the
                            cavalry that had fled there was not one born leader. No one of its
                            number had the genius to gather it together again for that superhuman
                            deed. Doroteo alone possessed that genius.</p>
                        <p>But bitter failure had met all the efforts of Quiroz.</p>
                        <p>He had ridden out from Tizapan reasonably sure of returning with a not
                            inconsiderable body of troops. He knew almost every man of Vicente's
                            army by name. He knew the dwelling-places and the probable retreats in
                            flight of the chief figures of that scattered band. They had learned his
                            bravery and received not a few attentions from his adroit flattery. They
                            were dissatisfied with the hard life peace had led them. He would give
                            them views of bigger game even than Vicente had held out. He went forth,
                            too, with the determination to promise plunder and win allegiance in the
                            old Roman fashion.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-416" n="407"/>
                        <p>Probably the only matter in which Quiroz could have fatally deceived
                            himself was in that of other men's belief in him. That ordinary minds
                            should come to suspect his sincerity was a supposition not easily lodged
                            in his brain. Perhaps this may be called his greatest weakness&#151;
                            that he was too sure of his ever ready deceit. At no other point would
                            he have been vulnerable, watching all his armor with a lynx' eye. But
                            there was under the smooth politeness of this gambler a vanity that was
                            somewhat of an enormity. That those churls who had fled should suspect
                            him, was therefore not considered possible by him. But such was the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>He rode from Jiquilpan to the mountains, from mountains to lake, from
                            village to village. Having occupied some days in the search, he found
                            the scattered ones. He whispered his plans privately in many an ear. He
                            gathered a little band of those who had followings and appealed to them
                            with all his art and his earnestness, and with all his lies &#151; a
                            speech that a Roman indeed might have been proud to make. He found deaf
                            ears and eyes cast askance at him. Rebuffed, he scoured again shore and
                            mountain. He urged, he pleaded, he called forth the full battery of his
                            powers. He found the scattered army determined not to follow him. He
                            once more secured the presence of some of the chief men at a spot on the
                            shore and made his last mighty effort, of promise, flattery, scorn,
                            deceit. They became exasperated. They broke out finally and told him the
                            truth. The real leader, said they, he who should be king, was captured.
                            They could not rally round Vicente. They would not go wildly after
                            another to support a baseless project. The army lacked its head and its
                            purpose. They looked with little faith on a course across <pb
                                id="VAA3931-417" n="408"/> mountains to that distant City of Mexico
                            where the central government held powers unknown. And finally they told
                            him plainly they had no faith in him. The true perpetrator of that
                            treachery in Tizapan, was not altogether unsuspected. With that they
                            sullenly departed.</p>
                        <p>So the matter was hopeless. The game was lost. Quiroz was for an instant
                            stunned. But he rallied at once. After all, these were not a notably
                            fierce people. For the most part they had lived a sufficiently quiet and
                            primitive life. It had been the particular influences that worked for
                            Vicente that had roused them. When Vicente was captured, the blood of
                            the enterprise was let out. And if, finally, they suspected him, he knew
                            the truth of his failure. After one bad hour of dismay, his natural
                            quickness of intelligence showed him how fatal was that suspicion. So,
                            with a lasting bitterness and a somewhat novel lack of his old suave
                            manner, he returned to Tizapan.</p>
                        <p>All his old desperation became sharpened and invigorated. He was becoming
                            even abnormally reckless. He would risk his head on the first chance and
                            wring by sheer desperate force some kind of compensation from that
                            fortune whose wheel had ever been his god. At least he had the girl. He
                            would dash away with her to the southeast. There lay his arena. Let him
                            loose his leash of devilish powers in that pot of intrigues and battles
                            called the City of Mexico. He would wrench success up by the roots. If
                            he now was, in the game, down to his last coin, let him gallop away with
                            the girl, stake it on the red indeed, play his last mad play yonder
                            where the great game was fiercest &#151; and win much or lose all.
                            He cast maledictions on the lake and the state wherein it lay and, with
                            them, all past associations.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-418" n="409"/>
                        <p>He grew hotter in exasperation and eagerness as he approached his
                            home.</p>
                        <p>He entered Tizapan in the night and did not find Pepa. He searched the
                            place for her with a brutal vim. Some one said she had sailed away in a
                                <hi rend="i">canoa.</hi> Then was it that rage was born in Quiroz.
                            He would then have thrown fortune itself away to grasp the girl. His
                            mother found him fierce and fearful for one awful hour. That poor
                            trembling lady deemed her son gone mad, and with devout assurance (a
                            certainty no visitation from Heaven could have moved) blamed that
                            strange Señorita Josefa Aranja for all this misery. Then Doroteo was
                            suddenly himself again &#151; he was never otherwise for long
                            &#151; become calm, cool, keen, graceful as of old. He was
                            determining to cut his way through all earth's powers, steadily,
                            remorselessly, and secure that vanished woman who had ever been to him
                            like strong wine. He was secretly gathering his courage; tempering, for
                            the relentless pursuit, his spirit &#151; as it were, trying its
                            edge and ringing its metal as though it had been a steel blade.</p>
                        <p>It was then that, in the early morning, Pepa's note was placed in his
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>Pepa herself, on that day, in the midst of her many visions, dreamed at
                            times of Quiroz's success. He would gather up the troops. She finally
                            decided he could not return to Tizapan for several days, perhaps would
                            be occupied by his task of reorganization much longer. Her time of
                            vengeance was instinctively postponed.</p>
                        <p>About noon, when the wind had changed to the southwest and the <hi
                                rend="i">canoa</hi> with the message for the governor had departed,
                            could those on the island have seen the Tizapan river and its marshes
                            they <pb id="VAA3931-419" n="410"/> would have perceived a vessel poled
                            thence into the lake and a sail raised. But Tizapan was too far away. At
                            most the finest eye could have detected only a faint spot of white, the
                            sunlight barely glimmering from it as it floated yonder on the distant
                            waters, whose vast waste, yellow in the midday sun, circled it about and
                            bore it like a still and tiny jewel.</p>
                        <p>Josefa Aranja grew, toward evening, chilled of soul. For she must not be
                            looked upon as of that proverbially heartless, murderous,
                            Mexican-Spanish nature, which kills with ease. If she should ever come
                            to the point of killing that white foreigner, it would be after passing
                            through many fires. Finally, she dreaded the deed; it sickened her. She
                            remained cold and silent. Life for her rotted.</p>
                        <p>By the afternoon's middle that tiny white spot was a very little larger
                            and a little whiter.</p>
                        <p>The night, the same Vicente had seen come with despair, and yet in which
                            he hoped to make his escape from that place of gloom, came on. The
                            sunset was one of those seldom failing ones of beauty that are the
                            lake's chief charm. The visible universe was, for an hour, steeped,
                            suffocated, drowned in red. The mountains seemed melting in that deep,
                            incarnadined flood of light. The lake flowed living blood. The sky was a
                            vast dome of blazing crimson.</p>
                        <p>The tiny spot of white had reached and passed the lake's centre, and was
                            less tiny. It turned, in the new light, from white to red, and flashed
                            that color back to the west like the flashing of the red wing of a
                            distant bird.</p>
                        <p>About eight o'clock, when the night had come indeed, Clarita, bearing
                            with her, as always, her sorrow, yet with a new emotion growing in spite
                            of all deeds within her, chanced to be walking by the shore <pb
                                id="VAA3931-420" n="411"/> at a point about half-way between the
                            octagonal tower and the island's southern, prison-crowned end. The path
                            was among great rocks, and well concealed. The heights of the island
                            towered over her on the left, the lake's waves beat on her right. She
                            had been near the door of her brother's prison all day. She had spent
                            the hours in suspense and loneliness. After trying to eat a little by
                            the tower (the Mexican supper is always late) she had wandered here,
                            letting the night breeze blow over her face, watching the stars,
                            gathering some little peace from nature, the only possible source,
                            before she should return to the church for the night.</p>
                        <p>She could dimly see the forms of a few soldiers on the upper crest
                            against the sky. She believed she recognized Rodrigo himself, more than
                            a hundred feet over her, walking slowly along the island's upper edge
                            and blotting out stars as he went. Only the sky enabled her to see. She
                            on the ground and so far below could not have been detected by those
                            above. She watched that moving figure with pain and longing. His very
                            vigilance was her grief. She recalled that habit she had seen in him of
                            slowly patrolling the whole edge of the island thus every night,
                            sometimes arising from sleep to keep his own eye on his realm's
                            boundaries. The figure disappeared.</p>
                        <p>She walked on, and there was a shadow moving there before her among the
                            rocks. She stopped, holding her breath. The shadow was still likewise.
                            She believed that she had imagined it. This rugged way leading to
                            nothing was surely deserted. She walked on, a little afraid. The shadow
                            suddenly came out from behind a boulder, and, showing itself to be the
                            crouching figure of a man, came before her and held out something white
                            in its hand. She was so <pb id="VAA3931-421" n="412"/> frightened that
                            she turned and ran. Running, her vigilance for Vicente, her readiness
                            for every chance to help him, made her suddenly imagine (in her brain
                            that was ever imagining escape and ever seeming to receive messages from
                            him) the very thing that proved to be true. She made herself stop. She
                            turned, and the shadow was before her. Her fear increased, so that her
                            limbs shook. But the fact that there was a chance, however slight, that
                            the message came from the prisoner (her woman's mind unrea-soningly and
                            at once grasped at that chance), made her determination not to run away
                            as moveless as rock. She took the paper, and the shadow was gone, to be
                            seen no more.</p>
                        <p>She ran then, terror-stricken now that the danger was over, and came to
                            the <hi rend="i">canoa.</hi> Pepa was not there; she was half-way up the
                            ascent seated on the rocks alone. Fortino was in the tower. The <hi
                                rend="i">canoa</hi> was anchored very near the ruins of the pier, so
                            near as barely to be safe when the waves dashed it toward the rocks.
                            Pepa had had it brought thus with purpose. She could then, when it
                            floated to its chain's length and was nearest land, easily leap to its
                            stern from the elevation of the pier. Yet it could not come so close as
                            to strike. Clarita, naturally timid, was growing bold. She could not
                            wait to make that long ascent to the church for a light.</p>
                        <p>She came to the edge of the pier. The waves dashed spray over her. The
                            vessel came swaying toward her, borne on a billow, and was brought up
                            with a jerk by the anchor chain, the stern near her. She nerved herself
                            and leaped over the narrow chasm and came safely into the <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa.</hi> She found the matches and the candle, made a light, and
                            with trembling fingers opened the paper. She saw with blinding <pb
                                id="VAA3931-422" n="413"/> joy that the writing was his. Her brain
                            swam, and she could scarcely read. The first word halted her. It was
                            "Pepa." But could she be blamed, in her great love and her longing, for
                            reading on, when the words were his and she would do anything to help
                            him? She could no more have stopped at that word than the breeze that
                            lifted these billows could be turned back in its course. She devoured
                            the lines with an eagerness that was pain. They were these: <text>
                                <body>

                                            can, to the southern end of the island; anchor it as
                                            near shore as possible, with the anchor ready to be
                                            immediately lifted. It must be directly under the
                                            southeastern corner of the prison that stands on the

                        <p>She realized that she must lose no time. She came to the boat's end to
                            leap out. Before she could do so Pepa stepped across the chasm and was
                            beside her. The older girl had seen the light. It was suddenly clear to
                            Clarita that, though she still had that old distrust of Pepa, the boat
                            could not be secured and removed without Pepa's knowledge. The latter,
                            too, was too shrewd that Fortino and Clarita could hope to carry out so
                            great a project and she be ignorant of it. Lastly and most weighty, Pepa
                            was wonderfully cunning, bold and strong to perform. Her help would be
                            invaluable. Vicente, by this very note, trusted the whole to that girl.
                            Then she, too, could and must trust her. She gave her the note,
                            explaining how she had received it, and Pepa read it.</p>
                        <p>When she had grasped the significance of this communication, for one long
                            minute the great eyes <pb id="VAA3931-423" n="414"/> of Josefa Aranja
                            stared into those of Clarita, while the boat rocked and the candle-flame
                            sputtered in the wind that swept under the thatch. That minute decided
                            Pepa's course and her vengeance. The dread of murder fell from her like
                            a black and heavy cloak, and her heart stood out strong and free,
                            relieved, bounding with exultation, &#151; as though she had been
                            committed to the crime, bent down by the thing she must do, and was
                            suddenly given liberty. To her credit let it be remembered that her
                            greatest joy in the deed of the night was that she would not now be led
                            to do a worse one. What could have been more fitting to her wishes, to
                            her hate, than this? She had sacrificed Vicente for him who had not
                            received her. Now, in the latter's fancied security of possession, to
                            revenge herself by taking away the very thing she had given, and scorn
                            his scorn and baffle his vigilance and laugh her contempt to the night
                            wind as she sailed away with Don Rodrigo's prize, &#151; more than
                            this, to thus undo her treachery, repent of the deed that had been
                            loathsome to her, by the deed's undoing, and save thus some faith in
                            herself and some honor from others, &#151; oh, then did her whole
                            life revive, and decay was no more, and the blood in her veins was full
                            of the fire of that sweet revenge!</p>
                        <p>She bade Clarita wait till she should bring the giant, and then she
                            leaped out to the pier and was gone.</p>
                        <p>That sail that had been the tiny spot of white near Tizapan, and had
                            turned to red in the lake's middle when the sun set, now that the
                            darkness had come was invisible. It might have sailed on toward
                            Chapala's towers, or swerved a little and be now yonder on the course to
                            Ocotlan. It might be coming on, too, straight toward these rocks to
                            which no commerce <pb id="VAA3931-424" n="415"/> came, and round which
                            no fisher dipped his circling net; so that, had some lightning flashed
                            out of that clear sky, it might have been seen, grown larger and turned
                            white again, sailing on, sailing on.</p>
                        <p>Scarce a minute elapsed (a minute of the deepest anxiety to her who
                            remained in the rocking <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>) before Pepa returned
                            and entered the boat with the giant. The three, like conspirators of old
                            (ah, strange trio ye! with what differing hopes and fears and purposes,
                            each borne on, like every other of the race of men, by the varying waves
                            of your hearts' emotions!) &#151; the three crouched down on the
                            boat's flat and heaving bottom, and out of that curious union of
                            interests the plan was born.</p>
                        <p>"The greatest danger," growled the now gleaming-eyed giant, in whom the
                            news had aroused a joy so awful that his observers were astounded at it,
                            "is this: That infernal <hi rend="i">jefe</hi> makes the circuit of the
                            upper shores at least three times every night. You say he might be
                            absent at the moment, &#151; but I, wreck that I am, believe it not.
                            The devil that haunts Fortino and drags me under his hoofs will bring
                            Rodrigo to that very end when the time comes. I know it &#151; on my
                            soul, I know it!"</p>
                        <p>Pepa, during the last of this brief and hasty discussion, had sat in a
                            profound revery. She now looked up and cast her deep eyes on each in
                            turn. Then she laid her fingers, much as Quiroz might have done, on
                            Fortino's shoulder.</p>
                        <p>"Listen, friend," said she; "you are right. There is the chance of the
                            failure, though it be small. But there shall be no chance. I shall not
                            accompany you. Go you with Clarita. Slip round the island in the dark
                            with the vessel. Do you your duty. Think not of me. When the anchor is
                            raised for the last <pb id="VAA3931-425" n="416"/> time, fear not," and
                            a deep sadness suffused her eyes with tears. Who could read that
                            intricate mind, still less the untamed but love-torn heart? "Fear not;
                            if I am not with you, I shall be where best the time suits. Friend, go
                            on. Leave this <hi rend="i">jefe politico</hi> to me."</p>
                        <p>They demurred. She was obdurate and she was capable. Her help thus was
                            needed. They agreed. She leaped out to land, and disappeared. It was
                            after nine o'clock when the anchor was finally raised, and, with but two
                            occupants, the boat glided in silence out and thence along the shore. It
                            was well that the night was dark and that there were no soldiers
                            immediately at hand. But the chance of being seen was always a living
                            chance. For one man to pole a <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> among waves is as
                            nearly impossible as anything that might be done can be. But if any man
                            on earth could do it, Fortino could; and he did, putting out all his
                            fisherman's skill and his great strength, inspired by hopes that made
                            every inch of his huge body tingle, dreaming of this glorious redemption
                            of his great loss, this resurrection of his dead repute; dreaming most
                            constantly of all, with homely honesty, of doing this momentous deed for
                            the man who still believed in him.</p>
                        <p>The sail that had been the white spot and the red spot was still
                            invisible. Wherever it should come to land, whether it be at Chapala, or
                            at Ocotlan, or under these precipices, it would sail straight at the
                            rocks in silent boldness, appearing suddenly, looming out of the night
                            like a scudding spirit.</p>
                        <p>Rodrigo was striding to and fro in the gloom on the island's top, buried
                            in thought, passing and repassing that larger square tower that stands
                            between the two prisons. His course brought him at times not far from
                            the edge of the precipitous descent that <pb id="VAA3931-426" n="417"/>
                            overlooked the western shore. He was alone among boulders, cacti, and
                            the ruins, there being no guards near him. Toward ten o'clock he
                            approached that western edge for the tenth time, on the point of
                            continuing his restless course round the island. He suddenly caught a
                            sound, other than the sighing of the night breeze. It was a soft and
                            unwonted sound, such as these solitudes seldom heard, half a sob, half a
                            moan. It came from among rocks that clustered in shadows a little inward
                            from the island's upper rim. He paused in wonder, looked, and perceived
                            a little gleam of white among the boulders. He came nearer.</p>
                        <p>It seemed there was a human form lying supine upon the flat surface of a
                            stone, its face turned toward him, but partly hidden by its arms. Half
                            he recognized it, and was seized with an unreasoning dread. There was a
                            second moan. He was too much of a man not to answer that distress. He
                            came quickly and silently close. He saw it was Pepa, flung down there
                            alone; her hair loose and scattered over the rock; her arms, half bare,
                            hiding her eyes, so that it seemed that she did not see him. She moved a
                            little and turned, as one in long, dull pain stupefied. Remorse struck
                            deep in his heart. He stood over her, and spoke her name unsteadily:</p>
                        <p>"Pepa!"</p>
                        <p>She threw her arms back and left her face bare, staring up at him with
                            eyes whose light the night could not obscure, yet than which the night
                            itself could not have been blacker. She looked at him as though she did
                            not readily recognize him. Then, with a start, she arose, ran a few
                            steps, and stumbled and fell. In real agitation he was beside her.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa! Pepa! What is it? You are hurt!"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-427" n="418"/>
                        <p>She half arose, but sank back.</p>
                        <p>"No," she said with infinite wretchedness in her voice. "I &#151; I
                            hurt? What is there, man, that could hurt me? No, no; Pepa is well
                            &#151; happy. Why do you haunt me? Why can I have not even solitude,
                            which alone is left to me?"</p>
                        <p>"I will leave you if you will," said he quickly. "But you are in pain,
                            and you have fallen. You do not believe me so brutal as to be unmoved by
                            this. Come, for the last time and sincerely &#151; is there not
                            something that I can do? At least stay not here and thus, or my
                            unhappiness is grown beyond endurance!"</p>
                        <p>"Do?" said she dully. "What is the word, and what does it signify? Don
                            Rodrigo, the doing is done. The crime, the throwing away, the death.
                            You, who are still alive, speak of doing &#151; say it not to me. I
                            have died, Don Rodrigo. Why did you come and why have you spoken to
                            me?&#151;me who am dead &#151; dead."</p>
                        <p>The pitiable tone of the words tore his heart. He believed for the moment
                            that she was losing her mind, at least was so stricken by grief that she
                            knew not what she said.</p>
                        <p>"No, no!" he cried. "There is life and hope for you. Despair, girl, is
                            not for you. It cannot be! You are too young. Rise from this blackness
                            and blot out my face from your memory."</p>
                        <p>"Señor, you speak words. It is you who are young, who feel not, who love
                            not. Do you think, then, that weary old thought of all the weary world,
                            that age is measured by years? Have you, then, in all your life of
                            freedom and adventure, never, never sat you down and thought, and
                            discovered in that thought that time is a lie, that there is no time;
                            and <pb id="VAA3931-428" n="419"/> only the beating of the heart and the
                            birth and the death of its emotions bring age? Ha!&#151;young! Then
                            is God young! Señor, I am older than these rocks, and the ruins of this
                            wall, though they have seen and known such pain and sorrow in the times
                            gone by as wrung tears out of stone, yet, looking on me, surely must
                            weep again. You who scorn me, would call me incapable of remorse. Yet
                            have I last night and to-day burnt with it till it was as though my soul
                            staggered and fell, black ruins. Go away &#151; leave me. If still
                            there be left that in my heart that can bleed, let me bleed alone."</p>
                        <p>"I will leave you," he said bowed down. "I can say no more. May God be
                            with you. May God be with us both."</p>
                        <p>He turned to go.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," murmured she, "alone. Leave me with that which I must do. Your way
                            will be darkened by me no more."</p>
                        <p>"What do you mean?" he cried, turning back, frozen with fear.</p>
                        <p>"Then you do not leave me? Come &#151; Oh I am mad! Señor, if your
                            mind still is whole, pity the wreck of mine! Why &#151; you are
                            still here? Did you not go? I saw you last, señor, at the tower. Grief
                            has made me this poor way. I would have crawled after him. I think I did
                            &#151; I crawled over the stones &#151; stunned, crying. I held
                            out my arms to him &#151; ah, I remember, it was then my mind first
                            was black."</p>
                        <p>"Pepa! Pepa! &#151; Oh my God!"</p>
                        <p>"Why &#151; are you still here, señor? Will you not, then, leave me?
                            I cannot do it if you are here."</p>
                        <p>He stooped down beside her and, seizing her arms, bent his eyes on hers,
                            striving to call her to herself.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-429" n="420"/>
                        <p>"What is it," he cried with a desperate sternness, "that you are going to
                            do? Listen! Look at me! I compel you to tell me!"</p>
                        <p>"You are so fierce with me," she moaned plaintively, like a child who is
                            cold. "Yet &#151; I understand &#151; gentleness is not for me,
                            though I be very hungry for it. Love is not for me, though my heart die
                            for it. Señor &#151; please, please go away &#151; for the time
                            is coming. Please, please go away!"</p>
                        <p>At these mad words he was wrung with a torture such as he had never
                            dreamed possible.</p>
                        <p>"Oh broken heart!" he cried. "What can I do!"</p>
                        <p>"Do?" said she suddenly, after a moment's silence. "There is nothing for
                            you to do. <hi rend="i">Ay de mi!</hi> You have done it all. Don
                            Rodrigo, do not fear. I am come to myself again. I tried to bear it. I
                            did all I could. But there was something in the blackness that laughed
                            at me &#151; and I fought with it till it came and crushed me. I can
                            feel no more. I knew when it came dark I had failed at last, and must
                            not live. I cannot. So I walked away thinking I would come to the water.
                            Don Rodrigo, I gave you all, my love, my faith. You were not able to
                            give to me &#151; anything. So to pay me only a little, can you not
                            do me this one favor. Leave me and let me do it. I cannot go walking on
                            in these ruins."</p>
                        <p>"You shall not," he cried, "you dare not! With my soul's strength I
                            forbid and I shall prevent it. Kill me first. I am here and I give you
                            my arms and I pray you kill me. For this you must do before you can kill
                            yourself! Listen to me &#151;"</p>
                        <p>"The mad cannot listen, and I am mad. I say it plainly. I have felt
                            reason going, was happy that I felt it. Oh señor, to break one's heart
                            once is much too often; to live is to break it anew with every <pb
                                id="VAA3931-430" n="421"/> thought, in every moment. This lifelong
                            agony you would decree to me. Holy Mother Mary! thou too hast gone from
                            me! What &#151; only this man here? Señor &#151; then will you
                            not leave me? Go away &#151; the last time I plead with you. If I
                            had a heart I could tear it out and cast it down and cry, Take it;
                            trample it! &#151; but leave me! Señor, I have no heart. Then for
                            the deed's sake &#151; please, please go away!"</p>
                        <p>It seemed to him clear with a deadly clearness that this strange woman's
                            mind was sinking under her grief. He was filled with horror and a
                            self-loathing that made him panic-stricken. He leaped to seize her,
                            crying:</p>
                        <p>"You shall not!"</p>
                        <p>She was up, seeming tall and strong. Her eyes, like those of a maniac
                            indeed, glared fire at him out of darkness. That look for a second
                            disarmed him. She wrenched herself with one quick effort from his grasp,
                            and crying out crazily, brokenly, ran away, leaping the stones like a
                            wild animal. She was at the edge of the precipitous descent and he came
                            on with all his speed and desperation after her. He perceived that she
                            plunged down over boulders and amidst cacti. Being in that moment at the
                            edge, he could barely see the black shadow of her figure going on,
                            zigzag, leaping, disappearing, rising again, skimming over that perilous
                            course as though wings held her.</p>
                        <p>He knew the descent was full of danger even in the day, but he did not
                            pause. He went down after her, crying to her. He sprang from rock to
                            rock, wounding himself but going on. Boulders loomed before him and on
                            every side. The high shadow of the island itself now towered behind him.
                            He was half-way down amidst a chaos of shattered stone, <pb
                                id="VAA3931-431" n="422"/> plunging on where one false step would
                            have been fatal. Before him the girl's form went lightly, swiftly, and
                            the lake, unseen, beat its waves under her. He saw failure before him
                            and the night for evermore gashed like a wound in his life. He called
                            aloud shrieking it:</p>
                        <p>"Pepa! Help ! Help ! Stop her in God's name !" He dashed on blindly.
                            Others had heard his cry and came, some running along the shore from the
                            tower, others descending after him. He was near the bottom. He was
                            leaping to the last boulder before reaching that narrow track that
                            separated the ascent from the water. He could just see her spring from
                            the shore with the agility of a panther over a wide stretch of heaving
                            water, to a rock that stood alone in the lake. She sprang yet again from
                            that to a second farther out. She did not pause. She sprang yet a third
                            time to the last boulder far out where the lake was deep. The spot was
                            not far from the island's southern end and the ruined prison of tunnels
                            looked down on the scene out of its years of gloom. Rodrigo was over the
                            first stretch of water and on the first isolated rock. Others, being
                            nearly all those few soldiers who had watched the island's southern end,
                            were running to her aid behind him. He jumped to the second rock and saw
                            her figure disappear. There was the sound of the fall of a body in the
                            lake. He came, and his comrades came, to the high flat summit of that
                            last boulder. The water beat against it and surged in darkness about its
                            base. There was no woman there, or arm stretched up out of that
                            unspeaking flood, or hair that floated on the waves.</p>
                        <p>The place was a wilderness of water to the west, and a wilderness of
                            rocks toward the shore &#151; rocks <pb id="VAA3931-432" n="423"/>
                            that cut off the view in all directions, and were buried in unfathomable
                            gloom, among which the billows played, retreated, advanced, hid, and
                            shattered themselves. Some of the soldiers dragged, some scanned the
                            shore and the lake, some called for a boat, and a fruitless search went
                            on.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER X</head>
                        <p>IT was not with bounding hope &#151; in spite of a will to hope
                            &#151; that the prisoner began the operations of the night. It was
                            rather with a sense of coming disaster that made his mind and his manner
                            sombre. So soon as it was safe and he had no other interruption of
                            guards to fear, that is, a little after eight o'clock, he cautiously
                            raised the lid to that unclean passage.</p>
                        <p>He lowered himself, taking his candle with him, and closed the opening.
                            He traversed again the tunnel, crawling in places, gathering earth upon
                            him, and seeing the white evidences of unknown miseries of the past
                            flash out of cave-like recesses as he went. Whatever of agitation the
                            events of the preceding night and the news born from them had caused
                            him, there was none of it left to render him too hasty or too slow, or
                            his foot or his mind unsteady. Had one seen him as he pierced that
                            underground passage, the candle light on his face, it would have seemed
                            that the dreamer had grown taller; that his mien was one of a reserve
                            that meant power; and that some unmeasured gloom was in him which
                            rendered him calm.</p>
                        <p>She had not come to see or speak to him&#151;and the day was gone. He
                            endeavored to blot this fact out of his mind, but it took refuge then in
                            his breast. Having earlier pondered this, and all the circumstances of
                            his condition, he had come to the inevitable <pb id="VAA3931-434"
                                n="425"/> conclusion that in her lay his only hope. He could rely on
                            the discretion, as he could on the silence, of the mute. That messenger,
                            ignorant of the identity of all of Vicente's friends, could be directed
                            then only to deliver the message to Pepa, whom Vicente believed to be
                            the only woman on the island. For her the mute could easily detect.
                            There would be no slightest chance of a mistake, and there ought to be
                            none. He could not say to the mute: "Find a giant and deliver the
                            message to him." For the night would be dark, and Vicente recalled that
                            Bonavidas likewise was a large man. Hence he girded up, as it were, his
                            faith in the girl, and made his first decision final.</p>
                        <p>He came to the steps under the southern prison and mounted. Half-way up
                            he perceived that other narrow exit, a black slit among boulders,
                            leading down through similar blackness to liberty. His blood leaped with
                            no joy, nor did he tremble. He went on up, calmly, and emerged in the
                            hermit's cell.</p>
                        <p>The eyes of that death-stricken aged one were as though they had been
                            long staring at the spot where Vicente's countenance appeared. The mute
                            was seated in the farthest corner on the ground, his hat pulled down
                            over his features. He made no move. The fire leaped once more into the
                            hermit's face, which looked ghastly pale, having assumed that extreme of
                            emaciation that seems often to come suddenly. He stretched out his hand
                            and cried with a sickly joy:</p>
                        <p>"My son &#151; you are come at last!"</p>
                        <p>Vicente stood over him and looked down in a deep meditation. He passed
                            his hand, then, once gently over the hermit's wasted features.</p>
                        <p>"Write it!" gasped the sick man. "Write the <pb id="VAA3931-435" n="426"
                            /> message and send him. And tell me," clutching at Vicente's arm in
                            feeble but thirsty eagerness, "tell me your hope and your energy are
                            high. Tell me you will secure this night freedom for all time and the
                            army again shall be yours!"</p>
                        <p>"Father," replied Vicente, "to this course am I committed. To this shall
                            I cling till the end come. There is nothing else in the world for me.
                            There be some not born for the world. It is possible I am one of these;
                            but let time answer. The army will follow me again, as it followed me
                            once. I can gather it up where any other would fail. So, if there be
                            truth in the vision of my founding yet a government that shall be strong
                            and a power for good, fear not. I shall wring that truth out of that
                            vision, and your heart, be the world or the grave its resting-place,
                            shall have peace."</p>
                        <p>"It has it," gasped the hermit. "Go &#151; write."</p>
                        <p>Vicente walked to the table, sat down on the bench, and wrote with a
                            curious leisure. He arose and went to the mute.</p>
                        <p>"Get up," said he.</p>
                        <p>The mute obeyed and turned up a face wherein the exultation was for a
                            moment visible, but which, on the hermit's suddenly crying out, seemed
                            to stiffen. Vicente, towering over him, laid his hand heavily on the
                            dumb man's shoulder and held the other's eyes with his own.</p>
                        <p>"Go you," said he slowly, making the words clear and distinct and
                            weighting them with command, "down to the lake. Follow the shore to the
                            right and keep yourself ever hid. Search for a woman. If she is not
                            there she may be in a boat, wherein you are to look with all your
                            cunning and your caution strained to the utmost. You are hunting,
                            understand <pb id="VAA3931-436" n="427"/> it well, a woman. There is but
                            one here. Search, man, till you find her, if you must upturn every rock
                            on this barren isle. And you are to let no other see you. When she is
                            found you are to give her this in secret. That is all."</p>
                        <p>The mute took the paper and instinctively turned toward his master, whose
                            eyes had been blazing through the writing of the letter and the delivery
                            of the command, and whose weak old body, even weaker than on the
                            previous night, was again half raising itself.</p>
                        <p>"Go!" cried the hermit, his voice husky and breaking. "I am weak of body,
                            but my mind is your master still, you who taunted me in that old time.
                            And my mind shall follow you this night, for on this mission have I set
                            my spirit. My weakness left you free two whole days, and that freedom
                            starved me so that I now die; but, liar in your soul, I won you back and
                            you are mine still. And if on this night of my great hope, you dare to
                            think &#151; ay, so much as think freedom, I will crush you down on
                            that very spot where the thought is born. Go on&#151;I will follow
                            &#151; I &#151;I"</p>
                        <p>A fit of coughing that seemed to rend his body, suddenly attacked him, so
                            that his weakness appeared incapable of enduring more and his form, now
                            seated, swayed and rocked. Vicente seized and held him. As the coughing
                            abated and the old man gasped and groped with his lean hands, that
                            evident and striking failure of his last strength bore its fruit in the
                            mind of the slave. The dumb one, looking on first in terror, then with a
                            deep and infernal cunning, let his face show plainly, daringly, for the
                            first time, his joy at his master's coming dissolution, his defiance,
                            his savage sense of freedom as the master's mind sank <pb
                                id="VAA3931-437" n="428"/> toward death. All those emotions came out
                            on his revolting features and, as it were, stood there and smiled or
                            glared.</p>
                        <p>The hermit saw them and the fact of his now, on the grave's brink,
                            failing in his long work, seeing the crushed rise up, swept in on him.
                            It produced an effect as appalling as it was sudden. Despair turned to
                            rage so great that it burst all bounds. He wrenched himself from
                            Vicente's grasp and tottered up. He was convulsed and torn with that
                            mighty anger. He stood for one second tall and lean and trembling,
                            glaring at the crouching figure before him. Some mad emperor, in
                            blasting wrath about to trample his people, would have looked thus and
                            not more dreadful. He staggered forward, with clenched fist and flaming
                            eyes, a demon withering the human form that dared not escape. The effort
                            was the hermit's last. Its force consumed in one instant the vitality
                            that might have lasted him for hours. Vicente, awed by that spectacle,
                            had not time again to seize him before his tall and emaciated body
                            collapsed. It fell with complete and final ruin, barely arrested in its
                            fall by the arms of the son who leaped to sustain it.</p>
                        <p>Its despair and its rage alike were dead&#151; as were its memories
                            and its hopes. Its powers of spirit and of mind were gone. Yet, not
                            absolutely. For the force of that wrath bent the mute once more into a
                            subjection which, for a space yet after his master's doom, would live;
                            and in that last subjection, even as the master fell, the slave slunk
                            away down the stairs into the bowels of the earth, on his mission.</p>
                        <p>Vicente, even now not thrown into excitement, but weighed with a grief he
                            had not anticipated, gathered up the form, a strangely light form, and
                            placed it on the couch. He sought stimulants and administered <pb
                                id="VAA3931-438" n="429"/> them. He chafed the body. He worked long
                            and rapidly &#151; to no purpose. He brought the candle then and
                            looked, haunted, for many long minutes into the face. Behind those
                            features had lived his own source of being and his destiny. The eyes he
                            now closed had held that power that bent men, and won his mother's
                            wayward heart&#151;and failed of all good. The face was grown calm.
                            It was absolutely white, and in its lineaments and its whiteness Vicente
                            saw himself and knew his life as he had never known it before. His brain
                            swam with memories. The shadows of the cell were the figures that acted
                            out his father's tragedy. The future to him was only some strong, sad
                            force that led him on, him, the helpless, the fated, to an untimely end.
                            He sank to his knees and wept, but without tears. It was then that the
                            mute returned and the prisoner remembered his promised liberty. He arose
                            and bent his eyes on the messenger who had crept in more awed by that
                            last effort of his master's mind than Vicente had ever seen him.</p>
                        <p>"Have you succeeded?" demanded the latter.</p>
                        <p>The other signed yes.</p>
                        <p>"Did you give it to a woman, and in secrecy?"</p>
                        <p>Yes.</p>
                        <p>"Then come. We will wait below."</p>
                        <p>Vicente took up the candle. The mute had cast a glance at the couch. He
                            had looked away as though he dared not glance again. Then, a second
                            time, he had cast his eyes thither. He was like a dog that scents a dead
                            body and is fascinated, yet repelled; drawn, yet terrified; half
                            approaching, yet slinking away; the knowledge of dread full on him, yet
                            deep under it the animal instinct to come on and rend.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-439" n="430"/>
                        <p>Vicente, turning with the candle perceived that canine glare. He walked
                            to the couch and did the last small offices of arranging the hands and
                            the blankets. He stood yet another moment and looked for the last time
                            at the face.</p>
                        <p>"Come," said he, and turned, walking toward the exit. "We will go. This
                            shall be his tomb."</p>
                        <p>He began the descent and the mute followed, leaving the dead man there
                            buried, he of power and of failure, of great love and greater sin.</p>
                        <p>They left the stairs at their middle and entered the fissure between
                            boulders. The descent was without steps and steep, and the passage as
                            narrow as low. Vicente himself would lead, though he did not know this
                            tunnel. It was cut irregularly through earth, swerving aside frequently
                            to avoid the rocks. It went ever down so that all the height of the
                            island was speedily left above. They emerged at last from the black hole
                            of the exit. That hole was so small they must crawl through. On one side
                            of it, without, and extending some distance in front of it, stood one of
                            the many boulders that line this shore. On the other side, and extending
                            across so as entirely to hide the tunnel, grew one of those clusters of
                            cactus that towered and spread and straggled in many directions. Between
                            the cactus and the irregular wall of the precipice was left a narrow
                            passage leading round the island's shore under the bluff. Following this
                            path over stones and among other cacti with the island's wall on the
                            right and the lake on the left, one could come at length to the bay and
                            the tower, having passed on the way the spot where Mendez met Clarita,
                            as also the spot where, a little later, Rodrigo and his men looked for
                            the body of Josefa Aranja.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-440" n="431"/>
                        <p>There was also room left or rather cut by the mute, between the cactus
                            that hid the tunnel and the boulder on the left &#151; a path so
                            hewn through the prickly plant that masses of that plant still extended
                            beyond the boulder's edge, leaving the tunnel's mouth invisible from the
                            lake. The spot had evidently been selected with much cunning, there
                            having been no haste and little cause for secrecy in the hollowing out
                            of that unsuspected way.</p>
                        <p>Vicente, halting the other, passed thus between those wing-like
                            concealments of boulder and cactus and emerged with caution at the
                            shore. The lake beat up but a few yards lower than the passage's exit
                            and some ten yards distant from the island's abrupt wall. There was a
                            small cove there which rocks left somewhat of a harbor. Waves coming
                            from the southeast could beat straight into it. But those from the
                            southwest, or any other direction, were halted by the line of rock. As
                            the wind came on this night from the southwest (indeed it does so on the
                            majority of nights during the dry season) the cove was left
                            comparatively calm. He perceived a boat could be brought without danger
                            very near the shore. Having learned the ground he crept back to the
                            tunnel's mouth. The mute was ordered to remain concealed and in no wise
                            to meddle in aught that should occur. Vicente sat down in hiding and,
                            without suspense but in gloom, awaited the hour.</p>
                        <p>There was being borne in on his consciousness at length some faint hint
                            of a moving shadow, barely other than the night's own shadows, yonder
                            due south on the face of the water. It wavered and rose and fell, was
                            large and then suddenly small, as though a cloud glided over the waves
                            or some spirit walked there. He did not know whether his imagination,
                                <pb id="VAA3931-441" n="432"/> rendered too alert by the strain of
                            the night, called up this unreality, or whether the shadow were a thing
                            real. He was straining his eyes to that otherwise blank south and
                            hearing the waves beat up, when another sound broke on his ears
                            &#151; the soft plash, plash, of a pole near the shore.</p>
                        <p>A moment more and the great hulk of Fortino's <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            appeared indistinctly, shrouded in gloom, to his right. It was cutting
                            the billows, indeed staggering somewhat among them, as, unsteadily
                            propelled by that one strong man, it hugged the rocks and rounded, in
                            imminent danger of wrecking itself, the last of the boulders. It wavered
                            and sank and rose before him who saw his freedom come thus shadowlike
                            out of shadows. It turned slightly, and turned back, wheeling
                            irregularly, refusing to enter the place of calm. Fortino himself could
                            be now indistinctly descried high up on the side near the stern, his
                            body bent far back as he strained on the pole putting forth a supreme
                            effort. He conquered the waves; the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> came into
                            the tiny gulf and felt the heaving water grow quiet under her flat
                            bottom.</p>
                        <p>She rode in absolute silence nearly to the shore, struck without noise on
                            sand, and stood, her pointed prow high and black and sharp. For the
                            first time tingling eagerness was born in Vicente. He was ready to seize
                            that second and be gone, swallowed up in the lake's night. He turned to
                            draw the mute from his concealment, not forgetting that creature whom he
                            pitied. The creature was not there. The prisoner dared waste a fraction
                            of the precious minute to search the hiding-place; the dumb one was not
                            found. Vicente ran to the passage's mouth and a little way up. Neither
                            was he there. Time was too priceless. There could be no more delay. It
                            was unlikely the <pb id="VAA3931-442" n="433"/> mute, if later found by
                            the soldiers, would be severely dealt with. He was left to his fate
                            &#151; unfathomable product of crime and sorrow clinging to
                            captivity. Vicente crept to the shore and was at the vessel's prow,
                            raising his hands to draw himself in. It was then that a girl's form
                            leaped out and was beside him.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa!" he whispered, bewildered by this movement.</p>
                        <p>She was closer to him. She seized him round the neck with both her arms.
                            He saw and felt that she was littler than Pepa, and he knew the quick
                            smothered sobs. He was dazed. He seized her and pressed her to him in
                            the secret darkness.</p>
                        <p>"Clarita! Come &#151; there is not one moment to lose. I will lift
                            you back in the boat &#151; help me! What is it!"</p>
                        <p>She was pulling back.</p>
                        <p>"Go on!" whispered she, pushing him frantically to the vessel, from which
                            he had a step withdrawn. "You are free. I have helped you. This is
                            enough for me. I cannot &#151; at last, Vicente, I cannot go. I am
                            safe!"</p>
                        <p>"What do you mean?" cried he, feeling failure close on his track. He
                            dragged her after him, but she tore away. She put her face close to his
                            and whispered, impassioned:</p>
                        <p>"Rodrigo has been good to me. You are safe. Kiss me! I shall love you
                            always &#151; the change is come&#151; Oh! you
                            understand&#151;my place is here. And thus I can get him to let you
                            go!"</p>
                        <p>He comprehended that trembling confession, comprehended it half with
                            sorrow, half with joy. But he had faith in Don Rodrigo, most of all,
                            faith in Clarita; and there was in him little of selfishness.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-443" n="434"/>
                        <p>"Then good-by!" whispered he, pressing her to his breast. "God be with
                            you!"</p>
                        <p>She crept away and he leaped up to the boat's prow. The figure of another
                            girl, running along the shore out of the darkness, swept past the spot
                            where Clarita drew aside invisible. That other slipped in between cactus
                            and rock. She was panting barely audibly. She sprang out to the water's
                            edge at the cove where Vicente, bewildered, was entering the vessel over
                            the prow and Fortino at the rear still strained on the pole. Her
                            clothing was soaked and clung to her strong young body, pouring water in
                            a score of little streams to the earth, having, indeed, dashed spray
                            from her flying person all the way as she came along that hidden path
                            under the island's bluffs. Vicente was once more astounded to see that
                            wet figure coming in after him and feel the dripping arm brush his
                            face.</p>
                        <p>With a last glance, half fearful, half exultant, Clarita perceived the
                            boat begin to move. The night was yet as silent as the prisons, save for
                            the lonely sound of waves. She did not see that other spirit-like bulk
                            of gloom that had stalked yonder from the south. To her the change had
                            come at last, and with it tears. For the first time in all her life she
                            would not follow him. Not again would she walk through the dark night to
                            find him, or cross the stormy lake unbidden to be where he was.</p>
                        <p>She waited to see no more. She ran swiftly round the island's end to its
                            western side, and traversing in a kind of panic the course the dripping
                            Pepa had traversed, came to the rocks that had hidden the swimmer. She
                            ran almost fully into the arms of the remorse-crazed Rodrigo, who,
                            having failed at the point of the leap, was running here, scanning the
                                <pb id="VAA3931-444" n="435"/> shore. It swept over Clarita that
                            this haste meant pursuit of her brother, at least suspicion, that the
                            secret would out, that on her alone depended the safety of the fugitive.
                            She hesitated not one moment. That latent spirit of deeds came up.
                            Rodrigo had declared his love &#151; her brother was free. She loved
                            this man with her whole heart; she knew it now in the moment of her
                            anxiety. Her modest timidity went down in the storm. She, the gentle,
                            was suddenly as wild, as bold, as ever had been Pepa in her freest
                            times.</p>
                        <p>She cried out as he would have passed her:</p>
                        <p>"Rodrigo! Rodrigo!"</p>
                        <p>She cried it passionately. He turned, and she, blocking his way,
                            stretched out her arms and he caught her. She held him in the embrace of
                            desperation. She wept and called his name; she threw back her face,
                            which, thinking that some great trouble had come to her, he kissed,
                            beseeching her to tell him.</p>
                        <p>"I can bear it no more!" cried she. "You love me &#151; you said you
                            loved me!"</p>
                        <p>"With all my life!"</p>
                        <p>"Then take me! Take me!"</p>
                        <p>Doubtless in the paroxysm of emotion that, like a maelstrom, had suddenly
                            seized her, confession of itself would have broken out. She was swept
                            away in the bursting storm of that which her secret heart had longed to
                            utter. The stratagem was but the hundredth part of the moment's deed. It
                            was merely that it could fall in with the storm. Curiously did stratagem
                            and reality flow on together, the last sweeping in the first. Ah! thou
                            timid one, thus thy great love made thee, too, that unusual deceiver,
                            with that unusual and sweet deceit that was truer than truth.</p>
                        <p>There came then, ringing through the night, the <pb id="VAA3931-445"
                                n="436"/> distant cry of a man's voice, "Help! Help! He is
                            escaping!" and the report of a pistol.</p>
                        <p>She had detained Rodrigo one invaluable minute; even she could detain him
                            no more. He listened, startled; then broke away from her.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> bearing the fugitives had begun its silent
                            gliding out as Clarita had run away. It was but a few feet from the
                            shore when the waves caught its stern, whirled it, in spite of all
                            Fortino's strength, sidewise, and, for a moment, hung it motionless on
                            the rocks. The giant ground out between his teeth such oaths as the
                            night must have shuddered at, and Vicente, seeing that his life hung on
                            every second, was high up beside him, his slender figure, too, straining
                            with all its power on the pole. It was then that they heard the cry and
                            the pistol, whose ball struck the water under them. There were no other
                            boats at the island. Escape was yet possible.</p>
                        <p>When Rodrigo had called his men to the pursuit of Pepa, Bonavidas, on the
                            island's extreme southern point, had not heard the call. Seated under
                            the prison's wall he was watching that shadow yonder in the south. The
                            sound of the grating of Fortino's vessel came suddenly to him. He crept
                            half-way down the precipitous descent and the scarcely seen movement
                            below aroused his fears. He cried out and fired to determine his course
                            and raise the alarm, not aiming at the vessel. His fears were confirmed
                            by the struggle beneath and, with a devilish zest, the wily lieutenant
                            plunged into the danger. When nearly to the shore he hung from a rocky
                            ledge and dropped. Then he leaped at the boat, crying aloud. He had seen
                            one huge and one tall figure high up against the stars on the struggling
                            vessel. But he, too, had been seen.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-446" n="437"/>
                        <p>His descent, since the alarm, had taken but the eighth of a minute. It
                            took that frantic giant but two seconds to intrust the pole to Vicente
                            and the girl and spring from boat to water, from water to land. On the
                            edge of the shore he met the charging lieutenant. Fortino's only
                            thought, mad and blind as he was, seeing his great hope threatened, was
                            to crush this howling demon. He sprang on his astounded enemy before
                            that enemy could raise his weapon. They were locked in a deadly embrace.
                            Bonavidas's long and powerful arms entwined that great bulk and wrenched
                            fruitlessly. The giant's muscles were in sudden and irresistible play
                            and with a dull, sickening crack the body of Bonavidas was crushed
                            against his iron breast. The time occupied in this silent contest was
                            infinitesimal. The disease that had secretly gnawed the lieutenant's
                            strength then showed its works. It was as though the lungs were, by that
                            bear-like grip, mangled. Floods of clotted blood burst from the victim's
                            mouth, and he fell, blood running still on the sand,&#151;and lay
                            dead.</p>
                        <p>Cursing in his throat gutturally, the giant, now inflamed with fury, ran
                            through water straight at the boat, and hurled his form against its
                            stern. It was like striking it with a boulder. It scraped and swung free
                            and circled out amidst greater waves, Fortino clambering, as it went,
                            over its side. They were dashed by billows fifty feet into the lake;
                            they heard shouts and running feet upon the shore.</p>
                        <p>"With all your strength!" cried Vicente; and the wind caught his voice
                            and made a hideous clangor of the words.</p>
                        <p>The two swung on the pole, Pepa crouching under them straining at the
                            rudder, striving to guide the vessel straight out.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-447" n="438"/>
                        <p>"Up with the sail!" cried Vicente.</p>
                        <p>Fortino loosed the pole and the vessel tilted and swayed. It was then
                            that bullets began spattering the water and they heard Rodrigo's voice
                            crying orders on the shore. The sail, hoisted by Fortino's great arm,
                            its ropes seized by Vicente, went fluttering up, caught the wind with a
                            dull report, and dragged, bulging, at its mast. The flight under the
                            white square began, round the island's eastern side twenty yards from
                            shore, toward the spot where lay Ocotlan, the wind directly in the
                            stern.</p>
                        <p>Exultation was suddenly turned to horror. The thing that had been the
                            spot of white and red in the long afternoon, had been, too, that
                            ghost-like bulk that strode in darkness from the south. The three
                            fugitives, crowded together in the stern, crouching to avoid the bullets
                            that now went wild, bending every effort to the management of sail and
                            rudder, beheld then a second expanse, looming out of the southern
                            darkness, towering over them, bearing straight down across their bows.
                            They cried and shrieked in vain. That silent enemy sailed on. They came,
                            in spite of all effort, in front of its prow. It was as though the white
                            sail became a dazzling sheet to wind them in and cast them down. The
                            prow of that new enemy, bursting in on the moment of success, crashed
                            against their vessel's side.</p>
                        <p>The phantom bore with it Doroteo Quiroz. He had heard the cry and knew
                            who alone could be escaping. He had been still in his desperate mood;
                            and the escape of him for whose capture he had risked all, frenzied him.
                            Let not that skeleton arise out of the tomb to goad him. Thinking this,
                            he had heard Vicente's voice and seen the vessel rolling out on to the
                            lake's bosom. He had borne down on it. <pb id="VAA3931-448" n="439"/>
                            Coming very near he had heard yet another voice, a voice that seemed to
                            make every drop of blood in his body stand still. It was Pepa's. She,
                            too, was escaping and with the very man they had pawned their souls
                            together to destroy. Burning thoughts of treachery burst in his mind. It
                            seemed then everything he touched fell in ruins. Crazed by that last
                            voice, he hesitated not. He crashed straight into the traitor's ship,
                            heedless of danger or death.</p>
                        <p>His vessel was the "Goddess Venus" manned by three of his own sailors.
                            She had no iron on her, and she struck her opponent at a spot of the
                            latter's side most firmly braced by heavy cross timbers. So she did not
                            pierce her. The two <hi rend="i">canoas</hi> shook and tottered, but
                            remained whole. Quiroz sprang to the prow and hurled his anchor into the
                            other vessel. While the fugitives struggled to prevent that disastrous
                            union, Quiroz called his willing servants to his aid, seized the chain,
                            and the vessels were drawn together. They wrapped the chain's
                            superfluous coils round a staying timber, so that those two small and
                            tossing ships were lashed like galleys of old.</p>
                        <p>Vicente was not armed. All weapons had been removed from him on his
                            capture. He had stood at the point of conjunction ready to sell his
                            freedom with his life, infuriated for once by the presence of this fiend
                            of treachery. The girl, at the sound of Quiroz's voice, lost her daring
                            for the first time before any save Rodrigo. She slunk into the boat's
                            farthest corner and looked on, no party in the fight. Vicente's was the
                            coolest mind of the three. It would have been better had Fortino's been
                            cooler. The moment the anchor caught the ship the former sprang to cast
                            it loose. Fortino, a maniacal purpose born in him, strangely prevented
                            that separation. <pb id="VAA3931-449" n="440"/> But what reasoning, what
                            earthly force, could stop the dread hurricane of that great man's
                            passion when, in a fury that no words can describe, he realized that
                            this, his last struggle with his destiny, was failing because of that
                            same wretch who had brought about his miseries. He cried out with so
                            fierce and so deafening a cry that it was as though some king of the
                            forests, leaping on his prey, roared in him. He hurled himself across
                            the chasm between the two prows. He launched that vast weight of his
                            straight at his enemy &#151; all thoughts, all purposes, all hopes,
                            dead, save just this one, to crush the vile soul out of its viler
                            body.</p>
                        <p>He seized Quiroz in a grip of iron. He called forth the sum of his
                            powers. He was a demon from the fiery pit. If breath of man could blast
                            man Quiroz must have shrivelled before that hot exhalation of supreme
                            hate. The traitor felt his body pressed till it seemed the crushing arms
                            must cut him through. His ribs seemed cracking and the blood felt as
                            though it burst from his veins and flooded him. He would doubtless have
                            gone the way of Bonavidas had not his three sailors, themselves strong
                            men, been there to help him. They were with one accord on Fortino. One
                            seized a club from the boat's bottom and beat the giant's defenceless
                            head unmercifully. The attack of the others was not less fierce. The
                            boat was rocking under them and the other dragging at its chain, and the
                            two sails, left unguarded, surged and flapped as the <hi rend="i"
                                >canoas</hi> wheeled contrary to wind. The fight lasted scarce time
                            for Vicente to perceive its nature. He, too, was on the point of
                            springing across and adding his despairing strength to that of Fortino,
                            when he was pushed back from the spot where, for <pb id="VAA3931-450"
                                n="441"/> an instant, he was poised on the boat's side. His
                            assailant was one of the sailors, who, knocking Vicente backward into
                            the vessel, jumped in after him.</p>
                        <p>The struggle with Fortino was done. It is likely that even four men would
                            not have proved too many for his towering strength, had not an
                            unforeseen circumstance aided them. He had grown, in the contest, even
                            more crazed than before. In the grasp of his three assailants and still
                            holding Quiroz, he had lunged and tottered. The mass of men had crashed
                            into the thatch, torn that light roofing from the sides, and shattered
                            it. Even the mast itself was all but cracked. The sail then united its
                            efforts with those of Fortino's enemies and caused, with their strength,
                            his failure. The wheeling of the vessel had left the canvas empty of
                            wind. It sank, flat and flapping, and wound the plunging giant in its
                            folds. He knew not what he did. He loosed one arm for a moment from
                            Quiroz, to tear the cursed thing down. It confused and hampered him. Its
                            sagging end, the rope unguarded, tangled his feet. That loosing of the
                            arm was fatal to success. Quiroz, with the others' aid, jerked himself
                            loose. With a dexterous twist the canvas was more thoroughly wound about
                            the frantic combatant.</p>
                        <p>It was then the unarmed Vicente was hurled back. Quiroz and the two other
                            sailors left Fortino, who for an instant could not free or collect
                            himself. They sprang into the other vessel. Vicente was in the midst of
                            the most desperate fight of his life with the first of Quiroz's
                            servants. The two following ones joined it, overpowering the dreamer.
                            Quiroz, losing not a second, at once on entering that vessel and before
                            Fortino could come storming to the prow, cast away the anchor that bound
                            the two <hi rend="i">canoas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-451" n="442"/>
                        <p>They staggered again at this release, and swung apart. Fortino was
                            charging over cross-timbers, having freed himself. He was an instant too
                            late. He was baffled so ignominiously that the last of his heart and its
                            courage were wrecked. He saw the other <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi>
                            containing Quiroz and his three assistants, Vicente and the girl,
                            tossing yonder, himself here alone in Doroteo's vessel, and an
                            impassable gulf of black and heaving waves between. He sank down in
                            despair.</p>
                        <p>The other <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> was at once righted by Quiroz and his
                            men, and headed to the shore. Viceñte, overwhelmed by numbers, though
                            having fought with unflinching bravery, was pinioned in the prow. The
                            sail, bulging again, hid the stern from him. High in that stern sat
                            Quiroz, grown calm and steely. He stared at the girl. She crept up to
                            him, kitten-like, and, resting against him, put up her face.</p>
                        <p>"Did you think I was leaving you?" whispered she, bringing her lips
                            close, close. "I was only getting away, the sooner to come to you!"</p>
                        <p>He tried to read her face.</p>
                        <p>"Pepa, are you telling me the truth?" said he between his teeth.</p>
                        <p>"I would not lie to you," she replied plaintively, bringing her lips
                            still closer, so that he felt her breath on his face. "Doroteo, I would
                            not lie to you to save my poor soul."</p>
                        <p>"Then you are mine at last!" cried he, holding her an instant with
                            passion. She crept away and crouched under the thatch.</p>
                        <p>The shore was at once neared and the vessel anchored, yet not so close
                            that those soldiers who came running there could detect the identity of
                            its occupants.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-452" n="443"/>
                        <p>"Deliver him to the <hi rend="i">jefe,</hi>" whispered Quiroz to his men,
                            "and say not a word, but return here."</p>
                        <p>So the ill-fated prisoner was given over once again to that chief of
                            police in whom the escape had caused a relief as great as transient. The
                            three sailors returned to the <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> answering no
                            queries. That vessel, containing still the girl and Quiroz, was poled
                            out free of rocks, the sail was raised, and the journey was continued.
                            Its master wished to return to Tizapan, but this the wind would not
                            permit him to do. He would not remain on that island. He hated every man
                            on it; he had obtained what he sought. He would sail for the opposite
                            shore and return to his native town when the wind should change. So that
                            square of canvas that had been the white spot and the red, and the
                            spirit-like shadow from the south, went away to the north and
                            disappeared.</p>
                        <p>The despair of Fortino was infinite. For a full hour his vessel, he the
                            lonely occupant, tossed at the will of the waves. The sail caught the
                            wind and dashed the boat about, that it was nigh to sinking. It lost the
                            wind and fell and flapped in laxity. The prow now cut the advancing
                            waves, now turned and ran from them. The waters flowed dark and deep,
                            and he knew death lay under them. He dreamed a long bitter dream of
                            Ocotlan, Tizapan, and the Island. He was haunted by ghosts and ridden by
                            black morbidness. The sky was a pall over him, the lake a grave under
                            him, life blacker than the grave. He would have leaped in but for the
                            profound contempt of self that made him punish himself by not doing so.
                            The high rocks of the island yonder cursed him. His own soul rose up in
                            revolt and cursed him. He died a hundred deaths, and felt a hundred
                            other <pb id="VAA3931-453" n="444"/> dooms bring their weight and
                            mercilessly unload it on him.</p>
                        <p>The night progressed and the silence of the infinite was about him. In
                            every direction lay the same unpierced gloom. He went at last to the
                            stern. No more fights, no more efforts for him. He was the lowest of the
                            low. To fish &#151; this was all &#151; merely to drag helpless,
                            tiny things out of water in a net &#151; this was all that might fit
                            the impotent Fortino. He righted the sail and worked the vessel round
                            till its prow pointed as nearly toward Chapala as the wind would allow.
                            The canvas filled and bulged. The breeze was thus not well in the stern
                            and his course was slow. He sat by the rudder and held his ship
                            remorselessly on its way. Seldom, seldom has a sailor sailed these ships
                            alone. He went on into the very deep, blank middle of that gloom. He
                            left the island. He could see no rocks behind, no shore before, no
                            mountains to the left or right. Thus empty was all time to him. He
                            sailed in the gloom, queer old Fortino, swallowed up yonder alone, seen
                            no more, lost in the waves and the night.</p>
                        <p>At midnight, or shortly after, the underground passage not yet having
                            been explored by any of the soldiers, there was struck a light and lit a
                            candle deep under the prison of tunnels. The yellow flare lit up the
                            hermit's cell, the stones, the couch, the body; also the revolting
                            visage of the mute who had lighted it. He had spent two long hours of
                            what trembling, what terrors, what fearful visions who knows? &#151;
                            creeping up the length of the tunnel he had made, halting and sitting
                            crouched for long minutes in dread, then creeping again. Coming at last
                            into the cell's absolute darkness he went with <pb id="VAA3931-454"
                                n="445"/> stealth and secured the candle and the match. Then
                            moisture, cold, came out over his whole body and he sat down in the
                            blackness. He bent his eyes toward the spot where stood the couch and
                            dared not move. He was thus many minutes more. Then the fascination drew
                            him on and he lit the candle. He crept over the floor to the couch. He
                            stared at the calm countenance. He put out his hand and withdrew it. He
                            put it out again and felt the body. He passed his fingers to the face.
                            He could not believe it. There was no power &#151; there was no
                            mind. He brought his own face closer. He passed his finger over every
                            feature. He knew the truth. He dropped the candle and it went out. He
                            crept to the exit and down, and came at length to the shore. He went a
                            little way along the water, arriving at a line of boulders that extended
                            into the lake. He climbed to the first and looked once back at the
                            passage. He stepped to the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth. He
                            was far out with the billows round him and deep water under him. He
                            raised his arms high in air. And he &#151; he, the mute &#151;
                            brokenly, imperfectly, the words made by but half a tongue and that half
                            long paralyzed &#151; cried out in a joy diabolical:</p>
                        <p>"Free! Free!"</p>
                        <p>He leaped and sank, and was seen henceforth no more. It was thus that he
                            followed her.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
                        <p>IN the middle of a bright and hot afternoon when the green and red walls
                            of Doña Manuela's home were rendered even more than ordinarily luminous
                            by the brightest and hottest of the sun's rays, that anxious señora's
                            son, with Josefa Aranja, entered the street door and appeared once again
                            in the tree-shaded <hi rend="i">patio.</hi> The interior of this, his
                            ancestral home, was as peaceful, as full of quiet and shadow, as could
                            have been even that domestic life for which the old lady believed him by
                            nature fit. The footfalls of the two arrivals woke sharp sounds from the
                            brick pavement. The trees barely stirréd and fell again into the
                            afternoon's yellow depths of sleep. The shattered door of the rear <hi
                                rend="i">patio</hi> had been removed, and there was a lack of
                            promptness or of inclination or of will in putting up another, for the
                            rear court, dusty and bare, lay visible. The door of the room Pepa had
                            occupied stood open, and looking in, they could see the unseemly hole in
                            the outer wall and through it catch some gleams of the sunlit
                            street.</p>
                        <p>They traversed but a scant half of the distance to the low roofed <hi
                                rend="i">corredor</hi> before there was again the wonted vision of
                            the loose blue dress. Its occupant, with a cry that may have been joy,
                            or only anxiety, ran out of the glazed parlor to meet them.</p>
                        <p>"Doroteo, my only son!" cried she, falling upon him. "Oh! the bitter
                            hours that I have not slept <pb id="VAA3931-456" n="447"/> or eaten! My
                            boy, you are come at last, and this time, oh surely &#151; tell me
                            this is the last time!"</p>
                        <p>"Aha!" cried Quiroz, fondling a stray lock of her hair; "you are right,
                            little mother, this is indeed the last!"</p>
                        <p>"Thanks be to Heaven!" responded she fervently.</p>
                        <p>Josefa advanced with something of the solemnity seen in her at times
                            before, and with lines a little harder about her mouth and a far-away
                            look in her eyes. She kissed Doña Manuela on both cheeks, and was at the
                            same time on both cheeks kissed by her, after the elaborate Mexican
                            custom. Then the old lady, struck with a sudden thought, turned in
                            agitation to her son and whispered:</p>
                        <p>"Are you &#151; is it &#151; Oh, Doroteo! It is already done? Are
                            you then &#151; really &#151; married, Doroteo?"</p>
                        <p>Quiroz laughed a somewhat sibilant laugh and went walking with his old
                            feline air under the tiled roof, where he sat down in a cane-and-leather
                            arm-chair.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, yes, <hi rend="i">Mamacita,</hi> ha! ha! So we are, with a bond of
                            steel. Set your heart at rest, <hi rend="i">Mamacita,</hi> we are
                            married, Josefa and I."</p>
                        <p>"And the good times," cried she, clapping her hands slowly and doing it,
                            too, with a solemn face of doubt, so that the joy of that clapping of
                            hands was hollow and without merriment, "the good times have come!"</p>
                        <p>She was not able to talk much during the rest of that afternoon. Her
                            brain and her heart were exceedingly full. She went about doing many
                            things restlessly, looking askance at the silent Josefa or following her
                            son with fearful eyes. And he was himself again, graceful, full of life
                            and suppressed spirits. Doña Manuela clung to the idea he had <pb
                                id="VAA3931-457" n="448"/> come at last to settle down. She
                            cherished and hugged and warmed that thought, not so much as daring, any
                            more, to say anything about it, merely in trepidation waiting to see.
                            Later they ate a supper which, save for Doroteo's run of comments on
                            many subjects far from the thoughts of all, would have been rather a
                            silent one. The old lady tried once, during that meal, to be jocund, and
                            said a thing very full of merriment, and declared, too, that Doroteo was
                            at last, now fights and bad influences being away, like her own son, the
                            son whose nature and whose needs she knew through and through. After
                            that saying the merriment pined with curious rapidity and died.</p>
                        <p>The darkness had come on and was whispering among the trees in the <hi
                                rend="i">patio,</hi> and the candles cast light out into the shades
                            of night. Unusually early they all agreed they were weary, and retired.
                            Døña Manuela withdrew to her room, a great depression on her, not having
                            dared ask or say more concerning the subject nearest her heart, not
                            knowing where her son had been to-day and yesterday, whether he would
                            remain with her or go away on the morrow. She spent the night before the
                            crucifix.</p>
                        <p>In the morning she found Doroteo busy with horses. She was struck dumb
                            and said nothing, nor expressed surprise. She summoned him to breakfast.
                            He kissed her with great gallantry and called her <hi rend="i"
                                >Mamacita,</hi> but said he and Pepa had had breakfast. The <hi
                                rend="i">mozo</hi> brought two horses into the <hi rend="i"
                                >patio.</hi> One of them bore a side saddle. Then the old lady,
                            standing motionless in the <hi rend="i">corredor,</hi> her white face
                            blank, heard Josefa singing the snatch of a tune in her room. The singer
                            came out. She was in a high-strung mood. Her eyes danced and the color
                            came <pb id="VAA3931-458" n="449"/> and went in waves on her face. She
                            came and kissed the old lady on both cheeks again.</p>
                        <p>"Good-by &#151; good-by!" cried she, in odd and feverish
                            happiness.</p>
                        <p>"Good-by," whispered Doña Manuela.</p>
                        <p>Doroteo helped the girl to the saddle with needless care. Then he turned
                            to his mother.</p>
                        <p>"Little mother, God with you! Fear not till Doroteo comes again. We will
                            not leave you alone forever. No, no! <hi rend="i">Mamacita</hi> is ever
                            in the memory! Farewell!" and he kissed her and held his finger under
                            her chin, "till we come again to settle down!"</p>
                        <p>He mounted, and they rode out, leaving tears running down Doña Manuela's
                            cheeks. When the door was closed she went in and stood up on the
                            window-sill from which Clarita had seen Vicente gallop up the street.
                            She watched them disappear, Doroteo sitting straight and handsome as
                            only Doroteo could be, and Pepa, the proud Pepa, staring away to the
                            front and the wild future in the warring southeast. It was then Donña
                            Manuela's doubts of Josefa Aranja were verified. The two were presently
                            gone, leaving the house and its swirls of red and green desolate, not
                            having so much as turned to wave a hand at her.</p>
                        <p>She did not blame him. Nay, she forgave him. How many times since the old
                            sacrifice at Jerusalem has the cleansing of sins been thus renewed, the
                            mother washing them away with blood from the very wounds that the son
                            inflicted! She turned back to the empty house and came at length to the
                            parlor, where the glazed bricks glistened and the broken pieces of the
                            crystal <hi rend="i">chirimoya</hi> still lay amidst the other shining
                            fruit. She stood in a dream.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-459" n="450"/>
                        <p>"He was never thus by nature," murmured she, pitifully. "Oh, Holy Mary,
                            thou dost know it was the woman who did it!"</p>
                        <p>And in that sweetly bitter thought the sins of Doroteo Quiroz were wiped
                            out.</p>
                        <p>The morning of the day previous to that of Quiroz's return to Tizapan a
                            straggling fleet of some twelve or fourteen <hi rend="i">canoas,</hi>
                            gathered not without trouble, went down the river amidst the waste of
                            green marsh, and issued on the lake. Those vessels contained the
                            remainder of Don Rodrigo's men, who sailed out in high spirits. Scarcely
                            was there one <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> from which did not float over the
                            dancing waves the tones of some Spanish love song, or the high and
                            plaintive falsetto of some weird Indian melody. The steady breeze of an
                            autumn day blew this company of sails ever toward the spot where, a dead
                            leaf in a sea, the island lay. The long morning and the longer afternoon
                            passed, the fleet neared the rocky shore in the early evening, and the
                            soldiers saw the prison walls standing gaunt against a sky of many
                            colors.</p>
                        <p>Clarita, sunk into yet greater grief, had spent the whole of the night
                            after the great failure lying on the ground outside the door of the
                            prison, wherein a securer cell had been selected for the captive, and a
                            constant guard placed over him. They would have allowed her to go in; in
                            the morning they besought her to enter. She could not. Rodrigo, nigh
                            crushed by her sorrow, held aloof; he would not break in on her
                            solitude, though she had given herself to him. The two, bound together
                            yet separated, were waiting for the governor's message, each with fear,
                            neither with hope.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-460" n="451"/>
                        <p>During the day the wind changed gradually to the southwest, finally to
                            the west, so that the approaching fleet, having come within a few
                            hundred yards of shore, could come no further. It was forced to anchor
                            where it was. The soldiers were thus compelled to remain in waiting <hi
                                rend="i">canoas</hi> till morning. But to one other vessel, a lonely
                            vessel from another direction, the change was advantageous. Chapala
                            lies, as has been said, on a cape. Between Mescala and the former town
                            the shore makes a turn, almost of a right angle, so that Chapala lies
                            west of the island, as Mescala lies north. The messengers returning with
                            the governor's reply perceived, at Mescala, that the more usual
                            southwest wind would likely prevail during the afternoon and night. They
                            therefore did not await the improbable north one. They skirted the
                            shore, leaving their <hi rend="i">canoa,</hi> and came, toward evening,
                            to Chapala. They secured there another vessel, and set sail for the
                            island. The wind changing and coming at length directly from the west,
                            and, as always, rising with the night, the journey was made with good
                            speed.</p>
                        <p>At nine o'clock that night Rodrigo, grown considerably calmer than he was
                            wont to be, his teeth shut and a grim determination forcing him on, came
                            to the prison doors where he had last seen Clarita. She was not there.
                            The guards told him she had gone away. He came again to the church. He
                            did not look at its stones, and he kept out of his mind by a mighty
                            effort the other scenes he had been a part of in it. He stared straight
                            before him, and strode in. She was kneeling again, a candle near her. He
                            came to her and spoke, standing over her and looking down. She started
                            up and turned an appealing face to him, reading his expression. She had
                            steeled herself for <pb id="VAA3931-461" n="452"/> this moment. It was
                            as though she held her every nerve with a desperate grasp. He said:</p>
                        <p>"The message has come. I will bear your sorrow with you &#151; I
                            must. You have given yourself to me. To hold aloof because I was the
                            unwilling cause, this will serve no longer. Clarita, I am come to be,
                            henceforth, always, regardless of the blot on me and rising above it,
                            the help that you need. I will take you away. I shall not let this grief
                            blast all your life. For him, there is no hope. The governor, in his
                            weakness grown for once by irritation strong, will not be moved. Come,
                            oh my heart! you, this I know, have forgiven me long since. I may have
                            done wrong &#151; I do not know &#151; I did the best I knew.
                            Will you come now and give me this grief of yours, as you gave me your
                            love, and let me, now that I can do no more, bear it for you?"</p>
                        <p>She came and bowed her head to his breast, and he held her.</p>
                        <p>"Go now," said he at last, "and speak to him."</p>
                        <p>She went out, slowly. The gray <hi rend="i">rebozo</hi> fell and lay in
                            the ruins. He picked it up and went out after her, going down to the
                            shore where he gave orders. He called a soldier, handed him the
                            governor's message, and turned over to him his own authority. He saw
                            that the <hi rend="i">canoa</hi> was ready. He returned and waited at
                            the prison door.</p>
                        <p>The girl, scarcely able to go, had crept in. The guards had let her pass
                            and she came to his cell. She turned bewildered at the door and stared
                            at the cactus and the walls. She tried to go in, but she fell against
                            the ruins and stood there with her face buried on her arms. She did not
                            know whether minutes or hours passed. At last she turned and entered.
                            Vicente was standing by the candle listening, as though <pb
                                id="VAA3931-462" n="453"/> he had heard her silent footstep. He saw
                            her appear, standing looking at him, agonized, her love for him going
                            out and drawing him. He sprang forward and caught her. He drew her to
                            the light and put back her hair from her face, at which he stared. He
                            read her message. He did not tremble or cry out. He heaved a deep sigh
                            and stroked her hair, and then smiled at her.</p>
                        <p>"I think you came to tell me there is no hope," said he.</p>
                        <p>She shuddered and sank more deeply in his arms.</p>
                        <p>"Look, Clarita &#151; to me it is not this great grief. Then to you
                            it shall not be. Do not weep. That which God brings is best. Death has
                            not any terror for me. This have I long seen coming. It was the destiny
                            prepared for me."</p>
                        <p>She clung to him, desperately, grief shaking her frame. She could not
                            look at him. She could not raise her face. She could scarcely hear him.
                            She must hold him &#151; hold him.</p>
                        <p>"I cannot go!" she cried in anguish.</p>
                        <p>He held her closer, pityingly, being stronger now than in all his unusual
                            course.</p>
                        <p>"You love Don Rodrigo," said he.</p>
                        <p>"He has given up," she said. "He did all to save us &#151; he is
                            going away."</p>
                        <p>He looked at her hair, in which the candle-light brought out gold. He
                            looked at her shaking shoulders and put his gentle hand on them. He drew
                            her up and kissed her many times.</p>
                        <p>"Then you, too, go," said he. "Death is nothing; faith and love, these
                            are all. And you have been these. This, your life, will light the way
                            for me to the end. Go in peace; grieve not. You have done all that you
                            could. Remember I met death with <pb id="VAA3931-463" n="454"/> calmness
                            and did not complain, because your faith had strengthened mine."</p>
                        <p>She would not go. She clung to him with a grip he could not loose. After
                            holding her long he tried to lead her to the door. She seemed
                            overwhelmed by the fear that he would make her leave him.</p>
                        <p>"I cannot!" cried she again, turning her face up to him. "So long as life
                            lasts I shall stay with you."</p>
                        <p>"Clarita, you must leave me, because I ask it. This is the last you can
                            do for me. If these sad times had not come, and I, still living with
                            you, had become ill and then died &#151; you would not have been
                            crushed by grief for that; you would have trusted God and gone on in the
                            world till a better time. Think of it thus now. You will walk out
                            to-night, leaving me because I pray you with my last prayers to do so.
                            It will be that you left me already dead, that I have gone before you.
                            You will not think of the death and the sorrow, nor of me as living
                            here. You will think only of the future."</p>
                        <p>She had ever obeyed him &#151; his wish had been unquestioned law. To
                            do so now was a new struggle. She only shook in his arms, unable to
                            obey.</p>
                        <p>"I have followed you always!" she cried.</p>
                        <p>"Heart of faith," said he, "this last gift I pray from you. You will not
                            refuse it. To stay would be only to blacken the end for me, whereas,
                            remembering you thus as having gone away when I wished, there will be
                            light. Go &#151; in my name and for your love of me. It is not
                            desertion of me. I know you would stay. It is my will. This is your
                            last, your most sacred duty. Go."</p>
                        <p>When she could realize it thus, she began to yield, but not till then. He
                            succeeded at last in getting <pb id="VAA3931-464" n="455"/> her away. He
                            gave no sign of the pain of that parting, he did not so much as flinch
                            at the wound. She staggered out, held by a guard, seeing nothing, unable
                            to go alone &#151; and she left in him a loneliness that seemed as
                            if it must of itself bring death.</p>
                        <p>She was caught up outside by Rodrigo, who carried her to the shore as
                            though she had been a child. He brought her into the vessel and gave
                            orders to the sailors. To do nothing but grieve over those events and
                            that end, to feel remorse and hate himself &#151; these were not
                            worthy of him. Let him bring all his emotion, now that he had done what
                            he could, to bear on caring for her. He turned his back upon the island
                            and the prison and the past. He faced the future with her.</p>
                        <p>He had arranged a bed on the boat's bottom where she might pass the
                            night. She lay there all the hours of the journey. He stood over her, or
                            strode to and fro, or scanned the horizon as the vessel sped on. He
                            rested not.</p>
                        <p>The island was sunk in the past blackness and the lake's northern shore
                            came near. The wind in the early morning brought them to Ocotlan.</p>
                        <p>She had recovered a little and they proceeded on horseback to
                            Guadalajara, where they were married. Rodrigo communicated with none of
                            his acquaintances, merely made the arrangements for departure. They took
                            passage in one of those great, old-style <hi rend="i">diligencias</hi>
                            that, drawn by eight mules, whirled them away over many stony roads to
                            the east and north. The nights were spent in inns, sometimes at towns,
                            sometimes in lonely places. They were transferred to other <hi rend="i"
                                >diligencias</hi> and the days were dusty and long. But his love
                            sustained her.</p>
                        <p>There came a sunlit morning when the sluggish <pb id="VAA3931-465"
                                n="456"/> waters of the sand-blocked Rio Grande rolled before them.
                            They walked to the shore and some rowers were coming toward them in a
                            boat. The high bank hid them and they were alone. He put his arms about
                            her and said:</p>
                        <p>"I have found all at last &#151; all. And for my many mistakes you
                            give me yourself as reward. Clarita, I am going to make you happy."</p>
                        <p>"You will," she said; "a little while longer and you will!"</p>
                        <p>The boat came and they entered and were rowed across. On the way the sun
                            came and glistened on her tresses.</p>
                        <p>"I think it was your hair," said he, "that won me first &#151; and
                            the dimples."</p>
                        <p>She looked at him and smiled for the first time, a sad smile. But the
                            dimples themselves had come again.</p>

                        <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
                        <p>ON the afternoon following the departure of Clarita, a lazy <hi rend="i"
                                >canoa</hi> dropped sail and floated to the sandy shore at Chapala,
                            poled by one very lean and tall man whose bare legs as he strained along
                            the boat's sides seemed of immoderate length, and by another man who was
                            shorter and who grunted as he strained. The boat came to anchor near
                            that portion of the beach where the lime-kilns stand at the rear of the
                            church. The two sat on the side, then, and swung their feet over the
                            water.</p>
                        <p>The long one made a movement as though to jump in and proceed to shore,
                            but grew of a sudden so very languid that he found the movement could
                            not be completed. He yawned and retied about his waist a green sash
                            which separated the white blouse of his shirt from the white rolls of
                            his trousers. He leaned against the thatch and let his eyes wander over
                            the town and the sides of St. Michael. The other sat beside him, held a
                            sandal up, and stared vacantly at it as though it needed something but
                            he had forgotten what it was that it needed. He too yawned. The color of
                            his sash was magenta. The two then sighed in harmony and, removing the
                            two high-peaked sombreros, let the breeze fan their faces. Apparently
                            the idea of disembarking must be given time to gain ground. There was a
                            great bulk sitting yonder on the sand with its back to a hut. It did <pb
                                id="VAA3931-467" n="458"/> not move. Anastasio's eyes had slowly
                            taken in the place of his nativity.</p>
                        <p>"The church towers are still the same," said Anastasio with sentiment,
                            moving the large toe of the left foot slowly back and forth.</p>
                        <p>The other assented only with silence.</p>
                        <p>"I see the <hi rend="i">salati</hi> is not changed," observed Francisco
                            after some minutes of the silence.</p>
                        <p>"The old place is doubtless lonesome," said Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"Run down," agreed Francisco.</p>
                        <p>They deemed it unnecessary to proceed further with this line of thought.
                            Later, when the languor seemed really to approach exhaustion, Anastasio
                            felt in his bosom and drew out a rag, which, being slowly untied,
                            displayed three copper cents. Anastasio appeared bored by the sight. He
                            put the rag and its contents back in his shirt. He perceived Francisco,
                            after some time, removing a rag likewise, and opening it. There were not
                            any cents at all in Francisco's rag. This sight seemed extremely
                            fatiguing to both.</p>
                        <p>"Francisco," began Anastasio, having looked long and dreamily into the
                            water.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="i">"Si,"</hi> said Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"There was something wrong with the spoils."</p>
                        <p>"It was in the book," said Francisco in irritation. "If what's in a book
                            is n't true, then," and he gave a large gesture with his hand as defying
                            anybody to answer so masterful an argument, "what in the devil is?"</p>
                        <p>"Is everything in books true?" queried Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>"Why," cried Francisco, some of his old excitement reappearing, "what
                            else would it <hi rend="i">be</hi> there for?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-468" n="459"/>
                        <p>This proved unanswerable and Anastasio sank into apathy, merely
                            observing:</p>
                        <p>"Anyhow, there was something wrong with the spoils."</p>
                        <p>"It was Fortino," said Francisco. "Fortino did n't know much history, nor
                            did he concentrate. The secret of history is concentration. Fortino
                            scattered himself &#151; I mean his mind. So the strategy got
                            him."</p>
                        <p>This not seeming particularly lucid, Anastasio let it pass. He observed
                            presently, however:</p>
                        <p>"It looks to me that he concentrated too much. He concentrated the whole
                            army. This is called good strategy."</p>
                        <p>"But I tell you, fool," cried Francisco, "that it is the mind. The mind
                            rules wars!"</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Pues, bien;</hi> let it go. Is your rag entirely empty,
                            brother?"</p>
                        <p>Francisco spread it out flat.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi>" said Anastasio, "there is nothing in it but your
                            honor. Wrap it up, wrap it up; you rode hard for it. Come, you and your
                            honor, you may live with me on my three coppers."</p>
                        <p>"Till the fish are drawn," assented Francisco.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi>" said Anastasio, "we will return to them. The fish
                            are more lucrative."</p>
                        <p>The great bulk yonder on the sand moved a little sluggishly, in the sun,
                            and his sombrero fell lower over his unseen face.</p>
                        <p>"Poor brother Fortino," muttered Anastasio to himself.</p>
                        <p>"<hi rend="i">Si,</hi>" said the other, "he failed to concentrate."</p>
                        <p>The afternoon advanced almost in silence. The small waves beat up
                            murmuringly on the yellow sand. The town slept on in its primitive
                            peace. The serried line of mountains cut their eternal jagged line <pb
                                id="VAA3931-469" n="460"/> against the sky's blue. A dove in the old
                                <hi rend="i">salati</hi> sent her mourning notes out over beach and
                            water and the song seemed the voice of nature. St. Michael lifted his
                            mass out of the town's very centre, and cactus and shrubs half hid his
                            rocky sternness. There was no sign, no thought of war. The place was
                            almost as it had been three hundred years ago.</p>
                        <p>The light on the eastern waters was suddenly intensified. The languid eye
                            of Anastasio and the alerter one of his companion perceived a dozen
                            sails or more, reflecting the sun's rays, glistening, dazzling, glide
                            one by one round the point of the cape from the east. The unwonted sight
                            moved Anastasio to curiosity, Francisco to wonder. The bulk by the wall
                            of the hut arose and stalked slowly, sombre, to and fro, its eyes
                            fastened on the ground. The fleet aroused the town, and men and women in
                            crowds appeared running from the streets to the beach. Brilliant
                            blankets and fluttering <hi rend="i">rebozos</hi> crowded the water's
                            edge. But there was no laughing, no noise. There was only awe.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this sudden arrival began to be whispered about. Already
                            the deed had been anticipated. Francisco leaped to the water, his brown,
                            dripping legs flashed through it, and he ran along the beach to the
                            largest crowd. Anastasio still reclined against the thatch. The last of
                            the sails came round the cape. The first vessel, the second, the third,
                            anchored at the beach. The sails one by one fell and were furled to
                            masts. The great Fortino strode yet, slowly, ponderously, to and fro
                            before the hut like one in whom restlessness gnaws the vitals. The
                            townspeople still came running. The first <hi rend="i">canoa</hi>
                            discharged its freight of soldiers. The second, too, gave forth its line
                            of men. The third and the fourth <pb id="VAA3931-470" n="461"/> did
                            likewise. The soldiers drew up in order on the beach, the evening sun
                            casting their shadows long across the sand. Fortino still strode yonder.
                            A lion, the fierce life crushed in him, strides thus to and fro in his
                            cage.</p>
                        <p>Only the last sail glistened on the lake's breast. It too fell and was
                            furled. The ship under it floated to the beach and the guard landed.
                            There was a double line of soldiers forming an alley, waiting for its
                            chief occupant. The crowd held a little aloof. Vicente came out and
                            stood on the beach. He was straight and fearless, but the sorrow in his
                            eyes struck deep into every heart. The soldiers marched, he in their
                            midst, into the main street and through the plaza, and the crowd,
                            straggling, followed him.</p>
                        <p>Fortino strode yet upon the shore. His face was dark. His hands were
                            clenched. His eyes were the eyes of despair. He would not look up. He
                            would not leave his beaten track.</p>
                        <p>Anastasio, having at length come to land, walked slowly, hesitatingly, to
                            the giant. The latter's back was toward him.</p>
                        <p>"Brother," said Anastasio.</p>
                        <p>Fortino turned and cast his dull eyes on him.</p>
                        <p>"Brother," said Anastasio with odd kindness, "you will still share the
                            fish with us &#151; no?"</p>
                        <p>The old red gleam appeared for an instant in Fortino's eyes.</p>
                        <p>"The fish &#151; the fish," muttered he. "<hi rend="i">Si</hi>
                            &#151; oh my God! We will share the fish. Fortino shall draw the net
                            till his last day come and his sun set forever. Pitiable is he that he
                            ever left. I will draw fish, and to him that buys of them let
                            wretchedness come. My food shall be ashes in my mouth. Let the air round
                            about me choke him who breathes it &#151; <pb id="VAA3931-471"
                                n="462"/> let the waters where I row turn to blood behind me. <hi
                                rend="i">Si</hi> &#151; fish &#151; fish &#151; this is
                            all. But I shall not fish up that which is sunk forever. And let that
                            which I draw, henceforth, wherever it be sold, or wherever it be eaten,
                            turn to poison."</p>
                        <p>He stalked away toward the hut, Anastasio following.</p>
                        <p>"No," muttered Anastasio after him; "this is not thus. Fortino, when I
                            taunted you in Tizapan &#151; this was an ill thing to do."</p>
                        <p>Fortino went on unhearing.</p>
                        <p>"An exceedingly ill thing, Fortino," said the long Anastasio,
                            plaintively.</p>
                        <p>Fortino went into the hut and lay down on the floor. Anastasio remained
                            outside and presently said, the sound penetrating the walls of
                            reeds:</p>
                        <p>"They will not be ashes or poison. Fortino, to your brethren, the fish
                            will still taste like fish."</p>
                        <p>Fortino heard not. He lay there for hours. He did not stir even when many
                            weapons were simultaneously discharged at a distance. After long days he
                            was, in the matter of deeds, like the old Fortino; but never so in
                            manner or in heart. He was silent, morose, till his death. He never left
                            the lake. He fished and ate and slept, and fished again, buried here; a
                            man of great faith in a world that needs faith; a man of honesty that,
                            like a rock that holds at bay the sea, no force under the sun of heaven
                            could have moved one jot &#151; in a world where honesty is all too
                            rare; a man, not without genius and the spirit of creation (though
                            dulled somewhat by ancestry and his time) &#151; in a world where
                            men devoid of both rule millions; a man of no selfishness &#151; in
                            a world that, ridden by selfishness, calls most anguish-stricken for
                            that very quality which he had.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3931-472" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA3931-5">

                        <p>The march of soldiers through the plaza had been prolonged beyond the
                            plaza. It came to the narrow, rocky street that leads up St. Michael.
                            They had taken the condemned one through the town's middle. He was not
                            crushed by coming death; he thought little of it, feared it not. He
                            thought most constantly of Clarita, thanking his God that he had been
                            able to prevail upon her to go. At least she, whom his soul loved, was
                            away from this. It was said of him about the town that never was there
                            seen in its poor streets a face so beautiful as his.</p>
                        <p>They led him straight up the steep and rugged hill, the crowd remaining
                            at its bottom. The example would be held high, in sight of all the
                            world, that revolutions might be no more. The climb was difficult and
                            wearying. But he never halted or seemed fatigued. It was rather that he
                            led them than that they led him. He was among the first, even the first.
                            He went up steadily, strongly, his eyes raised. Cactus and boulder and
                            shrub he saw not. He seemed to run to meet death, so that the soldiers
                            scarcely could follow. They emerged at last on the summit. He was
                            already there. He stood on the highest rock and swept that incomparable
                            scene with his eyes &#151; Chapala under him, its red-tiled roofs
                            lit by the setting sun; the cape and the lake's vast sweep beyond; the
                            island lying small and black in the water's middle; all the great bosom
                            of that inland sea casting up light to him; Tizapan invisible; blue
                            mountains rising in the eternal circle.</p>
                        <p>It was then that his last sorrow fell like a curtain on him. He gazed at
                            the sands of the beach and the row of tiny huts along it. He had lived
                            there in his only happy time. Before all this wild dream he had been
                            full of life there; he had had her, too, and <pb id="VAA3931-474"
                                n="464"/> the love of her; and there where the sun fell yellowest he
                            had played with her in the long evenings or on moonlit nights, in the
                            sand. It swept over him that there was the Eden from which some stern
                            power had driven them out. He passed his hand over his eyes and was
                            heard to say:</p>
                        <p>"That I might turn &#151; that I might retrace these steps and go
                            back &#151; my God! my God! then might I find the cherubim and the
                            flaming sword that turneth every way, and know at last where is the tree
                            of life."</p>
                        <p>They let him stand where he was, and, the arrangements made and the word
                            given, he was shot. It is the beautiful custom of the country to erect
                            crosses at places of blood. On St. Michael's stony head one may still
                            see the cross which marks the spot where he fell.</p>
