            <head>Why Was the Democratic Party in Indiana A Radical Party, 1865–1890?</head>

            <p>The money question was a live issue in Indiana frori 1866 to 1880, in 1868 it became a leading issue,
                    and in 1874, 1876, and 1878 it was the paramount issue. Its importance began to decline in 1880 and
                    by 1882 it was negligible. The Greenback party managed to taper out an existence in the state to
                    1886, but by 1884 it scarcely counted and by 1885 it had passed into history. By the 1890's
                    Indiana had definitely become an ally of the conservative East.</p>
            <p>Immediately following the close of the war, both Democratic and Republican parties were radical on
                    the money question. The state platforms of both parties stood against contraction and for the
                    payment of the debt in greenbacks. The Republican enthusiasm for soft money began to wane by 1870,
                    and by 1872 the party was inclined definitely toward conservatism. But in 1874 the Indiana
                    Republicans in Congress not only voted for but led the fight for the adoption of the Inflation Bill.
                    The Republican platform of that year was a straddle on the money question. The Republican members in
                    Congress voted for specie resumption in 1875, although the state platform of 1876 and the Republican
                    party press during the campaign of that year demanded repeal of the clause which fixed a definite
                    date for the beginning of resumption. The Indiana Republican members of Congress in 1878 stood for
                    the radical Bland Bill and for the Bland-Allison Bill, and even voted to override Hayes’
                    veto. This was the last manifestation of monetary radicalism on the part of the Republicans of
                    Indiana. Their platform of 1878 was ultraconservative, and in that year they accepted the Specie
                    Resumption Act without reservation.</p>
            <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-042-3-006"/>
            <p>It will be seen, then, that the Republican party was headed for conservatism as early as 1870, but
                    that a temporary intensifying of agrarian hard times forced the party into more or less radical
                    positions at various times from 1870 to 1878. On the whole, the votes of the Indiana Republican
                    members in Congress were more radical than the party's state platform declarations. This is
                    a situation almost unique in political history—a party more radical in action than in
                    promises. The Republican party contained a considerable radical money element at least down to 1880.</p>
            <p>The Democrats were radical on the money question in 1868 and continued to be so down to 1880, and, in
                    that year and after, the party was conservative only because the inflation agitation was over and
                    there was no radical money movement in the country to which the party could attach itself. The
                    Democrats stressed the money question in 1868 and continued to do so down to and including the
                    campaign of 1878, with the single exception of 1872!, when the party unwisely abandoned economic
                    issues for the political reforms advocated by the Liberal Republicans. The platforms of 1874 and
                    1878 were extremely radical, and differed little from Greenback declarations. The platform of 1876
                    was predominantly radical, and the party that year was ardently inflationist. Indiana Democrats in
                    Congress stood against the Specie Resumption Act, supported the original Bland Bill, and voted to
                    pass the Bland-Allison Act over the Hayes veto. In both pronouncement and performance the Democratic
                    party of this era was radical on the money question.</p>
            <p>Both parties contained minorities which opposed the prevailing tendencies of their respective
                    organizations. The Republicans contained a minority who opposed the conservative trend of their
                    party. Oliver P. Morton, whose personal influence over his party was well-nigh overwhelming, managed
                    to keep his party fairly liberal until his death in 1877, and there were those who attempted to
                    continue his policy after that time. Tn the Democratic party a powerful minority led by such able
                    leaders as McDonald, Kerr, and English attempted to keep the party in the conservative path, but
                    without much success.</p>
            <p>When the prevailing economic distress became temporarily more intense the Republicans would become
                    less conservative and the Democrats more radical. When the <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-042-3-007"/>
                    prevailing economic distress was less intense, the Republicans would become more conservative and
                    the Democrats less radical. The position of the parties on the money question was a trustworthy
                    barometer of economic conditions.</p>
            <p>The positions taken by public men on the money question were not always consistent. Morton voted for
                    the Specie Resumption Act in 1875, although his record up to that time had been constantly and
                    vigorously radical. Pratt likewise violated his past record when he voted for the Specie Resumption
                    Act. So did Orth. McDonald, honest as he was in his conservatism, voted for the amended
                    Bland-Allison Act, and back in the National Democratic Convention of 1868 he was the Indiana member
                    of the resolutions committee, the committee that wrote the radical national platform of that year.
                    Apparently, he did not dissent. The unstable position of Hendricks on the money question has often
                    been pointed out. Harrison was consistently conservative, but had he been in a public position in
                    the seventies it would not have been so easy for him to have maintained such a record. Kerr and
                    English never faltered in their conservatism. Voorhees and Turpie never swerved from inflationist
                    convictions, and the former was ardently radical. But these men are the exceptions. Among the lesser
                    leaders the records are even less unifying than among the more important. The insistent tug of party
                    loyalty, a temporary change in economic conditions, and a fleeting shift in public sentiment are
                    among the factors which explain the changes in the public attitude of politicians. Many had no
                    convictions on the subject of money. Still others did not understand it.</p>
            <p>A man's attitude on the financial issues was not the only criterion by which he was judged
                    in the seventies. When one isolates a topic from the completed story and develops it, he is likely
                    to overemphasize it at the expense of other topics and other factors. A radical legislature sent the
                    conservative McDonald to the Senate in 1875, a comparatively conservative legislature returned
                    Voorhees to the Senate in 1885, and a radical Democratic district sent Kerr to Congress in 1874. Men
                    never entirely subordinate the personal element to economic interests, even when economic issues are
                    uppermost in the political discussions of the day. And there is always present an interplay of
                    issues, no one candidate epitomizing and harmonizing all the views of the men who vote for him.</p>
            <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-042-3-008"/>
            <p>What were the reasons for the agrarian radicalism of Indiana in the 1870's? These
                    are to be found largely in the economic and social conditions prevailing in the state at that time.
                    Indiana was predominantly agrarian in 1870. The total population, excluding children under the age
                    of ten, was 1,197,936. There were 459,369 persons engaged in gainful occupations, and of these
                    266,777 were engaged in agriculture. Only 76,057 were then occupied in the manufacturing and mining
                    industries, some 80,000 were to be found offering professional and personal services, while a meager
                    36,517 were employed in trade and transportation. There were no really large cities in the state. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> boasted a mere 48,244. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> contained 21,830 inhabitants, Fort <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The census of 1880 again emphasizes the dominance of agriculture. Out of a population ten
                    year's or older of 1,468,-095 inhabitants, there were 635,080 engaged in earning a living,
                    and of this latter total agriculture claimed 331,240. There were 137,281 offering personal and
                    professional services, 110,127 working in the manufacturing and mining industries, and 56,432
                    employed in trade and transportation. Even in 1880, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> possessed a population — of only 75,056, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> of 29,280, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> of 26,042.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the entire state there were in 1870 but 11,847 factories and only 58,852 factory hands. The
                    capital invested in manufacturing totaled $52,052,425, the value of the manufactured
                    products $108,617,278, and the wages paid $18,-366,780. On the other hand, the
                    total capital invested in agriculture amounted to $652,480,780, and the total value of
                    agricultural products reached $122,914,802.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> It is highly
                    significant, however, that the $52,052,423 invested in manufacturing yielded products
                    valued at $108,617,218, while the 8652,480,780 invested in agriculture, more than twelve
                    times that invested in manufacturing, rendered only $122,914,302. The difference between
                    the total valuation of the products of each was only $14,297,024, while the difference in

                    allowance should be made for the food livelihoods made by the farmers, and these livelihoods do not
                    appear in the census figure. Even so, money invested in agriculture seems to have earned
                    considerably less than the same amount invested in manufacturing.</p>
            <p>Statistics for 1880 reveal practically the same conditions. There were only 11,198 manufacturing
                    establishments in the state in that year, a slight decrease below the number of 1870, due to the
                    then prevalent tendency to consolidation. The capital invested in manufacturing represented
                    $65,742,-962; more than 62,000 wage earners were employed; the total wage paid was
                    $21,960,888; and the entire manufactured production was valued at
                    $148,006,411. The capital invested in agriculture amounted to $655,713,099,
                    and the total value of farm production was $114,707,082.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The
                    disparity between agriculture and industry in the amount invested and the financial return thereon
                    is even more striking in 1880 than it was in 1870. The comparatively meager amount invested in
                    industry was actually bringing in more financial returns than the comparatively large amount
                    invested in agriculture. The peculiarly privileged position of manufacturing is still more enhanced
                    when it is revealed that the figures for the total amount invested in agriculture do not include
                    capital invested in livestock, while the figures representing capital invested in manufacturing
                    include every conceivable factor of investment. As pointed out before, however, allowance must be
                    made for the food livelihoods of farmers, which allowances do not appear in the census figures.</p>
            <p>During the Civil War, the farmers in Indiana, like those elsewhere, had enjoyed a phenomenal
                    prosperity. The average price received in Indiana for corn in 1864 was ninety-five and one-half
                    cents a bushel, while wheat had soared to $1.75. Corn had dropped to sixty-five cents in
                    1867, but wheat had rocketed to $2.21. The boom was over by 1868. Corn had taken a
                    further slump and the average price per bushel received that year was only fifty-two cents, while
                    wheat had gone down to $1.50. Corn rallied to seventy cents in 1869, but wheat went down
                    to ninety-three cents. Corn fell to <list type="footnotes">

                    climbed to an average of $1.26. Corn declined to twenty-nine cents in 1872 and wheat

            <p>It will be noted that by 1868 corn arid wheat had both registered a decline, Corn declined to
                    unprecedented prices during the years from 1870 to 1873, so that these years constitute the lean
                    time of the Indiana corn grower. Wheat rallied after the depression of 1868, but declined in 1873,
                    and did not again reach the 1872 level of $1.32; during the period under consideration.
                    Corn went up to fifty-one cents in 1874, the year of particularly hard times for the wheat grower,
                    but went down to thirty-nine cents in 1875, never again to reach the 1874 level during the decades
                    of the seventies and eighties except in the single year 1881 when the average price received for
                    corn in Indiana was sixty cents.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>It is significant, then, to note that the depression of 1868–1869 was followed by a
                    partial recovery of agricultural prosperity, that both corn and wheat rallied, but not
                    simultaneously, so that the corn grower suffered a lean year while the wheat grower enjoyed a
                    temporary and comparative prosperity, and vice-versa. But after the depression of
                    1873–1874 the distress was continueus, and all agricultural producers suffered a loss. To
                    be sure, there were years of relative prosperity, and years when the general depression was
                    comparatively even more severe. Wheat fell as low as eighty-one cents in 1878, and hit bottom at
                    sixty-seven cents in 1884. <list type="footnotes">

                    abortive. Corn hit bottom at twenty-seven cents in 1878 and staged a temporary rally in 1881, going
                    up to sixty cents.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The years 1879–1881 were tantalizing in that they
                    seemed to prophesy a return to general prosperity, but the revival was ephemeral. There was a slight
                    variation in the condition of producers of different agricultural products, and there was some
                    fluctuation from year to year in the prices of one product, but as a general condition the hard
                    times were continuous. Indiana was above all else a corn producing state and there is a marked
                    connection between the price of corn and the existence or non-existence of agrarian radicalism in
                    Indiana politics in the 1870's and 1880's.</p>
            <p>The corn producers of Indiana received $70,941,567 in 1864, for 74,284,363 bushels of
                    corn, which represented the yield of 2,561,529 acres. Six years later, 113,150,000 bushels of corn,
                    representing the yield of 2,864,556 acres, rendered the corn producers only $42,997,000.
                    The crop yield and the acreage increased, but the financial returns were actually less than they had
                    been in 1864. Similarly, 138,252,000 bushels of corn were produced on 4,215,000 acres of land in
                    1878, and the total yield of the crop in money value was onlr $37,328,040. The acreage
                    was almost double that of 1864, and the total yield was more than double, but the value of the crop
                    was approximately one-half what it had been in that year. Even in 1881, the one year approaching the
                    old-time agrarian prosperity, the 79,618,000 aggregate yield of corn on 3,657,800 acres brought
                    financial returns amounting to only $47,777,800. Even if one takes as a basis for
                    comparison the figures of 1884, which was an average year for corn in these decades of depression,
                    he will find that 104,757,000 bushels, representing the yield of 3,612,312 acres, brought a
                    financial return of only $35,617,380.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    for 22,321,-376 bushels of wheat which were raised on 1,594,384 acres. Ten years later, 23,331,000
                    bushels of wheat raised on 1,912,-377 acres of land yielded only $21,931,140. The value
                    of the crop had fallen off by almost one-half, although its size was slightly larger. In 1878, a
                    particularly bad year for the wheat grower, 33,136,000 bushels of wheat, representing 2,071,000
                    acres of land, brought only $26,840,160 in money. The, crop and the acreage had been
                    increased by one-half and one-third over the 1864 totals, but the aggregate pecuniary return was cut
                    down by about one-third. In 1884, another very bad year, 33,745,000 bushels of wheat, representing
                    the entire yield of 2,708,016 acres of land, resulted in a total crop valuation of only
                    $22,609,150. The crop and the acreage had been increased over the 1878 figures, but the
                    total money yield was even less than it had been in 1878. In 1883, an average year in these decades
                    of depression, 28,447,800 bushels of wheat, representing the output of 2,535,370 acres, yielded in

                    and his output, but the consequent rise in supply only resulted in further declines in price and a
                    decrease in his annual money income.</p>
            <p>Land values declined enormously. In 1870 there were 10,104,279 acres of improved farm land in

                    all farm land was $634,804,189. In 1880 the unimproved farm land had dwindled to
                    6,487,245 acres, while the improved farm land had increased to 13,933,-738 acres. Thus between 1870
                    and 1880 more than two million acres had been added to the farm land of the state, while more than
                    three million of the farm acres had been improved and put under cultivation. Yet the total valuation

                    communities, and that in the more remote and less wealthy counties they were considerably over the
                    average for the state. Even as late as 1889, when the average rate of interest for the whole state
                    was down to 6.33 per cent, the average rate of mortgage interest in Crawford, a poor agricultural

                    value low, the size of the farms restricted, and the farms tilled by their impecunious owners the
                    Democrats were usually in the majority.</p>
            <p>Why did the Republicans become conservative? Because their strength came from the wealthy
                    counties. Their citadel of strength consisted in the populous and rich counties of the central
                        plain.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> These counties of the northwest were comparatively new. They were
                    in the process of development. The population was rather sparse and the land was not developed to a
                    point where land values correlated with the true fertility of this region's soil.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> But the farms were large, the capital wealth was very high, and about
                    one-fourth of the soil was tilled by prosperous tenants. In 1870 the per capita wealth in Porter was
                    $1,063; in <placeName>

                    </placeName> County was only $1,042. This northwest region was Republican from the first,
                    and as its soil came more and more under cultivation and after the industrial development of the
                    Calumet region took place in Lake and Porter, its Republicanism was intensified.</p>

                    following the Civil War. The soil of the four counties to the west was richer; it was owned in large
                    tracts by wealthy landowners; the per capita wealth was high. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and Starke on the other hand, the soil was poorer; it was owned in smaller plots and
                    by struggling farmers. The average per capita wealth was lower by from two hundred to three hundred
                    and ever four hundred per cent. In Starke the average per capita wealth was $308; in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> it was $1,424. These figures represent the two extremes. In this connection
                    it is interesting to note that White County, which belonged to the eastern group economically, threw
                    in its political lot with the western group, just as Jay County in the central plain was a poor
                    county which usually went Republican.</p>
            <p>The Republican strength, then, came from the wealthy counties, the counties of large farms, and from
                    those where there was a tendency to a higher percentage of tenantry. Politically, this likeness in
                    economic condition expressed itself in a sectional alliance of the central plain with the northwest.</p>
            <p>The conservative position of the national Republican administrations was a force always tending to
                    make the Republican party in Indiana conservative, but the fact that the party in Indiana drew its
                    strength from the wealthier elements in the state made its assumption of the conservative position
                    much easier. The Democratic party of Indiana in the seventies was more radical than the national
                    organization. The roots of its radicalism extended down to the small struggling farmers in the poor
                    sections of the state, the farmers who had a hard enough time in the prosperous years, and who found
                    the lean years intolerable.</p>
            <p>The Greenback party never came close to carrying Indiana. Except in coalition with the Democrats,
                    that party never carried a single county of the state in the whole decade of its existence. It
                    polled in 1874 a vote of ten per cent or more in twenty counties, some wealthy and some poor, some
                    Republican and some Democratic.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The party ran second in Black ford,

                    effective political organization.</p>
            <p>The truth is that there was no need of a third party in Indiana. Unlike overwhelmingly Republican
                    states as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>, <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName>, and the
                    Dakotas, Indiana was a state with two strong major lbarties, and a third party was not the necessary
                    and inevitable creation of a suffering people groping for an instrument with which to express
                    opposition. The Democratic party was the natural party of opposition and was radical enough to give
                    the discontented a means of expressing their unrest. The Greenback party did serve a purpose,
                    however. It was a creator of original programs; a maker of new ideas. The Indiana Plan was adopted
                    by the Indiana Democracy as well as by the national Greenback party, and it is perhaps one of the
                    cleverest and safest soft-money schemes ever devised.</p>
            <p>What accounts for the success of the Democratic party in 1870, 1872, 1874, 1876, 1878, 1882, and
                    1884? Undoubtedly, economic discontent was the chief factor. But the Democratic party
                    made a bid for the wet vote, and it was the combination of liquor and inflation which explains the
                    victories of the seventies. Democracy made a bid to the cities with its wet planks. Republicanism
                    made a bid to the cities with its appeal to the manufacturing and industrial interests. And
                    Democracy won. The Republicans usually won some thirteen counties which had over a half million
                    dollars invested in manufacturing in 1880, while the Democrats usually carried some fourteen
                    counties with similar investments.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>Besides appealing to the urban population, the liquor issue appealed to the Catholic and foreign,
                    especially German, voter. But many of these lived in the cities and have thus already been accounted
                    for. The Democrats carried the rural counties where these elements constituted numerous parts of the
                    population. But as these counties were for the most part poor counties, with Democratic leanings,
                    they probably would have been carried anyway.</p>
            <p>Of the forty-three counties containing the heaviest foreign-born population only eleven were
                    definitely Republican while twenty-seven were definitely Democratic. Of the thirty-five counties
                    possessing the heaviest German population only seven were definitely Republican while twenty-four
                    were definitely Democratic. Of the thirty-three counties having the heaviest Catholic population
                    only four can be set down as Republican while twenty-two can be set down as normally Democratic. In
                    the central plain there were fewer foreign-born and here the Protestant sects were strong,
                    particularly Methodism. The Republicans, with their tendencies to temperance, drew heavily from the
                    Methodists and the Baptists.</p>
            <p>The Democrats made no demagogic nor unnatural appeal to the poor, the discontented, and the wets. In
                    1868 their party already was composed of the poor counties, and contained large foreign, German, and
                    Catholic elements. Thus composed, it naturally espoused the causes which appealed to <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-042-3-026"/> its own people. A party becomes what it is because of the constituent
                    elements which combine to make it up. In the seventies the Democrats welded liquor and inflation
                    into a winning issue, carrying the poor counties (and a majority of the urban communities. This
                    victorious alliance was neither unnatural nor unholy: the Democratic party merely adjusted its
                    policies and its creed to the interests and predilections of the people who composed it.</p>
            <p>After 1880 the industrial development of Indiana was more rapid. Of the 724,058 people in the state
                    engaged in occupations in 1890, 330,569 were engaged in agriculture; 161,637 were offering personal
                    and professional services; 139,-508 were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits; and
                    92,344 were employed in trade and transportation. Far less than half of the population of the state
                    was engaged in agriculture. Cities were growing rapidly. <placeName>

                    $131,605,366, the number of manufacturing establishments had increased to 12,354, the net
                    value of the manufactured products was $96,705,976, the number employed in factories was
                    124,349, and the total yearly wages paid amounted to $51,749,976.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From 1886 to 1900 the "Natural Gas Craze" existed in ten counties, and factories
                    were drawn by the prospects of cheap fuel.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The amount of coal mined in the
                    state jumped from 1,996,490 tons in 1880 to 4,068,124 tons in 1896.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The
                    capital invested in manufacturing rose to $234,481,528 in 1900. The number of wage
                    earners in that year increased to 155,956. It is significant that the greatest industrial
                    development in the state was taking place in the central plain land in the northwest, Republican
                    sections, increasing their population and their wealth. On the other hand, industry in the southern
                    section was not growing so rapidly, and the industrial center at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> had actually declined. These facts help explain why Indiana did not respond effectively
                    to the agrarian crusade of the 1890's.</p>

            <p>German newspapers were first published in the East, and as the Germans migrated west, German
                    newspapers began to appear in other sections. The type used for many of them did not appeal to the
                    eye, and a number of them were written in a corrupted German. Among the first to appear was the <hi rend="i">Philadeldphische Zeitung</hi> published by Benjamin <placeName>

                    the paper began on June 24, 1732. It was issued every other week for five shillings per year. <hi rend="i">Der Hoch Deutsche Pennsylvanische Geschicht Schreiber</hi> was established in America

                            </placeName> is too obvious to require an elaborate argument. The rich and fertile lands of
                            this county, teeming with nature's most valuable productions; the vast array of
                            laborious and successful agriculturalists spiread over its entire surface; the immense beds

                            a high place among the best counties of our rich and prosperous State. The agricultural
                            interests of Dubois are annually assuming more importance; its population is rapidly
                            increasing; its political influence is sensibly advancing, and consequently it is of the
                            highest importance that those interests, and the general wants of our citizens, should be
                            kept prominently and constantly before the country. To accomplish this end no means that can

                    Saturday, May 11, 1867. It was a four-page, five-column paper, and the price was $1.50
                    per year. The first number contained several statements as to its policy. First, it was hoped that
                    no German would find the price beyond his means; second, that if the Germans did not support the
                    paper they would be degraded in the eyes of the Americans in the county; and third, that the paper
                    would not affiliate with any political party.</p>
            <p>The first editor and operator of the paper was E. Reininghaus, a native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, who had learned the printer's trade in that country. E. Pickhardt, a pioneer
                    merchant, financed the paper for his nephew in part by getting a number of businessmen to loan him
                    ten dollars each. He gave them notes for the loan and later redeemed the notes with advertising and
                    printing. A year after the paper began its publication, it was suspended, apparently, because it had
                    not received sufficient support. In the fall of that year, Pickhardt made an attempt to revive the
                    paper because a prominent Democrat promised to get six hundred subscribers for the paper provided it
                    would sponsor the principles of the Democratic party. The paper was revived in September of 1868
                    under the title of the Huiitingburgh <hi rend="i">Demokrat</hi>. Since the Democrat failed to make

                    with the first issue in January as volume 2, number 1, ignoring the six issues published under the

                    making it a nine-column paper. The paper was enlarged to eight pages with six columns on December
                    26, 1895. Both English and German advertisements appeared in the paper, but all other reading matter
                    was printed in German. Some of the advertisements which were unusual and very clever appeared in the

            <p>The paper began its publication in English on May 1, 1914. The change in languages apparently was
                    purely a business move. Pickhardt planned to install a typesetting machine, the first in the county,
                    and he — was well aware of the fact that eventually he would need to buy English mats,
                    and, therefore, he did not deem it available to invest in German mats which would be discarded in
                    the near future. It was, no doubt, also difficult to get German printers. The paper was leased to
                    Elmer Katter on July 1, 1933, for six months with the privilege of buying the business any time
                    during the life of the lease. Katter discovered that the business met his anticipations and
                    concluded it would be more economical to own the business and move it to his own building, and on
                    October 16, 1933, he became the owner of the paper.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Before mentioning the part the Germans played in politics, it may be well to state that there was
                    considerable friction in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> between the "Grays" as those Germans were called who came before
                    1848, and the "Greens" those who came after 1848. There were times when it was
                    advisable for a member of either group not to appear alone in a locality as his opponents might
                    descend upon him. Occasionally, they went so far as to engage in a hand to fist fight. There were a
                    number of radical reformers and revolutionists among the "Forty-eighters" who were
                    determined to make the world over. The native Americans were also disgusted with them and referred
                    to them as greenhorns, revolutionists, and blasphemers.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most of the "Grays" had affiliated with the Democratic party, but those
                    "Greens" whose views were too radical and who did not care to unite with this
                    party floundered around for some time. The abolitionists expressed the views of this group on the
                    slavery question, but the religious zeal of the former was frowned upon by the
                    "Greens." They saw no future in the Free Soil party and, therefore, had no desire
                    to be identified with it. So far as the Whig party of 1852 was concerned, it did not appeal to them
                    because it was no more out spoken on the, antislavery question than the Demo <list type="footnotes">

                    president, had a record which was distasteful to the Germans.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> A few, however,
                    did unite with the Whip party and consequently, the Whig newspapers made every attempt to secure the
                    German vote. The Whigs made an effort to attract the German vote through their paper <hi rend="i">Der Deutsche Republicaner</hi> published at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thousands of these copies were distributed free among the Germans in Indiana. A German

                    </placeName> in the hope that this party might induce the Germans to vote for the Democrats. Both
                    parties were discouraged because the Germans refused to become excited.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                    Because the Germans had been oppressed by their governments and the nobility, the very word
                    Democracy appealed to them. This may account for the fact that the "Grays"
                    identified themselves with the Democratic party. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> when there was a movement on foot to teach German in the public schools, the Whigs
                    opposed it and the Democrats favored it. The economic principles of the Whig party did not appeal to
                    the Germans because such principles were held to be in favor of the land speculator, merchant,
                    banker, and manufacturer. The Democratic party, on the other hand, claimed to be the party of the
                    people. Their interests lay more with the workingman, the farmer, and the settler in the West. The
                    Germans believed that no more true friend for the immigrant could be found than the Democratic
                    party. It was said that the Democrats were able to maintain control of the government because so
                    many immigrants identified themselves with this party.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The slavery problem which raised new issues in all parties in the fifties made some Germans question
                    their political allegiance. Because the Democratic party was so closely allied with the slave
                    interests many Germans began to waver, and upon the arrival of the
                    "Forty-eighters," the first thread was broken in the allegiance of the Germans to
                    the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Republicans began their organization in 1854, a large number of
                    "Forty-eighters" identified themselves with this party. Now the struggle between
                    the "Grays" and the "Greens" was again renewed since the former
                    supported the Democratic party. Although a large number of Germans had become Democrats, they were
                    opposed to the repeal of the <placeName>

                    favored it. Some Germans hesitated to join the ranks of the Republicans because the Puritans and
                    Know-Nothings had united with the party. Because the "Forty-eighters" identified
                    themselves with the Republican party and were bitter enemies of the Catholics, the latter usually
                    remained true to the Democratic party. The Republican party was denounced by the Catholic <hi rend="i">Seebote</hi> as a party composed of "Temperance men, abolitionists, haters of

            <p>The Germans not only opposed slavery, but also the greenback and silver craze. A large number of them
                    advocated civil service reform and wanted to see an end put to the radical program of reconstruction
                    in the South. Some Germans shifted their politics from time to time, which would seem to indicate

            <p>Ferdinand has always been Democratic. This may be explained by the hostile attitude of the old Whigs
                    as well as the new Republicans towards immigrants and Catholics. The Whig party was influenced by
                    the Know-Nothing and similar groups which opposed immigration and Catholics. For the European
                    immigrants the principles of government which the Democratic party favored had more of an
                    attraction. Father Kundek was a loyal Democrat and his colonists followed in his footsteps in their
                    choice of a political party. He also impressed upon them the need of their remaining together
                    whenever their interests were concerned and not permit scheming politicians to win their votes. He

            <p>The day following the presidential election of 1888, the returns were brought from St. Meinrad, also
                    a Democratic center in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, to the county seat. When the inspector arrived he was informed that since the
                    Democratic party had lost by a large majority, it would not be necessary to take care of his
                    ballots. No doubt, somewhat surprised he replied: "Has the vote from Ferdinand Township
                    been heard from?" He seemed to be confident of the fact that the combined vote
                    of Ferdinand and St. Meinrad could bring a victory in the national election to the Democratic party.
                    So far as Father Kundek was concerned politics meant the management of public affairs, and even
                    though politicians might claim religion did not belong there, he felt it did. He was further of the
                    opinion that the principles of the Democratic party served the interests of the public in the most
                    satisfactory manner.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>When the old log courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1839, a new building had to be constructed. The
                    money was appropriated and a contractor engaged. After the foundation had been completed the work
                    ceased, and for some time the partially constructed building stood, no credit either to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Since Father Kundek could no longer endure the view, he consulted with men of
                    experience who were willing to do the work for a reasonable sum under his management. He then filed
                    a petition with the board of county commissioners to permit him to complete the building which he
                    agreed to do by December. 1, 1845. The contract was accordingly awarded to Father Kundek on December
                    3, 1844. Father Kundek was also appointed to the board of school examiners of <placeName>

                    him for the addition of German books to county libraries in areas where a sufficient number of
                    Germans would warrant the expense. He also advocated that a longer period of residence should be
                    required of foreigners before permitting them the privilege of voting, doubtless with the view that
                    the new citizens should be better acquainted with American ideals before casting their ballots. It
                    is possible that Kempf was influential in the act which was approved on March 5, 1859, to provide
                    for the printing and binding of two thousand copies of the Indiana Laws passed at the special
                    session of the General Assembly in 1858, and at the regular session in 1859, in the German language,

            <p>The fact cannot be overlooked that the Germans made a real contribution in the Civil War. From the
                    statistical study made by B. A. Gould, it appears that 176,817 men born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> volunteered in the great war. This study also indicated that there were 75,000
                    foreigners whose nativity was not known, and it may be assumed that a large proportion of this
                    number was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Gould compiled another table in which he indicated the contribution each nationality

                    176,817. This may in part be accounted for by the fact that among the German immigrants a large
                    percentage were young men of military age. Then too, bounties were made so attractive that it was
                    financially. worth while to enlist. Recruiting officers met immigrants as they arrived and persuaded
                    them to volunteer for military service. Some, however, were approached to volunteer while on the

            <p>Europeans, however, were accused of desertions. It was said that the large bounties attracted them
                    and after desertion they would enlist again for another bounty. Cognizance, however, must be taken
                    of the fact that the immigrants were not familiar with the regulations governing enlistment and
                    discharge in the army. No doubt, the Germans had an even greater handicap because of their language.
                    The localities where the most desertions occurred were in the Eastern manufacturing states. Since
                    the states that had the largest number of German volunteers were in the Middle West, it would be
                    unfair to place too much blame for the desertions on this group.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The interest of the foreigners can readily be seen by the number who responded to the call of the

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area could be recruited. An act which is indicative of their interest was displayed by
                    the fact that the ships, the "Bavaria" and the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bremen</settlement>

                    very valuable to the North in view of the fact that the Confederates had the advantage of having

                    themselves with the Republicans when they began their organization in 1854. Southerners and German

            <p>Stories of the monster did flourish. It became the subject of a rather remarkable ode and the object
                    of a public meeting. Its horrific likeness was portrayed in the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> at
                    half-column length. It became a last survivor of the prehistoric mammoth. Plans were made for
                    sending out a "scientific expedition" to sound Lake Manitou and to haul the
                    creature from the deeps by means of a large boat and rafts as a martyr to learning. It was declared
                    to live in Bass Lake, where bones of its former companions still strewed the bank; it swam by vast
                    subterranean passages to Lake Maxinkuckee. All in all, the articles are a curious compound made up
                    in nearly equal proportions of the legends of the Potawatomi who were being removed from the state

                        that the Indians could remain for two years. There were clashes in August, 1838, between the

            <p>As this brief summary suggests, the accounts of the Indiana monster grew rapidly to something more
                    than the proportions of a common "snake" story. By September 15, 1838, the time of
                    the last article, they had become a good deal more; they had expanded to include much of what <placeName>

                    Potawatomi left the state. By means of these accounts, we can recapture something of the outlook of
                    our forefathers upon their have, but slightly puzzling, new world.</p>

                    Dillon who wrote the three articles signed "A Visitor to the Lake." I assume that
                    these articles were written by an editor of the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> because the second

                    colleague, Hyacinth Lasselle, Jr., seems the probable author not only because he was apparently the
                    principal editor but also because he displays elsewhere a command of phrasing, vocabulary, and
                    information equal to that exhibited in the articles, whereas Lasselle's contributions,
                    where they can be identified, do not rise above good journeywork.</p>
            <p>John Brown Dillon was, of course, to become in, later years the noted historian whose <hi rend="i">A

                    is little suggestion of the spirit of playfulness that is evident in the articles of "A

                    <p rend="center">THE DEVIL'S LAKE.</p>
                    <p>In the northern portion of Indiana there are many beautiful little lakes which give great
                        interest to a country somewhat open. About twenty-five miles from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                        </placeName>, and in the vicinity of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                        </placeName>, there is one of these lakes about two miles in length, half a mile in width, and
                        of unknown depth. Soundings were once tried with a line of thirteen fathoms, but with no effect.</p>
                    <p>There is an ancient tradition of the Pottawattimie Indians relative to this lake, which has been
                        handed down from generation to generation, and is now received by the white man with confirmed
                        credence. The precise time at which the tradition was first received among the Indians cannot be
                        determined—probably not a long time after the emigration of the Pottawattamies across
                        the "hard waters" of the north, some centuries since, to this district of
                        country, which was then occupied by the Miamies, by whose grant the Pottawattamies became
                        possessed of the lands which they have held north of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                        </placeName>. It appears that the tradition does not owe its origin to the superstitious fears
                        of the red men; but that some gigantic creature inhabited the lake, and does at the present
                        time, is beyond the probability of doubt.</p>
                    <p>This lake is called by the Indians "Lake Man-i-toe," or the Devil's
                        Lake; and such is the terror in which it is held, that but few Indians would even dare to
                        venture in a canoe upon its surface. The Indians will neither fish no bathe in the lake; such is
                        the powerful conviction that "man-i-too" or the Evil Spirit, dwells in its
                        chrystal waters. It may elicit a smile from the incredulous to assert gravely the fact that some
                        very extraordinary creature claims monarchy of this beautiful lake. But the existence of a
                        monster in this lake is not an object of more surprise to us than the remains of the Mastadon,
                        whose teeth measures 18 inches—and which were found but two miles from town, <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-042-3-052"/> in prairie through which the canal runs. Were there not
                        assurances from men entitled to credibil[i]ty that a monster has been seen within a few days in
                        the lake Man-i-too, it might be supposed the strange story originated in the superstitutious
                        fears of the Aborigines.</p>
                    <p>When the Pottawattamie Mills were erecting some ten years since, at what is called the out-let of
                        the lake,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> the monster was seen by men known to Gen. Milroy,<hi rend="sup">14</hi> under whose direction the Mills, I believe, were erected. There are persons in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                        </placeName> who questioned closely those who lately saw the myterious occupant of the lake, and
                        are now convinced of this tradtion of Man-i-too being founded upon something more substantial
                        than the basis of fish and snake stories generally.</p>
                    <p>But two weeks since some men by the name of Robinson were fishing in the lake, when they beheld
                        with surprise the even surface of the water ruffled by something swimming rapidly, and which
                        they suppose must have measured sixty feet. The Robinsons are respectable men, whose fears are
                        not easily excited; yet such was the terror which this nondescript caused, that they made a
                        hasty retreat to the shore, much alarmed. Since this circumstance took place, and but a few days
                        since, Mr. Lindsey, who is well known here,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> was riding near the margin of
                        the Lake, when he saw, at the distance of 200 feet from him, some animal raise its head three or
                        four feet above the surface of the water. He felt the security of the shore, and viewed the
                        mysterious creature many minutes; when it disappeared and reappeared three times in succession.
                        The head he described as being about three feet across the frontal bone, and having something of
                        the contour of a "beef's head," but the neck tapering, and having the
                        character of the serpent; color dingy, with large bright yellow spots. It turned its head from
                        side to side with an easy motion, in apparent survey of the surrounding objects. Mr. L. is
                        entitled to credibility. So convinced are many of the existence of the Monster, that some
                        gentlemen in town have proposed an expedition to the lake, and by the aid of rafts to make an
                        effort to capture the mysterious being which is a terror to the superstitious, but which becomes
                        an object of interest to science, the naturalist, and philosopher.</p>

                        making an effort to capture the Leviathan that inhabits its mysterious depths, it is generally
                        believed would afford an exciting and interesting trip, worthy the consideration of every
                        scientific mind. If every one who is desirous of joining the expedition would leave his name at
                        the office of the Telegraph or that of the Herald, the full extent of the
                        "Devil's Lake Expedition" may be determined on.</p>
                    <p>Now is the time that invites those interested in the capture of the terrific creature in its
                        natatory gyrations. The weather—the aid of moon-lit nights, are favoring
                        circumstances to effect a triumph over the "Indian terror." It would be well,
                        probably to suggest the propriety of those holding a meeting who are favorable, and willing to
                        support the effort to ascertain with certainty, whether the mysterious, old and cherished
                        tradition of the Indians, is based upon a KNOWN species of fish, or serpent, or whether the
                        field of science shall be extended by the discovery of a new species of animal, perculiar to
                        this beautiful and not oft visited Lake Man-i-too.</p>
                    <p>There are many necessary preparatory steps to be taken, to ensure a successful issue of the
                        expedition:—plans for the capture should be suggested; the policy, too, of the
                        building of a large boat, and constructing rafts; and to advise upon the proper means, to the
                        fullest extent. To determine the soundings of the chrystal depths of Man-i-too would be of
                        itself ample requital to the enterprising who will perform the expedition.</p>
                    <p>The belief of the tradition of Man-i-too is daily becoming confirmed from many unexceptionable
                        sources. Among them is the testimony of the Surveyors of the "Government
                        Purchase" on the Lake,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> who declared they saw a gigantic
                        inhabitant of the waters which very much alarmed them. It is confidently asserted that a line of
                        the surprising length of forty fathoms or 240 feet, has been once dropped and without effect.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> It is truly astonishing that such a small inland lake, so remote too from
                        the seas, should be as mysterious in its depths as it is in its legendary associations. But so
                        it is. Boys! up with your harpoons and to the Lake Man-i-too. The weather, the season, the
                        forest in all its leafy beauties, offer you inducements to leave the turmoil of every day life
                        for a week, and seek relaxation in the exciting expedition to the Devil's Lake.</p>

                            while assisting in its survey had become alarmed and made to shore, declaring that they had
                            seen a monster in the water—and for awhile it was difficult for him to get a man
                            to carry the red flag. Whether they really saw anything terrible in the water, or their
                            fears were merely the result of an excited imagination, after hearing the Indian legends,

                    <p>As this story has obtained and is likely to obtain a credibility which it does not deserve, we
                        have taken the pains to enquire of those who should know, the truth or falsity of the statements
                        made, and find that there is very little if any foundation for the many garbled reports which
                        are afloat in regard to this wondrous and extraordinary animal. Indeed, it would seem that it
                        required more proof, in any event, to be believed. The story it seems in the first place, is
                        predicated upon the superstitious traditions of the Indians, and receives additional strength
                        from the statements of those who have witnessed the curiosity—some ten years ago,
                        others more recently.</p>
                    <p>We are informed by the gentleman who located the Pottawatamie Mills, at the foot of this lake,
                        that nothing of the Indian traditions ascribed to this Lake ever existed, and that when the
                        mills were located, the Indians objected strongly upon the ground that they would sooner be in
                        possession of the fishery than of the mills—the location, they thought, would in a
                        measure, destroy the fishing. Mr. McCartney, one of the first settlers in this country,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> and who has lived among the Indians for several years, says that the only
                        Lake Man-i-too he has any knowledge of lies in Stark county<hi rend="sup">24</hi> near an old
                        road, known among the French traders as the Portage road, and is now called Cedar lake.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> This lake lies near <placeName>

                        which are now to be found) was once—so says the Indian tradition—killed on
                        its banks, the mate of which escaped into the water. This gave rise to the fearful superstitions
                        of the Indians,—a chief among whom, says Mr. McCartney, actually refused to shoot a
                        swan playing on the waters of the Lake, so great was his fear of the Man-i-too, or Devil.</p>

            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p rend="center">THE BONE EXPEDITION.</p>
                    <p>Some very grave and elaborate Editorial remarks appeared in the Herald of Thursday
                        last—avowedly the result of much "pains," and careful investigation
                        of the "Nonster Story," which were characterized with the awful obligations of
                        DUTY, to admonish the public, not to give credence to a tale destitute of plausibility, and
                        which is "obtaining an undeserved increasing notoriety." Has the Senior editor
                        of the Herald, the arrogance and vanity to imagine that he can exert an influence that shall
                        arrest the "increasing notoriety" of the article which appeared in the
                        Telegraph under caption of "The Devil's Lake?" His effort
                        to effect it, is made in a spirit of pitiful, irritability of feeling, and mendacity of
                        sentiment. But says the sapient editor: "we should not have noticed it, did not the
                        increasing notoriety which the story is obtaining demand it of us." Truly a very
                        handsome eulogy upon the merits of the story considering the impartial source whence it comes!</p>
                    <p>The article in the Herald forsooth! scarce merits a passing thrust, as it was concocted in the
                        bitterness of chagrin, illiberality and guilty meanness of spirit. But we merely glance at the
                        absurdity of the impotent effort to change a favorable public sentiment, towards a tradition
                        connected with a people in whose fate the whole civilized world manifests the
                        warmest’ interest. The attempt is preposterous as it is futile and ridiculous! But a
                        week since friend Jesse was up in arms with highly polished harpoon prepared to start upon the
                        expedition to "The Devil's Lake," to capture the terrific
                        "critter." He announced himself "a pioneer in the great
                        work." But now "a change has come over him like a summer cloud." Not
                        however, until he had "taken the pains to inquire of those who should know the truth or
                        falsity of the statements made" in the Telegraph. Now the Illuminary of the Herald
                        says, that there is no plausibility about the "monster story"—that
                        Lake Man-i-too is not Lake Man-i-too, but that Cedar Lake is Lake Man-i-too. Marvelous! That
                        there is no "monster" at all. Yet, strange contradiction, there is a monster
                        in Cedar Lake, enjoying its natatory gyrations "solitary and alone." And even
                        more forsooth? The tale now is made truly monstrous. For, says the Herald,
                        "a monster, (the bones of which are now to be found,) was once, <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-042-3-059"/> so says the Indian tradition, killed on the banks of the Lake, the
                        mate of which escaped in the water." This is valuable information—a
                        scientific point is acquired, which decides the monster to be amphibious and a reproductive
                        animal—or the Man-i-too's mate would not have made a rapid exit in the
                        translucent bosom of the Lake. The Senior editor of the Herald assures us that after much
                        pains-taking that these bones may be found high and dry upon the banks of Cedar Lake.</p>
                    <p>The capturing of the Leviathan of the Devil's Lake near <placeName>

                        interest. But the capturing of Man-i-too's bones is rendered certain. For one, then, I
                        go in for the bones! The mystery which has shrouded the change in friend Jesse's
                        sentiments comes intuitively to our mind! Of course as a member of the expedition to the
                        Devil's Lake near <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                        </placeName>, he could not aspire to a higher office than "Leftenant," whereas
                        Jesse is ambitious of being a "canting," so he wants to get up "The
                        Bone Expedition" in a sort of generous emulation with the Devil's Lake
                        exploit. Truly noble! Friend Jesse makes a pitiful and uncalled for thrust at an old ally and
                        friend—which is kindly and gently parried without a wish to hurt feelings naturally
                        irritable. Ah! friend Jesse, thou didst wrong to effect a sneer at "the monster and
                        monsterous" meeting and the eloquence displayed there. Jesse says that he did not
                        attend the meeting, a circumstance monstrously regretted—for who like him could make
                        the assembly shine?</p>

                        <p>"I had noticed the snake-story to which you refer. It appears to be going the
                            rounds, and I am unwilling to be referred to as vouching for the truth of a tale of this
                            class in which the author has thought proper to introduce my name. I remember of hearing
                            something of an Indian tradition that doubtless gave rise to this tale—for myself
                            I never credited it as reality. You are aware of Indian credulity, as relates to that which
                            they have received from their Fathers;—also, how many residing places they have
                            imagined for their Man-i-toos,—their good or evil spirits. All that I learnt
                            relative to the Lake, that never appears to have received the name of the
                            "Devil's Lake," I suppose had its origin in some such tradition
                            or fiction. So far as came to my knowledge, the Indians had no fear of being on the Lake;
                            their fishing and night-hunting for deer, was common on it. The objection made by them to
                            the erection of the mills, was that the dam at the outlet would injure their fishing.</p>
                        <p>"I will add, that if any are disposed to invent a "snake-story," I
                            would thank them not to introduce my name into it; this class of tales does very well
                            without a witness."</p>

                        the author of the tale of the "Devil's Lake," that Gen. Milroy should
                        suppose that his name had been endorsed as "a witneiss," believing in the

                        lending credit to a tale in which, it appears, Gen. Milroy gives no credence. But it would be
                        truly a source of DEEP regret to the author, HAD he wa[i]ved that proper delicacy, and regard in

                        be seen that Gen. Milroy's name was used only in connexion with the erection of the
                        Pottawatt[C]mie Mills; and in what way that allusion to his name should bring conviction upon
                        the mind of Gen. Milroy, that, he was therefore supposed to be a believer in the mysterious
                        tradition of the Red Men, is somewhat enigmatical! These are the words used in the article
                        referred to:—"When the Pottawattamie Mills were erecting some ten years
                        since, at what is called the out-let of the Lake, the Monster was seen by men known to Gen.
                        Milroy, under whose direction the Mills, I BELIEVE, were erected." If it be true that
                        these Mills were superintended by the General, and the men in his employ saw the Monster, of
                        course the men gave credence and were "witnesses," but [it] is not set up as a
                        fact, or even intimated, that Gen. Milroy was a witness, nor did the writer of "the
                        story" insinuate such a thing; therefore, it certainly appears to us, that it became
                        unnecessary for Gen. M. to say that he is "unwilling to be referred to, as vouching for
                        the truth of a tale of this class, in which the author has thought proper to introduce my
                        name."</p>
                    <p>HAD Gen. Milroy's name been used in support of the "monster
                        story"—HAD he really been brought in as "a witness," there
                        is no doubt but the respectability of his name might have influenced the minds of some who are
                        now incredulous in regard to the tradition.—Whatever efforts have been made to make
                        "the story" appear destitu[t]e of plausability, or to attribute the Indian
                        tradition as originating in the superstitious fears of the Aborigines, have certainly proved
                        unavailing; for confirmatory testimony every day, adds interest and importance to the
                        Devil's Lake. Consequently, the extract from the letter, in the opinion of many, does
                        not "put to flight any remaining credulity which may be placed to the credit of this
                            story.<hi rend="sup">)</hi>’ There is a diversity of opinion as to the location
                        of Lake Man-i-too. At one time, Cedar Lake is Lake Man-i-too and the Devil's
                        Lake—then it appears that the mysterious waters, in the vicinity of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                        </placeName>, are Lake Man-i-too, but not the Devil's Lake.—This is
                        perplexing! It is a point which should be settled at this day. If it be a
                        "BONE" of contention now, it will be, certainly, at some future time, a
                        subject for learned disquisition and antiquarian regret. The mysterious depth of the Lake near <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                        </placeName>, is truly surprizing, and the source of so vast a body of water becomes a matter of
                        speculation with many, The Indians believe that there are subterraneous communications with Lake
                        Max-in-euk-kee and the large lakes of the north; and though a theory originating with the
                        Indians, it is not an improbable one, when we reflect upon the physical conformations of the
                        earth.</p>
                    <p>Lake Man-i-too, at this time, is unusually high; and it is well known that the northern lakes are
                        rising to an alarming degree.—Hence, it would appear, that these vest [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] bodies of water are the source of this lovely little lake. What seems to
                        substantiate the ABORIGINAL theory of the subterranean communication, is, that a
                        "monster" was seen in a lake not far from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                        </placeName>, at the time of surveying the northern portion of Indiana, by a man in the employ
                        of the engineer, who was very much terrified. Such was the testimony <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-042-3-062"/> given in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                        </placeName> a short time since, by the gentleman in whose employ the man was.—Now,
                        probably, this is the same "monster, the mate of which was captured on the banks of
                        Cedar Lake." There is no doubt, then, that the "monster" is
                        migratory, and makes excursions through the subterraneous passes from lake to lake,
                        periodically.</p>
                    <p>In the mysterious workings of nature, it is known that subterraneous convulsions have raised
                        mountains from the level—slides have buried vallies—the sea has receded
                        from the land, and advanced upon other portions of the earth—rivers have changed
                        their channels; and subterraneous caverns of miles in extent, are known to exist. All are
                        mysterious, and which render the Indian theory concerning the lakes, far from being out of the
                        pale of probability.</p>

                        Men, but from what has been but imperfectly gleaned from those who have lived and mingled among
                        them for speculation and profit, rather than from an interest in their history, and social
                        habits. The crumbling column, and disfigured statue, of Egyptian, and Grecian production, are
                        cherished as mementos of a distinguished people, who have excelled in the arts. These relics
                        tell of the age in which they were fostered, and proclaim the advanced state of human
                        achievements, and the sublimities of the arts of that day.—But what monumental pile
                        shall stand, that future generations may point at, to commemorate the ages in which the
                        unfortunate Indians lived? Though these people, rude and ignorant of the arts, will
                        leave but little more than the curious, rude and simple sepulchres of logs and bark, that must
                        inevitably perish before the corroding hand of time, or the irresistable plough-share of
                        obtruding civilization; and though the artist has perpetuated the features of many of the
                        distinguished Warriors, Headmen and Orators of the Red Nations, and the poet, too, has sung of
                        their sorrows and they wrongs; yet, let us, while we can, rescue from oblivion, all that
                        concerns a people that are rapidly disappearing from the theatre of human action, known alike
                        for fortitude and valor.</p>
                    <p>We cherish the old ballads of the; days of chivalry, and feel interested in the superstitions of
                        the days when the mind was shrouded in mental darkness; and as we glance in retrospection upon
                        the mazes of buried ages, and reflect upon our own days of human rights and <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-042-3-063"/> religious freedom, before whose radiant star of mental regeneration
                        superstition has partially disappeared, we may well feel proud of our advanced and enlightened
                        civilization. Will not, then, the traditions, history, and thoughts of the Red Men interest the
                        civilized world? Many of the lakes in the fair region of the north of Indiana, are
                        associated with Kee-caw-bas and Man-i-tous. There is a curious and interesting Indian tradition
                        associated with a sparkling lake in Stark county of this state, about four miles in length, and
                        a mile in width, varying but little. The margin of the lake is bounded by occasional bluffs or
                        abrupt banks of no great elevation, and beautifully timbered. Here and there, are green slopes
                        extending from the margin of the lake in gentle ascent, but upon which the Indians never encamp,
                        from the religious awe in which they hold these hallowed waters; which, to the whites, are
                        familiarly known as Cedar Lake, but which the Indians call Man-i-tou-ken, or the Lake of the
                        Devil's Bones.—It is a well known custom among the Indians, to make the
                        squaws the repository of their history and traditions; and though it is a SAVAGE custom yet it
                        may be deemed a felicitous one, for as it is the mother who gives shape, form and character to
                        the infantine mind, so are the squaws, from their habits, suited to impart to the papooses the
                        tone of the tribe. The tradition of Man-i-tou-ken, was related to an Indian trader by a squaw,
                        who was well known in the Pottawattamie nation by the name of No-cum-mick-qua. She was a
                        descendant of the line of the chiefs of To-bin-a-bey; and there fore the tradition is entitled
                        to the credit of legitimacy. When the Pottawattamies located south of the great lakes, and north
                        of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                        </placeName>, a succession of many centuries since, the land was barren, and the sun shed his
                        refulgent rays upon the open surface of a country not bold nor striking, but diversified with
                        small lakes of various depths. There was but little timber to fling the cool and refreshing
                        shades upon the earth for the game to repose it. At that time, which was so remote, the mighty
                        Mammoth, whose history, like that of the early period of the Indian nations, is enveloped in
                        doubt, mystery and obscurity, was a habitant of the earth, and was indigenous to the great
                        western territory, of which Indiana was a part. Recent discoveries, but a short distance from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                        </placeName>, which are known and familiar to every one here, substantially corroborate the
                        fact, that the Mammoth did once exist in this section of country. These gigantic animals were a
                        terror to the aborigines of the north, among whom they caused much tribulation and anxiety; for
                        the game and all habitable creatures but man, were fast disappearing before the voracity of the
                        mysterious Mammoth, whose pomers [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of mastication may be imagined by the
                        citation of a tooth measuring nearly two feet—and it seems it was hailed by the
                        Indians as a happy decree, that the evil or bad Man-i-tou would no longer scourge them by his
                        presence. The Kee-caw-bas, who were good spirits that inhabited the deep waters of lake <placeName>

                        rapid disappearance of the game before the terrible and repeated aggressions of the ponderous
                        Mammoth. The Kee-caw-bas, who were diminutive creatures, like unto the muskrat, came <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-042-3-064"/> forth from the clear depths of lake <placeName>

                        whole of the animal creation, beneath whose ponderous weight and massive foot, every leaf, bud
                        and flower was crushed. The Kee-caw-bas, or Man-i-tous, discovered three Mammoths on the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                        </placeName> river, to whom they avowed a hatred which a final extinction would only gratify,
                        for the rapid disappearance of the game was about to end the chase. Two of the Mammoths were
                        females, and one of them escaped from the destruction of the Kee-caw-bas, enciente [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and disappeared in the translucent waters of Man-i-tou-ken, which is about eleven
                        miles from the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                        </placeName> river. From that day to the present time, the lake while it is reverenced for its
                        hallowedness by the Indians, yet it is regarded with thrilling terror and dread. The lake
                        abounds in many species of fish, but the Red Men, from superstitious dread, or from a desire not
                        to disturb these sacred and sparkling waters, never avail themselves of a bounteous providence.
                        No Indian was ever seen gliding in his canoe upon its glassy surface. The Loon sits upon its
                        bosom and screams its melancholy note and flaps its wi[n]gs undisturbed; for the Red Man will
                        not fire his rifle, least the sound should disturb the slumbering Mammoth in her repose in the
                        chrystal depths, and whose terrible desolating work on the earth many centuries since is
                        remembered—for the Indian mother, in narrating the tradition, never failed to awaken
                        a superstitious dread in the minds of the pop-pooses. The Kee-caw-bas, having caused the
                        Mammoth's extinction, retreated to lake <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                        </placeName>, and disappeared in its depths for ever.</p>
                    <p>Tho tradition further states, that a crazy Indian, who was encamped with a band of Pottawattamies
                        upon the banks of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                        </placeName> river, discovered the bones of the Mammoth, and in a fit of desperate insanity,
                        threw them into a deep ravine which connects itself with the river. This place is called
                        Man-i-tou-ken, or the place of the Devil's bones, even to this day. The banks of the
                        river at this spot are of more than their general elevation, and the water remarkably deep.
                        Occasionally the bones of the Mammoth are washed from the ravine, and many of them
                        irrecoverable; but the hope is yet entertained that the skulls have not been dislodged from the
                        repository in which it has laid many centuries.</p>
                    <p>Whatever interest or credit the tradition is entitled to, every mind must decide for itself. But
                        the existence of the bones claims credibility; for they have been seen by many, among whom is
                        our respected friend Mr. M'Cartney,<hi rend="sup">29</hi> who is well known here, and
                        by whose consent, we have the use of his name in making these statements. Upon his veracity no
                        one can cast a shLadow of doubt. He, also, is the surviving husband of her whose name is
                        familiar to the Pottawattamies as No-cum-mic-qua.</p>

                    <p rend="center">LAKES OF INDIANA.</p>
                    <p>The scenery of the "thousand isles", of the St. Lawrence, and of the
                        "highlands" on the Hudson, have been made subjects of history and themes of
                        romance, while the wild, beautiful and gorgeous scenery of northern Indiana is almost unknown to
                        those who have never travelled among it. Hundreds of small, clear Lakes with sandy shores, from
                        one to five miles in circumference, decorate and enliven the face of the country. At one moment
                        the eye of the traveller rests upon cultivated fields, fair hamlets, and bright sheets of pure
                        water glittering in the sunlight. Suddenly the scene changes, and the View extends, through
                        "oak openings" and over a gently undulating surface covered with rich and
                        variegated wild flowers, as far as the eye can reach. Wild deer are often seen bounding in herds
                        over the plains, and flocks of white swans croak their hoarse notes at sunset upon the waters of
                        the Lakes. Almost every Lake is invested with interest by the legendary lore of the Indians who
                        have inhabited the country for centuries, and whose traditions, if faithfully recorded and
                        transmitted to posterity, will be regarded as deeply interesting memorials of a strange race of
                        "barbarians" who perished under the "protection" of their
                        civilized brethren.</p>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> could feel that it had done at least something to preserve the

            <p>Samuel Milroy moved in the Indiana House of Representatives on December 5, 1820, "That the
                    judiciary committee be instructed to enquire into the expediency of so amending the criminal code of
                    this state, as that corporal punishments by whipping and imprisonment be abolished and that hard
                    labor on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> under proper overseers, be substituted …."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    This resolution was prompted by three motives: 1) to furnish a supply of labor for the canal, 2) to
                    abandon the brutal and much hated whipping post as a means of punishment, and 3) to reduce the
                    number of prisoners kept in the county jails.</p>
            <p>All the acts and parts of acts in force in Indiana relating to crime and punishment were codified.
                    This code defined around forty-five misdemeanors and felonies and described the punishments or
                    penalties to be inflicted or imposed. Four were punishable by death by hanging, thirteen by
                    whipping, sixteen by imprisonment, and the rest by fines.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whipping was meted out as a punishment in so many cases because of the great lack of satisfactory
                    jail space. By law each county had a jail, but these were crude, small structures, unhealthy, poorly
                    ventilated, and usually unheated. Confinement of the prisoners for a period of months or years was a
                    financial burden on the county and a grave responsibility for the sheriff who was in charge of them.
                    Public sentiment against whipping, however, was so strong that some substitute for it had to be
                    found.</p>

                    hundred stripes would be sentenced to prison at hard labor for seven years. Those liable to fifty
                    stripes would be sentenced to five years, and those liable to thirty-nine stripes, to three years.
                    The certificate of a conviction was to be delivered to the county sheriff by the county clerk, and
                    the sheriff would deliver the convicts to the prison. Twenty-five cents a mile was to be allowed to

            <p>How the agent was to be paid is not set out clearly. The building and maintenance of the prison was
                    to be a joint affair between private individuals and the state. Three thousand dollars were

                    following December, stated, "Further legislative provisions will be necessary, to carry
                    into operation, the humane purposes of the Legislature connected with the establishment of the
                    penitentiary; and the situation of those, who have been engaged in erecting the building, are

            <p>In response to this last clause, the legislature passed an act which allowed Robert Gray and Reuben
                    H. Murray, "undertakers" to build the prison, $500 in addition to the
                    $3,000 appropriated for the building.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The prison was not a
                    profit-making institution, and a minimum total of $10,800 was expended for it to the
                    close of the year 1826. Much of this was from the <placeName>

            <p>The 1821–1822 session of the General Assembly did not seem inclined to take further action
                    on the prison. In reply to a report by Stephen Ranney, president of the board of managers, the
                    Senate committee, to which the report was referred, declared that on examining the report and the
                    1821 act, the committee believed that the managers "have full and ample powers granted them
                    to provide for the maintenance and employment of convicts committed to said prison"; and
                    declared that "it would not be advisable to make a further sufficient appropriation, to
                    create good and sufficient walls around said prison, if in the opinion of the Legislature the
                    situation of our financial concerns will admit of the same."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Governor Hendricks’ message to the General Assembly at the opening of the
                    1822–1823 session asked for provision for payment to the sheriffs to defray the expense
                    of transferring prisoners to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and for additional appropriations for the institution which seemed necessary
                    "not only for its prosperity but for its existence."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Two
                    acts were passed relating to the prison. Another act for the relief of Murray and Gray, and an act
                    amendatory to the act authorizing the building of a state prison were passed in 1821.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The latter modified the length of sentences the convicts were to serve in relation to
                    the number of stripes they were liable to receive under the existing laws. It also provided that
                    prisoners whose sentences included a fine and who could not pay, could be detained at the prison at
                    hard labor at fifty cents a day until the fine was discharged. The agent was directed to have a Rood
                    and substantial wall built to enclose the prison and appropriated $2,500 for this out of
                    the state treasury. Further provision for reimbursing sheriffs for bringing convicts to the prison
                    was made.</p>
            <p>During the 1823–1821 session of the General Assembly, Governor Hendricks requested a
                    reorganization in the management of the prison. The act<hi rend="sup">15</hi> that was passed in
                    response to this abolished the board of managers and the agency, and entrusted the prison to a
                    "superintendent of the state prison." To this officer fell the duties and powers
                    of the former agent and board of managers. The act confirmed the contract made with the incumbent
                    agent, Abel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was to keep the prison and prisoners according to agreement until August 4, 1824,
                    at which time his contract would terminate. The act gave the governor power to farm the prison out
                    to a superintendent or to employ one at a salary not to exceed $1,000, payable out of the
                    proceeds of the prison. Wells were to be dug and workshops and other necessary buildings were to be
                    erected at the prison.</p>

                    Abel P. Spencer, who succeeded White as agent. It is addressed to the General Assembly and covers
                    the period from August 5 to December 8, 1823. It gives a good picture of the prison as it operated
                    under the direction of the board of managers and agent and gives some idea of the kind of contract
                    made with the agent. It is evident that the 1824 act endeavored to correct some of the difficulties

                        leave to lay before the Honorable the General Assembly the following report, showing the
                        situation of the said prison, and the convicts from the fifth day of August 1823. to the present
                        date. On the Ninth day of August 1823 I received the appointment of Agent of the <placeName>

                        provisions, Clothing, Bedding, Medical aid &amp;c. To pay all the expenses necessary, for
                        the security of the same; according to the Instruction of the Maniger. For which I would receive
                        the services of the convicts as my compensation and clear the state of all expenses except
                        paying the keeper. This proposition was excepted by the Managers. And I entered into bonds of
                        ten thousand Dollars with security for the faithful performance of the same, and the discharge
                        of the duties of agent. It was ordered by the managers that I should settle and pay the expenses
                        of the prison from the fifth day of August (the date of the former Agents Resignation) the time
                        from which he refused to furnish supplies. Whence I entered on duty. the Number of prisoners was
                        Sixteen. Their ware no Mechanicks among them, except two masons and the only business carried on
                        was the manufacturing Segars and the labour on the wall. For those on the wall I received twenty
                        five Cents pr. day each, in Treasury Notes. Since I have had the charge of the prison, I have
                        established the shoe making Tailoring, Blacksmithing Basket Making, the making of Brooms
                        &amp; Mats, and am preparing to introduce other manufacturies, as soon as practicable.
                        Segars have been in their quality improved and now find ready sale at One Dollar pr. thousand,

                        Tools but have not been able to put them in employ. I find the expenseof establishing business,
                        in the prison greater than I anticipated Yet I believe by close attention and strict economy the
                        Prisoners may be made to support the establishment. But to ensure its success—some
                        change in its government is necessary. At present the Keeper has the exclusive control of the
                        prisoners, is paid by the day, feels no interest in the business carried on, he lives out of the
                        Prison and is necessarily absent when business requires his attendance. Suffer me therefore to
                        suggest the propriety of allowing the agent to employ a Keeper, One who will attempt to all the
                        business necessary and who shall be approved of by the managers or by the Governor. The work
                        Shops we make use of at present are inconvenient. The Shoe makers, Tailors Basket Makers and
                        those who make Segars are all crowded into one room. This room Tho inconvenunt for so many
                        workman I have made comfortable by putting up a large stove, laying a floor over head, making a
                        door repairing the walls and windows. The Blacksmiths’ Shop one of the ground rooms
                        is too dark and confined; it exposes the prison to Smoke and fire I therefore propose the
                        building of work shops which may be done with little expense by connecting them with the Prison
                        and the Prison wall. A well is indispensably necessary. The water used in the Prison is brought
                        in buckets from a distance of three hundred yards with out the wall and sufficiently employs one
                        man one half of his time. While we remain in this situation the gate must stand open and we
                        constantly exposed to escapes and the Prison liable to be destroyed by fire. The building a <hi rend="i">Necessary</hi> within the wall was deemed requisite. This I have commenced by the
                        advise of the managers, and rely on the Legislature to make an appropriation to pay the expense.
                        There are now confined in the penitentiary twenty Prisoners three of whom are learning the
                        Shoemaking business; three at basket making; five manufactoring Segars, two at Tailoring, two at
                        Blacksmithing, one making Brooms and mats, one cooking one bringing water and making fires; the
                        others are at this time employed on the building above mentioned. Since the 5th of August last
                        there has been brought in from the different Counties fifteen Prisoners sentenced to confinement
                        as follows <hi rend="i">to wit:</hi> Ten for one Year each, One for Eighteen months three for
                        two Years and one for four Years. I have furnished them all with shoes clothing Bedding
                        &amp;c. according to law. They are comfortably clad for winter and are at present healthy.
                        There are in the Prison two women whom I have <hi rend="i">furnished</hi> with domestic gowns.
                        One is employed in Cooking the other at present in manufacturing segars but she ell soon be

                        and they gave me permission to be absent. At time there were a number of the Prisoners sick one
                        man by the name of Troxel was not expected to live. I did not return untill late in the eaving
                        of the sixteenth when I enquired of one of the managers the situation of the Prison. he informed
                        me that the Keeper was sick and had left the Prison; that he had himself taken the kees had been
                        to the Prison and had shut up the Prisoners in the cells, all except Troxel who he believed
                        could not live through the night. He had therefore left him on a pallet in one of the upper
                        rooms. After receiving this information I callled to see the Keeper returned &amp; went to
                        bed. The next morning at day brake Col Ranney called me, and said I had better <hi rend="i">go</hi> [to] the Prison that the keeper was sick. I went immediately and found the Prison
                        broken. And on examination I found that nine of the convicts had made their escape. Troxel the
                        sick man was gone; and I have no doubt in saying that he broke the Cell locks and through him
                        there escape was effected. I lost no time in giving the allarm and many of the Citizens turned
                        out in serch of them. I spent five days myself. I made an advertisement offering five Dollars
                        bounty; and all reasonable Charges paid for the aprehension of each of them six of whom have
                        been taken and brought back the expense of recovering them hits been in money paid out
                        $72.00 of which I made an account a[n]d the same has been settled by the Treasurer
                        with the exception of fourteen dollars (deducted by His Excelency the Governor) Three out of the
                        nine who made their escape at that time have not been returned. Their names are Alexander H.
                        Porter James Johnson &amp; George Gray Thomas Cummings James Robinson and John Boyd have
                        likewise made their escape they were employed on the Wall, according to a contract with Col
                        Ranney they found their escape easy as their was no guard, nor has there ever been any
                        authorized by government. I am aware that much has been said concerning the escape of James
                        Robemon a man of coular, as their has been an attempt to attach blame to the officers of the
                        Prison. I shall be happy to have a committee appointed from Your Honorable body to examine into
                        their conduct. I understand however that this fellow has been taken up by some persons near New <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                        </placeName> Indiana and has been carried to the State of Tenesee. The others I have not healt
                        of. It is not in my power to show the debts due to the Prison, or what claims there are against
                        it, for I have never had the Prison Books in my possession. The Managers directed me to call on
                        Mr George White for the Books and papers belonging to the Prison. I did so,—and he
                        refused to deliver them up untill he got a settlement. I have only settled one account which had
                        been made previous to my agency that of Abraham Knickerbocker who was hired by the President of
                        the board of manigers as an assistant Keeper (The Agent having refused to him one) This account
                        I likewise lay before Your Honorable Body. It is testified by the Keeper and you will see by the
                        receipt that I have paid on it thirty four dollars Treasury money. From the nature of my
                        contract to support the Prison I consider it unnecessary to go into a detailed account of the
                        expences. The hiring of instructors in the different kinds <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-042-3-077"/>
                        of mechanical business established; furnishing tools stocks &amp;c. has cost more money than
                        I have realized from the labour of the Convicts. It was well known to me that this would be the
                        case in the commencement. But it was my opinion at that time and still believe by perserverance
                        I shall be able to fulfill my Contract without suffering a loss. In this I should be more secure
                        however if I was allowed to employ such keepers as would attend strictly to my business. I have
                        found by experience that I cannot (under the present regulation). I have the Convicts imployed
                        more than one half of the working hours—On the subject of the Prison Wall, I am not
                        able to make any report. I have been deprived of the Books and papers necessary to enable me to
                        do so—the Wall however had been built of good materials and in a workmanlike manner.
                        It is now completed but I do not know whether it fulfilled the contract of the money which was
                        appropriated for the building of the Wall. I have received $1431.38/100 and I have
                        paid over to Col Ranney $1423.84 1/4 which leaves a balance in my hands of
                        $7.53 8/4 Those accounts &amp; receipts, are lodged in the Treasurers
                        office—To show the situation of the Prison when I took it I herewith submit a copy of
                        my receipt given to the keeper for every article of every description then in his, possession.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    Index, and Illustrations. $4.00.)</head>
            <p>With an attractive title and a copious subject William E. Baringer has made a scholarly, but withal
                    an interesting, study of the most dangerous period of American history—Abraham
                    Lincoln's four months tenure as president-elect. The gaunt lawyer is deftly portrayed
                    "as a man living between two worlds, one dead, the other struggling to be born."
                    Yet the book is not a segment of the history (November 6, 1860 to March 4, 1861) of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>; it is rather "the story of the making of a statesman" at a
                    "time big with the fate of the nation."</p>
            <p>The two main topics of this day were "crisis" and "cabinet."
                    Lincoln, a representative of the Republican party, a youthful institution, was determined that a
                    dissatisfied minority must not be allowed io disregard with impunity the results of a lawful
                    presidential election. In a position of great influence, but with no power, Lincoln's task
                    was threefold: "He must, unite his party, make himself its leader, and impose on the
                    Republican party a political program which would increase its strength without alienating the whole
                    slaveholding section." Not only did he resist compromise with the South "with the
                    iron grip of a railsplitter," but he moulded the policies and principles of the Republican
                    party—forced them on his followers as no party leader had ever done. To the bitter end
                    Lincoln refused to restate his policy—a sop demanded by Southerners who did not like the
                    principles he had previously enunciated.</p>
            <p>One problem, which immediately presented itself after the election, was the matter of
                    patronage—the proper distribution of the "loaves and fishes." At first
                    this distribution of offices was an annoyance, but as Lincoln grew in political wisdom, he
                    discovered that "political plums" constituted a mighty political club that could
                    occasionally be used to his own advantage.</p>
            <p>The selection of the cabinet was the chief task of the patronage problem. A desire was expressed that
                    Lincoln would appoint a "cabinet in which all men (all except fools <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-042-3-080"/> and fanatics) will have confidence." Lincoln's
                    efforts were certainly directed along these lines. The cabinet problem was involved with geography,
                    friendships, ability of candidates for portfolios, secret bargains, coalitions, the right of the
                    vice-president-elect to name one member, and many other annoying and complex factors. After four
                    months of classifying "Grade A" claims with those of lesser pretentions, Lincoln
                    appointed a cabinet almost identical to the one he had had in mind on election night.</p>
            <p>With the "vultures" taken care of, Lincoln studied the threats of secession, heard
                    the secession salvos, and formulated his border state policy. Resting heavily upon press
                    reports—-particularly "the most perspicuous of the reporters —Henry
                    Villard" of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> the untiring author has delved to the very depths of the plots and
                    counterplots of pre-Civil War politics. At the same time Baringer has infused into his narrative
                    human interest stories about the president-elect, his family, and associates. Ample attention has
                    likewise been given to Lincoln's visit with his stepmother, the Farewell Address, the
                    inaugural tour, the <placeName>

                    "mecca" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>

                    </placeName> is no longer an untried statesman, but one who is capable of dealing with
                    "problems …. enough to frighten the greatest statesman who ever lived."</p>
            <p>One is impressed with Baringer's <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi> of source materials. Then,
                    too, in addition to his attractive title the chapters bear headings replete with fascinating
                    alliterations such as "Bates and Botts," "Travel to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and "Travail In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>In summarizing this scholarly and readable work, this reviewer believes that if all phases of
                    Lincolniana were as thoroughly and interestingly treated as this four months period of
                    Lincoln's life, the Lincoln theme would truly be exhausted.</p>

            <p>The author tells us that this book had its origin in a study which he earlier prepared on the
                    attitude of the Catholic bishops of the North toward the Civil War. This has become Chapter III of
                    his <hi rend="i">Catholics and the Civil War</hi> and with it begins the real study.</p>
            <p>During the Civil War Catholics were not politically or numerically strong and for the most part their
                    contributions as a church and as individuals have been neglected by the general historian. Father
                    Blied in his Essays, as he calls them, has helped complete the picture of the Civil War by his
                    researches into the church's part in the war. His chapter on the Catholic Press analyzing
                    contemporary Catholic opinion is a real contribution, though smaller in scope than Madeleine
                    Rice's <hi rend="i">American Catholic Opinion in the Slavery Controversy</hi>.</p>
            <p>The bishops of the Catholic church were almost as divided in their opinions on slavery and secession
                    as were the Protestant clergy. A Southern bishop's argument that "the law of
                    Moses, not only did not prohibit slavery, but sanctioned it, regulated it, and specified the rights
                    of masters, and the duties of slaves" (p. 62) could have come from many a Protestant
                    minister in the South. In the main the loyal northern bishop's concern was in preserving
                    the Union rather than in destroying slavery. Catholic representatives, North and South, agreed in
                    blaming the Protestant clergy for making slavery a political issue.</p>
            <p>By dealing primarily with the church as an organization, this study has scratched the surface of a
                    broad subject, Catholics and the Civil War. The national origins of the <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-042-3-082"/> people making up the Catholic population in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had much to do with their attitude. The feelings of the Irish Catholics on Civil War
                    issues were undoubtedly influenced by their hatred of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and the author rightly includes a chapter on the Fenian Brotherhood, though it is not
                    well integrated with the rest of the book. Much more could be written on this subject, and on the
                    importance of free land to the immigrant, so many of whom were Catholics. How important was the

            <p>The author of <hi rend="i">Storm</hi>, George R. Stewart, has again written an original and
                    informative narrative in <hi rend="i">Names on the Land</hi> Subtitled <hi rend="i">A Historical
                        Account of Place Naming in, the <placeName>

               </hi>, Stewart's latest work is nevertheless an exciting narretive of the
                    romance, tragedy, idealism and humor that characterized the namings in American history. Stewart
                    describes the four centuries of place naming from the days of Ponee de Leon to the activities of the
                    Post Office Department and the Beard on Geographic Names created by President Harrison in 1290.</p>
            <p>First were the Indians and Spaniards, whose namings were often lost, igncred, or vulgarized by the
                    English who followed. The first English namers, Captain John Smith and Gabrlel Archer, represented
                    the extremes of practicality and high-flown fancy. They named for the royal family, for their fellow
                    explorers and for their patrons, thus Cape Henry, <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-042-3-083"/>
                    Archer's Hope, Jarnestown, Cape Charles, Keale's Hill and most important, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Charles Stuart struck out the Indian names on Captain Smith's map and gave
                    the Puritans a precedent for English names soon to spread over New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> under the authority of the <placeName>

                    commemorated the rulers, but the common people named the features of the land—rivers,
                    creeks, and mountains—giving names often unknown in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and truly American.</p>
            <p>The Dutch and Swedes and the minor nationalities of the Middle Colonies all contributed in naming, as
                    in blood and work, to create the new nation. The French on the frontier named the Great Lakes and
                    the important rivers and states of the Middle West. English-speaking settlers who followed respected
                    the French, but their rendition of French words was a dubious compliment. Lewis and Clark named no
                    state, but recorded Council Bluffs, Milk River and the names of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <region type="county">Jefferson</region>, <region type="county">Gallatin</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>. The railroad builders like General Dodge of the Union Pacific and influential persons
                    like James M. Ashley of the Committee on Territories named many states and towns of the new west.
                    When local pride and ingenuity collapsed, the Post Office clerks took over.</p>
            <p>Every aspect of American life contributed names on the land. The wars left their quota of names of
                    generals and battles. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s name was given to a state, 33 counties, 121 cities and towns, 257 townships,
                    10 lakes, 8 streams, 7 mountains, and about 1140 streets. The classical revival put names like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName> (31 places), <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Canaan, Sharon, and others. The wave of gentility that struck after the Civil War
                    eliminated Cow Neck and Rum Point and brought in the somewhat nauseating Bosky Dell and its
                    relations. Suffix trouble beset the namers, as it did President Harding, and provided many odd
                    combinations, for example Applebacksville.</p>
            <p>Stewart considers a major awkwardness the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America, first used officially in the Declaration of Independence. It supplied no
                    name for the inhabitants, was unsuited to song or poem. The makeshift adoption of the national name
                    refused to give way to <placeName>

                    so we limp along.</p>
            <p>Some names were jokes, some were mistakes in spelling. There were scandals, too, in the names, and
                    vociferous debate that shook the country, before <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> gained recognition of its nonalignment of spelling and pronunciation and Tacoma settled
                    down to accepting Mt. Rainier.</p>
            <p>Stewart disavows encyclopedic purpose for <hi rend="i">Names on the Land</hi>, but by process of
                    selection he succeeds in suggesting the wide scope and diversity of geographical naming throughout
                    American history. He gives attention not only to the great names but to the little homely names on
                    the land of rivers, creeks., mines, and streets that make up the American concept of home. He writes
                    with subtle humor and an easy style that more scholarly writers in American history might well
                    attend.</p>

            <p>While engaged in the research from which came her biography of Charles Osborn, the author learned
                    about the free produce movement. After much additional investigation she was able to produce this
                    second small volume, which traces this phase of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> activity as far as available sources permit. It is an account of the effort, largely by
                    Friends, to secure goods not made by slave labor and to boycott the productions of the slave system.</p>
            <p>To the uninitiated, the most interesting point which the study illustrates is the sharp division
                    among the Quakers in regard to the agitation against slavery. Although hostile to the institution,
                    the conservative majority of the Friends were opposed to co-operation with others and to the
                    "excitements" involved in the controversy. The free produce movement offered to
                    some of the Friends an opportunity to work against slavery without engaging in the more extreme
                    forms of the antislavery agitation. It was not supported by the conservative majority nor by the
                    more extreme antislavery Quakers, the latter regarding it as too mild and ineffective.</p>
            <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-042-3-085"/>
            <p>Its failure was due primarily to this lack of support, although there were other contributing factors
                    of importance. It was very difficult to secure supplies of cotton, sugar, and rice which had not
                    been produced by the labor of slaves and such supplies as were obtained generally cost more than the
                    market price. Because of the nature of the business, it was necessary to conduct it on a cash basis
                    and the men engaged in it lacked the resources to buy on a large enough scale to compete with
                    regular agencies.</p>
            <p>The author has related the story in a scholarly and interesting manner, without exaggerating the
                    importance of her subject. The final chapter includes a brief account of the anti-slavery press of
                    the Friends. The volume will be of interest to persons in Indiana and <placeName>

            <p>Geographical factors largely determined the direction of this small migration. Many of the streams of

                    </placeName> find their way to the Albemarle Sound. These water courses offered a route to fertile
                    unsettled lands with less danger and greater ease. Their chances of escape were better if attacked
                    by tribes of Indians or wild beasts from the impenetrable Dismal Swamp, or the dense forests and
                    thick undergrowth of the interior. An abundance of fish in the streams was a partial guarantee of a

                    Pearre and daughter of Joseph Scott, published their intention of marriage. They were married at her
                    home "December 15, 1683." William Bundy is recorded as being a witness at several
                    weddings in 1680. His signature appeared on a remonstrance dated September 25, 1679, which was
                    addressed to the Duke of Albemarle by the Quakers, most of whom had been inhabitants of Carolina
                    since 1663. The court records show that he assigned to Mary Scott all his interests to an Indian
                    named Sanders, April 6, 1680. He served as one of the justices at a court held for the Precinct of <placeName>

                    precinct the court consisted of a judge and four justices. To be an eligible candidate for justice,
                    a man must have been an inhabitant of the precinct and own 300 acres of land. At that time there
                    were four precincts in Albemarle County —<placeName>

                    county. He is listed among the Quakers who were sentenced and imprisoned for refusing to bear arms,

                    monthly meetings. At their regular monthly meeting May 4, 1706, this organized group of Quakers
                    decided to build a church between the home of Caleb Bundy and William Brother's Creek, and

                    region, and many of them were traveling by packhorse over nature's thorough-fares, crossing
                    the Appalachian Highlands and following the streams that directed them into the fertile lands to the
                    west. William Bundy and relatives crossing the Appalachian Highlands, where the barriers had been

            <p>Miles, the eldest child of Jeremiah and Betsey, was "bound out" at the age of
                    eleven. In the spring of 1816, he ran away and joined some neighbors who journeyed westward,
                    following the Wilderness Road to its terminal, <placeName>

                    joined Joseph Pool whose family followed the trail on packhorses to Vernon which had been platted
                    the previous year, 1815. The town consisted of three cabins, surrounded by a clearing here and there
                    with a cabin in the center. Joseph Pool chose a site for his round log cabin near a spring on the
                    south side of the South Fork of the Muscatatuck in the forest three miles east of Vernon in which
                    they lived until 1824 when he erected a large two-story house from brick he burned on the site. Just
                    across the creek from the Pool cabin was a camp of some of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> whose camps extended for several miles along the stream. They were under the control of
                    White Eyes and Big John. In the spring of 1817, they abandoned their camps and set out for the West.
                    Just before leaving some of the tribe came to the Pools and demanded meal.</p>
            <p>Their first year was full of hardships and privations. In the fall of 1816. their horses got loose
                    and the last of their corn meal had been made into corn pone. Joseph Pool and his thirteen year old

                    second child, said when reminiscing in her advanced age that "it was awful" while
                    they were gone, for the mother and the children lived on frost-bitten pumpkins, the children cried
                    and the wolves howled around the cabin. The summer was cool, frost came early and the winter of
                    1816–1817 was severe. One week in January the ice froze eighteen inches thick on the
                    Muscatatuck Creek. Then a thaw came and the creek was almost clear of ice and again it was frozen
                    sixteen inches or more thick. Scars that were made on the trees by the floating ice could be seen
                    for many years.</p>
            <p>Miles Bundy married Emilia (Milly) Pool, the eldest child of Joseph and Hannah Hooker Pool in 1819
                    and lived in a cabin across the Muscatatuck from the Pools for thirteen years. They obtained a
                    living by tilling the "clearing" and killing wild game. There were plenty of deer,
                    and turkeys were easily caught in rail pens. In the fall when the beechnuts were ripe, the passcnger
                    pigeons came in such large flocks that they darkened the air and at night they would roost in the
                    trees at their regular roosting places in such numbers that the limbs of the trees were often
                    broken. They obtained many of them for food with clubs at night. Every spring they made maple sugar.
                    One spring the young wife cared for two children and made two hundred pounds of sugar. She placed
                    the baby, Elizabeth Bundy (Patrick) in a sugar trough and carried Jeremiah so far from the boiling
                    sugar water that he could not reach the fire under the sap before she returned from gathering sap.

            <p>The father cut millstones and in this way was able to accumulate a small capital. He formed a
                    partnership with "Jim" Spaulding and erected a gristmill run by water power two
                    miles farther up the creek which was later known as the Wilson Mill. Then the family moved to the
                    site of the new mill, Their savings increased and in 1839 they purchased two hundred or more acres
                    of timberland on Crooked Creek, paying $1.25 an acre for government land. A cabin was
                    built which burned to the ground in 1840. That year with the <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-042-3-099"/>
                    help of his seven sons, he built one of the largest sawmills in the county. The dam was made of
                    limestone rocks and timber, the huge frame of hewed timber. During the spring months, the mill was
                    run night and day while the stream was being fed by rains and the melting snow. During the summer
                    months, his sons, John and Miles, hauled thousands of feet of poplar, walnut, and ash lumber with ox
                    teams over the dirt road to Vernon from which point it was shipped by rail to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be loaded on boats for the market at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When the little Crooked Creek was out of its banks in 1876, tha dam broke and was
                    never rebuilt for the supply of timber was exhausted, steam-driven mills were taking the place of
                    the older water-power mills.</p>
            <p>Another hard year was 1833 when a killing frost came the night of June 15. The tender new twigs on
                    the beech trees were about a foot in length and an abundant crop of green peaches about the size of
                    a quail's <hi rend="i">egg</hi> hung on the trees. The leaves, twigs, and fruit fell, and
                    many of the trees and shrubs were killed. On large areas in the flats or level swamplike land the
                    timber was killed which was afterward known as the "frost deaden."</p>
            <p>They were among the first members of the Baptist church which was organized at Vernon in 1817. On
                    horseback the father and mother each carried two children along the unimproved dirt road roughly
                    paralleling the North Fork of the Muscatatuck to Vernon to listen to the sermon of John Vawter, or
                    of Reverend Jesse Vawter. They were among the organizers of the Ebenezer Church, a Methodist church
                    erected on a plot of land adjoining their farm. Their large family of young people made the home a
                    place for social gatherings such as quiltings, dances, stirring off sugar, etc., which were attended
                    by the Moncriefs, Hiltons, Royles, Patricks, and Hinchmans. In cases of illness, Dr. Pabody, the
                    first physician to join the settlement at Vernon, was called. Dr. Gunn's book was often
                    consulted and a generous supply of "Smith's Ager Tonic" was kept on hand.</p>
            <p>The parents could write a legible hand, in fact, both of them had had instructions in the three
                    R's. The father helped "to raise" the first log schoolhouse on Crooked
                    Creek, which was equipped with puncheon floor, long benches, and a fireplace. He was appointed in
                    1841 as one of the three school commissioners. In this position he served for a number of years.
                    Many evenings all the thirteen children would gather <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-042-3-100"/> around the
                    fireplace and by a flickering yellow poplar torch drill for the neighborhood spelling school. Around
                    this fire was kindled the desire for learning that enabled one son to become judge of the circuit
                    court for a number of years, another enter the ministry, and several to serve the community as
                    teachers. Most of the grandchildren and many of the great-grandchildren entered the professions.</p>
            <p>The news came in 1863 that Morgan and his men were coming, and that, no doubt, there would be an
                    attack on Veron. The father hid the horses in a deep hollow, commonly known as a sinkhole. The small
                    amount of "shin-plasters" and bills were placed in a box and secreted in a
                    knothole in an apple tree. The two young sons, Miles and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, joined the handful of old men and boys that had assembled to protect Vernon. Various
                    verbal reports reached the home as to the number killed in a battle. Later, an authentic report came
                    that the inhabitants of Vernon with some of their treasures sought safety outside of the town, and a
                    few volunteers were formed in line of battle south of town. They refused to surrender to Morgan who
                    moved his forces south through the county towards Dupont.</p>
            <p>Miles not only endured the hardships that fell to the farmer-lumbermen and other citizens during the
                    Civil War, but death claimed his wife and daughter, Mary Ann. His youngest son Frank, accidently
                    shot himself. Shortly after the war closed, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> passed on. His children were Jeremiah, Nancy, Joseph Pool, Elizabeth (Betsy), George,
                    Hannah, Mary Ann, Emilia, John, Jane, Niles, Henry Clay, Benjamin Franklin. Jason, the eldest, died
                    at the age of a few months and was buried in the Baldwin Cemetery, one of the oldest in the
                        county.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>The family of Jeremiah Bundy endured the hardships and privations that were experienced by all the
                    members of the small groups who pushed the frontier northward across the Northwest Territory and
                    helped to block out the territory for settlement. Yet theirs is a record of longevity. The mother
                    reached the eighties, and Martha died at the age of ninety-one. Miles, Phineas, and Ephriam passed
                    on in the eighties. Records indicate that John and Hannah also enjoyed long lives. The family was a
