            <byline>PAUL MUSGRAVE</byline>
            <p>On May 29, 1933, hundreds of vigilantes captured three men in the woods just outside Culver, Indiana.
                    Their quarry was the last of a gang who had stolen more than $12,000 from the State
                    Exchange Bank in Culver that morning. Armed with shotguns, the robbers had entered the bank at 9:07;
                    while some of them watched over the bank's customers and employees, their leader ordered
                    the assistant cashier to open the vault, which the gang members then emptied. Alerted by a telephone
                    call from a bank employee in an adjacent office, a group of local vigilantes (soon numbering five
                    hundred, including ten officers from the Culver Military Academy) quickly mobilized and surrounded
                    the bank. Using two captives as human shields, the bandits ran to their getaway car. As they sped
                    away, the bank president's son, perched on a nearby building's roof, shot and
                    killed the driver. The car overturned, but the surviving bandits stole another one, leaving their
                    hostages in a ditch. <list type="footnotes">

                    their property and their communities. The Indiana Bankers Association (IBA) was the driving force
                    behind both the lobbying and the vigilance efforts.</p>
            <p>Because of the pivotal role the bankers played in the vigilance committee movement, I will refer to
                    its participants as "bank vigilantes." Bankers, and the vigilantes they sponsored,
                    were primarily concerned with order, not justice (except in the roughest sense). Examining their
                    actions offers a window onto democratic norms in Indiana. A student of policing reforms in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-uk">United Kingdom</country>
                    </placeName> writes, "decision-making power in policing â€¦ exemplifies the
                    fundamental conception of democracy present in that political system"; similarly, an expert
                    on the French police hypothesizes that "[t]he way in which the state ensures public order
                    in its national territory expresses the degree of development of democracy in that state, as much as
                    does its respect for public freedoms or the freedom of the press."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The
                    issue of how policing power is exercised is especially meaningful when the
                    "police" under scrutiny are fundamentally private agents funded primarily by
                    private groups with private aims.</p>
            <p>Evidence from the IBA and its magazine, the <hi rend="i">Hoosier Banker,</hi> as well as selected
                    archival documents from the association's sometime field secretary and contemporaneous
                    newspaper accounts of bank robberies, form the basis for this article. Although such sources present
                    almost exclusively the official line of the bank vigilante leadership, there are few alternatives to
                    relying on them. Other points of view are scarce: few writers defended the bank robbers, and the
                    robbers themselves rarely essayed justifications for their actions. But a close reading of the
                    available evidence reveals a fairly complete picture. Even among bankers, support for vigilantism
                    was far from unanimous, whether because of principle or fear. Popular attitudes toward bank robbers
                    were also complex: some criminals, such as John Dillinger, became celebrities. Viewed in context,
                    the <hi rend="i">Hoosier Banker's</hi> efforts at propagandizing for the vigilantes can be
                    read not just as self-congratulatory missives but as attempts to sway the general public and the
                    IBA's own membership. <list type="footnotes">

                    of attitudes in the general public, officialdom, and the banking community regarding vigilantism; in
                    so doing it sheds light on the evolution of the relationship of the state to society and on beliefs
                    about the legitimate use of force.</p>
            <p>WHAT A VIGILANTE WAS (AND WASN'T)</p>
            <p>Long associated with the American frontier, the term "vigilante" today suggests
                    "a nondescript midnight rider, blatantly ignorant, conventional, racist, and indiscriminate
                    in the use of violence against people and institutions."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In reality,
                    however, vigilantism was not confined to the West, and those who took part were not exclusively, or
                    even mainly, thugs. Between 1767 and 1910, Americans organized vigilante groups in almost every part
                    of the country, except for a few of the more settled eastern states.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Their
                    leaders were often members of the local elite, as were many of their followers and supporters. The
                    latter group included two presidents (Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt), at least five U.S.
                    senators, a congressman, eight governors, and scores of other officials, as well as business
                    leaders, such as Leland <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As one later commentator concluded, " [t]hese people were anything but
                    members of a backward, hell-for-leather rabble."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Nevertheless,
                    vigilantes (sometimes known as "regulators," because they attempted to
                    "regulate" the public's morals) were often brutal. The early
                    nineteenth-century English traveler William Faux, for example, recorded that after two men robbed
                    and killed a traveler, regulators hanged one thief and flogged the other almost to death. Another
                    group of regulators executed a murderer and left his head on a pole as a warning.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vigilante activity was recorded in Indiana at least as early as the 1820s.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    Between the 1820s and the late 1850s, there were doubtless vigilante groups scattered throughout the

                    organize such a group. An effort in the 1840s had failed because of ineptitude: the criminals
                    themselves had attended the committee's meetings.)<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Chief among the
                    Regulators' concerns was horse theft, a serious problem because horses were both a means of
                    transportation and a major financial asset. Indeed, many antebellum vigilante associations around
                    the country (including the Watchmen) focused on the issue.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> But the Regulators
                    also took it upon themselves to deal with robbery, burglary, arson, counterfeiting, and murder.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> In addition, they alleged that criminals' hiding places contained
                    "a number of lewd women," with "every allurement that men can use for the
                    ruin of your sons, to drag them down into the pit of infamy and shame." The pivotal moment
                    of a months-long campaign was the execution of a thief who had been convicted by a

                    been residents of this and the adjoining counties." After the execution, confessions
                    "became fashionable": "[Those questioned by the Regulators] would turn
                    pale and tremble, so that it was with much difficulty that they could answer questions-so strong
                    were their fears of being hung by the Regulators."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Like many nineteenth-century vigilantes, the Regulators believed that the primary purpose of a
                    criminal justice system was retribution (and thus the deterrence of other criminals), overriding
                    procedural niceties such as appeals or evidentiary standards. Mott justified the
                    Regulators' actions along such lines by invoking a sense of crisis: "the civil
                    laws are totally inadequate to the protection of the property of our citizens against the
                    depredations of the vampires, who curse the earth with their presences, living upon plunder taken
                    from the honest, the industrious, and often the indigent portion of the community." The
                    Regulators further defended their measures by arguing that</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>the people of this country are the real sovereigns, and that whenever the laws, made by those to
                        whom they have delegated their authority, are found inadequate to their protection, it is the
                        right of the people to take the protection of their property into their own hands, and deal with
                        these villains according to their just deserts.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>"[T]he will of the mass is the law of the land" in a democratic society, Mott
                    wrote, "whether it be [expressed] by legislative enactment, or by the spontaneous outburst
                    of indignation against a combined force that are plotting the ruin of the country."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> This right was enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, he contended,
                    but it was "a right which [a citizen] holds also by the charter given him by the God of the
                        universe."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Such ideas were common at the time. William Culberson,
                    a modern historian of vigilantism, summarizes the view: "If people had the right to make
                    their own laws and to elect their own officials, then in pioneer logic it followed that people had
                    the right to change laws or overrule officials." Thus, because "the
                    people" were "the ultimate and only legitimate basis for government,"
                    they "possess [ed] the right to reform, alter, or abolish their government at any
                    time" (and also, in the views of many, by any means).<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Since

                    assumed these functions as vigilantes-and saw their activities "as an act of public spirit

            <p>Not all private groups that employed violence were vigilance committees. Two relatively well-known
                    groups in Indiana history prove the point. The "white caps" were first recorded in
                    1887 in Indiana and later spread across the nation. White caps whipped those they accused of being
                    "wife beaters, drunkards, poor providers, immoral couples and individuals, lazy and
                    shiftless men, and petty neighborhood thieves." There are solid grounds for not classing
                    them as vigilantes. They operated wholly in secret, and their members usually wore masks or other
                    disguises-a far cry from the public (if illegal) trial the Regulators had held and the documents,
                    including constitutions, that mainstream vigilance committees made public.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    Furthermore, government officials condemned the actions of the white caps. After white caps attacked
                    two female students in Dunn Meadow in the heart of Indiana University's campus in April
                    1903, Governor Winfield Durbin informed the <placeName>

                    such opprobrium attached to the bank vigilantes twenty-five years later.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s was also not a vigilante society. True, some Klansmen organized
                    under the long-moribund state law that allowed citizens to form associations to catch horse thieves
                    and other criminals (the statute that had sanctioned the Regulators), but their activities were
                    mainly limited to helping the authorities prosecute those who violated Prohibition.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Despite the Klan's reputation, the group in the 1920s appears not to have

                    association held frequent meetings and "targeted bootleggers, gambling establishments, and
                    other moral transgressors," it rarely, if ever, used physical violence against minorities
                    (although one group of "night riders" apparently coerced an Asian immigrant into
                    leaving the area).<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The Klan hardly needed to resort to such crude tactics. It
                    exercised formidable power by other means: the group helped to elect the governor, a majority of
                    both houses of the General Assembly, most of the state's congressmen, and a host of local
                    officials. At its peak, the Klan's membership in Indiana included hundreds of thousands of
                    men in the KKK proper and tens of thousands more in the Women of the Ku Klux Klan and the Junior
                    Klan (a children's group)-more Hoosiers than belonged to the American Legion or the
                    Methodist church.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Most of the Klan's members apparently thought the
                    group was "little different from [the] Rotary or [the] Elks" (although, as
                    Safianow notes of the county in his study, "the Invisible Empire could not have achieved
                    such tremendous supportâ€¦ had there not been a strong base of bigotry to draw
                        on").<hi rend="sup">25</hi>Because the Klan refrained from organized violence and was
                    not principally an anti-crime group, it was not a vigilante society-although it is statistically
                    almost certain that the membership in the Klan and in the bank vigilantes' organizations
                    overlapped to some degree.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Nor is vigilantism synonymous with lynching. Lynch mobs normally lacked a discernible hierarchy,
                    assembled quickly, and dispersed immediately after the lynching. Vigilance committees, on the other
                    hand, were well-organized and lasted for weeks, months, or years. They held public meetings, adopted
                    constitutions and bylaws, and elected officers. They were also less bloodthirsty than lynch mobs.
                    Over the course of a century and a half, all vigilante groups combined probably killed fewer than a

            <p>CREATION, ORGANIZATION, AND ACTIONS OF THE BANK VIGILANTES</p>
            <p>The bank vigilantes of the 1920s and 1930s were superficially similar in some respects to earlier

                    at most, only the thinnest of legal sanctions. The differences, however, were more significant than
                    their similarities. On the frontier, vigilantes often operated in a legal vacuum and often
                    justified, even celebrated, their deeds as an expression of pure democracy. But the leaders of the
                    vigilante movement in the 1920s and 1930s saw their actions not only as the fulfillment of their
                    civic duty but as a temporary expedient necessitated by the <list type="footnotes">

                    and, most important, took up arms more grudgingly than had their predecessors. Indeed, the
                    vigilantes' sponsors and organizers sought to shift the burden of providing public order to

            <p>During the 1920s, the incidence of crimes that most concerned bankers, such as forgeries, burglaries,
                    and holdups, more than doubled in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> This increase in bank crime
                    paralleled a general increase in lawbreaking. By 1930, the average daily population of state penal
                    and correctional institutions was 6,499, an increase from 4,823 in 1925 and 2,930 in 1920. Indiana
                    sent about 8,600 men, women, and children to its jails and correctional institutions in 1930,
                    compared with 2,153 in 1920.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The 121.8 percent increase in the average
                    population of the state's jails and prisons and the 299.4 percent increase in the number of
                    commitments between 1920 and 1930 far outpaced the 11.2 percent increase in Indiana's
                    population over the same period. Banks were frequent targets of criminals, not least because there
                    were large numbers of them, especially in outlying areas, before the onset of the Great Depression
                    (and particularly before the Bank Holiday in 1933).</p>

                    were manifestly unsuited for their jobs. A study of Indiana law enforcement officials in 1934 found
                    that only one-third had educations beyond the eighth grade and that only five percent had attended
                        college.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Most policemen and sheriff's deputies entered law

                    1935 state report, had previous law enforcement experience, and all of whom had held their positions
                    for an average of only three years.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Law enforcement officials did not become more fit for their jobs the longer they stayed on the force.
                    An investigation by a state committee found that city police agencies frequently hired officers not
                    because of their ability or experience but rather because of their political connections. Such
                    hiring practices bred insecurity among officers, sixty percent of whom believed they would lose
                    their job if a different political party took office.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> The committee also
                    hinted at corruption in many municipal agencies: "[I]n many instances, [officers] are
                    selected not to apprehend all criminals, but to prevent the apprehension of certain classes or
                    groups." Sheriffs and their deputies, the committee concluded, were hardly in better shape:
                    "Few, if any, sheriffs have created a force out of their deputies that bear the slightest
                    resemblance to a modern police force."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Despite officers'
                    inexperience and lack of formal education, few agencies trained their officers after hiring them. As
                    a state commission wrote in 1935, "It seems that, contrary to the practice with reference
                    to other vocations and professions where a disciplinary training period is required, the

                    Although the officers of the State Motor Vehicle Police (created by the General Assembly in 1921)
                    patrolled the entire state, their authority was limited to apprehending automobile thieves. The
                    legislature expanded the motor vehicle police's jurisdiction slightly in 1925, but officers
                    still could not arrest a known criminal unless he violated traffic regulations.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The force's equipment and training were as minimal as its authority. An official
                    history of the Indiana State Police records that "[w]orn out cars and dilapidated
                    motorcycles were the only patrol vehicles." Since there was no statewide police radio,
                    officers had to telephone headquarters at thirty-minute intervals.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Most

            <p>Concerned by the inability of existing government institutions to fight crime, the IBA lobbied the

                        enforcement."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> In 1931, the Indiana Committee on Observance and
                    Enforcement of Law (a group appointed by Governor Harry Leslie which included the IBA's
                    then-president) also urged the creation of a state police force.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Observers

                    distributing fingerprint records, thus giving a sheriff in Noble County, for instance, the ability

                    identifying criminals by measurements of their body parts, also allowed the bureau to coordinate its

                        <hi rend="i">Hoosier Banker</hi> wrote), the General Assembly made it a felony for a convicted
                    felon to possess burglary tools with intent to commit a crime, and also declared burglary with
                    explosives, electricity, or gas a felony crime. Perhaps most important, the IBA satisfied the
                    "universal demand of bankers for drastic penalties for bank banditry" by securing
                    the passage of a bill providing for a minimum term of ten years for bank robbery-and a maximum term
                    of life.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    of protective groups."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> He attributed private citizens'
                    efforts to "defend their lives and their property from attack" to the ineptitude
                    of sheriffs and township constables, whom he called "ancient institutions tottering towards

            <p>In theory, following the report of a bank robbery, vigilante units in several counties would set up
                    roadblocks and pursue the bandits once sighted. Communications were crucial: although criminals
                    might be able to outrace sheriffs' deputies, they could not outrun the telephone. When the
                    plan worked, it brought impressive results. After a robbery in the hamlet of Mount Summit, some
                    vigilantes trailed the bandits while others telephoned neighboring cities with the news, alerting
                    the sheriff in <placeName>

                    robbers had been captured, had confessed, and had been sentenced to twenty-five years in jail.
                    (Ironically, the cashier of the Mount Summit State Bank was the chairman of the IBA's
                    statewide protective organization.)<hi rend="sup">70</hi> In December 1930, Hazel Haase, the chief

                    Citizens' Bank. During the pursuit, the robbers killed a deputy sheriff with machine-gun
                    fire. After cornering the bandits in a farm in nearby Sidell, <placeName>

                    attributed to the organization's "statewide Protective Plan" (as the

                    Fascination with criminals and criminality was hardly new; as Eric Hobsbawm writes, bandits have
                    often been considered "fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation,"
                    and he notes that although modern criminals are rarely seen as admirable, bank robbers in the 1930s

                    robbery is one in which the local authorities are local men â€¦ and where a few miles may
                    put the robber beyond the reach or even the knowledge of one set of authorities and into the
                    territory of another, which does not worry about what happens

            <p>The fact that, for a time, bank robbers could become admirable figures also reveals something about
                    public attitudes towards the bandits' targets. In a time of economic depression, such as
                    the 1920s in the rural Midwest, bankers were hardly popular figures; not only did they inspire envy
                    because of their association with money, but they were also the agents of the financial system
                    responsible for such tasks as foreclosing on family farms. Bank robbers struck at an institution
                    that drew mixed feelings, at best, from the general public. And if most of those who were <list type="footnotes">

                    detested the bandits, others could entertain a sort of admiration for them; as Hobsbawm writes,
                    bandits "are heroes not in spite of the fear and horror their actions inspire, but in some
                    ways because of them. They are not so much men who right wrongs, but avengers, and exerters of
                    power; their appeal is not that of the agents of justice, but of men who prove that even the poor
                    and weak can be terrible."<hi rend="sup">97</hi> The appeal of Dillinger and other 1930s
                    bank criminals suggests the lingering power of the <hi rend="i">idea</hi> of banditry.</p>
            <p>It is also interesting to speculate as to whether that myth of banditry allowed the vigilantes to see
                    themselves as mythic figures. The public comments of the vigilantes and their supporters did not
                    seem to reflect the idea that vigilantism was "an act of public spirit" that was
                    performed selflessly. Yet vigilantes, bankers, and media supporters alike appeared to share the
                    conceit that vigilantism was at once a burden and an opportunity to settle a serious problem in a
                    relatively simple and direct way. Public opinion about the causes of the crime wave of the 1920s and
                    1930s appears to have been equally straightforward, allowing vigilantes to portray themselves as
                    heroes confronting thugs and to condemn those who did not take up arms. As vigilantes, common men
                    and women could also be "exerters of power"; even more appealingly, their
                    exertions enjoyed the sanction of local law enforcement and the social elite.</p>
            <p>Noticeably absent from the rhetoric of bankers, vigilantes, police, and sheriffs alike were
                    considerations of rights and due process, which take center stage in criminal justice debates today.
                    These issues were of minor, and in most cases no, importance, even to professional lawmen of the
                    time. As one Buffalo police official told a reporter, " â€˜My oath of office
                    requires me to protect this community. If I have to violate that oath of office or violate the
                    Constitution, I'll violate the Constitution.â€™ "<hi rend="sup">98</hi>
                    Both law enforcement officials and the general public subscribed to a paradigm which Herbert Packer
                    termed the Crime Control Model, which held that the criminal justice system <list type="footnotes">

                            limited. There must then be a premium on speed and finality. Speed, in turn, depends on

                            than through the formal process of examination and cross-examination in a court; it follows

                    </quote> Such a system presumes that a suspect, once apprehended, is guilty. The premises of this
                    model mirror the Regulators' justifications of their actions and the media's
                    praise of the bank vigilantes. Today, Packer argues, far more people subscribe to the Due Process
                    Model, which postulates that the presumption of innocence is more than just a formality in the
                    investigation and prosecution of suspected criminals. In other words, what would today seem to be
                    the natural grounds for opposing vigilantism were not a major factor in the debate of the 1920s and
                    1930s; those who did not join a vigilante group out of principle were probably not acting out of
                    concern about possible violations of criminals' rights.</p>
            <p>If there was no broad public outpouring of support for the vigilantes (and the size of the
                    committees' membership, although numbering in the thousands in each of several states,
                    including Indiana, was not massive), there was also no broad public rejection of their goals or
                    means, which suggests that the vast bulk of the public acquiesced in the vigilantes'
                    activities. That is significant. Although willing to tolerate the exercise of extralegal violence
                    when sanctioned by the state, Americans displayed a "sudden preoccupation with the
                    distinction between legitimate and illegitimate political coercion" during and after World
                    War I, laying the groundwork for what historian Christopher Capozzola terms "the legal and
                    political dismantling of vigilantism in the twentieth century." Thus,

                    the result of the same community-based democratic sanctioning that the Regulators had relied upon
                    (formalized through the blessing of the community's democratically elected local
                    law-enforcement agents) and of the impulse toward the maintenance of order that had long
                    characterized vigilance committees, but a method through which the administrative apparatus of the
                    state could cooperate with a politically and economically powerful group (albeit one whose aims were
                    less objectionable than those of, say, Pinkertons in the service of industrialists).</p>
            <p>In 1933, newly inaugurated Governor Paul V. McNutt, with neartotal control of the General Assembly,
                    secured the creation of the Indiana State Police. As a result, by 1934 the bank vigilante movement
                    was nearly at an end. The IBA turned its attention toward raising $100,000 to support the
                    construction of a state police radio network, which the association said would dramatically increase
                    the force's ability to coordinate their efforts.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> After the police

                    explicitly warned readers that although "most banks have revolvers, alarms, tear gas and
                    other subterfuges," it was "seldom advisable to try to use a weapon."
                    Instead, bankers being robbed should "observe, <hi rend="i">observe,</hi> and

                    broader evolution of popular political beliefs. The nineteenth-century idea of a privileged

                            companies were offering locking equipment and alarm systems that, in combination with an

                    the local authorities. That idea was, in turn, replaced by a belief in the priority of the state
                    government over local institutions. These changes suggest that Indiana's police reforms
                    were not simply a technical reform of a police force that had become obsolete and was widely
                    recognized as such. The creation of the State Police redressed some of Indiana law
                    enforcement's structural deficiencies, but there were more factors at work. The new balance
                    struck between local groups (both the targets of crime, and the politicians and others who had a
                    vested interest in the old system) and the state should be viewed as the negotiation of a new social
                    contract between citizens, communities, and the state government. That the new professional
                    law-enforcement regime the State Police represented was only superimposed on the existing obsolete
                    structure is a testament to the enduring power of parochial interests in Indiana's
                    political system.</p>
            <p>Technological and economic changes undoubtedly contributed to the new compact: it was far more
                    difficult to train, equip, and coordinate thousands of vigilantes across an entire state than it had
                    been for nineteenth-century citizens to organize against a handful of criminals. Combating modern
                    criminal organizations required a professional force that could only be funded and managed by state
                    government. And as the burden of ensuring order increased, so too did the incentives for individuals
                    not to contribute to the provision of this public good; why, after all, should someone voluntarily
                    pay for something that would otherwise have cost him nothing? (Such free-riding problems are major
                    challenges for private law-enforcement mechanisms.)<hi rend="sup">104</hi> For the purposes of this
                    essay, however, the essential point is that these changes followed the creation of a new political
                    reality in which, for practical purposes, the entire citizenry agreed that private agents'
                    freedom to use violence for aims that they defined as public goods would henceforth be dramatically
                    curtailed. In Weberian terms, a traditional justification for the legitimate use of force finally
                    yielded to a wholly legal one, in which force was only "exercised by the modern
                    'servant of the state."<hi rend="sup">105</hi> The vigilantes did not <list type="footnotes">

                    twentieth centuries, women became more concerned with addressing problems in their industrial city
                    than with challenging the structures of patriarchal society. Nevertheless, through female-only clubs
                    they acquired new public roles and greater confidence, necessary building blocks for a future
                    suffrage movement. In the second decade of the twentieth century, energized by the growing state and

                    </placeName> women faced generations of deep resistance. Despite the social changes that came with
                    industrialization and rapid population growth, in the nineteenth century few Hoosiers, indeed few
                    Americans, supported changes in traditional gender roles. Beginning in the decade after the Civil

                    </placeName> women faced a different but equally intractable opposition. Fearing that women would
                    use the vote for prohibition, politicians and business leaders representing the city's
                    majority German American population blocked legislative efforts and stifled popular support until
                    the final years leading up to the Nineteenth Amendment. The connection of suffrage to temperance, a
                    relationship that in other states brought women into the political process, was highly detrimental
                    to the growth of the suffrage movement in Fort <placeName>

                    Lucretia Mott became conscious of their own gender limitations. Beginning in the 1840s they called
                    on women to pursue meaningful activities and, above all, to assert their right to determine their
                    own lives. The goals of the pioneer feminist abolitionists were to liberate people both in their

            <p>Thomas's commitment to establishing a career as a physician, however, delayed her

            <p>By nature, Beulah Ninde seemed less inclined than Mary Thomas to take on a public voice, making her
                    participation harder to trace. In addition, health concerns-the loss of twins in childbirth in 1852
                    and a pregnancy in the spring of 1854-likely delayed her participation in reform activities.
                    Nevertheless, in the decade before the Civil War, Ninde maintained ties to the Indiana WRA, serving
                    as an officer in 1856 and 1857, and remained active in temperance reform.</p>

                    or her husband Lindley) also voiced support for woman's right to enter the public sphere.

            <p>As temperance initiatives met stiff resistance, men and women together organized Grand Templar

            <p>While feminists found an avenue for promoting women's rights in temperance reform, the

                    Civil War, there was little local support. This became particularly evident in January 1859, when

                    Western Woman Suffrage Association, was praised as being "as sharp as a steel
                    trap" and able to keep "her audience spellbound by her eloquence."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For two days, speakers supported resolutions affirming the right of married women to make contracts,
                    own property, and control their own earnings. Echoing arguments made twenty years earlier,
                    women's rights supporters affirmed that enlarging woman's sphere of influence
                    would serve "the true interests of the Government, the Church, and the Family."
                    They saw suffrage as a means to correct "all the wrongs women now suffer as a
                    class."</p>
            <p>Claiming the expertise of twenty years of legal practice, Lindley Ninde called woman's
                    current legal status "unnatural" and the principal of unequal treatment
                    "at variance with every demand of morality and justice." Catharine Waite and
                    Hazlett stressed the need for equal opportunities for women, including the means to support
                    themselves, at the same time acknowledging woman's traditional domestic role.
                    "[U]ntil the time shall come that woman can enjoy the same privilege [as men] we cannot
                    have a republic in fact as well as in deed," Waite said. The greatest curse of our nation
                    was "the aristocracy of sex." Assuring her audience that voting would not
                    interfere with women's duties at home, she stressed the urgency of national housekeeping,
                    which "will never be properly performed until there is a more complete blending of the
                    duties and influence of men and women."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>On the second day, the convention elected officers and drew up a constitution for an <placeName>

                    and Lindley Ninde, were appointed as well.</p>

                            temperance in the newspaper account, but it is likely that local activist Junia Aveline
                            spoke about the importance of suffrage for temperance reform: "Mrs. Aveline made a
                            short address decidedly practical, and those who have passed through the trials and
                            oppressions that were there portrayed, can not consistently withhold their support from this
                            question."</item>

                    remained "very large notwithstanding the rainy weather." Seventy people signed the
                    charter as members. The <hi rend="i">Daily Gazette</hi> optimistically concluded that
                    "[t]he convention, as a whole, has been a decided success." Yet in the next
                    day's newspaper, McNiece also stressed the deep community resistance.
                    "[Established custom is a hard thing to fight," he wrote. "The error has
                    to be hammered into the ears of the people a long time before they can comprehend it."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Two years later, in February 1873, three of the most dynamic women of the day lectured to Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> audiences, generating interest, if not support, for the fledgling suffrage movement.
                    Speaking before packed auditoriums, Mary Livermore, Anna Dickenson, and Susan B. Anthony charmed
                    their audiences with addresses described as "fascinating," very
                    instructive," "brave and truthful." In a speech that she would deliver
                    hundreds of times-"What Shall We Do With Our Daughters?"-Livermore urged girls to
                    be self-reliant, healthy, and welleducated. Provoking frequent applause, Dickenson bluntly urged
                    women to strive for greatness and not to settle for low-paying jobs. "Let women undergo the
                    same training and she will fare the same as men," she said. Anthony gave "a
                    compact legal and constitutional argument for voting in the recent presidential election which would
                    have done credit to the best lawyers in the city." The speakers' challenges
                    apparently provoked little public debate.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the same weeks in 1873, opposition to temperance surfaced as never before, revealing the
                    growing city's deep German American roots. Temperance supporters had recently scored a
                    statewide victory with the General Assembly's passage of the Baxter Bill, which closed down
                    local unlicensed saloons (estimated to number well over 200 in Fort <placeName>

                    Americans, now comprising more than one-fourth of the city's population, hailed John

            <p>Almost simultaneously, however, the German American community charged Marine with having slandered
                    "a certain class of Germans" in a recent out-of-town speech. Mayor Zollinger,
                    Sarnighausen, and other leaders of the German community, as well as over 500 local citizens, called
                    for Marine to appear before "an indignation meeting" to explain himself. Despite
                    efforts to make peace, Marine became the target of heated charges. The local Democratic newspaper,
                    the Sentinel, described him as "a strenuous advocate of the temperance cause, and likewise
                    of woman suffrage." At the "mass meeting," a prominent German American
                    expressed the fear of many of his fellow immigrants, charging that Marine and other temperance
                    supporters wanted "to get woman suffrage and â€˜abolish all foreignersâ€™
                    and possess themselves of their property." The deep and bitter battle between liquor

            <p>The conflict probably contributed to the somber mood and low attendance that marked the state
                    women's rights meeting at the end of May. Hoping to distance themselves from the temperance
                    issue, attendees voted down resolutions urging women suffrage supporters to back political
                    candidates who were "avowed friends of temperance" and committed to
                    "giving the ballot to women." Newspaper reports instead recorded "strong
                    and sensible" speeches on behalf of woman suffrage delivered by featured speakers.
                    "[W]omen have right and justice on their side [so] that it will be impossible to resist the
                    movement which has been inaugurated," McNiece argued. As she had three years earlier,
                    Hazlett gave "a rousing speech" that stressed the injustice of denying half of the
                    population "the inalienable right of suffrage." Progress was now being made, she

                    quickly smothered hope for rational dialogue. "That woman will give her support to the
                    temperance cause cannot for a moment be doubted, but it will be such misdirected and wrong headed
                    support as will tend to promote and expand the very evil which is to be removed."
                    Furthermore, the <hi rend="i">Sentinel'</hi>s editor charged, "The strongest
                    argument against woman suffrage â€¦ is that woman is not possessed of good
                    judgement." Referring to the moral zeal of temperance crusaders, the Sentinel further
                    criticized the "tendency among the ladies of the woman suffrage reform to square everything
                    by the rule of moral equity." For the time being, popular opinion in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> likely confirmed the editor's opinion that "both sexes [were] for the
                    most part entirely indifferent to the whole question."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another underlying, often unstated, objection to woman suffrage was the expectation that
                    woman's place was in the home and that this would be undermined by the goals of the
                    woman's rights movement. On the national level this debate was being played out in
                    Anthony's failure to gain backing from labor leaders. Working-class men, threatened by
                    possible competition in the workplace, rejected Anthony's appeals for woman's
                    right to support herself. Furthermore, within German workingclass family traditions, women in
                    particular were sharply defined in terms of family responsibilities. Suffrage and women's
                    rights ran counter to deep social and religious traditions that placed women in a subservient
                    relationship to men.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>Despite its obvious unpopularity, the women's temperance crusade had a small number of local
                    converts who, like antebellum reformers, fervently believed in woman's special mission to
                    reform society and liberate her sisters. Foremost among Fort <placeName>

            <p>Moral reformers nevertheless found other causes that would advance their mission to alleviate social
                    problems in their rapidly growing industrial city. Two initiatives in particular, both begun in the
                    1870s, illustrate the continued tradition of female benevolence and moral reform together with a new
                    unsentimental direction. In both efforts, women found new public and feminist voices.</p>
            <p>In 1873 Beulah Ninde helped organize and manage a Home for the Friendless to care for indigent women,

                    larger cities. Caring for over 400 women during the home's ten-year existence, Ninde and
                    other women officers relied on contributions from the city's evangelical churches and from

            <p>Reaching further into the community, in February 1878 women from a broad cross-section of Protestant
                    churches organized the Ladies' Benevolent Society to identify impoverished families and
                    coordinate efforts of local charities. While their goals reflected a decided concern for alleviating
                    poverty, the women were also determined to exercise efficient administration. For example, as part
                    of their plan of implementation, a board of women visitors was assigned to each ward in the city to
                    seek the "most important information" by means of "personal and careful
                    inquiry." In this effort, Fort <placeName>

                    silenced by male politicians and community leaders, especially those from the German American
                    community. How many women were deterred from or brought into the women's rights movement by
                    meeting such resistance is impossible to guess. What is certain is that an increasing number of
                    local women were taking on new public roles. Refusing to be silenced, Fort <placeName>

            <p>In 1881 woman suffrage advocates, now prominently associated with temperance, gained strong support
                    in the Indiana General Assembly. Due to their efforts, as well as memorials and petitions from
                    thousands of women, the General Assembly passed bills to allow women to vote for presidential
                    electors and to amend the state constitution so that women could vote in all elections. Zeralda

                    required approval by two consecutive assemblies and then a popular vote.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for the cause of suffrage, the 1881 General Assembly had also passed an amendment in
                    favor of a far less popular cause: prohibition. Women from twenty-nine counties had sent memorials

                    </placeName> women's lack of participation in the 1881 and 1883 elections was
                    understandable, if disappointing. Under Frances Willard's leadership of the national WCTU,
                    suffrage and temperance had become closely intertwined, making suffrage all the more controversial
                    in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Moreover, a general resignation seemed to freeze women's reform initiatives.
                    The city's first WCTU chapter had apparently disbanded, for in the spring of 1882 it was
                    reorganized by representatives of Protestant churches led by Susan Creighton Williams. Political
                    involvement in the 1883 election was not recorded. In the following years, newspaper notices
                    reported only occasional WCTU meetings, and those avoided political engagement. For example, in
                    October 1885 the WCTU invited the public to prayer services at the temperance headquarters. If
                    suffrage and temperance were not completely dormant issues, they were, as historian Stephen Buechler
                    observed, clearly in "a state of drift and uncertainty."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    indefatigable Susan B. Anthony. Recognizing the lack of progress on the state level, these leaders
                    were visiting each Indiana congressional district to generate support for the sixteenth amendment to
                    the Constitution during the next session of Congress. Simultaneously, the women stressed the
                    importance of electing supportive legislators to the next Indiana Assembly.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    common among many women's rights leaders, arguing that women were "more deserving
                    of and better qualified to exercise the right of suffrage than the negro and the thousands of
                    ignorant voters in whose hands it was now placed." Given Anthony's reservations
                    about linking suffrage with temperance, she not surprisingly delivered only a "brief
                    talk," nevertheless impressing her audience with her "clear and powerful voice,
                    which makes her language impressive and her arguments real." Officers elected to serve the
                    newly organized twelfth district suffrage association once again included pioneer leader Beulah

            <p>Suffrage and temperance soon faded again from the public forum. Clearly, the description of the 1880s

                    </placeName>. The first generation of impassioned moral reformers was dying. Beginning in the 1890s,
                    however, newly formed women's clubs began to bring women into dynamic new female networks.

                    higher educational levels, more free time, and perhaps above all else, a need for meaningful
                    self-expression-brought women together in a quickly spreading popular phenomena, the
                    woman's club. Not only did clubs provide alternatives to the controversial temperance and
                    suffrage groups; they offered members organizational experience and an emphasis on social
                    responsibility. Historian Karen J. Blair argues that club women were able to maintain their
                    traditional domestic values while pursuing new feminist agendas.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>Events involving the Woman's Club League in the winter and spring of 1898 suggest the
                    gradual progress women were making in the public arena. The league's quarterly meeting in
                    January included, in addition to the accustomed entertainment and socialization, a
                    "scholarly" lecture by former mayor Chauncey Oakley, who stressed women's
                    key role in future politics. "Many branches of municipal power would be improved by having
                    women occupying positions on their boards," he stated, and optimistically predicted that
                    women would soon be serving as city officials. In May, local religious leaders placed women
                    preachers or speakers in "every pulpit but two" in the city to acknowledge the
                    biennial convention of the National Federation of Women's clubs then meeting in <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> women extended their roles as municipal housekeepers. Working through the Civic
                    Department, women cleaned up downtown alleys "for the purpose of demonstrating how the
                    alleys in the city ought to be cleaned." They built playgrounds and established sanitary
                    drinking fountains. Supporting the work of the Civic Improvement Association, they urged all women
                    to learn about efforts underway to beautify their city. Other initiatives included pressuring the
                    police department to enforce a juvenile curfew and hire a police matron, and convincing stores to
                    close early on Saturday evenings. For such projects, the Women's Club League generally
                    appeared to have the approval of the city's male power structure.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In other cases, local officials showed extreme disregard for women's opinions. In December
                    1909, members of the Women's League wrote to Mayor Jesse Grice, encouraging him to enforce
                    laws and ordinances that were "subject of flagrant violation or neglect." At the
                    top of their list were unenforced child labor and child neglect laws. Three years later, Grice
                    finally replied to the letter, stating that the women's concerns were either unwarrranted
                    or had been corrected.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    silenced. The controversy concerned legislation introduced in the Indiana General Assembly by state
                    labor leaders and the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs to shorten the work hours of
                    children under sixteen in the state's factories. Fort <placeName>

                    investigated local factories that employed large numbers of children and stayed with a personal
                    friend, local club woman Mary McCrea Wilson. When legislative hearings began in January 1911, Wilson

                    lobbying state politicians to support the child labor bill.</p>
            <p>Sponsors of the bill advocated a forty-eight-hour work week, a proposal that seriously affected Fort <placeName>

                    fifty-five hours a week. At hearings before the Indiana General Assembly in January, company
                    president Theodore F. Thieme, his brother Frederick, and other state industrialists bitterly fought
                    the legislation. Reflecting the businessmen's influence, the child labor bill that finally
                    passed limited the work week to fifty hours, fifty-four with parental permission-a minor victory at

                    Woman suffrage in municipal elections would "secure clean politics, clean homes, pure
                    morals and right living on the part of every man, woman and child in the municipality."

                    repeated efforts by Indiana suffragists and temperance leaders to push legislation through the
                    General Assembly. Nevertheless, valuable experiences in their community through women's
                    clubs and charity work, together with growing support from mainstream churches, guided women into
                    new public roles. Women's issues were now to be taken seriously, even if political and
                    business forces were still largely aligned against suffrage. This time, as suffrage supporters
                    organized and finally gained local support, they began to distance themselves from their WCTU
                    sisters.</p>
            <p>When Myra Strawn Hartshorn, chair of the Cook County Suffrage Committee, spoke to the Fort <placeName>

                    academic credentials, professional writing experience, and traditional role as "a devoted
                    mother of two babies." Certainly Hartshorn's newspaper photograph with her
                    children added an aura of domesticity to offset any suggestions of militancy. It was the content of
                    her speech, however-"New Educational Methods in Suffrage"-that won ready converts.
                    If women were more aware of the conditions of women sweatshop workers, she told her audience, they
                    would realize the importance of electing political representatives to serve the needs of society.
                    Appealing directly to the Woman's Club membership, Hartshorn also stressed statistics
                    showing women's growing educational achievements: "You can't keep
                    political power out of the hands of the educated class." Finally, the speaker urged Fort <placeName>

                    and state government and to learn where their elected officials stood on such subjects as wages and
                    working conditions for women. There was no doubting the next morning's newspaper report
                    that "Mrs. Hartshorn's successful lecture" had "stirred up the

                    practices widely used to recruit new members, club women also held teas in political wards. In a

                    </placeName> women, led by Guldlin, demonstrated a new assertiveness. Guldlin was the single female
                    member of the civic improvement association, and she (along with the Woman's Club League)
                    supported a $200,000 bond initiative to improve the city's riverbanks and build
                    boulevards. Guldlin put city council members on notice that women were eligible to vote at the ward
                    meetings where such issues were decided: "You see the women can vote as well as the men at
                    the ward meetings which are being held with the city council," she said. Unfortunately, the
                    meeting of the Sixth Ward was crowded with citizens living nearest the land donated for a city park.
                    The neighbors opposed the proposal, and Guldlin was accompanied by only two other women supporters.
                    When they asked if they might vote, the acting chairman told the women that only legal voters were
                    so entitled. The bond issue was then soundly defeated by a vote of 350 to 166.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    women, including state federation officers and guest speakers. Beginning the luncheon with a rousing
                    suffrage song, the women expressed great confidence in their future victory, celebrating their

                    "Recent Franchise Victories." While another speaker stressed that suffrage should
                    not be the organization's main priority, discussions were nevertheless lively and
                    enthusiastic. At a meeting at the end of December, Martha Ridenour, president of the local chapter,
                    described their organization as "one of the greatest working forces for the enfranchisement
                    of women" and stressed that the WCTU intended to work harder the next year.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    </placeName> suffragists generally resembled suffragists elsewhere. Most had college educations,
                    were Anglo-American, and were active in a variety of organizations. Those who were married often had
                    husbands who were prominent in the community. Single women were predominantly professionals and
                    civic leaders. Following national patterns, African American women, except for a limited presence in
                    the WCTU, were excluded. Suffrage groups and the WCTU now mostly attracted separate memberships

                    </placeName> women adopted a moderate, independent, largely non-controversial course. During the

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> women had little direct involvement. They also were not active in the Legislative
                    Council of Indiana Women, an ambitious lobby, formed in 1914, representing eight leading
                    women's organizations and some 80,000 women. Avoiding conflict with Democratic politicians,

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

            <p>During these years of building public support, two events stand out as particular successes. In early
                    May 1914, male community leaders sponsored a well-attended Suffrage Day celebration at the Jefferson
                    Theatre. Part of the program included showing "moving pictures" celebrating
                    renowned political suffragists and the recent defeat of corrupt politicians. Dr. Warren Calvin, a

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    political corruption in their own community if they were to have the vote. Rev. Arthur J. Folsum,
                    pastor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Congregational Church, and WCTU supporter, went even further: "One point that
                    I desire to emphasize is the fact of woman's intelligence. Living in an age of progress
                    along all lines of science, industry, morals and education, we are standing for political equality
                    for all persons independent of sex." The following year, suffragists invited every woman in

                    </placeName> was steadily increasing, suffragists still faced formidable opposition from politicians
                    allied with the liquor industry. In February 1915, a WCTU-sponsored bill granting women partial
                    suffrage cleared the Indiana Senate and was assigned to a House committee. Unfortunately, a
                    statewide prohibition bill was pending at the same time, and politicians again linked the two
                    issues. Lobbyists for the brewing industry, led by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName>'s former state senator Fleming, crowded the State House and opponents defeated

            </p>
            <p>Despite the liquor lobby's obvious show of power, dynamics were in place to change public
                    opinion. With the outbreak of World War I, anti-prohibitionists, German Americans, and by
                    association, anti-suffragists, were looked upon by a growing number of citizens as anti-American;
                    liquor lobbyists became associated with dirty politics. In the summer of 1916 suffragists by the
                    hundreds exerted new pressure at national political conventions to persuade Republicans and
                    Democrats to adopt suffrage platforms.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

                    Woman's Club League, served as hostesses at the woman's building.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In February 1917, Indiana suffragists finally scored their first true victory in the state General
                    Assembly. A predominantly Republican legislature approved a law giving women the right to vote for

            <p>Indiana suffragists experienced a hard-earned banner year in 1919. The Indiana General Assembly and
                    Governor James P. Goodrich quickly approved bills granting women presidential suffrage and calling
                    for a change in Indiana's constitution to grant women equal voting rights. In addition, the
                    General Assembly enthusiastically endorsed a memorial supporting the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.</p>

                    </placeName> women worked with state Woman's Franchise League officers to assure
                    ratification by the Indiana General Assembly in the year ahead. As in their many earlier campaigns,
                    however, suffragists would find no simple conclusion. Only after months of maneuvering did Governor
                    Goodrich agree, on December 31, to call an extra, one-day session of the state legislature.
                    Furthermore, his offer was contingent upon suffragists' securing promises from all state
                    legislators that they would consider suffrage only. Two weeks later, on January 16, 1920, Indiana
                    suffragists saw their work pay off when the Indiana General Assembly enthusiastically ratified the
                    Susan B. Anthony Amendment, making Indiana the twentysixth state to grant full suffrage to women
                    under the Constitution. The journey that had begun almost seventy years earlier would grind on for

                    pioneer women leaders championed the bold early goals of the women's rights movement. In
                    the final decades of the nineteenth century, however, suffragists were derailed by the intense
                    battle orchestrated by liquor interests against prohibition and, by association, suffrage.
                    Retreating from political controversy, women addressed social problems in their communities. They
                    found new public voices and meaningful roles through charitable work and women's clubs.
                    When public opinion made suffrage fashionable, women threw their tremendous energy and ability into

                    deep cultural resistance to social change. While women forged new public roles and made significant
                    contributions to their community, it can also be argued that their successes were guarded and
                    delayed. When their initiatives challenged political or business leaders, they were silenced. Unlike

                    </placeName>, as elsewhere, the WCTU served as a bridge that led women from concern for their home
                    and family to concern for the public good and ultimately, a commitment to suffrage.</p>
            <p>One question that deserves particular consideration is the degree to which suffragists'
                    experiences in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> differed from those of women in other areas characterized by resistance to the feminist
                    cause. Indiana had a reputation for being extremely conservative, even lagging behind other Midwest
                    states in political, social, and cultural change. In fact, suffrage leader Carrie Chapman Catt
                    considered Indiana one of five states that presented the most difficulties for gaining suffrage.
                    Certainly the control of the Indiana General Assembly by allies of liquor industries, as well as the
                    opposition of the Indiana Supreme Court, created formidable roadblocks to suffrage. Yet within such
                    a difficult political arena, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> suffragists seemed even more powerless and resigned than other Indiana reformers.
                    Moreover, existing studies suggest that Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> suffragists were more delayed in women's advocacy than their counterparts in <placeName>

               </placeName>, centers for large breweries and large populations
                    of German American and other foreign-born citizens with traditions of alcohol use. Milwaukee club
                    women, for example, pressured city officials to appoint a woman to the school board as early as
                    1895. Women of Waukesha, <placeName>

                    </placeName> women joined the campaign for reorganization of their city government. Backed by a
                    prominent businessmen's association, women formed a suffrage association <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-102-3-077"/> two years later. By comparison, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> club women did not begin to push for a woman on the local school board until 1913, and
                    their goal was not realized until 1921. While suffragists received some support from male religious,
                    business, and labor leaders, until the final years leading up to the passage of the Nineteenth
                    Amendment, most business and political leaders were firm opponents.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    </placeName> women gained new public roles and contributed much to the progress of their industrial

                    demonstrated a passion for voting rights that could only have come from a hard-earned sense of
                    dignity and opportunity. Their long-awaited political and social empowerment was a testimony to
                    their many decades of commitment.</p>

                    conservatism of the place-no federal money, support of anti-communist crusades, certain church
                    members pushing me in the direction of a personal interpretation of religion as opposed to drawing
                    out the relevance of religious principles to the public realm, commitment to a prevailing <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-102-3-079"/> orthodoxy and antipathy toward anything heterodox, a strong
                    John Birch Society presence, that sort of thing. I was even called a communist at a cocktail party
                    because I was wearing a red sport coat! The Sunday before the 1964 election, someone plastered all
                    the cars in our church parking lot with Goldwater leaflets. My new city did not strike me as quite
                    as open and welcoming of diversity (of race and of opinion) as cities I had previously lived in (<placeName>

                    welcome you, and then stand back for ten years to see how you do." All this made me
                    slightly uncomfortable.</p>

                    from the place that you first experienced in 1963, or even from the place you looked out the window
                    at on your first day as mayor in 1976? How much of this change is typical of urban America, and how
                    much of it reflects the unique flavor and history of <placeName>

               <hi rend="b">WH:</hi> Cities are organisms. They change all the time. They don't stand
                    still. Dick Lugar and his colleagues put Unigov and G1PC (The Greater <placeName>

                    greatly expanded the participation), and my administration tried to build on those foundations.
                    Looking out my 25th-floor window on my first day in office, as it were, it seemed as though our
                    central city was hollowing out, the victim of urban disinvestment. It also seemed as though we
                    needed to be more inclusive, and perhaps more willing to think outside the box and less reluctant to
                    take risks. We established a substantial list of priorities: neighborhood redevelopment, downtown
                    revitalization, improvement of police-community relations, a strong financial standing, and a
                    strategy for economic development that emphasized sports as a point of leverage. In order to
                    accomplish these goals, our policies were to encourage downtown reinvestment without discouraging
                    suburban investment, to maintain a Triple-A bond rating, to create an internal audit department and
                    have external auditors look at our books and report to the public in timely fashion, to make our
                    city as safe as possible, to promote a public /private partnership, to establish Labor and
                    Neighborhood advisory councils, to increase the percentages of women and minorities in the police
                    and fire departments, to upgrade the role of minorities in the city decision-making process, to save
                    the Pacers and attract an NFL franchise. And a few other things too!</p>

               <hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> You've mentioned the structures that shaped your term in office. One
                    of them, Unigov, has to be counted one of the most significant innovations in urban governance of
                    the last century. Does Unigov still offer a model for other metropolitan areas to follow? And do you
                    feel that it has gone far enough in rectifying the inequities of service and revenue that affect
                    American metropolitan areas?</p>

               </placeName>- have failed, due to opposition from the suburban
                    constituencies that had to vote on this matter.</p>
            <p>Unigov represented a dramatic and successful initiative to reform governance structures in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It had several benefits, even though it also aroused opposition and lawsuits. By
                    incorporating the suburbs in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> into the city, it widened the city's tax base, thus helping to stabilize city
                    finances and achieve a Aaa bond rating; it created a larger sense of "family" and
                    enabled business and civic leaders who resided in the suburbs to become more active in civic affairs
                    (neither I nor Bart Peterson would have been eligible to run for mayor, without Unigov); it gave
                    minority interests a larger voice in governance; it made service delivery (planning and zoning,
                    streets, trash pickup, parks, etc.) more efficient; and it centralized leadership in the office of a
                    strong mayor system. Unigov did not consolidate schools, tax rates, township and city fire and
                    police departments, nor any jurisdictions beyond <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, and it left intact the governmental structures in the excluded cities of Lawrence, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Speedway and Homecraft. Thus it was not a complete consolidation. It was a
                    compromise-politics being the art of the possible. I personally feel the school districts should be
                    rearranged so that the county is divided pie-shape into eight districts ranging from the center to
                    the outer county boundaries, because that would resolve some of the desegregation problems that have
                    existed over the years and eliminate <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Schools, which has always seemed to have problems. But of course that will
                    probably never happen. Nor will annexation of territories beyond <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>, even though Unigov is bursting at the seams, and the regional dimensions of land use
                    and transportation planning require regional solutions. Also, I am pleased that the current city
                    administration has been working hard on consolidating police and fire services in the county.</p>
            <p>Around the country, Unigov is admired as a bold step forward, precipitated not by a crisis but by
                    reformist zeal, and several communities, such as the ones mentioned above, would like to have a
                    similar system. Today, jurisdictional boundaries that were created in the nineteenth century are
                    obsolete, because the metropolitan form has morphed from a heliocentric design, with a large central
                    city and bedroom suburbs, into something resembling a constellation, with many nodes of independent

                    land development, job force training, environmental degradation, and economic development-cutting
                    across jurisdictional lines. In such areas, the Unigov model, though far from perfect, could be
                    followed as a way of addressing these problems. There is no cookie-cutter approach. Each community
                    has to figure out its own system of governance. But not to address regional issues is to ignore the
                    reality of modern-day metropolitan America, encourage sprawling development, and invite paralysis
                    caused by too much parochialism with insufficient mechanisms for collaboration.</p>

               <hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> Given the city's changing needs as you've identified them,
                    do you feel that big public investments in sports, leisure, and tourism remain essential for
                    vitalizing the economic and cultural base of large, aging cities such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>? Would you be as likely to push for this sort of investment if you were taking on the
                    mayor's job today, rather than 30 years ago?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">WH:</hi> It is difficult to calculate the impact of a domed stadium or similar type of
                    venue on a local community's economy and "psyche." Certainly, when we
                    built the "Hoosier" Dome in the early 1980s, it appeared to me that the benefits
                    outweighed the costs-benefits such as increased convention business (more than just the Colts
                    playing there a few times each year), an enhanced national reputation, additional hotels,
                    restaurants <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-102-3-083"/> and activity downtown which created more tax base
                    and more jobs, enhanced economic development opportunities, and a rallying point for civic spirit
                    and pride. For example, when I asked Neil Norrey from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, why his
                    company had chosen to purchase the abandoned Western Electric plant on Shadeland Avenue and turn it
                    into a distribution center, he responded: "Because I read about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the sports pages, and thought you were the kind of aggressive, progressive city in
                    which I would like to invest." Some people opposed the expansion of the convention center
                    on the grounds that the money should have gone to housing, filling chuckholes, and that sort of
                    thing, but these persons missed the point that the entire $80 million raised from the
                    public and non-profit sectors to finance the deal were earmarked for that purpose and could be used
                    for none other.</p>
            <p>Now, over twenty years later, this stadium has the smallest capacity of any in the NFL. Times change.
                    Competition is keen. If a new stadium is necessary to keep the Colts in town, and if the convention
                    center needs to be expanded, I am in favor of it because, in spite of the cost in public funds, the
                    benefits mentioned above are significant. If we lost the Colts, our reputation as a major-league
                    city would suffer a huge setback that would have consequences in other areas. I think in smaller
                    markets, like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Green Bay, the presence of an NFL team means more than it does in larger cities like <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and as mayor, I would never set-as Mayor Daley once did in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>-a top limit on the amount of public dollars to be spent on a stadium, saying,
                    "It's my way or the highway." I do not know the particulars of the new
                    deal that has been struck in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and admittedly, I feel a little nostalgia and remorse in seeing the demolition of the
                    stadium I and others worked so hard to develop. But if in the estimate of current city leaders, the
                    new stadium is the proper step to take, coupled with another expansion of the convention center,
                    then it should be taken, with as little public money involved as possible.</p>

               <hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> In your recent work at the Urban Land Institute, you've been writing
                    about your concept of "civil cities." Your take on this idea seems to me to be
                    informed by a lot of nuts-and-bolts experience that other architects and social critics involved in
                    the dialogue can't always claim to have. How has your work as Mayor affected your
                    perspectives on what makes a civil city; and, on the other hand, how have your explorations,
                    research, etc., at the Institute affected the approach you would take to the task of planning a big
                    city like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the 21st century?</p>
            <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-102-3-084"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">WH:</hi> Our society and our political discourse need a big dose of civility. It used to
                    be, "I'm OK, you're OK, even though we disagree." Now,
                    it's, "I'm OK, and if you disagree with me, you are a scumbag."
                    There seems to be a lot of rancor in the air right now, feelings of adverseness if not downright
                    animosity, and a willingness, born of ideological rigidity, to fight rather than compromise. Our
                    democracy is in a precarious position right now: polarized, antagonistic, contentious, seemingly
                    unable to embrace honest, open dialogue where divergent opinions are explored. Civil society is
                    incompatible with cocooning, that is, with a refusal to consider the merits of another position
                    because one is wrapped in the blanket of one's beliefs. Certitude is never the same as
                    certainty. Democracy cannot work without civility, without respect for others and tolerance of
                    differing points of view. Disagreement is not disloyalty. No one has a corner on the truth, which,
                    like love, is a many-splendored thing, often lying somewhere in the realm of indeterminate grays
                    between absolute blacks and whites. This does not mean one cannot believe deeply and speak
                    passionately, but one should do it without selfrighteousness and with a little modesty. The genius
                    of Abe Lincoln was that he could hold to strong moral opinions without being moralistic.</p>
            <p>The two most civil persons I ever have met in public office are Andy Jacobs and Dick Lugar. They are
                    neither mean-spirited nor arrogant. I have never heard either say an unkind word about another,
                    whether that person be a political opponent or an angry citizen. They are open to discussion. They
                    listen. They can be a role model for all of us. I tried to be like them when I was in the
                    Mayor's office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (and in Chevy Chase). It is important to be inclusive. Whether it was the Michael
                    Taylor incident (when a 16-year-old boy was shot while in police custody in 1987) or the furor
                    surrounding our solid waste disposal plans, I felt it was important to hold open hearings on these
                    contentious matters to give the public an opportunity to voice their opinions. Transparency is
                    always a requisite for building public trust. The mayor is an orchestra leader who tries to bring
                    people together on the same page, recognizing that they play different parts. That explains why I
                    met on a monthly basis with representatives of labor and with the members of the Progress Committee
                    (a good cross section of the community), and why I conducted four radio programs a month where
                    people could call in with their "opportunities for service." Being a mayor taught
                    me the art of listening and being inclusive, two requirements for a civil city.</p>

            <p>During my almost ten years of work at the Urban Land Institute, I have come to appreciate the role
                    that private-sector professionals-real estate developers, architects, marketing and financial
                    experts, consultants, etc.-can play in building a more civil society. IF they are willing to
                    exercise civic leadership. City leadership is too important to be left to the politicians.
                    Leadership is a job, not a position. Good civic leaders are teachers, enablers, communicators,
                    people who bring others together to make things happen. They are discerners of the signs of the
                    times, and engage forcefully in the crucial issues their communities are facing. They forge
                    partnerships for the common good. They promote cooperation and try to resolve tensions and reconcile
                    conflicts. They nurture the soft infrastructure of a city-dialogue, trust, civility, respect for all
                    opinions, openness, grace. They are servants of community, bridge builders, people who care and put
                    their muscle where their caring lies.</p>
            <p>During my travels with the Urban Land Institute, I have met many civic leaders. One that comes to
                    mind is the Simboli family in Chelsea, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. Back in the 1980s, Chelsea was a disaster area-high poverty rates, corruption, urban
                    deterioration and blight, low education- achievement scores-and the state placed the city in
                    receivership. The Simboli family decided to make some investments in Chelsea, which started the
                    city's renewal. Now, they own and operate about a half-million <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-102-3-086"/> square feet of commercial space there. "But we try to be good
                    corporate citizens, too," says Patricia Simboli, daughter of the family's
                    patriarch. They have been involved for many years in a program for at-risk youth. They assisted ROCA
                    (Spanish for "rock," and an acronym for Reaching Out to Chelsea Adolescents) to
                    acquire a new headquarters building in the downtown area. The Simbolis shared ROCA's
                    vision-helping Chelsea youth toward productive citizenship-and then persuaded others to share it and
                    implement it. This was civic leadership in action.</p>
            <p>My experience at ULI has taught me the importance of urban design and planning, something to which I
                    paid insufficient attention during my sixteen years as Indy's mayor. But a good civic
                    leader will pay attention to these matters. The mayor is the chief architect of a city. There has to
                    be a vision (as we had at Circle Centre) and a plan to follow in implementing it. Zoning has to be
                    updated as times change. Careful attention has to be paid to what's happening where, to
                    avoid unsightliness and the proliferation of one strip development after another. Historic buildings
                    should be preserved, or given new uses. Higher densities have to be created to avoid sprawl. Land
                    must be used well, green space needs to be preserved, not gobbled up with promiscuous development or
                    paved over with asphalt. Smart growth must be practiced.</p>
            <p>ULI has a program called Advisory Services Panels. We have conducted well over one hundred of these
                    panels in the past few years, doing about one each month. We bring into a city impartial experts in
                    land-use planning from our membership around the country. They spend a week there, interviewing
                    scores of people, touring the site for which remedial action is needed, and preparing
                    recommendations about strategic steps that can be taken to revitalize a given area. We were in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> City after the bombing, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> after Katrina. We have journeyed to Europe and Asia with this program, and in each
                    place we have gone, these volunteers have done an immense amount of good. Most times our
                    recommendations are taken, occasionally they are not. But the point is that our members have engaged
                    with a city, sought to help it envision and construct a better future, and given it positive
                    recommendations upon which to act. This is civic leadership in action.</p>
            <p>Few of us will stride across the pages of history and leave big footprints. But that does not mean we
                    cannot be leaders, that we cannot rise to the occasion to provide vision, support, and direction. To
                    each of us there come opportunities, on life's journey, to accomplish something worthy of
                    being remembered. Our job is to see and seize these opportunities with relish, and not pass by on
                    the other side of the road.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, a city often neglected by scholars in urban studies and history. The first
                    chapter explores the "political meaning" of high school basketball in the city,
                    particularly the 1951 playoffs. Crispus Attucks, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s lone high school for African Americans, won the city sectional (the
                    equivalent of winning the city title), defeating all-white schools, and went on to represent the
                    city in the state tournament. The city's black leadership skillfully exploited the
                    team's accomplishment by pointing out that the squad potentially represented "a
                    spearhead for change" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By handling their fame in a responsible and courteous manner, Attucks players helped
                    reinforce local cultural attitudes that "rights would extend to those that showed they
                    deserved them" (p. 22).</p>
            <p>This style of "polite protest" also shaped the African American
                    community's struggle to desegregate the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> public schools. Due to the small size of its black population, the city had more or
                    less integrated its schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The influx of Southern black
                    migrants and increased racial hostility throughout the 1920s led to the construction of segregated
                    schools by 1930. During the next two decades, black leaders worked patiently and sometimes quietly,
                    using all available means to desegregate the schools. As a result of a changing political climate,
                    segregated schools were legally abolished in 1949. However, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> school board <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-102-3-088"/> adopted only token efforts at
                    integration; Attucks, for example, did not have a white student until 1968. Twenty years later, the
                    city still grappled with desegregation.</p>
            <p>Chapter Three explores the housing problems facing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> black community. As in the fight to desegregate schools, African American leaders
                    utilized protest tactics they considered appropriate for their conservative community. The
                    percentage of home ownership for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks was higher than in any other northern city, and many African Americans had no
                    wish to threaten their status. Nevertheless, their tactics proved futile in the wake of urban
                    renewal efforts such as interstate highway construction through downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although blacks eventually succeeded in obtaining open-housing legislation by the late
                    1960s, the growing economic gap between blacks and whites operated as an effective barrier to
                    integrated housing.</p>
            <p>The next chapter focuses on the problems facing African Americans in a segregated labor market.
                    Because few national civil rights organizations established a presence there (the Urban League did
                    not establish a chapter until 1965), <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks were left to their own efforts. As they had in the fights for integrated
                    education and housing, members of the black community worked patiently to gather evidence of the
                    problem and to present it to city leaders in a polite and courteous manner. By the 1960s, blacks
                    could point to the presence of equal-employment laws, but the changing economy of the city did more
                    to shape the opportunities available to blacks than did social legislation.</p>
            <p>The final chapter examines the creation of Unigov, a unique political structure that united the city
                    and surrounding county together under one government. Pierce argues that Unigov's creation
                    vastly expanded the political power of suburban whites while diminishing black political strength.
                    The protest tactics of patience and politeness that blacks had used in the past, along with their
                    alliance to the Democratic Party in a city ruled by a Republican mayor, failed to stop
                    Unigov's creation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Polite Protest</hi> adds a remarkable new dimension to the field of twentieth-century
                    black urban studies that will be enormously useful to students. Nonetheless, readers may wonder
                    about the possible effects of crime and the criminal justice system upon the black community. This
                    observation in no way detracts from the book's overall strength, but it suggests an area
                    for future research.</p>

                    conducted by fourteen black and white Ball State University undergraduates, the book is filled with
                    the past and present life experiences of these people, their family members, their friends, and

                    at work, at home, at school, and at church, as well as in the realms of leisure and entertainment,
                    local politics, community activism, and race relations. Until now, the voices and contributions of
                    these men and women who are the progeny of mid-nineteenth-century black settlers in this small,
                    midwestern industrial city have been mostly ignored.</p>
            <p>In Chapter Two, "A City Apart," Hurley Goodall and Elizabeth <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> provide a gripping historical account of early black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They demonstrate convincingly that African Americans have been essential participants
                    in the economic growth and development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> for much of its history. Blacks' economic position, though limited in the
                    early years, helped to sustain a community that built its first church in 1868. With the discovery
                    of natural gas near the city in the 1880s, new glass factories and steel foundries opened, expanding
                    industrial opportunities. The black population grew significantly, as a result, from just under
                    fifty residents in 1870 to more than two thousand in the 1920s. Over this half-century, the authors
                    note, a vibrant, fully-formed black community emerged with its own newspaper, political
                    organizations, social clubs, YWCA, and YMCA. Moreover, black businesses-ranging from barber shops to
                    restaurants to a hotel and a skating rink-proliferated and diversified. African Americans even
                    provided their own civil servants, adding a black fireman and a police officer to the
                    city's payroll.</p>
            <p>By 1924, when the Lynds arrived, there was no mistaking that a black community existed, and in many
                    ways had prospered in spite of visible and widespread racism. The Ku Klux Klan, having been reborn
                    in several midwestern cities and upper-south towns during this period, experienced <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-102-3-090"/> great success in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1922 and 1924, the Klan held major parades in the city. The 1924 parade culminated
                    in a downtown march led by the mayor and the chief of police.</p>
            <p>Today, these events still echo in the memories of lifelong residents. Reading the book, one gets the
                    sense that this moment crystallized the profound effect of black agency upon white Munsonians.
                    "White affirmative action" according to Goodall, one of the book's
                    principal authors and lifelong resident, has been one result. "Owing to years of
                    institutionalized racism, and its resulting de facto professional and social segregation, many
                    African Americans do not hold the kinds of high-ranking positions that would enable them to provide
                    opportunities to others" (pp. 236-37). In their seminal anthropological study, the Lynds
                    not only rendered black life and white terror invisible in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they also helped to define modern American culture as a culture without race and

               </hi> is in every way meant to challenge the legacy of this invisibility and
                    oppression. From the World War II period through the Civil Rights era and beyond, the voices in the
                    book tell of the slow and sometimes uncertain destruction of segregation. They tell of black
                    teachers integrating the public schools in the 1950s, and of black politicians capturing a city
                    council seat in 1967 (which is still held) as well as a state legislative office in 1978. Black
                    Munsonians are proud of these gains, but they also have not forgotten George Wallace's 1964
                    campaign appearance at Ball State; or the 1967 race riots spurred by the adoption of the Confederate
                    flag as a school symbol; or cross burnings in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>These proud women and men, whose stories are co-edited by their student interviewers as part of the
                    collaborative methodology, also reveal new anxieties regarding crime, drugs, and prostitution in
                    certain city neighborhoods. Since there are few young people interviewed, these observations are
                    shaded somewhat by a generational bias. Also, scholars will at times find this work frustrating
                    because it is almost entirely a work of ethnography with no attempt to corroborate observations or
                    to deepen the analysis by drawing upon the qualitative and quantitative scholarship of black life in
                    other Indiana or midwestern cities. It is almost as if the need to place black Munsonians within the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> canon was so great that to use data from anywhere else would be to undercut their own
                    purposes. Readers who are interested in the black experience in Indiana will value this work. Still
                    others will find the university/community collaborative approach fascinating and may be inspired to
                    adopt it.</p>

            <p>The land-grant universities made their mark in agricultural education during the late nineteenth and
                    early twentieth centuries. Although the Morrill Act authorized the land-grant educational system in
                    1862, agricultural educators had little to teach and farmers generally resisted book learning,
                    preferring the received knowledge passed from fathers to sons. In 1869, Indiana became the
                    twenty-first state to accept the Morrill Act and the twenty-fourth to locate a site for the
                    university. In 1874, Purdue University became the thirteenth land-grant university to open its doors
                    to students. Little agricultural instruction occurred, however, until 1882 when William Carroll
                    Latta, a new graduate of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Agricultural College with a Masters of Science degree in agriculture, joined the
                    university. At Purdue, Latta played a major role in curriculum development, and he earned a
                    reputation as the spokesman for agricultural education in Indiana. He also helped organize
                    Farmers' Institutes, at whose forums university experts explained new agricultural methods
                    to farmers, based on scientific research generated at the state experiment station. In 1907, Latta
                    became director of the Farmers' Institutes, a position that he held until retirement
                    fourteen years later. By the end of his career, Latta was a generalist in a new age of scientific
                    specialization.</p>
            <p>Frederick Whitford and Andrew Martin, both in the Cooperative Extension Service at Purdue, have
                    written a laudatory biography that emphasizes Latta's professional career at the
                    university. By so doing, they provide a glimpse of the efforts to improve farming and agricultural
                    education through applied research and education. The authors portray Latta as the quintessential
                    extension agent prior to the official creation of the position by the Smith-Lever Act in 1914. In
                    this tributary account, Latta is a man ahead of his time, someone who never gets angry, makes a
                    mistake, or takes issue with university administration (which, in 1888, rejected him for director of
                    the state experiment station and requested his resignation because the president did not believe
                    that Purdue could have more than one professor of agriculture).</p>
            <p>Latta was, of course, similar to many agricultural specialists at the land-grant universities during
                    the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries- men with practical experience and some graduate
                    training who dedicated their lives to improving agriculture and farm life. The nation <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-102-3-092"/> owes much to the quiet workings of these individuals. Yet if Latta had
                    any shortcomings, no reader will learn about them here.</p>
            <p>Long block quotes and itemized lists of various sorts give this book a style and format that most
                    historians no longer use. Still, anyone interested in learning about the history of agriculture at
                    Purdue will find the book useful. Agricultural historians may find it helpful for some matters of
                    detail, particularly in relation to the operation of Farmers' Institutes. Visitors to
                    Purdue's College of Agriculture will find it a useful introduction to a man who helped the
                    university to become a center of agriculture research and education.</p>

                    Only later did townspeople learn that the firm, a printing plant, was associated with William Dudley
                    Pelley, a controversial figure known as the "High Priest of American Fascism."</p>
            <p>Pelley's path to Indiana was a snaking one, along which he had seemingly reinvented himself
                    several times. Scott Beekman expertly unravels the twists in Pelley's life in <hi rend="i">William Dudley Pelly: A Life in RightWing Extremism and the Occult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, Pelley's father was variously a Methodist minister, cobbler, businessman and
                    journalist. The younger Pelley was intensely proud of his "pure English blood" (p.
                    2). His first success came in one of his father's failed careers, journalism. After several
                    years spent editing newspapers, Pelley became a short-story writer and novelist, winning two O.
                    Henry Awards for his stories. This led him to Hollywood, where he wrote screenplays, including some
                    for Lon Chaney, Sr., who became a friend. It was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> that Pelley underwent a conversion experience that was the dividing line in his life.
                    His so-called "Seven Minutes in Eternity" and what the author describes as
                    "his ego and overarching desire for public recognition" (p. xv) would move him to
                    the outermost fringes of American society.</p>
            <p>One day in May 1928, believing that he was dying, Pelley (as he later <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-102-3-093"/> recounted) felt himself pulled into a blue mist. He awakened on a slab,
                    where he was attended by two kindly figures, one of whom, "William," explained to
                    Pelley that "everyone â€¦ lived hundreds of times before" and that
                    "earth was a classroom" for souls moving up the hierarchy. From the experience,
                    Pelley developed a metaphysical, pseudo-religious philosophy known as "Liberation
                    doctrine," which the author characterizes as "mixing spiritualism, Theosophy,
                    Christianity and pyramidism into a potent concoction" that earned him adherents in both
                    anti-Semitic and metaphysical circles (pp. xii-xiii).</p>
            <p>Pelley's anti-Semitism led him to form a group called the Silver Shirts in 1933. He used the
                    group to enter politics, pushing his anti-Semitic and anti-Communist agendas (both of which had been
                    fermenting since his travels through Russia in 1918-1919). Like similar extremist groups, the Silver
                    Shirts were more sound and fury than substance, but they brought Pelley recognition, even among the
                    many detractors who viewed him as a Hitler wannabe. During the same decade, Pelley also formed the
                    Christian Party of America, running for president in 1936. All the while, he was eyed suspiciously
                    by a public and government (particularly the Dies Committee) wary of extremists.</p>
            <p>By the time he arrived in Indiana, Pelley had disbanded the Silver Shirts, claiming that he wanted to
                    concentrate on publishing his philosophical ideas. But unable to eschew politics, he published
                    "anti-Roosevelt and pro- Axis material" in his new religious publication <hi rend="i">Galilean.</hi> Ultimately this led to his arrest and conviction for sedition in trials

                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, native Bruce C. Smith has written a fascinating local history of World War II
                    and its impact on his hometown. <hi rend="i">The War Comes to Plum Street</hi> tells the story of
                    Smith's own family, along with that of other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents who belonged to the "Greatest Generation," those Americans
                    whose lives and characters were formed during the Great Depression and World War II. Drawing
                    extensively from oral history interviews, newspaper accounts, high school yearbooks and other local
                    sources, Smith has produced a sensitively written social history that encourages readers to
                    understand the wartime years in a new light.</p>
            <p>Focusing on the inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, located in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName>, Smith weaves together a story of individual lives, local events, and larger external
                    forces, such as depression and war, that shape people's opportunities and make up
                    America's history. Smith begins his book by tracing the history of his grandparents, who
                    relocated from the Upper South to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> as part of a World War I- era search for manufacturing jobs. Plum Street, where
                    Smith's grandparents and their children settled, hosted many working-class families who
                    moved in and through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> and whose labor fueled the town's Chrysler auto parts factory and a host of
                    other durable goods manufacturers. During the boom-and-bust economic cycles of the next two decades,
                    these migrants and their children struggled through the Depression and ultimately prevailed thanks
                    to neighborly kindness, public works programs, and the industrial conversion occasioned by a new
                    war.</p>
            <p>Using local newspapers, Smith details the many sacrifices that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> inhabitants made to World War II. He tracks the activities of his father and uncles
                    who, along with more than 100 men and women, aided the war directly as members of the armed forces
                    and the Red Cross. He supplements this story of the war in Europe and the Pacific with accounts of
                    activities closer to home, describing industrial operations, scrap drives, and the constantly
                    changing rationing programs that occupied <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents. Through this enumeration, he crafts a portrait of one small town's
                    part in the larger war effort.</p>
            <p>Smith obviously appreciates the sacrifices made by the "Greatest Generation," yet
                    manages to avoid sentimentality and nostalgia. His discussion of the war years, for example,
                    acknowledges the social tension that characterized the era. Along with mentioning labor strife and
                    racially motivated violence elsewhere, Smith intersperses accounts of familial discord and stolen
                    rationing coupons in <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-102-3-095"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Tracing the motivations of individual men who enlisted in the armed forces, Smith
                    downplays patriotism and suggests myriad factors that influenced decisions about when and whether to
                    join up. Centered on personal and local accounts, Smith's complicated and honest narrative
                    challenges stereotypes of a country unified by war and nationalism.</p>
            <p>Readers with an interest in Indiana history will find much to appreciate in <hi rend="i">The War
                        Comes to Plum Street.</hi> By treating the history of one town, and the lives of a select sample
                    of families, as important, Smith gives weight to the role that ordinary Americans play in shaping
                    history, and he demonstrates the critical part that oral history can play in recreating this
                    history. Smith's example will hopefully inspire others to investigate the events that
                    transformed towns in Indiana and across America in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>The past two decades have witnessed the appearance of a number of urban encyclopedias, including two (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>) from the Midwest. Most reviewers have lauded these efforts and have touted <hi rend="i">The Encyclopedia of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName> City</hi> (1995) as the best of the group. The 2004 appearance of <hi rend="i">The
                        Encyclopedia of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> has likely upset this ranking.</p>
            <p>This volume is a superb work that fulfills its editors' goal of revealing the Windy
                    City's interdependent sense of place. More than the other urban encyclopedias, this
                    handsome work literally and metaphorically maps the city's geography. It conveys a deep
                    sense of place in multiple entries on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s neighborhoods and locations and embeds within each entry both a separate
                    history and a connection to the larger metropolis. The result is an integrative history that links
                    the city's vital parts to a civic whole.</p>
            <p>Another important integrative feature of the work is the simultaneous creation of an electronic
                    encyclopedia, with an emphasis on links and extensibility. Of course, the encyclopedias created
                    before the Internet contained cross-references-the trait, after all, is common to the genre- but the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> editors clearly were thinking of the volume as a digital product as well as a
                    traditional one. <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-102-3-096"/> Given this strategy, it is disappointing to
                    learn that the electronic version (http://www.encyclopedia. chicagohistory.org) appears to contain
                    nothing more than the print edition.</p>
            <p>The entries, arranged alphabetically, are well-written and informative. The editors' implied
                    claims to the contrary, they follow the types of entries found in other urban encyclopedias: places,
                    people, events, organizations, ethnic groups, religious bodies, and so forth. Topical essays appear
                    throughout the volume (e.g., Air Quality, Home Rule, Mental Health, etc.). Most of the contributors
                    appear to be associated with academic institutions and libraries.</p>
            <p>Several features are worth noting. Businesses deemed significant by longevity, number of employees,
                    or industry leadership receive separate treatment in the "Dictionary of Leading <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Businesses, 1820-2000" (pp. 909-953). A biographical dictionary (pp. 955-998)
                    provides summary information on 2,000 deceased Chicagoans who are mentioned in the main body of the
                    encyclopedia, although page numbers to these references are not included. Census information for
                    counties, municipalities, and communities, noted at thirty-year intervals, also appears at the end
                    of the volume, as does a list of the city's mayors and a comprehensive index.</p>
            <p>These features notwithstanding, illustrations are the glory of this volume. No urban encyclopedia to
                    date has made better use of cartography. Thumbnail maps accompanying the entries reveal the location
                    of each county, municipality, and neighborhood within the metropolitan area, while large-scale maps
                    show everything from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s global and national connections (pp. 342-343) to the railroad path used by
                    the Great Migration (p. 363) to the city's freight tunnels (p. 834). The maps reinforce the
                    editorial theme of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> as an interconnected place. In like manner, the illustrations-especially the four-
                    color Timeline and Year Pages- exceed in quality and quantity anything produced by the other urban
                    encyclopedias.</p>
            <p>Great cities deserve great encyclopedias. With the publication of <hi rend="i">The Encyclopedia of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

               <hi rend="i">Karl Bodmer's North American Prints</hi> is a companion publication to <hi rend="i">Karl Bodmer's America,</hi> a comprehensive catalog of the Bodmer drawings and
                    watercolors in the collection of the Joslyn Art Museum's Durham Center for Western Studies.
                    Like that earlier work, this monumental study is based on the museum's Maximilian-Bodmer
                    collection, "an unparalleled written and visual description of nineteenth- century American
                    landscape and cultures" (p. xiii) that contains Maximilian's written records and
                    hundreds of art works by Bodmer.</p>
            <p>In 1832, Maximilian (1782-1867), Prince of Wied-Neuweld, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, an experienced naturalist who had made an earlier trip to Latin America, hired the
                    young Swiss artist Karl Bodmer (1809-1893) to accompany him on an expedition to the American West.
                    Maximilian's goal was to observe and record what he called the "rude, primitive
                    character of the natural face of North America" (p. 5).</p>
            <p>The naturalist and the artist, along with Maximilian's servant, arrived in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the summer of 1832 and immediately <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-102-3-099"/> headed west.
                    Passing through Indiana, they spent the winter at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Maximilian fell ill with a "serious indisposition â€¦
                    resembling cholera" and nearly died (p. 14). After he recovered, they resumed their trek
                    west. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> they boarded a boat headed up the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>, launching a
                    3,000- mile expedition into the heart of the West, then largely terra incognita, that would last a
                    little more than a year, from April 1833 to April 1834.</p>
            <p>While the drawings and paintings that Bodmer created during the expedition are widely known and
                    admired, the 81 atlas prints that he produced after the expedition to illustrate
                    Maximilian's account of their journey are little known, despite the fact that the volume,
                        <hi rend="i">Travels in the Interior of North America,</hi> 1832-1834, considered "one
                    of the last of the great illustrated books of the Enlightenment," introduced Bodmer to a
                    wide contemporary audience (p. 18).</p>
            <p>To complete the print project, Bodmer, himself a trained engraver, selected thirty of the best
                    engravers and printers he knew to produce the aquatint engravings for the atlas. The prints also
                    were published in several important scientific publications of the time, valued for their
                    ethnographic veracity and historic significance. Infused with an aura of Romanticism, the superb
                    images go beyond the requirements of a mere document to reveal the character and humanity of the
                    Indians and the primeval, sublime western American wilderness. The famous naturalist and explorer
                    Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) praised Bodmer as an artist who viewed nature as
                    "something alive."</p>
            <p>This magnificent volume, edited by Brandon K. Ruud and featuring thoughtful, engaging essays by Ron
                    Tyler and Ruud, provides a handsomely illustrated, comprehensive survey and analysis of each of the
                    prints, in more than 500 illustrations of their various states and renditions.</p>
            <p>The volume's catalog of tableaux and vignettes, as the prints are known, is a compendium of
                    information on each print, from fundamental facts such as the dimensions of related drawings to
                    detailed discussions of each state of each print. Appendices provide yet more information: a
                    location census; a cross reference of the atlas prints and related watercolors and drawings;
                    engraver assignments and biographies (an unexpected bonus); a catalog of Bodmer's non-North
                    American prints; an inventory of subscribers to Maximilian's publication; and a compilation
                    of North American subjects after Bodmer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Karl Bodmer's North American Prints</hi> is a true treasure whose gorgeous
                    landscapes and Native American portraits, alongside the superb scholarship that illuminates them,

            <p>The introduction of steel plows was a leading step to the opening of the midwestern prairies by
                    pioneer farmers. Tough prairie sod could not be broken with cast iron shares, and sticky soils could
                    not be turned with ironclad moldboards. In the 1830s, a few blacksmiths used steel to make sharper
                    plowshares and some experimented with wrought iron moldboards. In 1837, John Deere, an ambitious
                    smith from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, newly arrived in Grand Detour, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, produced a plow that cut more keenly and turned furrows more smoothly than its rivals.
                    It sold well and Deere continued to improve the implement, importing fine steel and enlarging his
                    workshop. In 1848, he moved to Moline on the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, where he built
                    a large new factory to produce even better plows for an expanding market ranging north to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> and south to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. In the 1850s, output soared from over 2,000 to over 13,000 plows a year.</p>
            <p>A crucial problem for the growing enterprise, examined in detail by Neil and Jeremy Dahlstrom, was
                    how to maintain a cash flow. Young pioneers who bought land on the prairies had little or no money
                    in their pockets. They needed Deere's plow to start cultivating and, until their crops and
                    livestock were sold, they remained desperately short of ready currency. On the other hand, suppliers
                    of steel demanded immediate payments in cash for material imported from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> or transported from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and each week Deere had to find cash to pay wages to sixty-five workers. A long lag
                    between expenditure and income made it difficult to assess the profitability of the business. The
                    financial panic of 1857 imposed a severe strain on its credit.</p>
            <p>In 1858, Deere passed control of the business to his only surviving son, Charles, who was
                    college-educated and also well trained in the office and on the factory floor. Charles's
                    first task was to visit customers and dealers in the field, instructing them to make cash-only
                    sales. After the Civil War, he faced unfair competition from <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-102-3-101"/>
                    another plowmaker, marketing replicas of his "Moline Plow." A lawsuit ended in
                    1871 with a judgment against Deere for attempting to impose an "odious" monopoly.
                    For the remainder of the century, farmers' associations and labor unions regarded him as a
                    dominating industrial giant. Deere responded by devolving production and marketing to eight branch
                    houses located across the continent.</p>
            <p>This outstanding study in business history has been constructed from company archives, letters and
                    papers kept by members of the family and business partners, and files of newspapers and trade
                    journals. It is particularly illuminating on the close relations that bound industry to agriculture
                    during the pioneering period of settlement in the Midwest. In Europe, mechanization of agriculture
                    was mostly initiated and financed by large landowners and wealthy farmers. In America, the
                    manufacturer took the initiative and actively promoted his product. It is unlikely that any other
                    firm in the world produced as many steel plows in the third quarter of the nineteenth century as
                    Deere and Company, and few businessmen took greater risks than John and Charles Deere. It is an
                    enthralling story.</p>

            <p>No one can read Abraham Lincoln's state papers without perceiving in them a most remarkable
                    facility of "putting things so as to commend the attention and assent of the
                    people," wrote Henry J. Raymond, editor of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> in 1864. Still, there has been no end of difficulty in understanding
                    exactly how Lincoln's "facility" of expression managed to achieve the
                    ultimate political goal of commanding "attention and assent," Almost all of
                    Lincoln's surviving corpus of "speeches" are either texts he wrote
                    beforehand or transcripts of speech acts which a stenographer or reporter reduced to a written text,
                    with or without Lincoln's knowledge or even approval. So, at the very beginning, we are on
                    uncertain ground about what constitutes a Lincoln "speech"-is it a spoken act, or
                    a written text? Historians are further burdened with uncertainty about the rhetorical style in which
                    the spoken acts were cast. We have vanishingly few concrete descriptions of Lincoln in action on a
                    platform, and thus little <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-102-3-102"/> way of understanding how
                    Lincoln's patterns of delivery linked his words to the "assent" of his
                    audience.</p>
            <p>No wonder, then, that books devoted to unlocking the mystery of Lincoln's remarkable powers
                    as a speechmaker tend to fall into three categories: like Waldo Braden's <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln: Public Speaker</hi> (1988), they make as much as can be made of the slim
                    testimonies of Lincoln's voice and manner; like David Zarefsky's <hi rend="i">Lincoln, Douglas and Slavery</hi> (1990), they concentrate on the rhetorical strategies Lincoln
                    favored; or, like Harry Jaffa's <hi rend="i">Crisis of the House Divided (1859), Garry
                        Wills's Lincoln at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1992) or Ronald White's <hi rend="i">The Eloquent President</hi>
                    (2005), they offer extensive, almost Talmudic, commentaries on Lincoln's texts. Because
                    John Channing Briggs is an English professor, it comes as little surprise that his new foray into
                    Lincoln as a speechmaker falls very much into the third category-and given the sheer volume of such
                    commentaries, this is very likely to bring an involuntary sigh to the lips. That would be a mistake,
                    for Briggs's book turns out to be one of the most effective examples of the
                    Talmudic-commentary style, and indeed, one of the best books on Lincoln as a <hi rend="i">rhetor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briggs wisely avoids the pitfall of assuming that eloquence is a given. His first chapter, on
                    rhetorical contexts, considers (in the style of Kenneth Cmiel's <hi rend="i">Democratic
                        Eloquence)</hi> just what place oratory had in a nineteenth-century republican environment, both
                    on the giving and the receiving ends. Context also governs Briggs's first commentary-on the
                    1838 Lyceum Speech-as he carefully compares Lincoln's analysis of the problem of preserving
                    "republican institutions" from "mobocracy" with contemporaneous
                    speeches by Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren and Andrew Jackson. He also has a particularly acute ear for picking up obscure
                    parallels, such as the apostrophe, "Hail fall of Fury! Reign of Reason, all hail!"

                    "fittingly greets the demise of a Macbeth- like tyrant within the drinker" (p.
                    74). The gem of the book, however, may be the one chapter not devoted to a single speech, but
                    instead to a theme-"Presidential Eloquence and Political Religion"- which examines
                    the strands of religious rhetoric and allusion in Lincoln's speeches.</p>
            <p>There are, unhappily, two great drawbacks to the intensity with which Briggs scans Lincoln's
                    texts. The first is that the further Briggs moves into examining texts, the less we learn about them
                    as "speeches" and the more completely the book becomes an exercise in textual
                    commentary. The other is that twelve of the thirteen chapters are devoted to Lincoln before his
                    inauguration; the last chapter must gallop panting through the First Inaugural, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address, and the Second Inaugural so that the book can live up to its title. <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-102-3-103"/> And yet, even within those confines, Briggs's <hi rend="i">midrash</hi> on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address manages to do as much in ten pages as Garry Wills did in his entire misbegotten
                    book. In fact, taken generally, <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Speeches Reconsidered</hi> does a
                    finer job than any of the other commentaries on Lincoln's speeches Qaffa alone excepted),
                    and its reading will repay richly the serious student of Lincoln and of American political ideas in
                    general.</p>

            <p>Thomas Goodrich's <hi rend="i">Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American
                    Tragedy</hi> is a well-researched account of the events surrounding Lincoln's
                    assassination. Like the best historical works, the book effectively weaves a deep and broad
                    collection of sources into a unified narrative that smoothly propels readers along the path of
                    events from the fall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> in April 1865 to the commitment of Mary Todd Lincoln in May 1875. Goodrich, in sum, is
                    as effective a storyteller as he is an historical researcher.</p>
            <p>Goodrich tells the well-worn story of Booth's assassination of Lincoln, and his subsequent
                    capture and death. He also traces the response of major political leaders like Secretary of War
                    Edwin Stanton, on whose authority hundreds of citizens-many of whom had nothing to do with the
                    assassination-were arrested and imprisoned in a climate of anger and suspicion. But what makes the
                    book particularly valuable and interesting is the author's focus upon the emotional and
                    often violent reactions of ordinary people. In locales North and South, citizens expressing sympathy
                    with Booth or satisfaction with Lincoln's assassination were likely to find their lives
                    quickly ended by griefstricken, angry fellow citizens. Among the many acts of summary <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-102-3-104"/> retribution were shootings and bayonettings by aggrieved Federal
                    soldiers. But ordinary citizens were no slower to shoot, hang, drown, or even butcher those who
                    lacked the proper attitude of respect and mourning. In some locales, mobs descended on the homes of
                    those not exhibiting sufficient ccoutrements of mourning in their windows.</p>
            <p>While Goodrich provides an elegant, if conventional, account of these events, Leonard E Guttridge and
                    Ray E. Neff's <hi rend="i">Dark Union: The Secret Web of Profiteers, Politicians, and Booth
                        Conspirators that Led to Lincoln's Death</hi> frames the same events within the context
                    of an elaborate conspiracy theory. According to this theory, a cabal headed up by Secretary of War
                    Stanton and composed of a variety of groups, including desperate Confederates grasping at any
                    opportunity to further their cause, Radical Republicans unhappy with Lincoln's moderation
                    toward the South, and Northern and Southern cotton speculators unhappy with Lincoln's
                    increasing intolerance of their black market trade, conspired to kidnap Lincoln as a means of
                    advancing their disparate agendas. Booth was to play only a supporting role in the conspiracy, but
                    took matters into his own hands when the conspiracy unexpectedly unraveled.</p>
            <p>The theory is intriguing and reminiscent of the kinds of theories revolving around the assassination
                    of John F Kennedy. The authors fit together facts, events, motives, and personages into a unique
                    narrative that suggests that coincidence is, in reality, conspiracy. Unfortunately, the precise
                    sources for each particular claim are somewhat difficult to verify. Unlike Goodrich, whose footnotes
                    precisely document each claim and source, Guttridge and Neff provide only a general set of notes on
                    sources for each chapter. But one source looms particularly large for them- the fugitive writings of
                    Stanton's operative <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Charles Baker, the man who directed the pursuit of John Wilkes Booth. Baker's
                    knowledge of the alleged conspiracy is said to have resulted in an inordinate number of attempts on
                    his life, but the evidence is, quite literally, difficult to discern. Baker's writings
                    revealing the conspiracy are said to have been surreptitiously recorded in the margins of an issue
                    of <hi rend="i">Colburn's United Service Magazine and Naval Military Journal.</hi> These
                    marginal notes were recorded in a cipher, and written in a kind of invisible ink that was supposed
                    to become visible when exposed to direct sunlight but proved recalcitrant until exposed to tannic
                    acid.</p>
            <p>If this theory is even partially true, it requires a thorough reaccounting of the events that ended
                    the Civil War. Indeed, it is intriguing to re-read Goodrich in light of this conspiracy theory,
                    because some events in his account lend circumstantial support to the conspiracy claim. In
                    particular, Goodrich writes that in the immediate aftermath of the assassination "Stanton
                    alone kept his <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-102-3-105"/> wits and continued with almost superhuman focus
                    and energy," even assuming the role of "acting head of state" (p. 168).</p>
            <p>In sum, the strengths and weaknesses of these books seem complimentary. Goodrich provides a
                    well-researched and extremely welldocumented account of the events surrounding Lincoln's
                    assassination that can be criticized, at worst, as being overly conventional. On the other hand,
                    Guttridge and Neff make audacious claims that, if true, require a complete re-write of history,
                    though their claims may be said to be somewhat less thoroughly documented. This reader will leave it
                    to the specialists to adjudicate the dispute between these two very interesting books.</p>

            <p>One of the finest attributes of social history is its conviction that the average person's
                    life is an authentic part of the human saga, as genuine as tales of the rich or powerful. Birth and
                    death, childhood and work, love and heartache all mix together; the challenge for historians is to
                    construct narratives from such fragmented sources as property records, census data, neighborhood
                    newspapers, and oral histories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Pictures of Home</hi> is a different type of historical resource. Photographs from
                    family albums and bureau drawers inspire some of the author's recollections. Small
                    photographic reproductions precede each chapter. Intermittently, the author muses about the emotions
                    captured in these moments. But the thematic glue that holds this book together is found in its
                    subtitle: memoir, reflections on the everyday lives of aunts and uncles, grandparents and neighbors,
                    parents and siblings. The "pictures" in this volume are not so much silver images
                    recorded on paper as flashes from the author's memory.</p>
            <p>The setting is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s South Side, for the most part after World War II. The story begins in the
                    Bridgeport neighborhood, not far from Richard J. Daley's home turf, where the
                    author's immigrant ancestors first planted their American roots before relocating to the
                    bungalow belt on the city's southwest side. At 54th Street and Homan Avenue, the Bukowski
                    family joined a melting pot of nationalities (but not races) in activity spaces revolving around a
                    memorable <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-102-3-106"/> grocery store, doctor's office, savings and
                    loan, movie theater, and, most importantly for this clan, St. Gall Catholic Church. Chicagoland
                    serves as a dynamic stage across which the family moves in the course of their daily activities. The
                    universe beyond Gage Park is epitomized by nearby Municipal (later Midway) Airport, at the time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s portal to the rest of the world. But the farthest most family members
                    venture is to the old neighborhood to visit relatives, to Comiskey Park, to downtown for a few hours
                    of shopping along State Street, across <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Avenue (the city's socio-spatial dividing line) for some magical thrills at
                    Riverview Amusement Park, or to a suburb to bury family members at Resurrection Cemetery. What
                    readers encounter is not so much a sense of community as a memoir of place-locations where life
                    unfolds. And although the setting may be <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the broader context is any urban place where prewar ethnic Americans reinvented
                    themselves as postwar suburbanites. The lifestyles are typically urban midwestern.</p>
            <p>The book's five chapters unfold in roughly chronological order, but within each unit, events
                    occur in a stream-of-consciousness style that may annoy some readers. There is no fixed progression
                    within each chapter. Dates jump back and forth congruent with the author's flashes of
                    memory. An accomplished historian, Bukowski chose not to mine each episode for its historical
                    significance- with the exception of race relations, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Gordian knot. Readers partake of everyday details in the lives of people who
                    are neither relatives nor neighbors. Aging and death are subtexts in this odyssey. Therefore readers
                    must be willing to appreciate the intimacies that social history celebrates, the exhilaration of a
                    grandchild's birth or the exasperation of an elderly parent who fails to get to the
                    bathroom in time. Whether we formally publish our family history or not, the grim and graceful
                    "pictures" that we have all recorded are vital and genuine. Doug Bukowski has
                    proven that point.</p>

                    </placeName> A&amp;M University dissertation provocatively revisits Civil War raiding and
                    guerrilla warfare, in a work of considerable relevance to Hoosier Civil War historiography.</p>
            <p>Mackey faults many prior accounts for imprecisely defining, and thereby rendering virtually
                    interchangeable, discreet contemporary terms for Civil War irregular troops- especially
                    "guerrilla," "partisan," and "partisan
                    ranger." Further, he contends that Civil War scholarship understates the extent of
                    unconventional fighting in the Upper South and obscures the symbiosis between irregular cavalry and
                    partisan operations and the campaigns of primary Confederate armies. He argues provocatively that
                    Confederate leaders astutely grounded their bid for independence on a "cohesive strategy of
                    irregular warfare" (p.22), and that cavalry and partisan raids were no mere sideshow. In
                    fact, so many such operations occurred that Upper South Confederate civilians commonly conceived the
                    war as defined by "ambush and raid, isolated blockhouse, and burned home," rather
                    than by "setpiece battles" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Mackey meticulously deconstructs the Upper South's war. His most original chapters concern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, where Confederate general Thomas C. Hindman, trying to fend off Union invading forces
                    with diminishing manpower, initiated guerrilla resistance anticipatory of twentieth- century
                    struggles. Hindman's june 17, 1862, "Band of Ten" order from his <placeName>

                    </placeName> headquarters called on Arkansans to organize themselves into ten-man independent
                    companies to harass the enemy "without waiting for special instructions" (p. 207).
                    Other chapters assess and de-mythologize the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Mackey argues that so long as Union officers mistook Confederate cavalry and partisan
                    units for bushwhacking guerrillas, Confederates held the advantage. Once Union authorities by 1863
                    conceptualized them as appendages to official Confederate operations, they effectively neutralized
                    the Confederate irregulars with an array of innovations-including troop concentrations, improved
                    fortifications (especially railroad block- houses), and clever deployments of <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-102-3-108"/> gunboats. "Mosby's Confederacy" had more
                    staying power than did the Confederate irregular resistance in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but Union authorities in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> also took remedial action, such as General Benjamin Kelley's armored railcars
                    on the B&amp;O-aptly dubbed "ironclads." Meanwhile, Union authorities pacified
                    much of <placeName>

                    comprehending the Union's success in parrying Confederate irregular warfare- and the
                    horrific reprisals, wanton atrocities and pillaging that accompanied guerrilla fighting from 1862 to
                    1864-resolves the longstanding puzzle of why Confederate leaders in 1865 rejected all-out guerrilla
                    warfare as an alternative to surrender.</p>
            <p>Mackey references Carl von Clausewitz, Antoine Henri de Jomini, and other military theorists to
                    contextualize his story within the history of warfare. Useful appendices (the 1862 Confederate
                    Partisan Ranger Act and Hindman's "Band of Ten" order) supplement the
                    text. Some readers may find Mackey's frequent redundancies annoying, and no one should
                    judge <hi rend="i">The Uncivil War</hi> by the map on page 4: it shows Grant in 1863 campaigning on

                    convincing analysis that builds on recent treatments of Civil War irregular action by Mark Grimsley,
                    Michael Fellman, and other scholars. Because of Mackey's labors, our understanding of the
                    Upper South's Civil War will never be quite the same.</p>

            <p>John Jakle and Keith Sculle are well-known writers on the landscape of the automobile age in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. They have crafted books on the gas station, the motel, and fast food restaurants; now
                    they have written a book on roadside signs.</p>
            <p>In section one, the authors study the variety of commercial signs found on town and city Main
                    Streets, and <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-102-3-109"/> along the rural roadsides. They pay particular
                    attention to billboards and to storefront display windows, and claim that the overall assemblage of
                    facilities (signs, buildings, and parking lots) "created a visual ensemble exciting and
                    inviting. They did not amount to chaos, as traditionalists decried" (p. 46). This claim
                    positions them in opposition to cultural geographers such as Pierce Lewis and Wilbur Zelinsky, who
                    have made a strong case that outdoor commercial signs are an abomination.</p>
            <p>In section two the authors look at traffic signs, specifically those created after the federal
                    government, in 1935, issued a manual standardizing such signs for regulation, warning, and guidance.
                    They also consider those signs of community that proclaim faith in "God, country, family,
                    and the neighborhood" (p. 76). There are curious omissions in both categories. The authors
                    did not include signs connected to houses of worship, street signs, or specific neighborhood signs.
                    They do look at signs boosting specific states, as when they examine the signs along the Lincoln and
                    Dixie Highways, two early crosscountry roads promoted by automobile manufacturer Carl Fisher of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Billboards along these highways proclaimed the advantages of each state they passed
                    through. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, where Fisher had huge personal stakes as a real estate developer, was, along with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, the biggest winner.</p>
            <p>In the third section of the book, the authors turn to signs of personal identity. The issue seems
                    particularly pertinent in this age of globalization, characterized by massive internal and
                    international migration, and by a bombardment of information which produces cultural confusion in
                    many migrants. The authors' treatment of this subject, however, is not terribly profound.
                    They dwell on consumerist aspirations to upward mobility, enhanced by advertising signs, and on
                    signs that mark territory and discourage encroachment, invasion, and contamination.</p>
            <p>The fourth section of the book takes on the aesthetics of signs. While signs were used for
                    "wayfaring" through landscapes, too many signs could lead to
                    "blight." In the best chapter in this section, on the history of sign regulation,
                    the authors document the war between the advocates of the City Beautiful movement and outdoor
                    advertisers. Because it was legally difficult to block the erection of billboards on aesthetic
                    grounds, the critics of billboards had to base their arguments on issues of public health and
                    safety. Four states have been more successful than others in regulating billboards:
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>, <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
               </placeName>, Alaska, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName>. Each places critical importance on the beauty of nature for attracting both tourists
                    and migrants.</p>
            <p>The authors close with the euphemism that "who regulates signs controls the future"
                    (p. 169), and their book richly documents this claim for automotive America. This is a useful and
                    important work, but I found it <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-102-3-110"/> wanting in writing style when
                    compared to the crisper language and tighter focus of their earlier books on the motel, the gas
                    station, and fast food chains.</p>

            <p>The approach of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth seems to have induced Southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> University Press to produce paperback editions of four interesting books that highlight
                    Lincoln's relation to Americans via his private secretaries. The Lincoln White House
                    received somewhere between 250 and 500 pieces of mail each day, out of which his secretaries
                    selected 10 to 20 for his personal attention. <hi rend="i">Dear Mr. Lincoln</hi> presents the text
                    of letters seen by Lincoln between 1860 and 1865, organizing them into ten topical
                    categories-advice, requests, compliments, complaints, inventions, gifts, business, invitations,
                    family matters, and threats. Harold Holzer prefaces each chapter with an introduction and makes note
                    of the nature or existence of the president's replies. Holzer's second volume, <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Mailbag,</hi> grew out of interest in the first. It presents additional
                    letters seen by Lincoln as well as many that were simply forwarded to others for reply. Like the
                    first volume, this also contains annotation regarding his replies, though these letters are
                    presented in chronological order without prefatory commentary.</p>

            <p>Michael Burlingame focused his analysis on one of Lincoln's secretaries, the Bavarian-born

                    presents the secretary's letters and writings organized chronologically for the years of
                    the presidency. After Lincoln's death, Nicolay set out to write a history of the presidency
                    and interviewed a variety of people in <placeName>

            <p>The editors of this book have chronologically organized the wartime diary entries of Sergeant William
                    Bluffton Miller of the 75th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, added historical and military context to
                    each set of entries, and provided a brief biographical sketch of Miller as a soldier. The diary
                    chronicles Miller's involvement in some of the most important campaigns in the Western
                    theater, and it also uncovers the private journey of one man through the Civil War. In his writing,
                    Miller grapples with his assumptions about race, within the context of the nation's past
                    and of his own vision of the future.</p>

            <p>Written to coincide with the opening of the college's new Science Center, William R.
                    Eberly's book provides a highly detailed history of how the sciences have been taught at
                    one Indiana college. Much of the text is devoted to outstanding professors and their research, but
                    the author also <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-102-3-114"/> considers the work of many successful alumni
                    and, of course, the growth of the institution. The book is well- produced and generously
                    illustrated. It should be of interest not only to graduates of the college but to anyone interested
                    in the history of science education in Indiana.</p>

            <p>This book, like so many institutional histories of colleges and universities, is divided into
                    chapters according to presidential tenure. However, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berea</settlement>
                    </placeName> College archivist Shannon Wilson has written the kind of educational history to which
                    other authors should aspire. The book is very well illustrated but does not rely on illustrations
                    for its primary interest. Rather than losing the reader in the minutiae of administrators and
                    policy, Wilson places the college within the context of race relations, the history of Appalachia,
                    and the history of modern educational practice, and does so in an engaging prose style. Anyone
                    interested in the history of progressive higher education in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
                    the history of race and education in America, and the history of Appalachia will profit from reading
                    this book.</p>

            <p>This revised edition of the late Murray Holliday's history (originally published in 1980)
                    maintains the original text and organization while adding a biographical sketch of society

                    historical markers. Appendices document officers, charter members, award winners, annual dinners and

                    the photographs are undated, and the captions vary from providing full names and extensive <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-102-3-115"/> biographical detail (p. 19) to stating as little as
                    "Grandma Reese and Robert" (p. 6). Presented without any narrative, the
                    juxtaposition of images implicitly suggests a silent continuity of past and present. For example, on
                    page 27 a stern-faced, Victorianera couple sits with hands clasped in front of their white clapboard
                    house; in a photo immediately above, a 1990s-era senior-portrait style photo depicts two sisters in
                    jeans and sweaters seated with hands clasped, at the base of a tree-aside from a common family name
                    in both captions no other explanation is given. This volume should prove useful for its
                    dissemination of a wide variety of historical photographs depicting small-town life in Indiana.</p>

            <p>This handy reference brings together photographs and commentary about Indiana high school basketball

                    "golden." Photographs depict players in mostly posed or candid settings, though a
                    few document actual play. Likewise, the commentary primarily emphasizes players and teams, with some
                    description of actual games. An appendix lists brackets and scores for each year's
                    tournament from the sweet sixteen round to the finals.</p>

            <p>Since 1991, the Exotic Feline Rescue Center near Center Point, Indiana, has been a home for big
                    cats-166 lions, tigers, leopards, ocelots, cougars, and bobcats as of this book's
                    publication-that have either grown too old for zoos and circuses or suffered abuse and neglect at
                    the hands of private owners. A foreword warns the average person of the complications and dangers of
                    owning big cats as pets, but the beautiful, full-page, color portraits of the animals paired with
                    compelling life histories will make any reader want to drive out and see them in person.</p>
