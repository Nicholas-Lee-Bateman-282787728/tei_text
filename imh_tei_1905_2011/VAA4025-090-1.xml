            <head>Battling the Great Depression on Stage in Indiana</head>
            <byline>George T. Blakey*</byline>
            <p>The Federal Theatre Project (FTP) during the 1930s was, in many respects, a typical New Deal response
                    to the economic crisis of the Great Depression. It was an experiment to create jobs for the
                    unemployed—in this case theater people, including actors, directors, and technical crew.
                    The federal government initiated, financed, and regulated the project, and the American public
                    enjoyed its results in a variety of dramatic productions at minimal cost. In the end the FTP, like
                    so many other New Deal programs, became embroiled in partisan controversy and expired before it
                    could prove its potential or leave a significant legacy. Indiana's participation in the FTP
                    was not unlike that of the other thirty states, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>, which hosted this New Deal experiment, but it did differ in two major ways. Whereas
                    most state projects assumed an almost passive role and followed federal directives,
                    Indiana's chartered an almost autonomous course often in conflict with national wishes. And
                    whereas the original goal was to create a "national theater" with considerable
                    standardization of American themes, the Hoosier FTP prided itself on staging works by Indiana
                    authors about local subjects. While not openly defiant of federal goals and regulations,
                    Indiana's FTP proved an example of state independence and provincial pride much in keeping
                    with the state's tradition of individualism. As a case study, the Indiana FTP reveals a
                    unique instance of the arts being used to combat economic depression, provides new evidence about
                    the tensions between federal centralization and Hoosier "home rule," and exposes a
                    philosophical contradiction within the New Deal itself.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 1929, the Great Depression proved resistant to private and governmental remedies. Banks
                    failed, factories closed, farmers could not find markets for their products. Unemployment reached a
                    record high of thirteen million, an estimated 25 percent <list type="footnotes">

                    Roosevelt's New Deal, starting in 1933, tried several new measures that proved only partly
                    successful. The Bank Holiday and reform legislation stabilized the financial community, and farm
                    programs helped to reduce agricultural surpluses. Unemployment, however, remained high as the
                    private sector failed to absorb the jobless. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)
                    distributed $3,000,000,000 in welfare benefits to millions of needy, including four
                    hundred thousand people in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> To provide jobs in late 1933 and early
                    1934, the Civil Works Administration (CWA) employed at its peak four million jobless, more than one
                    hundred thousand of whom were Hoosiers.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> These emergency measures reduced some
                    of the economic woes but were admittedly temporary. A larger, more systematic, attack on
                    unemployment seemed to be needed; thus, the Works Projects Administration (WPA) was established in
                    1935 under the direction of Harry Hopkins, who had also directed both the FERA and CWA.</p>
            <p>The WPA created a massive number of jobs and, at the same time, produced useable or lasting
                    facilities for the public. When possible the WPA tried to match jobs with the skills of the jobless,
                    not just hire people for make-work activities. The agency lasted until 1943 when World War II
                    rendered it unnecessary, and it ultimately hired approximately nine million people and spent more
                    than $11,000,000,000. Famous for road work, the WPA also built thousands of schools,
                    parks, and bridges. In Indiana alone it employed ninety-nine thousand at its peak, spent a total of
                    $302,000,000, and worked on 24,000 miles of roads, 3,000 bridges, 361 parks, and 78
                        schools.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A small and unique section of WPA employed artists, musicians, writers, and theater personnel. Known
                    as Federal One, it never constituted more than 2 percent of the total WPA work force,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> but it generated more publicity and controversy than the other 98 percent. Federal
                    One's employees painted murals in public buildings, performed musical programs, wrote such
                    publications as the American Guide series, and staged hundreds of theatrical productions for an
                    audience of millions. This extraordinary government subsidy for the arts was virtually unprecedented

            <p>Darkened theaters across America in 1935 stood in mute testimony to the effect of the Great
                    Depression and the need for Federal One. Unemployed workers did not purchase tickets; consequently,
                    inactive box offices could not pay actors' salaries. <placeName>

                    and children permitted her this venture into federal service in 1935 because she envisioned the FTP
                    as a major catalyst for change. The project could go well beyond the simple employment of actors,
                    she believed. It could lead to "the establishment of theatres so vital to community life
                    that they will continue to function" long after the New Deal measures were no longer
                        necessary.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Under Flanagan's creative leadership the FTP fulfilled many of its goals between 1935 and
                    1939. The project provided jobs for an average of ten thousand unemployed theater people per year
                    and paid them wages that averaged $20.00 per week.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> They presented
                    plays, puppet shows, and vaudeville acts for an audience estimated at thirty million people, some of
                    whom had never experienced live theater previously. Many of the performances charged no admission
                    fee, and those that did had a top ticket price far below the going rate for regular commercial
                    presentations. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for example, the most expensive FTP ticket was forty cents compared to
                    $2.75 for the best ticket to a commercial touring production.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Many
                    young actors such as Joseph Cotton, Arlene Francis, and Burt Lancaster kept their fledgling careers
                    moving with FTP work, and several directors such as Orson Welles and John Houseman advanced their
                    reputations with these government-sponsored ventures. Welles in particular gained notoriety by
                    staging a version of Macbeth with an all black cast set in <placeName>

                    Flanagan's experimental bent, the FTP incorporated new techniques and social protest in its
                    Living Newspaper productions, which highlighted current issues with multimedia presentations.
                    Perhaps the peak of the FTP's success came with the premier of Sinclair Lewis's It
                    Can't Happen Here, an antifascist production based on Lewis's recent novel. Amid a
                    barrage of publicity, the FTP mounted multiple versions of the play simultaneously in eighteen
                    cities, one of which was <placeName>

                    a premature death. Some conservative politicians found the FTP a vulnerable target for their attacks
                    on the New Deal and branded it a hotbed of radicalism, even communism. Congressional investigators
                    accused the FTP of fiscal irresponsibility and ideological subversion although they substantiated
                    few of these allegations. By 1939, however, President Roosevelt had to compromise with his critics,
                    and the FTP was one of the New Deal measures to be jettisoned. Its innovation and visibility made it
                    an easy scapegoat, then a sacrificial lamb.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Indiana, like thirty other states, had enough unemployed theater personnel to justify a local FTP
                    unit. With the exception of <placeName>

                    </placeName> all of the Hoosier state's neighbors also established their own theater
                    project. National FTP leaders selected state directors to survey WPA relief rolls to find qualified
                    theater people—actors, directors, and technical crew—and transfer them to the
                    FTP rolls. Although the WPA was, in a sense, the parent of FTP, the family relationship was unusual
                    and strained. Semi-autonomous as a federal employee, the state FTP director would work with the
                    state WPA director but not be accountable to him; he was responsible directly to the national FTP
                    director and had a budget separate from the state WPA budget. This tortuous chain of command was
                    destined to create political and budgetary conflicts.</p>
            <p>The man selected to direct the Indiana FTP was well suited to manage a project for theater people but
                    was not particularly well equipped to deal with the overlapping bureaucracy and regulations of both
                    state and federal governments. Lee Norvelle came to the job with the right academic credentials. He
                    was a professor of speech and theater at Indiana University and had successfully directed shows in
                    makeshift spaces since 1925. He was also a man of unconventional background and firm opinions. A

                    Following a series of transfers in and out of several colleges, Norvelle finally entered Indiana
                    University from which he graduated in 1922. He taught briefly in <placeName>

            <p>Norvelle's appointment as the state FTP director in 1935 set off a series of clashes between
                    Indiana and federal politicians. These conflicts often caught Norvelle between two governmental
                    forces and revealed the tensions between regional pride and federal power. The tension had been
                    there through most of the Hoosier past but was more intense since citizen dependence on federal
                    largess had accelerated during the depression. Between 1933 and 1935 Hopkins's FERA had
                    distributed welcome relief revenues in Indiana, but the accompanying pressure to centralize and
                    professionalize the welfare bureaucracy of the state was an unwelcome threat to old traditions.
                    Township trustees had long operated with considerable autonomy in administering relief to the
                    state's needy. Unlike most other states Indiana managed to win several battles in this
                    welfare war, with Hoosier home-rule advocates maintaining much local control over the national
                    relief funds. A similar struggle and compromise occurred in 1936 when the State Department of Public
                    Welfare was established to accommodate the new national Social Security administration. Indiana
                    again welcomed the federal revenues but insisted on controlling many aspects of their local
                        implementation.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Caught in this political crossfire, Norvelle found himself
                    on unfamiliar ground and almost abandoned the FTP experiment.</p>

                    procedures for setting up the state unit. Indiana Governor Paul V. McNutt and state WPA

                    they regarded as usurpation of their responsibility. Although Coy was a federal WPA official, his
                    loyalties were to Indiana and his mentor, McNutt. He had been the governor's aide before
                    being appointed to the WPA position, and his traditional political instincts compelled him to

                    Coy's office in setting up the FTP unit. Norvelle later remembered that one of
                    Coy's assistants "had been told to give me the smallest available office and the
                    least qualified secretary &amp; and let me cool my heels until I learned who should give out the
                    news releases."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> After weeks of foot-dragging by the state WPA
                    organization and the resultant inactivity, Norvelle was finally able to select FTP personnel from
                    WPA relief rolls and was ready to begin; but he found state WPA officials reluctant to release the
                    necessary funds. The frustrated Norvelle threatened to resign, telling his federal superiors that he
                    was tired of being "indefinitely delayed through the political maneuvering of persons who
                    are not in sympathy &amp;."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Several hasty telephone calls and
                    wires from federal to state administrators broke the impasse, and Norvelle moved ahead; but state
                    leaders displayed a lingering fear and mistrust that this new enterprise might prove an embarrassing
                    boondoggle over which they had little control.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This extended tug-of-war was not a partisan struggle; all the participants—federal, state,
                    and Norvelle—were some shade of Democrat. The conflict also had little to do with clashes
                    of personality or ego. McNutt generally cooperated with the Roosevelt administration because he
                    wanted the presidential nomination for himself in the near future. Norvelle cooperated with McNutt
                    because of a long mutual friendship.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The clash was, instead, a power play
                    between two levels of government. It sprang from generations of distrust over federal and state
                    jurisdictions, the lines of which were shifting rapidly during the 1930s.</p>
            <p>A similar but briefer power play took place concerning the selection of a theater building for the
                    Hoosier FTP. Norvelle had negotiated rental terms for B. F. Keith's theater, a site he
                    considered suitable for his project. This venerable vaudeville house, located at 117 North <placeName>

                    dark during the early depression. Keith's had a lighted marquee, gilded balconies and
                    boxes, an orchestra pit, special effect machines, adequate dressing rooms and office space, seating
                    for almost 1,400, and an ideal downtown location close to several popular restaurants.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> United Theatres Company owned Keith's and was willing to see the building put

                    use 25 percent of that to publicize the group's productions.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Coy was
                    reluctant, however, for the FTP to rent Keith's. He doubted that the project would succeed
                    and wanted Norvelle to find a smaller auditorium. Coy questioned whether a company of unemployed
                    actors could attract large crowds, and empty rows of seats in the cavernous Keith's would
                    just draw attention to the skimpy attendance. Indiana could be humiliated by this failure.
                    Coy's reservations were justifiable. FTP projects elsewhere were getting a rocky start with
                    resignations, censorship disputes, and bad publicity, all of which had been reported in Indiana
                        newspapers.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> A desire to protect Indiana from similar failure could explain
                    Coy's lack of enthusiasm for grandiose plans. Norvelle won on this battle, however; and the
                    FTP opened in Keith's on schedule, although a little less ready than the theater group had
                    hoped because of the various obstacles that had been placed in its way.</p>
            <p>Norvelle had few illusions about the professional quality of his local troupe of theater people. They
                    after all came from the ranks of the unemployed. He also never forgot that the FTP was a relief
                    project first and foremost. What emerged from Norvelle's survey of the state WPA relief
                    rolls was an eclectic mixture of talent and experience. From a pool of approximately eighty eligible
                    individuals, he assembled a professional stage director, twenty or so actors, two electricians, a
                    carpenter, wardrobe mistress, assorted stage hands, and a janitorial staff. "None of these
                    people were extremely talented," he recalled, "but they'd done all kinds
                    of work."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> For instance, Jack Duval was an actor of considerable
                    experience and competence but currently down on his luck, and Joseph Shea had once worked as a
                    properties man for the Metropolitan Opera.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Early in the process of developing
                    the casts for plays, Norvelle lamented to the national FTP the dim prospects of mounting viable
                    shows with the "frail reeds" that he had assembled. This problem was not unique to
                    the Hoosier state; it was common to FTP units across America. Consequently, federal guidelines
                    permitted state directors to supplement their troupes with nonrelief personnel to enhance the
                    quality of productions so long as these extras did not exceed 10 percent of the total payroll. On
                    occasion, then, Norvelle would hire some of his students from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> campus, and the national FTP would "loan" extra actors. For example
                    seven actors from <placeName>

                    did not want to be regarded as indigent; they worked hard and long and did not demand overtime
                    wages. And they developed a hearty group morale which Norvelle encouraged and enjoyed.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Included in the approximately eighty Hoosiers employed in the Indiana FTP were two groups who did not

                    </placeName>. From the ranks of the unemployed Norvelle inherited two vaudeville ensembles, one
                    white and one black, which performed skits and musical numbers. These ensembles worked independently
                    and accepted bookings around the state where they frequently entertained, at no charge, enthusiastic
                    audiences at schools, civic organizations, and many Civilian Conservation Corps camps.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Norvelle also established a children's theater in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Prior to the arrival of the WPA, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> resident Betty Lyman had conducted a children's theatrical workshop in the
                    city, and the FTP incorporated this group into a project that continued and accelerated its
                    momentum. A few adults received pay for directing and technical work, and children from the Calumet
                    region learned and performed.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> This children's unit and the two
                    vaudeville ensembles were intriguing facets of the Hoosier FTP. They both merit further scholarly
                    investigation.</p>
            <p>Selecting plays for his troupe to perform at Keith's placed Norvelle at odds with national
                    FTP goals. Part of Flanagan's vision was to create a national theater that would provide
                    bold, high quality productions. She was tired of commercial <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> shows that toured or were mounted by local companies in watered-down versions of their <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> originals; consequently, she encouraged state directors to innovate rather than follow
                    old traditions. As admirable as this policy might have been—and as in keeping with other
                    New Deal experiments—Indiana's FTP did not pursue this course as often as
                    Flanagan wished or as well as other state units. At times Norvelle's selections of plays
                    directly conflicted with Flanagan's suggestions. Some of the conflict sprang from their
                    philosophical differences. Flanagan advocated the <hi rend="i">avant garde</hi> in drama and wanted
                    to educate and stretch the audience. Norvelle, on the other hand, was more comfortable with
                    entertainment than inspiration. Although both were academics, she was world-traveled and worked at
                    an elite eastern school; his experience was rooted in mid-America with its more conservative taste.
                    Flanagan and Norvelle also differed in their perception of the audience's role. She
                    accepted the unique reality of a government-subsidized theater in which audience reaction and box
                    office receipts were secondary; artistic merit was the primary goal. Norvelle, to the contrary,
                    never departed from the rule that the public had to be pleased, that ticket <list type="footnotes">

                    personal differences also reflected contrasting economic beliefs. Flanagan was a true New Dealer,
                    who believed that people and federal programs to help them were more important than balanced
                    budgets. Norvelle's penurious youth had made him cautious with money, and his adopted state
                    of Indiana lived under a constitution that forbade deficit spending.</p>
            <p>These differences in background and philosophy manifested themselves in divergent attitudes about
                    what shows to produce. The national FTP established the National Play Bureau to evaluate and
                    recommend to state directors suitable scripts for production. This group of professionals judged
                    plays on their technical and acting difficulty, their content and message, and their potential cost
                    and audience reaction. Although the bureau could recommend and discourage, it did not have mandatory
                    powers; consequently, it had virtually no impact on what appeared on the stage at Keith's
                    in 1936–1937. Norvelle walked an independent line and ignored the advice of the bureau
                    most of the time. "I did it on my own," he recalled later, and put together a
                    "good mixture of farce, comedy and tragedy."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> He selected
                    plays that he had produced earlier at Indiana University or ones with which his stage director felt
                    comfortable. Charles Berkell, Norvelle's first stage director, had managed stock companies
                    for many years in Indiana and worked well with older, traditional fare. James Cameron from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> replaced Berkell in late 1936, but play selection changed little. Standard fare
                    continued despite the bureau's encouragement to be more modern and experimental. A review
                    of the forty-one locally produced shows indicates that an overwhelming number of them were older,
                    conventional, familiar pieces. From The Old Maid to Sis Hopkins to Penny Arcade, Hoosier FTP
                    selections did not aspire to challenge or stretch the audience. On two occasions Norvelle relented
                    to bureau pressure and mounted Noah and Laughing Boy, new plays with unusual treatments. Neither
                    could be regarded as successful, judging from reviewer comments and small audiences.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> If anything, this rare departure from the familiar must have confirmed
                    Norvelle's position about appropriate fare for Hoosier tastes.</p>
            <p>Flanagan and Norvelle argued frequently about play selection. He insisted that since the local FTP
                    had no stars with which to attract an audience he had to present shows of popular appeal. The highly
                    publicized It Can't Happen Here, which drew small audiences and lackluster reviews,
                    provided further proof of his contention. The experimental, topical, and satirical Living Newspaper
                    productions were popular in such major cities as <placeName>

                    Living Newspaper shows, but she could not persuade Norvelle to experiment with the new medium.
                    Although he offered to resign if she could find a replacement for him, nothing came of this offer,
                    and Flanagan had to accommodate his less than innovative approach. Later Norvelle took great delight
                    in recalling, frequently and correctly, that box office receipts in Indiana paid for more of the
                    production costs than did those of any other state FTP unit except the one in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> An artistic and fiscal conservative to the end, Norvelle enjoyed
                    applause of a different kind.</p>
            <p>Norvelle and Flanagan disagreed even more strongly about production schedules than about play
                    selection. He wanted to present a different show each week to keep the bill changing rapidly,
                    thereby encouraging audiences to develop a habit of attending the theater regularly.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The first five productions of the Indiana FTP ran for one week each with the next show
                    in rehearsal. Berkell, the stage director, had long experience with stock companies and weekly
                    changes of bill, so Norvelle's policy had some local precedent. Doubting that Norvelle
                    could produce plays of sufficient quality in so short a time, Flanagan questioned this routine early
                    on. In April, 1936, only a month after the Hoosier unit opened, she wrote him: "I am
                    wondering whether it is necessary to change the bill every week &amp;. It is difficult for me to
                    believe that any standard, after only a week's rehearsal can be very high
                    &amp;." She reminded him that all the other FTP projects devoted more time to rehearsal
                    and presentation and that dark days with nothing playing were of little consequence.
                    "Nowhere else in the country," she insisted, "have we any company
                    offering so rapid a turnover."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Although a complete listing of
                    rehearsal times for all FTP units is not available, a comparison with two others is revealing. The
                    average time spent in preparation for a play in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> was about six weeks; in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers often confirmed her doubts. Critics from the Star, News, and Times covered
                    all the local FTP productions, and for the most part they wrote professional reviews that commented
                    on both strengths and weakness, acting as well as technical work. A recurring theme from these
                    reviews was that the cast could use more rehearsal time or that the opening night show was not quite
                    ready.</p>

            <p>In apparent response to these criticisms Norvelle modified his routine. Some plays began to run for
                    two weeks, but only once in the first year of production did Norvelle allow the theater to sit dark.
                    Flanagan's assistant, John McGee, continued to pressure Norvelle for more quality and less
                    quantity. He advised, "I think you ought not to open a play until you definitely know you
                    are ready, even if it means dark weeks."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Regardless, after a few more
                    shows with two week runs, Norvelle returned to his weekly change of bill. Small audiences and weak
                    box office receipts did not seem to justify extended runs. Finally FTP suggestions turned into
                    regulations, and Norvelle's independence presumably was one of the reasons for the change.
                    In April, 1937, the FTP Play Policy Board ruled that "weekly stock has no place on the
                    Federal Program and that such companies as are now playing weekly stock shift to a production basis
                    &amp; more generally in line with FTP policies &amp;."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> McGee
                    informed Flanagan that this new ruling could possibly "break the Indiana project"
                    and suggested to Norvelle that fewer and better shows might attract larger audiences than the
                    "continuous and rather mediocre performances" at Keith's.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The Hoosier unit subsequently did produce fewer shows alternating with dark weeks, but
                    the resulting productions were not necessarily better because of the scheduling changes. Said Pasha,
                    the only musical offered by the Indiana FTP, opened to uniformly negative notices following ample
                    rehearsal time.</p>
            <p>The national FTP scheduling victory over Indiana was somewhat Pyrrhic. The Hoosier FTP ceased
                    operation in July, 1937, for reasons partly related to scheduling. Norvelle knew that the quality of
                    his productions was not very high; that hallmark had never been a primary goal. He also knew that
                    attendance was declining, a fact that was of some concern. Other factors also led to the demise of
                    the project. Because of a WPA funding cutback all FTP units had to reduce personnel in mid-1937, a
                    reduction that Norvelle felt his small group could not survive. These conditions, combined with his
                    desire to remain in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> unit. The Indiana FTP jettisoned future productions and ceased operations with the
                    final performance of <hi rend="i">Bill of Divorcement</hi>, their forty-first production. That play
                    had a run of ten days. Norvelle remained independent to the end.</p>
            <p>Flanagan's vision for the FTP included an American theater to focus on national themes, but
                    this part of her conception was doomed by a variety of factors. Regional art had become a powerful
                    phenomenon in the 1920s, a circumstance that continued during the Great Depression. Such painters as

                    Group preceded them by several years. Some of the state FTP directors tapped into this cultural
                    phenomenon. They discovered that puppet shows and patriotic pageants which highlighted local history
                    were easy to mount and generated audience enthusiasm. A few states staged full-scale dramatic
                    productions to instill pride in local heritage. <placeName>

                    populations with performances in Spanish or Yiddish, and there were several shows by and about
                    African Americans. Flanagan also found that many directors chose to ignore her interest in national
                    themes for reasons of finance or expedience. Shakespeare was in the public domain, so his works
                    appeared frequently and reduced royalty costs. Local adaptations of such classics as <hi rend="i">Cinderella</hi> and <hi rend="i">Hansel and Gretel</hi> also appeared with regularity for young
                        audiences.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Norvelle departed further from Flanagan's national emphasis than did most state FTP
                    directors, and his obvious regionalism pointed out a major contradiction in her vision. Indiana
                    distinguished itself by promoting state playwrights, Hoosier settings, and local connections.
                    Although a few state units mounted an occasional production to capitalize on local pride, Norvelle
                    made concerted attempts to move in this direction. Indiana authors wrote five of the forty-one
                    locally produced shows, and these productions received heavy promotion on that angle alone. Had the
                    Indiana FTP not ended in July, 1937, the next scheduled play would have been another Hoosier
                    offering. Norvelle had earlier informed the national headquarters that he was seeking additional
                    scripts by state authors, and an invitation to Hoosier playwrights to submit their manuscripts for
                    consideration drew a large number of potential plays.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Audience reaction proved
                    Norvelle's regional focus a valid one. The best attendance for any one-week run was for The
                    Hoosier Schoolmaster, written and dramatized by Hoosiers about a local subject; and the record
                    holder for attendance at a two-week run was Do Unto Others, likewise written by an Indiana
                    playwright and with a Hoosier setting.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> This almost provincial focus in Indiana
                    was actually more in harmony with the WPA's vision of public works than was
                    Flanagan's concept of a federal theater; her nationalism contradicted a strong regionalism
                    in Hopkins's agency and caused tensions between New Deal planners and local administrators.

                    Likewise, the project for artists encouraged painters to emphasize local themes for gallery exhibits
                    and murals for public buildings. What might have appeared at the time to be obstinance or
                    parochialism by Norvelle was more nearly in keeping with the WPAs goals than was Flanagan's

                    planned with publicity in mind.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Tarkington was a famous native son and still
                    lived in the capital city. His novels had been popular for decades, and he was the recipient of

                    play, and both critics and audiences had enjoyed the production.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Although
                    Clarence had not yet been released for stock companies, Tarkington generously allowed Norvelle and
                    the FTP to use it for their opening, and Norvelle emphasized Tarkington's largess in the

                    presentation at Keith's of an Indiana playwright. Whereas Clarence's ties with the
                    state were strictly through its author, Schoolmaster's locale and subject were both truly
                    Hoosier. Eggleston had grown up along the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, first in <placeName>

                    from grade school undoubtedly gave him a strong empathy with the story. There had been previous
                    attempts to dramatize the novel for the screen and stage, but Norvelle felt they were not successful
                    because they departed too much from Eggleston's original. He therefore crafted his own
                    version, using as much of "Eggleston's dialogue as possible" and
                    insisting that the "characterizations are, for the most part, identical with those created
                    by Mr. Eggleston."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    fictional Flat Creek citizenry outnumbered the available actors, Norvelle recruited and costumed
                    backstage crew to fill the smaller roles. When the FTP production opened on March 16, 1936, local
                    newspaper reviewers commented favorably on the elaborate sets of log cabin and schoolhouse interior
                    scenes, and they were amused by the actors' attempts to duplicate nineteenth-century rural
                    dialect. By general consensus one highlight of the play was the same as in the novel, the tense and
                    humorous spelling bee, which brings most of the community together and reveals much about the

                    called the dean of Hoosier writers, he had published poems, stories, essays, and novels, most
                    prominent among which were The Hoosiers (1900) and The House of a Thousand Candles (1905). In 1936

                    failing local economy. Although Kearnsville could have been anywhere in the Midwest, the authors

                    and temperatures rose above 100 degrees for days in a row. During the run of the play one stretch of

                    Although Norvelle was not enthusiastic about the script, he agreed to produce the play only if

            <p>Another world premier, One Night at Brenda's, was the fifth and final production of a

                    </placeName> and studied at Butler University before serving in the military during the Great War.
                    He joined the Star as a reporter in 1919 and remained with the paper in various capacities for the
                    rest of his life.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Long interested in the theater, Tiernan had never had a play
                    produced prior to this one. It received the same boosterish publicity as the other four plays by
                    Indiana authors, and the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The Brenda in question in Tiernan's comedy-drama operates a roadhouse and nightclub where a
                    group of high school classmates hold a twentieth reunion. There they encounter a group of unsavory

                    resemblance to characters created by another current newspaperman, Damon Runyon. Although the script
                    was still under revision at the time of production and the setting had nothing to do with Indiana,
                    Tiernan received celebrity attention on opening night. He also received encouraging notices for his
                    "Baptism of fire" on stage and reasonably good attendance.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
                    Tiernan continued his love of the theater and wrote Man Bites Dog, a play about newspaper work,
                    which the local FTP had scheduled for production when the project closed in July, 1937. Because One
                    Night was still a work in progress and his second effort was not produced, the national FTP script
                    appraisers had no opportunity to evaluate them. Considering their negative record with other Hoosier
                    plays, this silence might have been a good thing for Tiernan's still optimistic ambitions
                    as a writer in 1936–1937.</p>

            <p>Indiana's FTP closed before the major criticism of the national FTP damaged its reputation
                    with a taint of radicalism. Norvelle's selection of traditional and nonpolitical plays
                    would have exempted the Hoosier project from most of that criticism anyway. The Indiana FTP was a
                    brief and small episode during the depression, and it did not aspire to greatness or originality as
                    did its national model. It existed to create jobs for the unemployed and to provide entertainment at
                    a low cost. In those two goals it succeeded admirably. Approximately seventy people drew decent
                    wages for plying their craft at Keith's to an audience estimated at 150,000.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Many of those employees would continue their careers after the FTP closed in 1937, some
                    as actors, some in broadcasting, some in technical work. A few returned to college, and a few
                    retired or returned to relief rolls.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> As short-lived and modest as it was, the
                    Hoosier FTP provides another example of individualism and regional pride to add to the long list
                    that characterizes Indiana history. Pursuing an independent course despite federal wishes to the

                    national conformity, the FTP in Indiana shone uniquely in the national spotlight.</p>
            <p>In a broader context the Indiana FTP serves as a microcosm of the political tensions that had kept
                    federal and Hoosier officials wary of each other for generations. The Great Depression heightened
                    those tensions, especially when relief and public works activity created additional disagreements
                    over funding and administration. Norvelle's interpretation of the FTP—jobs and
                    regionalism—was closely allied with that of the WPA vision. When Flanagan added her own
                    aesthetic and national dimensions to that vision, an inconsistency of goals emerged. This
                    philosophical contradiction further strained relations between <placeName>

            <p>Since the 1960s some historians have argued that the roots of the National Endowment for the Arts
                    (NEA) reach back to Federal One, which included the FTP. Indeed, President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson's political career began in the 1930s and his Great Society measure can be seen as
                    a continuation of the New Deal's subsidies for the arts. A closer parallel for the Indiana
                    FTP, however, would be the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. CETA provided
                    employment, wages, and training on the job, a less sophisticated concept than the NEA but one more
                    in line with what Norvelle and his company were doing at Keith's Theatre in the 1930s.</p>

                    itinerant peddler, an imposter, a fraud, a forger, a vagabond, and otherwise "a notorious

                    doctorates in fifteen academic subjects. During the early nineteenth century M.A. degrees were
                    unusual, and "Doctorates" in areas other than medicine, theology, and law were
                        nonexistent.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Perhaps just as unusual, Bennett proposed to confer
                    doctorates on women. Riddell tried to dissuade him from this course of action, particularly in
                    medicine, as "prejudiced beings") would oppose it. Bennett roared that he had hung
                    out "the banner of reform" and wanted others to rally around it;<hi rend="sup">22</hi> nevertheless, he meekly revised the bylaws to exclude women from receiving medical degrees.
                    Women could still achieve doctorates in seven other areas of study, however, and the Christian
                    College became one of the first publicly chartered coeducational colleges in America.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A reform that Bennett refused to compromise was a provision that permitted the awarding of diplomas
                    based upon examination. Bennett had been interested in this concept since the early 1820s when, at
                    the completion of his own three-year preceptorship in medicine, he was required to pass a six-hour
                    examination administered by several physicians, including Perkins. During the examination he
                    defended the proposition that "all applicants for a Diploma granting plenary power to
                    practice Medicine and Surgery according to the laws of the State, shall be examined by the Censors,
                    and, if found qualified, received into full membership without regard to the time studied."
                    Bennett believed that practical experience with a competent mentor was the best way to become
                    proficient as a physician.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Christian College bylaws stated that degrees were "merely certification in attestation
                    of the attainments of the persons on whom they are conferred." While the degrees
                    "should never be bestowed too cheaply," they should be based upon merit and not
                    upon "the length of time spent in preparatory studies.") Therefore,

            <p>Despite this seemingly well-organized effort to get the Christian College underway, problems emerged
                    almost from the beginning. Some editors of regional sectarian newspapers promptly attacked
                    Bennett's pretentious plans. John M. Peck, a Baptist elder and editor of the Pioneer in
                            <placeName>

                    the Christian College with "much merriment and sarcasm."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more serious problem arose with leaders of the Christian church. When Bennett applied to the
                    legislature for the charter, he listed ten petitioners including Stone and Scott. The Christian
                    College's charter identified Stone as the corporation's secretary, and he was
                    subsequently elected a vice-president. Stone, however, stated that he "had no knowledge,
                    nor hint that application was to be made to the legislature for such a charter, or had been made, or
                    granted" until he saw it announced in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gazette. He was ignorant "of the appointment of presidents, vice presidents,
                    secretaries and all other officers, till informed by the same journal." He claimed
                    "that not half dozen of our influential friends, or brethren, had been
                        consulted."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Bennett sent him a "pompous letter"
                    requesting that he print an announcement about the college in the Christian Messenger. Stone ignored
                    the letter.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scott also claimed that he had first heard about the college when he received a letter stating that
                    he had been unanimously elected "President of the Faculty." Bennett also sent
                    Scott a copy of the Christian College charter that listed Scott's name as one of the
                    original petitioners. Scott viewed this "as an absolute forgery" and
                    "declined every and all connection" with the school. He refused to publish a
                    notice about the college in the Evangelist and wrote against it in his private correspondence.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    "been endeavoring to excite an interest in the community in behalf of a literary
                    institution." He had, he announced, finally succeeded in establishing just such a school in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Bennett encouraged Campbell to attend the April trustees' meeting and
                    reported that the academic programs of the college were to begin shortly thereafter. Finally, he
                    requested that Campbell publish a favorable announcement about the Christian College in the
                    Millennial Harbinger.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever Bennett's motivation, his actions were extremely undiplomatic. Campbell was upset
                    with the entire undertaking. The establishment of a Christian college was "wholly
                    unexpected." He had, he affirmed, "heard nothing of this project until it was
                    consummated." Campbell had believed that Bennett's failure to establish colleges
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> had broken his spirits and that he "had given it up." Campbell stated
                    that the remarks to which Bennett alluded "were not made with a design to enlist"
                    him in such an enterprise, particularly as Bennett was already involved in it. Distressed that the
                    members of the Christian church had not been contacted before submission of the proposal to the
                    Indiana legislature, Campbell commented that it would "have been more respectful to the
                    judgment and wishes of the brethren to have consulted them on the propriety of such a
                    scheme." He presumed, however, that in "the pressure of events" Bennett
                    had "not time to confer with many of them upon the matter." Campbell was
                    particularly concerned with the purported connection between the college and the Christian church, a
                    connection he wanted severed. He refused to attend the trustees' meeting scheduled for
                        April.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Campbell's election as president of the Christian College had been announced in
                    newspapers, Bennett's letter to Campbell made no mention of this fact.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Even after the exchange of letters Bennett continued to publish statements identifying
                    Campbell as the president of the institution. It is likely that Bennett believed Campbell's
                    involvement would encourage the participation of Scott, Stone, and other Christian ministers.
                    Campbell's connection was also a necessity for potential fund raising activities within the
                    Christian church.</p>

                    "very bad health."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> It is probable that other Christian
                    ministers also stayed away as a result of Campbell's published concerns and the private
                    correspondence from Stone and Scott. Whatever the attendance, business was conducted. Faculty
                    members were appointed, and three new ordinances were passed. "Ordinance No. 2"
                    stated that all male members of the Christian Church were members of the corporation.
                    "Ordinance No. 3" changed the bylaws to give Bennett the power to call
                    trustees' meetings "at any time he may deem it expedient." This revision
                    was in direct violation of the college's charter, which required quarterly meetings of the
                    trustees. Based upon Campbell's concerns, "Ordinance No. 4" stated that
                    the trustees retained the name of the Christian College as required by their charter but changed the
                    name of the institution that they supervised to the "University of Indiana, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> This strange twist of logic satisfied Campbell. He
                    indicated that "as a literary institution, liberal and anti-sectarian, we wish it all
                        success."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most serious problem confronting the Christian College was financial. Western colleges were
                    usually supported through a combination of subscriptions from local residents, financial support
                    from the church affiliated with the institution, and charity from eastern sources.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Bennett personally had little money, and there was no indication that other trustees were
                    willing to help launch the college. Bennett had counted upon financial support from the Christian
                    Disciples. He asked Campbell to solicit funds for the college, but Campbell refused. Bennett then
                    approached leaders of the Christian Disciples on the east coast.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> He claimed to
                    have received a grand total of fifty-four dollars in contributions for his efforts. This money he
                    used in part to reimburse his out-of-pocket expenses, which totaled one hundred fifty dollars.
                    Others later claimed that he had received more money and had pocketed the remainder.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Whatever the amount raised, it was not enough to launch the college. Bennett needed
                    another way to generate revenue.</p>

            <p>His solution to this dilemma was unique and creative. In 1833 there were only two medical schools
                    west of the <geogName>Allegheny Mountains</geogName>. There was no such school in Indiana, and none
                    would be established until 1844. Westerners interested in formal medical education mainly attended
                    eastern colleges, where the cost was prohibitive to all but wealthy individuals. As the population
                    west of the Alleghenies was rapidly expanding, state legislatures approved a variety of systems to
                    meet the medical needs of their citizens, including licensing medical practitioners after an
                    apprenticeship and the successful completion of an examination conducted by a medical society or
                    district. Passage of the examination granted physicians the right to practice medicine but not the
                    honor of listing an M.D. after their name. As medical degrees were difficult to obtain, they were
                    highly prized by their possessors and appreciated by the public, who viewed them as status symbols
                    that certified the possessor as a medical authority. Many qualified practicing physicians, however,
                    did not possess M.D.'s.</p>
            <p>Bennett decided to provide the valued status by conferring M.D.'s upon anyone who passed
                    examinations or who was otherwise obviously qualified. He expanded this concept to include other
                    academic areas such as law, theology, and the arts and sciences. Seventeen days after the Christian
                    College had been chartered by the Indiana legislature, but six days before the first
                    trustees' meeting that approved the bylaws, Bennett told Riddell that an M.D. would be
                    immediately conferred upon him.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Subsequently, Bennett conferred an LL.D. upon
                    Riddell. At that time Riddell had no background or preparation in medicine or law, nor did he
                    successfully pass any examination. When Scott rejected the offer to become the president of the
                    faculty, Bennett "garnished" an LL.D. upon him to encourage his participation.
                    Scott rejected the degree.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    College. Another announcement in the same issue of the newspaper reported that Bennett planned to
                    travel east "to procure some Anatomical preparations for the College, and to make

            <p>Only two diplomas issued by Bennett have been found, and both were issued to the same person.
                    Frederick C. Waite, a medical historian, identified only six recipients of diplomas, but he
                    suspected six others of receiving medical degrees from the Christian College.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
                    Clearly, however, many more degrees were conferred. Scott claimed that Bennett "rained down

                    numerous diplomas were vended and disposed of."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Another observer
                    reported that Bennett dispensed the "diplomas to every ignoramus who could raise ten
                    dollars to buy one." He knew "many who did buy them, though they were not worth a
                    cent." Bennett filled in the diplomas and "peddled them out."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> J. V. Himes reported that Bennett "lavished his diplomas upon
                    various gentlemen of the different sects in different parts of the <placeName>

                    thus delighted to honor with M.D., A.M., and D.D.," questioned the soundness of
                    Bennett's judgment or "the purity of his motives."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

                    College. This occasion was purportedly the only time the two men ever met, and Morrow claimed that
                    the conversation had nothing to do with diplomas or degrees. However, Bennett conferred degrees upon
                    Morrow and another faculty member, Ichabod Jones. Perhaps by design Riddell gave the degrees to the
                    two men after Bennett had departed. Riddell and Bennett claimed that Morrow, who did not possess an
                    M.D., accepted the degree with eagerness. When Morrow discovered that DeLathule had also been
                    awarded a degree and had subsequently left his college, he refused to pay for his own M.D.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Morrow claimed that Bennett granted degrees to prominent individuals as an
                    inducement to encourage others to purchase them.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> He later asserted that he
                    wrote to Bennett objecting to the practice of selling degrees but that the letter was not delivered
                    as the bearer could not find Bennett.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Under pressure from Morrow and Jones,
                    Riddell rejected the LL.D. degree and the position of treasurer and bursar at the Christian College.
                    On November 24 Riddell and Jones confronted Bennett, who had by then relocated to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Bennett promised that he would not confer more degrees on the
                    Reformed Medical College students "until after they shall have graduated," and he
                    also promised that Riddell's name "should not hereafter appear on any of his
                    diplomas under penalty of death!"<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>In addition to granting degrees himself, Bennett claimed that the Christian College bylaws authorized

            <p>In July, 1834, the trustees of Willoughby University of <geogName>Lake Erie</geogName> in

                  <settlement type="city">Chagrin</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    identified himself as a physician from <placeName>

                        Bloomfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Bennett
                    requested permission to become their agent. The trustees responded by asking him to establish their
                    medical college. He joined the Board of Trustees as an honorary member and was appointed a professor
                    of midwifery. Subsequently, the faculty elected him president of the medical college. Within a few
                    months, however, Bennett had been publicly identified as the "Diploma Pedler."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> He was charged with vending diplomas from the Christian College and was fired
                    from Willoughby University at the end of the first term. Two of the Willoughby faculty who attacked
                    Bennett were Dr. George Jones and Dr. Francis W. Walsh. When Bennett heard that he had been fired,
                    he claimed that he had never conferred the diplomas "upon unworthy
                    persons—excepting the cases of Walsh and Jones."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bennett claimed the right to confer degrees in the name of the Christian College for a ten-year
                    period. He presumably based his claim on a stipulation that prohibited the Indiana legislature from
                    amending the college's charter for that length of time. In the summer of 1834 Isaac S.
                    Ashton, bishop of the Christian church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, reported that Bennett was still "going about selling diplomas,"<hi rend="sup">73</hi> and despite his appointment at Willoughby University he continued to do so.
                    In October, 1834, he traveled to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, ostensibly to raise money for Willoughby, but he sold numerous degrees from the
                    Christian College on his travels. Six months later, when Bennett was charged with peddling diplomas,
                    he claimed that he had "quit that, you know, long since."<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

                    stated that Bennett was a vagabond without character, "a false brother and an imposter, a

                    the <hi rend="i">Christian Palladium</hi> reported that the Christian church disclaimed
                    "all connection with Mr. Bennett." Leaders of the church also announced that

            <p>In 1845 Bennett was appointed a lecturer at the Literary and Botanical Medical Society in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Morrow had also relocated and established the Eclectic Medical Institute in the Queen

                    school, he attacked Bennett, who responded by stating that he was not aware that he had ever
                    conferred more than "one that was UNDESERVED, and that one, which is YET UNPAID FOR!! was
                    on THOMAS VAUGH MORROW!!!"<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Bennett also restated his position with
                    regard to granting degrees based upon examination. He believed that the medical schools'
                    requirement for a specified term of study was based upon "purely mercenary
                    considerations." Bennett pointed out that other colleges had similar provisions. The

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    medicine provided that candidates passed appropriate examinations.<hi rend="sup">81</hi> In fact,
                    until after the Civil War many colleges granted various degrees based upon examination alone.<hi rend="sup">82</hi>

            <p>Dr. Alva Curtis, editor of the <hi rend="i">Botanico-Medical Recorder</hi>, defended Bennett and

            <p>Although subsequent historians have focused almost exclusively upon the medical degrees conferred by
                        Bennett,<hi rend="sup">85</hi> he also granted diplomas in numerous academic areas, including
                    law, divinity, and the arts and sciences. Bennett had few, if any, qualifications that justified his
                    examining anyone or conferring degrees in these areas. At the time, M.A.'s (or
                    A.M.'S) were mainly honorary degrees. A few colleges conferred them on alumni who had
                    sustained a good moral character, which sometimes meant little more than that they had stayed out of
                    jail since graduation. In 1835 there was no position in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> that required an M.A. degree.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the early decades of the nineteenth century the field of medicine was in a state of ferment,
                    and the public was justifiably confused as to the competing claims of advocates of various medical
                    theories such as those proposed by the Thomsonians, homeopaths, eclectics, and others.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> A medical degree was the only certification that transcended this debate. Medical
                    schools were mainly controlled by "regular" physicians, who fought every attempt
                    by proponents of other medical beliefs to confer degrees. Bennett's vending of medical
                    degrees was therefore perceived as a serious threat to their control of the profession.
                    Bennett's educational reform might have had more support had he carried out what he had
                    argued for: awarding degrees based upon merit and demonstrated proficiency. However, he conferred
                    degrees upon individuals who did not take examinations or who otherwise did not merit them. While
                    contemporary colleges granted relatively few degrees by examination, Bennett conferred a massive
                    number of degrees in a very brief time. While most colleges granted degrees only at the place in
                    which instruction was conducted, Bennett handed them out from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In addition, Bennett commissioned others to confer degrees, a practice not known to
                    have occurred in other institutions. <list type="footnotes">

                    confer degrees to the chancellor, the right to conduct examinations was solely vested in quarterly
                    meetings of the faculty and members of the corporation. Bennett's legalistic claim that he
                    was empowered to examine applicants was false.</p>
            <p>Bennett might merit some sympathy had he handed over the funds generated by his vending of degrees to
                    the Christian College, but he apparently appropriated the monies for his own personal use. He never
                    accounted for the expenditures generated by his selling of degrees, but during this time he was seen
                    gambling by two separate sources and was accused of speculating in real estate in <placeName>

            <p>Standing six-feet-three-inches tall, Robert H. Milroy of Indiana had "‘piercing
                    black eyes’, an aquiline nose, and long silver hair." Because of his conspicuous
                    features, men serving in his Civil War command affectionately and appropriately dubbed him
                    "Grey Eagle."' Although Milroy's military career was a checkered
                    one, his patriotism and courage were never questioned. He fought not simply for the love of fighting
                    but for the justness of the cause: the protection of "his country, the integrity of the
                    Republic, the freedom of the slave." As a general "he lived on a footing of very
                    democratic comradeship with his men," and he was literally worshipped by many of them. A
                    military colleague, General Carl Schurz, recalled that when confronting the enemy Milroy would
                    "gallop up and down his front, fiercely shaking his fist at the ‘rebel
                    scoundrels over there,’ and calling them all sorts of outrageous names," all the

                    "that in the whole history of the war, there was another instance where a regiment came
                    nearer idolizing their commander." He "never asked his men to go where he did not
                    lead, and he was brave almost to rashness."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Another soldier described
                    him to family members at home: "Imagine a large grey headed man with brown whiskers seated
                    on an iron grey horse of the corresponding proportions and speaking in a low, sharp, quick voice and
                    you have Milroy, one of the most impetuous, go ahead, fearless men in the whole army."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such respect and adulation would be glory enough for most men, but not for Milroy. He failed to
                    achieve the military recognition that he sought for a good part of his life and for this failure
                    blamed a military structure that he believed unjustly favored West Point graduates serving in the
                    regular army over all other officers regardless of ability. Milroy's charge may not have
                    been without foundation. West Point graduates were almost twice as likely to achieve the rank of
                    major general in the Union Army than those not from West Point. Denied a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Military Academy education, Milroy attributed many rebukes of his tactics and behavior
                    solely to a lack of credentials from that institution.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy's paranoia regarding West Point and the regular army became clear in June, 1863,
                    following the calamitous Second Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Removed from command and placed under arrest, Milroy remained oblivious to the
                    defeat's importance and his own deficiencies as a general, preferring to accuse a superior
                    with trying to destroy him. Milroy's Civil War experience exemplifies an instance in which
                    inflated ego, combined with overt suspicion of authority, nearly ruined a military career.</p>
            <p>Robert Huston Milroy was born into a military family on June 11, 1816, near <placeName>

            <p>The issue of educational opportunity was an important factor in deciding the course of

                    </placeName> Military Academy at West Point. As Milroy put it, "I have from the earliest
                    boyhood been ambitious and intensely desirous of military fame and renown as a general
                    &amp;." Indeed, his ambition in this regard, he said, was as "insatiable as
                    that of Alexander or Napoleon." Milroy's father, however, had a strong aversion to
                    higher education and apparently to West Point in particular. Labeling its graduates
                    "college trash," Samuel adamantly refused to pay for his son to go away to school
                    even after Robert offered to relinquish all rights to his father's estate in return for
                        assistance.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Milroy recalled, "I importuned my father for years,
                    before I was too old to procure me a position as a Cadet at West Point as I observed that that was
                    the only avenue to honorable position in our army. But he blindly, flatly refused." Of
                    Samuel Milroy's stance Robert asserted, "The old gentleman was so much of a
                    Democrat in theory and practice that he had unconquerable prejudices."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> In this era of Jacksonian Democracy, politicians and voters alike frequently debated the
                    need for a professional army. Samuel was a self-made man and volunteer soldier; perhaps he held a
                    reverse prejudice against the regular army. Nevertheless, it is ironic that what proved so
                    successful for Samuel would result in just the opposite outcome in his son's life.
                    Robert's lack of West Point training caused him to feel persecuted throughout his military
                        career.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Samuel Milroy did furnish a large family library, confident that his son "would take
                    advantage of it if he had the elements and determination of greatness in him." Robert
                    immersed himself in the library but never lost his hunger for a military education. Finally, at age
                    twenty-four and with a relative's assistance, he acquired sufficient resources to leave the
                    farm. In 1840 he visited an uncle in <placeName>

            <p>Milroy left Norwich thinking he was ready to embark upon a glorious military career; however, the
                    significance of his non—West Point background was soon apparent. After graduation he
                    applied for an army commission but was denied appointment. While the likely cause of the rejection
                    was the fact that the country was not at war, in Milroy's mind it was because he had not
                    "passed through the royal door of West Point." Milroy resolved that "army
                    favors and honors were considered the exclusive right of West Pointers, which discovery made me the
                    enemy of that Institution &amp;."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Unable to obtain an assignment,

                    intended to spend the balance of his life there, but the deaths of Samuel Milroy and an older

                    for which Milroy had been waiting. Writing to his wife years later, he acknowledged, "I

            <p>Second Lieutenant Lew Wallace, later a Civil War general and author of <hi rend="i">Ben-Hur</hi>,
                    served with Milroy and the First Indiana. A lifelong friend, Wallace held Milroy in great regard and
                    characterized his fellow Hoosier as "eager, impetuous, fierce in anger &amp; a genuine
                    colonel of cavalry." Milroy, Wallace averred, represented one of only a handful of men he
                    had met in his lifetime who truly loved combat: "In fence with sabres his wrist was like
                    flexible steel," and he possessed "a reach to make another swordsman, though ever
                    so skillful, chary of engaging him."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After mobilizing, the Indianans sailed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There they boarded ships for the <geogName>Brazos River</geogName> and service under
                    General Zachary Taylor. Much to their chagrin, the brothers Milroy, Wallace, and the First Indiana
                    participated in little combat in the next twelve months. Milroy's company divided the
                    majority of its time between a camp at the mouth of the Rio Grande and the Mexican towns of
                    Matamoras and Monterey. Most days proved monotonous and boring. Milroy and the sixty-one soldiers
                    under his command complained frequently about the vacuous nature of the experience. Milroy described
                    Mexico as a "miserable cheerless place" and grumbled that his men were getting
                    homesick &amp; dying from inactivity."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> He also displayed what was
                    to become a lifelong trait: a dislike for and suspicion of his superiors. To his brother James in
                    Indiana Milroy wrote that his company would probably remain at its location on the Rio Grande since
                    "our old Jackass of a Colonel gets at a rate of $936.00 more per annum for
                    guarding a separate post than if he was with the brigade under the Brig. Genl."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy did not show deference even to officers of the highest rank. The First Indiana's
                    transfer to Monterey in the spring of 1847 let the Hoosier get to know General Taylor, one of many
                    prominent people he would meet in his lifetime. "I see &amp; [Taylor] every day and
                    have got well acquainted with him &amp;." he penned in a letter to his sister in May,
                    1847; but despite the close association the young captain exhibited little admiration for the future
                    president, portraying him as "a low chunky very common looking old man" who did
                    not have "superior talents by any means &amp;."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Milroy's Mexican sojourn was mostly uneventful, one incident stood out. In late
                    1846 General Taylor placed four companies of the First Indiana in Milroy's charge with
                    orders to take them, first overland and then via the <geogName>Rio Grande River</geogName>, from
                    Monterey to Matamoras. With only four days' supplies for a journey that required ten, it
                    became necessary for Milroy to dispatch small foraging <list type="footnotes">

                    Jesus Maria Carvajal ambushed one five-man detachment; only two soldiers returned to the main

            </p>
            <p>The deaths of three comrades aroused Milroy. Aboard the <hi rend="i">Enterprise</hi> on the Rio
                    Grande when he received the news, Milroy, according to Wallace, immediately "buckled on his
                    sword, jumped ashore, and called for volunteers &amp;." He boldly promised that he
                    would be first to recover the dead Hoosiers' bodies and that his capture of General
                    Carvajal would result in a burning of the nearby town with the "natives &amp; [being]
                    treated to a hanging in imitation of Haman's." So persuasive was Milroy's
                    cry for revenge that not a soldier failed to respond; even the boatmen begged for guns.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy and his men soon discovered the Americans' "horribly mutilated"
                    cadavers. The brutality of the deaths only inflamed their desires to find and punish the Mexicans.
                    After some searching they located Carvajal in a small village atop a bluff. Milroy showed no
                    hesitation. He plotted a daring and courageous assault—similar to ones he would devise
                    during the Civil War—that required an advance across an open meadow, the ascent of a
                    hill, and the storming of the barricade protecting the town. Yelling, the Hoosiers rushed across the
                    prairie in double file to the base of the bluff. "Heavens! What furnace heat there was in
                    that go!" Wallace later wrote. Disappointingly for Milroy, as the troops scrambled up the
                    hill, the Mexicans exited in the opposite direction. A short firefight with the few who offered
                    resistance resulted in the killing of one of Carvajal's men and the wounding of four
                    others. Rather than torching the town as promised, Captain Milroy ordered that the injured be
                        attended.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The attack represented the apogee of Milroy's military career in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. He raised a cavalry company near the end of his term of enlistment in the hope that he
                    could take part in a significant battle before going home. The companies' services he
                    offered to General Taylor, the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, and the secretary of war. All turned him down. Discharged on June 16, 1847, Milroy
                    left Mexico disheartened, summarizing his experience with the lament: "I unfortunately got
                    into a Regiment&amp; that was cursed by an incompetent Colonel" and this combined with
                    "the shortness of the war prevented me from acquiring any reputation."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Back in Indiana, Milroy settled on law as a career. He enrolled in the Indiana University Law School

                    law and politics. In 1851 he served as a member of the convention <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A staunch Republican after the formation of the party in 1856, Milroy kept abreast of national
                    political issues, became a fervent abolitionist, and backed Lincoln's candidacy for
                    president. So ardent were Milroy's convictions on African-American rights that a regimental

                    for a regiment that became known as the "Bloody Ninth"—the Ninth
                    Indiana Volunteer Infantry. On April 23, 1861, Milroy was commissioned captain, Company G, Ninth
                    Indiana Volunteers. Four days later he was unanimously elected colonel.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Colonel Milroy spent the first months of the war under General George B. McClellan's command
                    in the counties that would, in 1863, become <placeName>

                    </placeName>. His forces protected that soon-to-be state from southern incursion. From June to
                    September, 1861, Milroy participated in Union victories at Grafton, Philippi, Carrick's
                    Ford, and Laurel Hill. He began the latter engagement in violation of orders but
                    "completely routed the enemy. The positive results of these conflicts won McClellan acclaim
                    and led ultimately to Lincoln's giving him command of the Army of the Potomac. Milroy
                    shared in the praise. On September 3, 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general. With a force
                    nearly six thousand strong, Milroy assumed charge of the <geogName>Cheat Mountain</geogName>

            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most crucial events for Milroy in 1862 were the battles of McDowell and Second Bull Run.
                    Though neither engagement produced a Union victory, each exemplified Milroy's style of
                    generalship and philosophy of warfare. What is most important, he survived these defeats with his
                    reputation intact, seemingly ready to ascend the ladder of Union military leadership; however, the
                    battles made clear as well Milroy's attitude toward the regular army, West Point, and the
                    generals of each.</p>
            <p>The Battle of McDowell on May 8, 1862, was one of many confrontations during Confederate General
                    Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson's <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName>
                    campaign. Jackson had to create a strategic diversion to prevent the armies of Generals Fremont and

                    Jackson's thirteen thousand men prepared to engage his troops, Milroy, although outnumbered
                    three to one, boldly avowed that he "would not yield a foot to treason, and so we must
                    fight." And they did fight. Believing he could not wait for reinforcements from sixty miles
                    distant, Milroy formulated a plan to "deliver a blow [at Jackson], if&amp; [he] could,
                    and then retire from his [Jackson's] front before he had recovered from the surprise
                        &amp;."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy's offensive called for crossing rugged terrain and confronting well-fortified
                    Confederates entrenched on a bluff called Sitlington's Hill. The strategy ensured a
                    "bitter and bloody" encounter. Milroy's forces charged against a
                    "devastating shower of lead." Despite initially gaining headway, by nightfall,
                    weary and short of ammunition, the Union general had to recall his two brigades and fall back to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>. In four hours of desperate fighting—at times
                    hand-to-hand—Milroy sustained 259 casualties to Jackson's 498. Although
                    ultimately repulsed by "Old Jack," Milroy believed that he had successfully
                    accomplished his goals of engaging the Confederates, penetrating their defenses, and relocating to
                    safer ground. If anything, he chastised <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> for placing too many strictures upon him. Declaring in a letter to his wife that the
                    old Pathfinder was "‘played out’ and down forever," Milroy
                    gave a caustic appraisal of his superior: "The world has been greatly deceived in that man.
                    He is intellectually a poor thing &amp; As a General &amp; a perfect failure."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy spent the summer of 1862 under Generals Fremont and Franz Sigel. From August 9–28,
                    in command of the Independent Brigade, First Corps of the Army of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, Milroy fought at <geogName>Cedar Mountain</geogName>, Freeman's Ford, Sulphur
                    Springs, and Waterloo Bridge—skirmishes preceding Second Bull Run. During the latter, on
                    August 29–30, Milroy's men stood at the front of the Union line, embroiled in
                    fierce, ferocious fighting. At one point a musket ball killed Milroy's horse as the general
                    cheered on his troops. The engagement's climax for Milroy occurred on the evening of August
                    30 when he questioned the leadership and tactics of his superior, General Irvin McDowell.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>In the thick of battle, Milroy believed he was not receiving adequate reinforcements for his battered
                    and beleaguered troops. The general hurried back to McDowell's headquarters and demanded
                    that the Union commander send a brigade forward "at once to save the day or all would be

                    "riding about in an obviously agitated state bellowing such improbable epithets as
                    ‘Hell and chickens’ and other strange oaths." Ordered to leave after
                    several minutes, Buchanan said that the Hoosier general was still "haranguing and
                    gesticulating most emphatically &amp; rushing about the field without any special aim or
                    object." Another officer alleged that Milroy, hat off and sword drawn, confronted McDowell
                    with the invective, "For God's sake, general, send a few regiments into these
                    woods; my poor men are being cut to pieces."<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy saw nothing peculiar about his demeanor. Military etiquette, he explained, meant little to
                    him, just results: "After my own Bgd was used up and out of ammunition I dashed back and
                    brought up others—one after another and pitched them in the fight. I asked no questions
                    who they were or who commanded them."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> McDowell finally reinforced
                    Milroy who, whatever his previous mental state, seized the opportunity, "dashed in front of
                    them, waved &amp; [his] sword, and cheered them forward." As evening hung over the
                    battlefield, Milroy felt certain that victory was in sight. In his vernacular, a brigade under
                    General Ambrose E. Burnside had that night "dashed back the tide of armed treason, and sent
                    such a tempest of shot, shell, and leaden death into the dark forest after the rebels that they did
                    not again renew the attack."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general was mistaken. The Union Army had not won at Second Bull Run. Unknown to Milroy, General
                    John Pope had ordered an overall withdrawal back to Centreville to protect <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. Denouncing that decision, Milroy said he first learned of it with "agonizing
                    surprise." "I was thunderstruck upon finding no troops in my rear for nearly a
                    mile and when I overtook Gen Sigel I was struck dumb with horror when told by him that he was
                    retreating by order of Gen. Pope &amp;." Pouring out his anger, Milroy blamed the
                    defeat on what he judged to be a West Point aristocracy that undeservedly dominated most positions
                    of importance in the northern military establishment: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> Although his blanket condemnation of West Pointers was wide of the mark, Milroy could not
                    be faulted for lamenting that military prowess in the top ranks of the Union Army had not yet
                    emerged.</p>
            <p>Milroy was convinced that McDowell and Second Bull Run had moved him closer to achieving distinction
                    as a brilliant general, one who was both bold and courageous. His stance toward Confederate
                    guerrillas operating in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the autumn and winter of 1862 did little to tarnish that image. The Confederate
                    government in April, 1862, authorized the formation of civilians into companies of Partisan Rangers
                    to protect the rights of southerners in a region torn between North and South. Milroy considered the
                    Rangers nothing more than armed vigilantes who despoiled property belonging to citizens with Union
                    loyalties. He gained such a notorious reputation for retaliating against southerners that the
                    Confederate government ultimately offered a bounty for his capture.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy had ample reason to suspect the Rangers' motives. As Colonel John D. Imboden, the
                    Rangers' organizer and commander, defined their mission, the partisans were "to
                    wage the most active warfare against our brutal invaders and their domestic allies; to hang about
                    their [Union sympathizers'] camps and shoot down every sentinel, picket, courier and wagon
                    driver we can find &amp; and thus render the country so unsafe that they will not dare to move
                    except in large bodies." He further declared: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I hold that by the laws of God and man, it is our duty to slay them by all the legitimate
                            means in our power. &amp; It is only men I want; men who are not afraid to be shot at in

                    or if the guerrillas had been harbored or assisted there &amp;." Milroy told Long
                    "to kill all that&amp; [he] could capture and hang their bodies by the roadside as a
                    warning." Later that month one of Milroy's cavalry units captured Frederick W.
                    Chewning, a notorious guerrilla. Milroy asked <placeName>

                    </placeName> what he should do with him and then suggested that it would "have a good
                    effect" on other Rangers "to try him by drum-head court-martial and hang
                        him."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To inhibit further atrocities Milroy issued a draconian order: Federal officers would appraise any
                    loyal Unionists' property seized or destroyed by southern guerrillas. The loss would be
                    assessed against known Confederate sympathizers living in the area. They, in turn, would have
                    twenty-four hours to pay the victims the judgment or face the death penalty. The order stated:
                    "If they fail to pay at the end of the time you have named their houses will be burned and
                    themselves shot and their property all seized &amp;." To ensure that Union officers
                    understood his resolve, Milroy solemnly added, "be sure that you carry out this threat
                    rigidly and show them that you are not trifling or to be trifled with."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Union soldiers executed the order exactly as Milroy advised. In Saint George they extracted from one
                    family a thousand-dollar payment. Another southerner, Adam Harper, an eighty-two-year-old, crippled,
                    infirm Dutchman, was forced to remit $285 to save his life. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tucker County</region>
                    </placeName> alone Milroy collected over $6,000 in compensatory payments. The rigorous
                    proclamation and its subsequent enforcement prompted Confederate military officers stationed in the
                        <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName> to characterize Milroy as
                    "bloodthirsty" and "savage" and a "fiend."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>Francis H. Pierpont, governor of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, condoned Milroy's conduct. He judged the method of warfare to be righteous
                    and just, the alternative being, he said, to allow "these rebels to enjoy, peaceably, their
                    property, while Union men are robbed." Pierpont proclaimed Milroy "universally
                    popular" among northerners who "endorse him, while the rebels censure
                    &amp;." He hoped Milroy would be "encouraged and sustained." The <placeName>

                    and kiss &amp; [his] hands and garments." Such reverence, he felt, derived both from
                    Milroy's courage and his stand against the Partisan Rangers. Similarly, the surveyor of
                    customs of that city conjectured that only tactics <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Not everyone shared their viewpoint. When President Jefferson Davis learned of Milroy's
                    actions, he found them not in accordance with the "recognized usages of war." On
                    January 7, 1863, he directed General Robert E. Lee to contact General Henry W. Halleck,
                    commander-in-chief of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army, to learn whether Milroy's deportment had governmental sanction. Lee
                    wrote, "I am instructed to ask whether your Government will tolerate the execution of an
                    order so barbarous and so revolting to every principle of justice and humanity." He
                    threatened that a continuation of Milroy's policies would result in severe retaliatory
                    measures by the Confederate Army.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Halleck's resolution of this matter marked the first of several decisions that Milroy
                    thought rooted in prejudice. After examining Lee's allegations, Halleck refused to support
                    the Hoosier general. Milroy, he determined, had not only acted with authority he did not possess but
                    also had, as Lee suggested, violated the rules of war. Halleck directed Milroy to revoke the edict
                    and, in a letter to Lee on January 14, offered what amounted to an apology, excusing the
                    proclamation as the unjustified act of an irresponsible subordinate.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Milroy, with Lincoln's tacit support, refused to ease his severe tactics. Though no direct
                    documentation exists, the president apparently believed Milroy's suppression of guerrilla
                    activities to be an appropriate response. If anything, the Hoosier's
                    "all-out" strategy foresaw methods effectively employed later by Ulysses S. Grant
                    and William T. Sherman. At the stage of the war in 1862, however, Lincoln was unprepared to give
                    anything more than implicit approval to policies that he would eventually sanction publicly.</p>
            <p>The developing Milroy-Halleck feud affected Milroy's nomination for promotion in January,
                    1863. The president had placed Milroy on a list of candidates for major general, but Halleck balked,
                    removing his name. Lincoln overrode Halleck's veto and reinserted Milroy as a nominee.
                    Halleck's opposition, Milroy surmised, was a direct consequence of events that had occurred
                    in <placeName>

                    months, Milroy thought, but it had been, in his words, "baffled and kept back by the
                    vindictive malice and little <list type="footnotes">

                    that his "acceptance of the promotion &amp; [represented] a complete triumph over old
                    Halleck" and was "the first appointment ever made over his protest since he
                    disecrated the office of Genl in Chief&amp;." With perhaps an attempt at humility
                    Milroy continued, "I am indebted for it to my own merit and the indefatigable and untiring
                    energy of friend [Schuyler] Colfax and others."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a letter to his wife Milroy tendered his version of the way that Halleck had tried to discredit
                    him. He contended that after Lincoln sent the nominations to Stanton and Halleck for their approval,
                    "Halleck struck out my name, Old Abe asked him the reason, Halleck said I had issued some
                    very severe unmilitary and outrageous orders in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">West Va</settlement>
                    </placeName>. for which reason he could not approve of my promotion." Viewing this as
                    tantamount to Halleck's being in bed with the Confederacy and doubtless fueling what was
                    already acute paranoia respecting the commander-in-chief, Milroy theorized, "The guerillas,
                    Bushwackers, Robbers and Horsethieves of W. Va. whom I undertook to suppress and exterminate,
                    complained to Jeff Davis of my stringent and successful orders." Then, he continued, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Jeff complained to Halleck of my violation of the rules of war with these cut-throats and
                            Halleck agreed with his friend Jeff, and sent me a severe reprimand and ordered that the
                            orders that I issued that were so repugnant to Jeff Davis and his fellow traitors, should be
                            immediately rescinded, and upon evidence of Jeff Davis alone he condemned me and struck my
                            name out of the list of nominees of the Presdt. for Majr Gen'l without waiting to
                            hear my justification or a word from me in explanation. I drew up a defence of my point. The
                            W. Va Officers in my command also drew up a complete vindication of my poling and orders,
                            and the W. Va. Legislature hearing of Hallecks course toward me, passed the enclosed
                            preamble and resolutions. When Old Abe saw me so strongly sustained by the soldiers with
                            whom I had been fighting and the people I had been defending, he did not wait for Hallecks
                            approval but sent in my nomination, so I have the gratification of having beaten Halleck and
                            his friend Jeff.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    if not impossible, situation. President Lincoln realized this and on June 14 sent Milroy's
                    superior, General Schenck, the department commander in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

                    </placeName> to Harper's Ferry if possible. He will be gobbled up, if he remains, if he is
                    not already past salvation." A short time later Lincoln received a dispatch from General
                    Daniel Tyler in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

            <p>Unfortunately, Milroy had neither good luck nor hard fighting on his side. Most detrimental was a
                    total lack of information regarding the size and strength of the opposing force. He also
                    underestimated the abilities of Lee. As late as the night of June 12 Milroy believed <quote rend="blockquote">

                    over" rather than fall back to Harper's Ferry. And when Schenck finally reversed
                    his order that Milroy hold <placeName>

                    received. Not until 9:00 p.m. on June 14––there nearly surrounded and in
                    jeopardy of being overrun—did Milroy, in a conference with his staff, finally order a
                    retreat to Harper's Ferry. Milroy said he "called a council of war after dark and
                    the officers were all for an evacuation or a surrender. I told them that the latter was out of the

            <p>June 14 had been disastrous for Milroy. General Early's attack from the south and west had

            <p>While Milroy and his officers convened the war council, Ewell anticipated the Federal's next
                    move and sent Johnson several miles up the Martinsburg Road to wait for Milroy's troops. At
                    two o'clock in the morning, leaving artillery and wagons behind, Milroy abandoned <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> and started toward Harper's Ferry. Two hours later the Confederate ambush took
                    him by complete surprise. Gallantly, Milroy rushed to the front. Rallying the disorganized Federals,
                    he led a fierce, hour-long skirmish. At daybreak, assessing the situation as hopeless, he ordered
                    his soldiers to cease fighting and to resume their retreat toward Harper's Ferry.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> In a matter of hours Milroy had witnessed almost the whole of his command
                    evaporate. He had sustained losses of 443 casualties, 23 artillery pieces, 200,000 rounds of small
                    arms ammunition, and 300 wagons. Most devastating of all, 3,358 Union soldiers were captured.

            <p>Lincoln was despondent. He met that night at the War Department with Halleck and Navy Secretary
                    Gideon Welles. The president, Welles recalled in his memoirs, told them that he felt very low and
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> looked like Harper's Ferry, a similar Union collapse in September, 1862, all
                    over again. From statements the "white with rage" Halleck uttered, Welles
                    concluded that "poor Milroy &amp; [was] to be made the scapegoat, and blamed for the
                    stupid blunders, neglects, and mistakes of those who should have warned and advised
                        him."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Welles was right. On June 27 Halleck removed Milroy from command and had him taken into custody.
                    Though outraged by his arrest, Milroy realized the leverage that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> defeat afforded the commander-in-chief. The following day he penned an urgent letter to
                    Lincoln in care of Interior Secretary John P. Usher, also a Hoosier. Of Usher, Milroy requested,
                    "I ask you as a friend in Gods name, to go with it [enclosed letter] to the President at
                    once &amp; try to procure my release from the grasp of an incompetent, unprincipled
                    tyrant." The communication delivered to Lincoln contained a tone of desperation. Milroy
                    maintained that Halleck had arrested him like a "common fellon" because the
                    general unjustly hated him "with the blind unreasoning hatred of an Indian
                    &amp;." He offered to "take any command, or go into the ranks as a private,

                    his plea, "After the crisis is passed, &amp; my country is saved, Halleck may have me

            </p>
            <p>Milroy had indeed had a rocky relationship with Halleck. The commander-in-chief had opposed
                    Milroy's handling of Confederate guerrillas in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wv">West Virginia</region>

                    </placeName>, and his decision to remain there and fight. Further, Halleck frequently disparaged
                    Milroy's generalship. Two cases illustrate Halleck's attitude. To
                    Milroy's request for reinforcements in January, 1863, Halleck wrote to General Burnside:
                    "I do not rely much upon General Milroy's statement of the enemy's
                    movements. He cries wolf so often that he may be caught. I send you the substance of his telegraph
                    for what it is worth." And immediately following <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Halleck ordered Schenck not to allow Milroy any command at Harper's Ferry
                    with the blunt denunciation, "We have had enough of that sort of military
                        genius."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lincoln's response understandably disappointed Milroy. Although the president was
                    sympathetic, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> had placed Lincoln in a difficult position. He reacted coolly to Milroy's
                    request for another command: "I have never doubted your courage and devotion to the cause.
                    But you have just lost a Division, and prima facie the fault is upon you; and while that remains
                    unchanged, for me to put you in command again, is to justly subject me to the charge of having put
                    you there on purpose to have you lose another." Lincoln refused to accept Milroy's
                    assertion that the wellspring of Halleck's dislike for him was personal pique. In fact,
                    Lincoln lectured Milroy concerning the Hoosier's own prejudices: "I have scarcely
                    seen anything from you at any time, that did not contain imputations against your superiors, and a
                    chafing against acting the part they had assigned you." Lincoln continued: "YOU
                    have constantly urged the idea that you were persecuted because you did not come from
                    West-Point&amp;. This, my dear general, is I fear, the rock on which you have split."
                    Milroy responded with a typical Mil-royism, confiding to his wife: "Old Abe seems to be a
                    mear tool for Halleck."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In August Lincoln, at Milroy's behest, appointed a court of inquiry to investigate what went
                    awry at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It required twenty-seven days and eighteen witnesses to exonerate Milroy of any
                    wrongdoing. The Hoosier general insisted that he had simply followed his superiors' stated
                    orders, specifically those of Schenck, <list type="footnotes">

                    through Brigadier General James H. Wilson if he could find Milroy a position. He "is not a
                    difficult man to satisfy," Lincoln wrote, "sincerity and courage being his strong
                    traits. Believing in our cause, and wanting to fight in it, is the whole matter with him. Could you,

                    Wilson nor Grant wanted Milroy's services. The former stated that any brigadier general
                    would prove as competent as Milroy. The latter told Lincoln he could not "give General
                    Milroy a command without prejudice to the service nor without doing injustice to other

            <p>These reverses did not dampen Milroy's resolve to return to the field. In March, 1864, he
                    implored Grant, "try me—try me where there is danger and hard fighting to be
                    done, and if I fail, then have me shot." He had hoped for a cavalry commission, but Grant
                    refused after General George Meade, apparently unfamiliar with Milroy's military training
                    and background, said that Milroy lacked adequate qualifications to head a cavalry unit.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Twice rejected by Grant, Milroy traveled to <placeName>

                    could not get him to consent to give me an active comd in front." From Kingston, Milroy
                    walked five miles to General George H. Thomas's headquarters where he was also denied a
                    front-line assignment. Thomas instead ordered him to report to <placeName>

            <p>Unfortunately, even substantial victories were not enough to make up for the disappointments and

                    had been fought without him. Deprived of the rewards, accolades, and glory of which he deemed
                    himself worthy, Milroy left the Union Army in July, 1865, an embittered man. His assessment of what

            <p>Not unique among military figures, Robert Huston Milroy longed for the fame and honors that war could
                    sometimes bestow. Despite a military education, Mexican War service similar to many other Civil War
                    generals, and a willingness to take the fight to the foe, such laurels always seemed out of reach.
                    Reasons for the Hoosier general's disappointments are difficult to ascertain. The injury to
                    his reputation from the grim result at <placeName>

                    questioned the judgment of superiors, and when confronted with difficult problems or ordered to
                    perform tasks contrary to what he considered correct, he became quarrelsome and abrupt. Milroy,

                    from the fact that he was a volunteer soldier and had never, as he put it, darkened the hallowed
                    halls of West Point—a persecution complex undoubtedly exacerbated by the fact that West
                    Point had been his life's goal well into early adulthood. Because of real and imagined
                    slights, he effectively alienated himself from generals such as Grant, Sherman, and Halleck, whose

            <p>Carol Devens examines the gender basis for responses to Christian proselytization among Ojibwa, Cree,
                    and Montagnais-Naskapi. Placing her study of Indian missions in the Great Lakes area squarely within
                    the history of European colonization, she identifies three patterns emerging from the midseventeenth
                    through the nineteenth centuries.</p>
            <p>The first pattern reveals Indian men and women at odds with one another in their responses to
                    seventeenth-century Jesuit missions. Devens limits her study of these missions to an examination of
                    those "domiciled native groups who accepted French protection, converted to Catholicism,
                    and adopted a sedentary manner of living. (The reader should note carefully her passing comments
                    that the experiences of these groups may not have been typical.) She writes that men were more
                    attracted to the new religion than were women, who often resisted the Jesuits. Devens points to the
                    Jesuits' repeated attempts to impose a male-dominated nuclear family model and to the
                    disruptive effects of the fur trade as sources of female animosity toward the missions.</p>
            <p>Devens sees a second pattern emerging between 1830 and 1870 in the acquiescence of both men and women
                    among <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s Cree and Northern Ojibwa to Methodist missions. She believes that these
                    Canadian Indians came to accept the missions because they identified them with the activities of the
                    Hudson Bay Company, which offered material advantages that could improve the Indians' poor
                    economic circumstances. Farther to the south Ojibwa came into contact with missionaries from the
                    American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) during roughly this same period. Here,
                    however, Devens discerns an emerging third pattern of mounting hostility toward mission work among
                    both men and women, who came to see missionaries as agents of the federal government and white
                    incursion.</p>
            <p>Devens argues that the first pattern of divided response re-emerged by the late nineteenth century in
                    missions run by the ABCFM and the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where whites were overwhelming Native American populations. Here men saw economic
                    benefits, for example in the literacy skills that missionaries offered, while women increasingly
                    became the "conservators of traditional ways" (p. 113). This pattern of gender
                    dichotomy and opposition, Devens argues, continued <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-090-1-080"/> into the
                    twentieth century, resulting in misinterpretations by anthropologists, who inaccurately applied
                    contemporary findings to past circumstances.</p>
            <p>The patterns that Devens describes might more accurately be described as trends, or tendencies, given
                    the degree to which native responses fluctuated and given the fact that her evidence is thin in
                    places. Greater awareness of the extent to which missionaries' agendas diverged from those
                    of dominant colonial interests would have added subtlety to her analysis. Still, Devens is to be
                    commended for taking on a broad, comparative study that raises provocative questions about gender
                    relations, questions that ethno-historians must not ignore.</p>

            <p>While recent writing about Europeans and Indians in the New World has shifted the story away from the
                    European to the Indian side of the border, June Namias, in her study of white captives, returns to
                    an older approach. She argues for a neo-Turnerian interpretation that seeks the meaning of America
                    on the margins of European society where it met the native tribes. In this encounter Europeans
                    defined themselves by measuring their way of life against a mythic Indian world. The real native is
                    scarcely of interest in this kind of confrontation. Europeans dealt largely with their own demons
                    and mythic anxieties in their sometimes desperate effort to define a new American self.</p>
            <p>In a sense the native people endorsed this process by taking white captives, exposing them to the
                    Indian culture, and often attempting to incorporate them into tribal society. Of course the captives
                    themselves were forced to grapple with their sense of self; depending on their psychic stability,
                    and the circumstances of the captivity, with more or less success. But more important, the captives
                    very early became a public issue. A substantial body of literature grew from the seventeenth through
                    the late nineteenth century describing the captive experience and examining its implications for the
                    development of a European society in America.</p>
            <p>Namias is mainly interested in female captives, though they constituted only a minority of those
                    taken by the Indians. They are in fact the most interesting cases and she believes the most
                    significant because the society at large seemed more threatened by the <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-090-1-081"/> alliance between women and Indians. On this latter point she is
                    probably right, though her examination of the matter is written in entirely conventional formulas.
                    She does make one significant contribution by arranging the female narratives into chronological
                    categories that place them in historical context. The first group she calls the
                    "Survivors," illustrated by Mary Rowlandson, who managed to endure their
                    captivities, retaining their own cultural loyalties intact while at the same time adjusting to the
                    requirements of Indian captivity. These captives are principally <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Puritans, and they are sustained by their belief in God and his providence. The
                    "Survivors" are succeeded by the "Amazons" in the revolutionary
                    and early national periods. Here the earlier Cotton Mather version of Hannah Dustan's brief
                    experience with Indians stands out. On the trail into Indian country the warriors made the mistake
                    of falling asleep. Mrs. Dustan remained awake, slaughtered and scalped her captors, and returned to
                    civilization to claim a bounty. Namias sees the Amazonian captives as an expression of American
                    nationalism, a plausible explanation though her contention that their activities are stimulated by
                    racism rests on little evidence. In truth the "Amazons" would appear to be a small
                    group among the captivity narratives. The most significant of the captives are what she calls the
                    "Frail Flowers." Descriptions of these unfortunate women flourished throughout the
                    nineteenth century, contemporary with the domesticated woman who lived her life under male
                    direction. In captivity her only hope of survival was to be saved by a masterful hero.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the bulk of the book makes little use of this taxonomy. Namias offers interpretive
                    essays on two noted captives, Jane McCrea and Mary Jemison, and one little known subject, Sarah
                    Wakefield, who was taken in 1862 in the Dakota War. The essays are not uninteresting, but they do
                    not as a whole move the examination of the captivity narrative very far. Jane McCrea was hardly a
                    captive at all. The Indians murdered her soon after she was taken, and the theme of her story would
                    seem to be her relationship with her family rather than the problem of a civilization at risk in the
                    borderland. The saga of Mary Jemison presents an altogether more satisfactory subject. Namias sees
                    her as a survivor, which she certainly was, but beyond that obvious point her examination bogs down
                    in a description of the so-called Iroquois matriarchate. Even if this interpretation of Iroquois
                    culture was convincing, it has no apparent bearing on the life of Mary Jemison. She was not a clan
                    mother, the source of female power among the Iroquois (the identity of her clan is itself
                    uncertain), and if she exercised any authority in her later years, it was because of her
                    identification with the whites who were invading the Genessee country. Namias presents Sarah
                    Wakefield as a nineteenth-century woman with a social conscience who wanted a measure of justice for
                        <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-090-1-082"/> the Indians, which seems about right from what is known of
                    her story. Beyond this point the evidence for her motivation is very slim, a limitation that in no
                    way inhibits the author's speculations.</p>
            <p>No doubt the experiences of white captives, particularly as their stories were translated into
                    popular culture, reveal a great deal about the American sense of self. The unencumbered individual
                    presented with the unlimited possibilities of the American continent could not but feel thwarted by
                    the resistance of the native people. The threat of "savagery" was a constant theme
                    in European and American discussions of the New World from the earliest contacts. Namias quite aptly
                    adds the factor of gender. Indians treated men and women differently, and the popular culture was
                    acutely sensitive to the dangers of female captivity, perhaps even more so than it was to the more
                    common captivity of men. If only in calling attention to this matter, Namias has rendered a service
                    to scholarship.</p>

            <p>Father Edward F. Sorin (1814–1893), French-born priest, member of the Congregation of the
                    Holy Cross, and founder of the University of <geogName>Notre Dame</geogName>, authored the
                    chronicles (annual resume of key events) required of every house in his religious community. This
                    translation reports Sorin's activities from 1841 to 1866, <geogName>Notre
                    Dame</geogName>'s participation in the Civil War, and Sorin's additions to the
                    chronicles written in 1880. All controversies are presented candidly because the chronicles were
                    meant for a sympathetic in-house audience, not for publication. Of course, since they are
                    Sorin's memoirs, he is always right in every controversy.</p>
            <p>The chronicles trace Sorin's constant battles for independence from his French superiors
                    until he himself was elected superior general. He also sought autonomy from Indiana's

                    index. $55.00.)</head>
            <p>In his preface Stephen Middleton focuses on a paradoxical characteristic of the Old Northwest: an
                    area strongly committed to principles of liberty and free labor yet adamantly antiblack in sentiment
                    and practice. From the beginning the Northwest Ordinance outlawed slavery; yet in every state
                    created from the territory, the legal system upheld laws circumscribing and often openly forbidding
                    African Americans' equality as citizens and residents. Without understanding this history
                    of an exclusive vision of freedom and liberty, the persistence of racism in this country makes
                    little sense. Therefore, Middleton's collection of "black laws" is an
                    important contribution to better understanding not only the past but the present.</p>
            <p>The book is divided into five parts, one for each of the states of the Old Northwest presented in the
                    order of statehood. Each state is given a three- to five-page introduction; then various laws,
                    organized topically, are presented for each state. These laws are followed by an interesting and
                    revealing sampling of judicial cases that offer a sense of how the laws were interpreted and
                    enforced. <placeName>

            <p>The section on Indiana will certainly be of interest to readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine
                        of History</hi>. In his introductory pages to the Hoosier state Middleton observes that
                    "Indiana was unusually hostile to people of color" (p. 160). He gives no
                    explanation of why this might be true other than the general observation made in his introduction
                    that "the enslavement of Africans reinforced the color prejudice of the whites &amp;
                    [making] racial discrimination inevitable" (p. xxvii).</p>
            <p>Laws in the Indiana Territory originally tried to circumvent Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance,
                    which prohibited slavery by allowing indenture for life. After statehood, laws were passed
                    discouraging African-American immigration and in 1851 prohibiting it outright. Black laws also
                    denied people of African descent basic citizenship rights such as voting, serving as jurors, serving
                    as militiamen, holding state office, and testifying in court against whites. Miscegenation laws and
                    exclusion from schools attempted to separate the races further and to perpetuate white dominance.
                    Most of these laws remained in effect until the civil rights laws of 1885.</p>
            <p>Judging by Middleton's acknowledgements, most of his research was done in <placeName>

                    </placeName> libraries. Since his book covers only five states, it would seem that checking with
                    each state's historical library would have been important. From them the author could
                    garner local material not readily available from standard state law collections to increase depth of
                    analysis in his introductory sections and to augment the bibliographic references. Nevertheless,
                    this volume provides a useful and convenient reference for persons interested in the Old Northwest,
                    African-American history, legal history, and the persistence of racism.</p>

            <p>This is a fascinating little book that gives the reader a good look into the life of the ordinary
                    soldier during the Civil War, a statement that can be made about most of the myriad works containing
                    diaries and letters of Civil War soldiers. Since the war there have been literally thousands of such
                    volumes, most with some value that makes them stand on their own. This work is no exception: it
                    makes several contributions that justify its publication.</p>
            <p>Henry Matrau was an exceptionally literate man in a literate army. Although only sixteen when he
                    fraudulently joined the army in 1861, he rose through the ranks to finish the war as a captain. <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-090-1-086"/> His letters are incisive, informative, and occasionally even
                    humorous. He was in most of the battles in which the Army of the Potomac participated, with the
                    notable exception of Antietam, and wrote about them all. Interestingly, most Civil War letters
                    reveal that the authors knew little about events in which they participated, even fierce and
                    momentous battles. Matrau, however, seems to have a better sense about events than most of his
                    fellow soldiers. His letters also show that a soldier's existence during war consisted of
                    boring, routine, mundane activities punctuated by moments of horrendous violence.</p>
            <p>Matrau's letters are of additional significance for the Midwest, as his unit—the
                    famed Iron Brigade—was the only western brigade in the Army of the Potomac. The unit
                    suffered massive casualties in most battles from Second Bull Run through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where it was effectively destroyed and lost its western character when it was rebuilt.
                    However, its reputation and contribution to the Union cause was perhaps the greatest of any single
                    unit in the army. And Henry Matrau was in the thick of that action.</p>
            <p>The book is well organized, with an introduction to each chapter that gives an overview of events
                    covered by the letters in that chapter. There is a useful cast of characters listed at the end of
                    the book along with a good index. Curiously, however, there is no bibliography. Perhaps the author
                    felt that the endnotes would suffice. There is also only one sketchy map, which erroneously dates
                    George B. McClellan's Peninsular Campaign as 1863 rather than 1862. More maps would have
                    been helpful.</p>
            <p>Still this is a good book that imparts to the reader the thoughts and feelings of the Civil War
                    soldier.</p>

            <p>"Regionalism in all its many manifestations remains one of the most elusive threads in the
                    complex texture of America," states Ronald Weber at the beginning of this insightful study
                    (p. ix). The rest of the book testifies to the aptness of the metaphor as the author skillfully
                    follows the thread of midwestern literature in its weave through the varied fabric of American
                    culture from the 1870s to around 1930.</p>

                    Stratton-Porter topped national sales charts. Weber, however, is little concerned with the
                    "best-selling effusions" (p. 15) of these "Indiana romancers"
                    (p. 3), preferring to concentrate on authors and works that offer a less conventional response to
                    their material. His focus is on "imaginative work of enduring stature &amp; in American
                    writing as a whole," work that has a "clear Midwestern grounding" (p.
                    12). Hamlin Garland, Theodore Dreiser, Floyd Dell, Henry B. Fuller, Robert Herrick, Carl Sandburg,
                    Edgar Lee Masters, Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, Willa Cather, Ruth Suckow, and O. E. Rolvaag
                    are the primary objects of his attention. "Although the entire range of Midwestern writing
                    during its period of ascendancy is not represented in these pages," says Weber, "I
                    try to take into account most of what is best" (p. 12).</p>
            <p>His standards for judging what is best are carefully elaborated in the opening chapter,
                    "Warm Center, Ragged Edge." Taken from separate passages in F. Scott
                    Fitzgerald's <hi rend="i">The Great Gatsby</hi>, the terms represent the two opposing
                    traditions of midwestern writing: uncritical celebration of the region as an agricultural paradise
                    versus harsh denunciation of it as a culturally backward wasteland. Weber derives his critical
                    theory from Henry Nash Smith's analysis of the paradox inherent in Frederick Jackson
                    Turner's frontier thesis, which drew equally from a static garden myth that evoked an <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-090-1-088"/> ideal pioneer past and, contradictorily, from a dynamic belief
                    in the stages of civilization that found the ideal in an enlightened urban society. While Smith
                    finds this contradiction to be a problem for intellectual historians, Weber believes that it is a
                    necessary ingredient of the best midwestern writing. "This central ambivalence within
                    Midwestern life &amp;," he writes, "has enriched its literature in the sense
                    of providing it with recurring situations of leave-taking and return as well as &amp; an
                    underlying complexity of conflicting and unresolved attitudes" (p. 24).</p>
            <p>In the chapters that follow Weber applies his theory in lucid, cogent, and imaginative prose to the
                    best works of the midwestern ascendancy. Beginning with Joseph Kirkland, E. W. Howe, and Edward
                    Eggleston, Weber methodically works his way through the pantheon of the region's writers,
                    offering biographical sketches, summarizing the most important books, analyzing each contribution in
                    terms of its qualities of sympathy and resistance, and placing each author's contribution
                    in the context of what has previously been discussed. While Indiana Golden Age adherents may resent
                    Weber's dismissal of its leading lights, they will have a difficult time disagreeing with
                    the author's arguments. In all, <hi rend="i">The Midwestern Ascendancy</hi> is a masterful
                    performance and an essential book for those interested in regionalism, American literary realism, or
                    midwestern writing.</p>

            <p>Regionalism has enjoyed a revival of sorts in recent years. A number of universities have established
                    regional study centers, and a stream of books, both popular and scholarly, have appeared on
                    regionalism in America. A new generation of scholars has eagerly substituted region for the frontier
                    process as an organizing principle in western history. But the current regionalism lacks the fire,
                    breadth, and aspirations of the influential cultural movement that preceded it in the 1920s and
                    1930s. Although major aspects of the interwar regionalism are well known, it has not received an
                    encompassing historical interpretation until now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Revolt of the Provinces</hi>, by Robert L. Dorman, maps the highways and byways traveled
                    by artists and intellectuals who perceived the possibilities of regionalism as a restorative
                    response to the blight of industrialism and urbanization on American society and culture. The author
                    charts the intersections of thought and <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-090-1-089"/> feeling among all the
                    significant regionalist leaders of the time—novelists, literary critics, artists,
                    historians, folklorists, sociologists, planners, publishers, publicists, and other intellectuals who
                    defy easy classification.</p>
            <p>Dorman interprets regionalism as a critique of American society. He recounts how Lewis Mumford, B. A.
                    Botkin, Howard Odum, Mari Sandoz, Mary Austin, Walter Prescott Webb, and many other cultural
                    luminaries, all distressed by the urbanized, commercialized, mechanized, standardized
                    characteristics of modern society, posed regionalism "as the means toward a richer, freer,
                    and more humane way of life" (p. xii). Thus, in Dorman's view, they sought to
                    "fashion regionalism into a democratic civic religion, a utopian ideology, and a radical
                    politics" (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>Dorman organizes his book accordingly. Regionalism as democratic civic religion is treated in the
                    first part, which includes biographical material on the major participants in the movement, analyzes
                    the effort to fuse Indian and folk materials into American art, and examines the agrarian revolt
                    against modernism. The second part probes the utopian ideology of regionalism, which in
                    Dorman's view illuminates the origins of contemporary multiculturalism. The final part
                    examines the programmatic or political dimension of regionalism in the 1930s and its termination
                    during World War II.</p>
            <p>Although Dorman often writes skillfully, his style tends to be ponderous and sometimes convoluted.
                    His erudition and intelligence is everywhere evident, but these same virtues alert him to possible
                    ambiguities. Apparently driven to clarify his ideas, he jumbles sentences with too many ideas or too
                    much information. His text is cluttered with a plethora of words in quotation marks and plagued with
                    parenthetical explanations.</p>
            <p>But the virtues of this book far outweigh its defects. It is based on research as admirable as it is
                    exhaustive. It offers a useful interpretation of an important but neglected chapter in American
                    cultural history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Continental America</hi>, the second of four volumes intended to provide a
                    "geographical perspective" on American history, examines <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-090-1-090"/> the period 1800–1867. Its author, D. W. Meinig, draws upon
                    works by historians, geographers, political scientists, contemporary observers, and others to
                    synthesize, analyze, and explore new dimensions of that crucial period in American development. The
                    major events and players are included, and the appropriate connections between events and players
                    are made; but the book's focus is less on history and more on the geographic impact of
                    events the players triggered or tried to manage.</p>
            <p>The book is organized into four roughly chronological parts. The first considers the territorial
                    expansion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>; the pressure applied by the growing empire to its northern, southern, and western
                    borders; accommodations for native peoples; and the establishment by 1867 of a transcontinental <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Part two examines settlement (westward migration and immigration), administration
                    (territories to states), and integration (transportation and communication) processes linking the
                    new territorial acquisitions into a growing, proto-industrial nation. The smaller parts three and
                    four contain, respectively, a focus on geographical, geopolitical, and sectional tensions preceding
                    and during the Civil War and a snapshot of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> circa 1867.</p>
            <p>Meinig includes the approaches typically taken by geographers. He applies a conceptual framework that
                    he developed years ago—"center" (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>), "domain" (Old Northwest and Old Southwest), and
                    "sphere" (Great Plains and beyond)—to the "Geographical

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1860 (pp. 418–28). Standard concepts are viewed through a
                    geographer's glasses, and common generalizations are clarified. According to Meinig,
                    American nationalism developed without the normally expected ethnic, cultural, religious, and
                    educational uniformity, but the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> still functioned as a nation because of commercial market and transportation and
                    communication systems (pp. 399–415). Meinig further stresses that "American

            <p>While "home" as a place is individual, in terms of activities and symbols it seems
                    nigh universal if not changeless. A town or farm family circa 1500 transported into a similar
                    setting in America circa 1800 or even 1850 would likely have felt basically "at
                    home." By 1900, however, such would not have been the case. In less than a century
                    industrial and social revolutions profoundly transformed what "home" meant and
                    was. How and why the transformation occurred are the foci of this introductory book.</p>
            <p>The book's origin, a 1989 conference on house history, explains both its essay format and an
                    overall style that deftly blends broad appeal, informality, and scholarship. An introductory essay
                    previews the other eleven by providing an overview of the purposes and methodologies of studying
                    house history. That study and the body of the book itself are divided into three broad areas:
                    "Room Life," "Home Life," and "Keeping House."</p>
            <p>The five essays grouped under "Room Life" examine how changes in the meaning of
                    "home" reflect changes in the use, decoration, and even the existence of rooms
                    themselves. Among the better examples are the evolutions of parlors into living rooms, bedrooms from
                    sleeping spaces into personal spaces, and servants' quarters into family quarters. The
                    overlapping social and technological "whys" of these changes are the binding
                    threads.</p>
            <p>The social threads become dominant in the "Home Life" section as the focus shifts
                    from architecture to activities. The changes in how families played together, prayed together, and
                    landscaped their homes are the specific topics. Fittingly, these essays, especially the one on the
                    home as sacred space, are among the book's most <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-090-1-092"/>
                    analytical. It is also here that the sensitive reader will be most aware that
                    "middle-class" should be part of the book's title.</p>
            <p>In the last section, "Keeping House," the technological threads dominate. How
                    houses and housework were modernized—the interdependent arrival of modern utilities and
                    modern appliances—and the resultant shift from a producer to a consumer society are the
                    major foci. A minor theme is the way in which that whirlwind modernization impacted the ability to
                    create and control the real and symbolic entity called "home."</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Home Life</hi> is an important book mostly because it is a first one. Students
                    of domestic history, architecture, material culture, or any other related field should find it an

                    the hurried measures taken could not make up for the years of neglect. The demands of modern
                    industrial warfare required well-trained, equipped, and balanced forces supported by an adequate
                    logistic system, and these are not created overnight. In the end the <placeName>

                    </placeName> managed to raise and transport to Europe a huge American Expeditionary Force (AEF),
                    which from the summer of 1918 on arguably provided a major element in the allied victory over the
                    Central Powers; but it was numbers and enthusiasm and not better training or weapons that made the
                    difference. To the end of the war American troops overseas relied heavily on allied weapons and
                    supply.</p>
            <p>Characterized by Phyllis A. Zimmerman as "a near catastrophic breakdown" (p. 81,
                    the supply situation in the winter of 1917–1918 became especially critical and demanded
                    reform. President Woodrow Wilson named Bernard Baruch to head the War Industries Board, while
                    Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, no friend of reform, appointed Major General Peyton C. March as
                    chief of staff and recalled George W. Goethals, a West Point graduate and former regular army
                    officer, from retirement. In turn March instructed Goethals to consolidate War Department logistics
                    into a single purchase, storage, and traffic division.</p>
            <p>Goethals, who had achieved his considerable reputation supervising construction of the Panama Canal,
                    was unable to achieve <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-090-1-093"/> fully the hoped for results. Even so, from
                    the summer of 1918 on, there was some improvement; and if the war had continued into 1919, the
                    combined efforts of Baruch, March, and Goethals most probably would have contributed substantially
                    to the combat effectiveness of the AEF. Nonetheless, the author believes—contrary to some
                    historians' opinions—that Goethals, with only limited authority, had at best
                    limited success. Mired down fighting established interests, <hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>, the

                    in the shaping of US. policy in the Cold War that followed, yet his enormous contributions were
                    overshadowed by the towering historical figures that he so loyally served. These two books by D. K.
                    R. Crosswell and Ludwell Lee Montague fill an important gap in detailing the significant
                    contributions of this talented military officer. As secretary of the general staff under Chief of
                    Staff General George C. Marshall during 1941–1942 and as General Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower's chief of staff from 1942 to 1945, Smith was what Eisenhower called the
                    "general manager" of the Allied victory over <placeName>

                    </placeName> (Montague, p. 6). Lieutenant General Smith served as ambassador to Moscow from 1946 to
                    1949, and <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-090-1-094"/> in September, 1950, President Harry S Truman
                    personally selected Smith, now with four stars, to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Smith
                    concluded his government career as under secretary of state from 1953 to 1954.</p>
            <p>Smith was born in 1895 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At age sixteen, while still a student at Manual High School, he joined the Indiana
                    National Guard. With the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, he began reserve officers'
                    training at Fort Benjamin Harrison. Like many other so-called ninety-day wonders, Second Lieutenant
                    Smith went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> as an infantry platoon leader. He was wounded and reassigned to the War Department
                    General Staff in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. When the war ended, he received a regular Army commission.</p>
            <p>Crosswell's study chronicles Smith's rise through the ranks and also traces the
                    reforms in U.S. military staff structure during his career. Smith worked his way into
                    Marshall's inner circle. He became the indispensable manager of daily details and freed
                    Marshall to concentrate on grand strategy. In 1942 Eisenhower convinced Marshall that he had to have
                    Smith's organizational skills in Europe. Eisenhower declared Smith a
                    "Godsend" to the Allied effort (Montague, p. 6). Smith was at the peak of his
                    public service, according to Crosswell, when he came home to a hero's welcome in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in June, 1945. Smith grew bitter, however, because he never became chief of staff as
                    did his mentor, Marshall, who had also risen in the Army without starting at West Point.</p>
            <p>Montague confirms Smith's personal frustration, but he argues that Smith's
                    twenty-eight months (Crosswell inexplicably says seventeen months) as head of the CIA shaped that
                    agency for the next twenty years. Montague's book is the second internal CIA history to be
                    declassified and released. It characterizes the general as the first successful director of central
                    intelligence (DCI). Smith invigorated the organization, made coordinated national intelligence a
                    reality, and established the DCI as the president's principal intelligence adviser.
                    Montague provides virtually no information on substantive issues during Smith's tenure,
                    such as the U.S. failure to anticipate <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>

                        <country reg="ir">Iran</country>
                    </placeName>. These topics may be covered in the pages deleted from the text during the
                    declassification process.</p>
            <p>Smith's manner was abrupt and authoritarian. He complemented the congenial Eisenhower, but
                    Crosswell suggests that Eisenhower exploited Smith. Political scientist Fred Greenstein has pointed
                    out that Eisenhower's "hidden hand" leadership style was purposeful and
                    effective. Crosswell contends that Eisenhower used Smith as his "hatchet man" (p.
                    266). Thus the supreme commander emerged as a popular hero, and Smith was stuck with the image of a
                    martinet. Having worked closely with Smith at the CIA, Montague views Smith's
                    "irritable impatience" as a calculated <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-090-1-095"/> style,
                    which was instinctive but also balanced by kindness, good humor, and diplomatic grace (p. 9).
                    Together, these books present a sympathetic portrait of the man Winston Churchill called
                    "the American bulldog" (Montague, p. 9).</p>

                    overdue) biography of a significant figure in agricultural history. Gilbert N. Haugen's
                    role in the McNary-Haugen movement is clearly portrayed in this well-researched and well-written
                    biography of a dedicated farm politician from <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Haugen was proud of his Norwegian heritage, loved the land, and exemplified by his actions the work
                    ethic to which he subscribed. Before he became a seventeen-term member of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives (1899–1933), Haugen had been, variously, a farm
                    laborer, horse trader, merchant, land agent, banker, and owner of many farms. His political
                    apprenticeship included experience as GOP county chairman, justice of the peace, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa state</region>
                    </placeName> legislator. It was after his election to Congress that he dedicated himself to becoming
                    a spokesman for the American farmer.</p>
            <p>Congressman Haugen was an admirer of President Theodore Roosevelt and gave his support to much of the
                    Square Deal. While not committed ideologically to progressivism, Haugen did favor federal
                    intervention to foster the well-being of the rural sector. Whereas he was conservative relative to
                    agrarian, small-town values, Haugen was realistic about adapting to change and foresaw the need for
                    more positive government. His real crusade was McNary-Haugenism. As chairman of the House
                    Agriculture Committee he joined with his counterpart in the Senate, Charles McNary of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, to sponsor a bill that would involve federal intervention on behalf of commercial
                    farmers. The proposal, twice vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, would have established a federal
                    export corporation to implement a two-price system by dumping surplus agricultural commodities
                    abroad. Farmers were to receive an equalization fee that would sustain farm income in the same
                    manner that the tariff aided industry. In retrospect the plan was economically <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-090-1-096"/> unworkable and overlooked the harsh realities of international trade.</p>
            <p>Haugen's involvement in farm legislation throughout the 1920s made him nationally known
                    among rural leaders. His cooperation with the bipartisan Farm Bloc helped him forge a Southern
                    Democrat/Western-Midwestern Republican coalition that continued to grow in political strength in the
                    1930s. The authors see Haugen as a link between the older progressives and the rising generation of
                    rural leaders (such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s Henry A. Wallace) who would become zealous advocates of federal management
                    of agriculture. As a lame duck member of Congress in 1933 Haugen did support the domestic allotment
                    plan (the heart of the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Act), but its production control
                    features were beyond his political vision. Haugen's legacy was that of McNary-Haugenism
                    which, as the authors point out, "was an important part of the story of agricultural

                    </placeName> until tuberculosis ended her advanced work in English literature but gave leisure in
                    convalescence to write. Her fiction examined both regions in which she had lived, but she first
                    achieved widespread attention with the artful tales of a Hoosier Quaker family recounted in <hi rend="i">The Friendly Persuasion</hi> (1945). Indiana figured in much of her subsequent writing,
                    notably in her best seller, <hi rend="i">The Massacre at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1975), praised by Alfred S. Shivers for its flavor of "rugged
                    frontier life" (p. 78). West revisited Indiana to research, lecture, and receive numerous
                    awards, including Indiana University's doctorate of Humane Letters (1959).</p>
            <p>Shivers states in the preface of this handbook that he "wanted to make it better organized
                    and more readable" (p. viii) than his first study of West, which was published in 1972. To
                    this end he has drawn on further research (including recent interviews with West's husband,
                    Dr. Harry Maxwell McPherson) to reconsider her earlier work and to summarize and evaluate the
                    additional books she produced before her death in 1984. A chronology and extensive critical notes
                    and documentation, often based on the author's correspondence with West, enhance the value
                    of this work.</p>

                    baby" (p. 71) but arrives after the birth. Shivers is fond of literary allusions, some less
                    illuminating than distracting. For example, he characterizes Cornelius in <hi rend="i">South of the
                        Angels</hi> (1960) as "sharply sensitive to the delights of sensory impressions
                    &amp; almost as if he had perused and taken to heart Walter Pater's concluding advice
                    in <hi rend="i">The Renaissance</hi> on the necessity to collect, treasure, and luxuriate in what
                    Pater terms ‘this fruit of quickened, multiplied consciousness’" (p.
                    104).</p>
            <p>No formal biography of West has yet appeared, though she wrote extensively about her life in
                    articles, somewhat covertly in novels and stories, and candidly in several memoirs. Shivers notes
                    that her "40-plus volumes of journals" (p. 138) and letters remain unpublished. He
                    seems as reluctant as before to accord his subject more than "minor" status as an
                    artist, "several rungs down the ladder of greatness," yet, ambivalently, he
                    declares her "fit company" for so distinguished a writer as Willa Cather (p. 145).</p>
