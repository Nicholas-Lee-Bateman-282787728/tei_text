            <p>(Read at the recent conference on the need of a Constitutional Convention, held
                    at Indiana University, June 8, 9, 10.)</p>
            <p>On the first Monday in December, 1815, the General Assembly of the Indiana
                    territory met at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Governor Posey was ill at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and he could not come to the seat of government. He sent a brief
                    message by his private secretary, calling attention to the tide of immigration
                    that was flowing into the territory and the Governor urged upon the legislators,
                    as of first importance, 'the promotion of education and the betterment
                    of roads and highways.' This Assembly passed thirty-one laws and seven
                    joint resolutions, but its chief interest centered in the efforts to change
                    their territorial institutions for those of a State government. On December 14,
                    1815, a memorial was adopted by the Assembly and laid before Congress on the
                    28th of the same month by Jonathan Jennings, Indiana's territorial
                    delegate, praying Congress to order an election to be held in the several
                    counties of the territory for representatives to meet in convention on a day to
                    be appointed. The memorial called attention to the fact that the Ordinance of
                    1787 for the government of the territory, had provided that 'whenever
                    there shall be 60,000 free inhabitants therein, this territory shall be admitted
                    into the Union on an equal footing with the original States.</p>
            <p>The memorial also set forth that from a recent territorial census, the number of
                    free white inhabitants was above 60,000. It w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as requested
                    that if a convention were authorized the majority of the delegates elected
                    thereto should determine whether it were expedient <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-010-3-002"/> to go into a State government, and if it were
                    deemed expedient the convention so assembled should have the power to form a
                    constitution and frame of government, or to provide for the election of a later
                    convention for that purpose. In this memorial the Assembly expressed its
                    attachment to the principles concerning 'personal freedom and
                    involuntary servitude' which had been laid down in the Ordinance of
                    1787 for the government of the Northwest territory.</p>
            <p>This memorial was referred to a committee of which Mr. Jennings was chairman. On
                    the 5th of January, 1816, Jennings reported to the House a bill to enable the
                    people of Indiana territory to form a constitution and State government, and for
                    the admission of the State to the Union on an equal footing with the other
                    States. The bill, after a few amendments, was passed by Congress, and became a
                    law by the approval of President Madison on the 19th of April, 1816. This was
                    the Enabling Act. for Indiana.</p>
            <p>In harmony with the provisions of this act an election was held in the several
                    counties of the territory on May 13, 1816, for members of a convention to form a
                    State constitution. There were thirteen counties in the State and they elected
                    forty members to the convention. From <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    </placeName>, June 10, 1816, and continued to meet from day to day until the
                    29th of June. In nineteen days it completed its work and adjourned.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Jennings was president and Wm. Hendricks was secretary. Badollet, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> was chairman of a committee to prepare a preamble and a bill of

                    Scott, of Clark, was chairman of the committee on the judicial department. Dill,

                    </placeName>, was chairman of the committee on impeachment. Maxwell, of
                    Jefferson, was chairman of the committee to consider other provisions of the
                    constitution not included in the foregoing topics.</p>
            <p>There were also committees on the mode of revising the constitution, on
                    education, the militia, the franchise, and prisons.</p>
            <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-010-3-003"/>
            <p>John B. Dillon in his well known <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi> (page 559)
                    says:</p>
            <p>The convention that formed the first constitution of the State of Indiana was
                    composed, mainly, of clear-minded, unpretending men of common sense, whose
                    patriotism was unquestionable, and whose morals were fair. Their familiarity
                    with the <unclear/> Amsrican Independence– their territorial
                    experience under the provisions of the Ordinance of 1787– and their
                    knowledge of the principles of the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, were sufficient, when combined, to lighten materially their labors
                    in the great work of forming a constitution for a new State. With such landmarks
                    in view, the labors of similar conventions in other States and territories have
                    been rendered comparatively light.</p>
            <p>In the clearness and conciseness of its syle, in the comprehensive and just
                    provisions which it made for the maintenance of civil and religious liberty, in
                    its mandates, which were designed to protect the rights of the people,
                    collectively and individually, and to provide for the public
                    welfare–the constitution that was formed for Indiana, in 1816, was
                    not inferior to any of the State constitutions which were in existence at that
                    time.</p>
            <p>The constitution of 1816 was not submitted to the voters of the State for
                    ratification. That step in popular government was not deemed necessary. By the
                    provisions of the constitution the officers of the territorial government were
                    required to continue in the exercise of their duties till they should be
                    superseded by the officers elected under the authority of the State government.
                    The president of the constitutional convention, Mr. Jennings, was required to
                    issue writs of election directed to the sheriffs of the several counties
                    requiring them to cause an election to be held for governor,
                    lieutenant-governor, representative in Congress, members of the General Assembly
                    and sheriffs and coroners of the counties, which election was to be held on the
                    first Monday in August, 1816. Here was a comparatively short ballot–a
                    governor, lieutenant-governor, congressman, and two county officers. All other
                    officers were appointive. Jennings was elected governor, receiving 5,211 votes
                    to 3,934 votes cast for his competitor, Thomas Posey, who was at the time
                    governor of the territory. Christopher Harrison, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, was elected lieutenant-governor, and William Hendricks was elected
                    to represent Indiana in Congress.</p>
            <p>The General Assembly elected in August, commenced its session at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName> on November 4, 1816. On November 7th the oath of office was
                    administered to Governor Jennings and Lieutenant-Governor Harrison, and the
                    Governor delivered his inaugural address.</p>
            <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-010-3-004"/>
            <p>Thus, on the 7th of November, 1816, the territorial government of Indiana was
                    superseded by a State government, and on December 11, the State by a joint
                    resolution of the two houses of Congress was formally admitted to the Union of
                    States.</p>
            <p>A comparison of this first constitution of Indiana with that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> adopted in 1792 and that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> adopted in 1803, will show how largely Indiana's
                    fundamental law was fashioned after these two instruments of her sister States.
                    Many parts are appropriated bodily, and it is easily seen that the new State
                    came offering a constitution that had been largely modeled after some approved
                    democratic pattern. All that the convention could reasonably be expected to do
                    was to fit some ready-made pattern to our local needs. That is what they did, as
                    a reading of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> constitutions will show. They evolved little that was new. Their
                    principles of government were well known principles; they were old and
                    established. There were good, hard-headed, common-sense men in the convention,
                    but there were no great creative political geniuses. They could not, or did not,
                    take time to create a constitution <hi rend="i">de novo.</hi> They seemed to be
                    in a hurry, though they worked for an age much slower-moving than ours. It may
                    be recalled as an evidence of the haste, not to say the snap judgment, that was
                    exercised in the process of making our first constitution and putting our State
                    government into operation, that the Enabling Act was passed on April 19, the
                    election of delegates was held on May 13 in less than four weeks; the delegates
                    came together on June 10, four weeks later; they deliberated less than three
                    weeks -and the constitution which they devised was not passed upon by the people
                    at all. Naturally, the men of the convention appropriated to their use
                    constitutional provisions already made and provided, and in so doing they acted
                    the part usual to Anglo-Saxon constitution makers.</p>
            <p>It has been said that the parties in political control were hurrying to bring the
                    State into the Union before snow flew, or before the fall elections. 0. H. Smith
                    in his <hi rend="i">Early Indiana Trials and Sketches</hi> says that the affairs
                    of the State were in the hands of three parties, or rather one party with three
                    divisions, the Noble, Jennings, and Hendricks divisions. All were represented in
                    the convention of 1816. Noble and Jennings were delegates, Jennings being the
                    president, and William Hendricks was the convention's secretary. This
                    was a time of 'personal politics' and an arrangement was made
                    among these leaders and their friends to make Noble senator, Jennings governor,
                    and Hendricks congressman. In their readiness to divide <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-010-3-005"/> these political plums among themselves, these
                    leaders we're naturally inclined toward dispatch, that the State might
                    be ready for acceptance for the fall session of congress.</p>
            <p>This was a period of the complete dominance of Jeffersonian Democracy, and
                    constitutions were becoming more popular and flexible Jefferson was on record as
                    favoring a State's changing its constitution at least once within every
                    generation. He thought a change once in twenty years might not be too often.</p>
            <p>Somewhat in harmony with this, and it would seem in even a more liberal spirit,
                    the constitution of 1816 provided. that ' every 12th year after the
                    constitution went into effect, at the general election held for governor, there
                    shall be a poll opened in which the qualified electors of the State shall
                    express by vote whether they are in favor of calling a convention or not; if
                    there should be a majority of all the votes given at such election in favor of a
                    convention, the governor shall inform the next General Asembly thereof, whose
                    duty it shall be to provide by law for the election of members to the
                    contention, the number thereof, and the time and place of meeting; which law
                    shall not be passed unless agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to
                    both branches of the General Assembly.' When the convention met it
                    should have the power to revise, amend, or change the
                    constitution–except that the constitution should 'never be
                    altered in such a way as to authorize slavery, as that relation can originate
                    only in usurpation and tyranny.</p>
            <p>So it appears that our fathers were starting off with the expectation of
                    frequently meeting in convention to revise their State constitution. It was
                    thirty-four years before a constitutional convention assembled again in
                    Indiana–probably a longer period than was anticipated by the framers
                    of the first instrument. We have been sixty-four years–almost twice
                    as long–on the second run, in a period of much greater change.</p>
            <p>The constitution of 1816 had not been long in operation until dissatisfaction
                    began to arise under it. From 1830 to 1848 repeated quarrels arose between the
                    State senate and the chief executive over the appointment of the supreme court
                    judges, and after some abuses in appointments had occured, it was felt that it
                    would be better if the choice of the judges were left to election by the people.
                    But the chief ground of difficulty seemed to lie in the lack of general laws
                    under which local needs could be met and administered. The General Asembly had
                    constantly to be passing laws in response to some local or personal demand until
                    the local laws became six or seven times <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-010-3-006"/>
                    more voluminous than the general laws. Divorce was then entirely a matter for
                    legislative action. There were numerous local and special acts. To illustrate I
                    shall name two instances among many–one for the relief of James
                    Hardin, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>, authorizing 'said Hardin to peddle and sell goods of any
                    kind whatever without paying license thereof in any county in the State,; and
                    one for the relief of Silas Overman, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant county</region>
                    </placeName>, against whom a court had given a judgment of $238.00 on
                    a surety bond. This judgment of the court was, in effect, to be submitted to a
                    referendum in Overman's township to see whether the voters would recall
                    the judicial decision and remit the judgment–an application of the
                    recall which no one in recent times has ever ventured to suggest or defend. Many
                    of the special acts were to incorporate towns and improve roads, there being no
                    general provision for such purposes, and the constitution not requiring that the
                    laws should be uniform for the whole State.</p>
            <p>The General Assembly at every session was constantly being beset to pass hundreds
                    of such personal and local acts. The evil was found to be unbearable, and there
                    began to be a pressing demand for a new constitution to remedy the situation.
                    There were other needs but this acted most effectively.</p>
            <p>A referendum similar to the one we are now confronting was provided in 1849. In
                    his annual message delivered to the houses of the General Assembly on December
                    6, 1848, Governor James Whit-comb recommended the passage of an act providing
                    for submitting to the people of the State the question of calling a
                    constitutional convention to amend the constitution of 1816. The governor gave a
                    number of reasons for urging this step: (1) The growing burden of local and
                    private legislation. (2) The increasing demand for biennial instead of annual
                    sessions of the General Assembly. (3) The necessity of prescribing restrictions
                    on the creation of public debt. (4) The desirability of requiring a two-thirds
                    vote in each house in appropriating public funds to private individuals. (5) The
                    universal desire for amendment.</p>
            <p>The time was thought to be propitious, as the question would not be complicated
                    by the excitement of a national election. Governor Whitcomb especially
                    emphasized the importance of calling a halt upon the increasing amount of local
                    and private legislation. For five years the amount of general legislation had
                    remained stationary while in the same period legislation of a local and private
                    character had grown by 350 per cent. In the last session of the Assembly <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-010-3-007"/> over 600 bills had passed, being more than
                    four for each member and more than thirteen for each working day of the session.
                    To examine thirteen bills every day for six or seven consecutive weeks seemed
                    like an unreasonable task for the mind of the average legislator, not to speak
                    of the governor, who was expected to examine personally all of them before
                    signing. The task became a physical impossibility, since many of these bills
                    piled up within the few days before the close of the session.</p>
            <p>An act approved on January 15, 1849 provided that at the regular State election
                    in that year, then held in August, the people might decide for or against the
                    calling of a convention, to alter, revise, or amend the constitution of the
                    State. Every qualified voter might vote for or against the proposition. The act
                    provided that when a voter presented his ballot for State and local officers, at
                    his proper voting place, the inspector of election was required to propose to
                    him the question,' Are you in favor of a convention to amend the
                    constitution?' Those favoring such convention should answer in the
                    affirmative, those against in the negative, and the answers were to be duly
                    recorded by the clerks of election in a poll book furnished for that purpose.
                    The inspectors and judges were to certify the number of votes for and against
                    the convention to the clerks of the circuit courts under the same restrictions
                    and penalties that votes for State and county offices were given and certified.
                    These clerks were to certify to the secretary of State, subject to penalties for
                    neglect, and the secretary of State was to lay the returns before the General.
                    Assembly. The county sheriffs were required to give six weeks' notice
                    of this election in every county.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It thus appears that this law provided that the responsible election officer
                    should put it up directly to every voter who presented a ballot to say whether
                    or not he favored a convention. This provision led to a large vote upon the
                    subject, almost as large as that cast for State officers. Yet in spite of this
                    laudable effort to induce the voters to express themselves, more than 10,000 who
                    voted for governor failed to express themselves upon the issue of the
                    convention. It turned out fortunately that a majority of all the votes cast in
                    the election were for the convention, though the law did not require that it
                    should be so before a convention might be called. The total vote cast on the
                    question of the convention was 138,91.9. with 81,500 votes <hi rend="i">for</hi>
                    and 57,418 votes <hi rend="i">against</hi>, giving a majority in favor, on the
                    convention vote, of 24,082. In the State campaign both of the leading candidates

                    themselves in favor of the convention. There seemed to be a positive desire
                    among the people for a change in the organic law, while there was no organized
                    or active opposition. In the August election, 1849, Joseph Wright, of "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Democrat, received 76,996 votes. Mr. John A. Matson, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Whig, received 67,218 votes, and Mr. James H. Cravens, the Free
                    Soil candidate, received 3,018 votes, making a total vote for governor of
                    147,232, with one county (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName>) unreported on the governorship vote. A majority of the
                    governorship vote was 73,617. The convention vote was about 8,000 above this
                    majority. The difference between the vote on the governorship and that on the
                    convention was a little over 10,000. That is, about 7% per cent of the voters
                    did not express themslves on the convention, though they were specifically asked
                    by the election officers to do so. The surmise is thatsome voters obstinately
                    refused to express themselves. If we have 650,000 voters in Indiana this year on
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senatorship which is a fairly conservative estimate, as there are
                    over 750,000 voters enumerated, and the proportion not voting on the convention
                    should merely equal that of 1849 (though it is likely to exceed it), we shall
                    find that about 50,000 voters will fail to express themselves. If these voters
                    vote for a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator but not on the convention one way or the other, they will
                    be counted in the negative, since the act referring the question to the voters
                    requires an absolute majority of all voting before the convention is authorized.
                    Of course the General Assembly might still call a convention regardless of the
                    vote, but is is not likely to do so.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that in the referendum of 1849 there was much public
                    discussion of the subject before the people. The people were not stirred up over
                    the question. There were no university conferences, or popular mass meetings on
                    the subject, no franchise leagues or other organizations to press the matter on
                    the attention of the voters, nor did the newspapers seem at all interested in
                    the matter. I have gone through the files of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                    Journal</hi> for several weeks preceding the election without succeeding in
                    finding a single reference to the pending proposal. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> voted against the convention by 347 majority, and the Democratic

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, charged that the reason for this was that the Whig leaders were
                    notoriously hostile to the measure and openly threw the weight of their
                    influence as well as most of their votes against it. Mr. Defrees, the Whig
                    editor of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, denied this. He himself voted for the
                    convention, and the truth was, he asserted, that very little interest was
                    manifested on the question by any one, and many of those who <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-010-3-009"/> were asked by the inspectors, 'Convention
                    or No Convention,' then heard of the proposition for the first time.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Defrees claimed that as many Whigs voted for the
                    convention as did Democrats and returns by counties seem to bear him out. The
                    fact was that many "Whig counties voted for the convention and many
                    Democratic counties against it, and <hi rend="i">vice versa.</hi> The strong <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> voted almost 3 to 1 for the convention, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> 2 to 1, and Henry gave a decisive convention majority. Clarke,
                    Sullivan and Washington equally strong Democratic counties, gave almost equally
                    heavy convention majorities. Sullivan, which went for Wright for governor by a
                    vote of 3 to 1, voted for the convention by 2 to 1. On the other hand, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Whig County</region>
                    </placeName> of Jefferson which went for Matson by 500 majority gave also 500
                    majority against the convention. The voting seems to have been governed by local
                    interest and local sentiment, not by politics nor party favor.</p>
            <p>But since the proposal for a convention in 1849 had carried a majority of all the
                    votes cast, the duty of the General Assembly was plain. Within the year, 1849,
                    Governor Whitcomb had been elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate and the lieutenant-governor, Paris C. Dunning, had succeeded
                    to the governorship. In his message of December 4, 1849, Governor Dunning called
                    the attention of the General Assembly to the duty before it. This duty was to
                    provide by law for districting the State for the election of convention
                    delegates. Governor Dunning advised (at least publicly) that the members of the
                    General Assembly should divest themselves of all party predilections and make a
                    fair apportionment as a means of assuring a fair representation in the
                    convention whose duty it would be to draw up a new constitution, and this, the
                    governor thought, would be an initiatory step which would tend to predispose the
                    people to adopt a new constitution when offered for their ratification. In this
                    General Assembly the Democrats had a safe working majority with 29 senators and
                    59 members of the House. A bill to provide for the election of delegates to a
                    constitutional convention was introduced in the Senate on December 4, 1849, by
                    Mr. Randall. It passed the Senate on January 3, 1850, and the House on January
                    11, and was approved by the governor on January 18, 1850.</p>
            <p>The act provided that an election for delegates to the convention should be held
                    on the first Monday in August. The convention was to be competent to consider
                    the constitution of the State, to make such changes or amendments as it might
                    think prcper, which amendments should afterwards be submitted to a vote of the
                    people <list type="footnotes">

                    The delegates were to be elected as the members of the General Assembly were
                    elected and in corresponding districts, the usual election officers, laws,
                    processes, and penalties to apply. The county sheriffs were to attest elections
                    to the secretary of State. The delegates numbered the same as the members of the
                    Assembly. The delegates were to assemble on the first Monday in October, 1850,
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for organization by electing a president and other officers. The
                    secretary of State was to attend and open the convention, call the lists of
                    districts and counties, receive the credentials and perform such duties in
                    organization as are performed by the proper officers when the General Assembly
                    is organized.</p>
            <p>The delegates to this convention were elected at the regular State election on
                    August 6, 1850. The two parties put out their candidates and their names
                    appeared on the party tickets with the other party candidates. One hundred and
                    fifty delegates were elected, fifty senatorial delegates and one hundred
                    representative delegates. Of the fifty senatorial delegates, thirty-three were
                    Democrats, and seventeen were "Whigs; of the one hundred representative
                    delegates sixty-two were Democrats and thirty-eight were Whigs. In the
                    convention as a whole there were ninenty-five Democrats and fifty-live Whigs.</p>

                    and privileges of a legislative body were conferred upon this convention. A
                    majority constituted a quorum to do business. The members were to receive
                    $3.00 per day while actually attending, and an allowance for
                    legislative mileage.</p>
            <p>The convention assembled on October 7, 1850. It completed its labors on February
                    10, 1851, making one hundred and twenty-six days in all, counting Sunday and
                        holidays.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> of October 7, 1850, spoke highly of the

            <p>When the convention had completed its work it recommended. and the General
                    Assembly then sitting provided, that it should be submitted to the people for
                    ratification or rejection at the usual election time, the first Monday in
                    August, 1851. The voters were called upon to express themselves on two
                    propositions: (1) The ratification or rejection of the instrument as a whole.
                    (2) The adoption or rejection of a separate article relative to negro exclusion
                    and colonization–a question submitted to the voters as a distinct
                    proposition in the following form: Exclusion and colonization of negroes and
                    mulattoes, 'Yes' or 'No.</p>
            <p>The proposed constitution was printed in full in the leading papers of the State
                    and discussed with considerable interest during the five months preceding the
                    vote. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi>, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one of the leading Whig organs of the State, said that while the
                    new constitution contained much that was objectionable, it would still pledge
                    support to all its provisions except the negro exclusion clause. The <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                        </placeName> Courier</hi>, a strong Democratic organ, regarded the new
                    constitution as 'immeasurably above the one now in force.</p>
            <p>At the regular election, August 4, 1851, the constitution was adopted by a vote
                    of 113,230 to 27,638. There were 113,828 votes cast in favor of negro exclusion
                    to 21,873 against.</p>
            <p>By its own provision the constitution went into operation on November 1, 1851.</p>
            <p>The vote for the constitution was decisive, not to say overwhelming. In his
                    message to the General Assembly on December 2, 1851, Governor Joseph A. Wright
                    expressed the conviction that 'as Indianians we may well challenge a
                    parallel in the unanimity with which our people adopted the new
                    constitution–a majority of 86,000 at the ballot box.' He
                    urged the General Assembly to give the constitution 'a steady and
                    energetic support' and carry out its various provisions, 'that
                    they may be fairly tested.'<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>The scope of this paper and the time allotted for it will not permit me to go
                    into detailed account of the efforts made to amend the Indiana constitution
                    since 1851. But a few of the leading efforts in this direction should not be
                    entirely omitted.</p>
            <p>The new constitution had hardly gone into effect before proposals were made in
                    the General Assembly to amend it–to restore annual legislative
                    sessions, to require full naturalized citizenship of all foreign-born voters, to
                    lift the sixty-day limit on legislative sessions, to allow special and local
                    laws for the support of common schools. Such proposals were frequently made
                    between 1853 and 1857. As early as 1859 efforts were made in the General
                    Assembly to bring about a new convention, or, failing in this, to secure a
                    series of amendments on the ground that provisions of the constitution made
                    legislation under it 'difficult, tedious, and in some respects
                    impossible, or at least inadequate to the emergencies of the case or to the
                    wants of the citizens of the State, restricting remedies that would tend to the
                    public good.' The vote in the General Assembly in 1859 showed that
                    there was a popular demand for a revision, and those who opposed the new
                    convention as the best method of bringing about the desired changes admitted
                    that changes were desirable. One of the members, Mr. Davis, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName>, spoke of the 'rickety constitution under which we now
                    live,' and he thought that the numerous requests for amendments that
                    had come up at every session of the General Assembly were convincing proof that
                    the people were dissatisfied. It was charged by some of the opponents of a <hi rend="i">new</hi> convention that it was only the '<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> law faction as voiced in the late State temperance
                    convention' and the 'unlamented remains of the Know-nothing
                    party which desired to exclude foreign-born citizens from the polls'
                    who were urging changes in the constitution. The opponents of a convention
                    thought then, as they think now, that the plan of amendment provided in the
                    constitution–the passage by two successive legislatures and
                    submission to the people for ratification–was 'satisfactory,
                    ample, safer, and more economical.' It was urged with force that before
                    resorting to a new convention the amending method should be tested. By
                    presenting propositions singly there would be less confusion and each reform
                    could be more forcibly presented to the people. It was urged in reply that the
                    amending process was 'utterly impracticable;' that
                    'competition for priority' had defeated every proposition so
                    far presented, since no new amendment could be proposed while any amendment was
                    pending.</p>
            <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-010-3-013"/>
            <p>The changes that were being urged at that time related to several matters:</p>
            <p>1. The common school system was being retarded by the 'uniform
                    law' provision of the constitution as interpreted by the State Supreme
                    Court. The constitution imposes a duty upon the General Assembly 'to
                    provide by law for a general and uniform system of common schools, wherein
                    tuition shall be without charge and equally open to all.' This was
                    interpreted to require a. proportionate uniform expenditure of revenue in all
                    parts of the State. 'Nothing could be done anywhere in the State in
                    advance of the progress of the darker portions.' The more enterprising
                    and enlightened communities could not of their own accord provide more money for
                    their schools than was provided elsewhere, but had to wait upon the more
                    backward communities 'who were willing to close the files of
                    progress.' This was a constant subject of irritation.</p>
            <p>2. There was dissatisfaction over the election laws. A change was necessary to
                    enable the General Assembly to pass a suitable registration law to prevent the
                    colonization of voters and other frauds at the ballot box. The present system
                    admitted 'whole shoals of immigrant voters' for want of power
                    to fix a suitable residence requirement. Governor Ashbel P. "Willard in
                    his message of January 6, 1859, urged the passage of a law adequate 'to
                    protect the suffrages of honest men against fraud… Men have left the
                    County of their residence; said Governor Willard, ' gone to others
                    where they had no permanent homes, where they did not intend to remain longer
                    than the day of election, have there cast their votes and thus determined who
                    should be the officers and representatives of the counties they
                    visited.' He called for severe penalties for such abuses.</p>
            <p>3. Members objected to the technical and detailed legislative processes required
                    by the constitution such as treating of but one subject in a bill, reading a
                    bill three times, and especially objectionable was the provision for the
                    amendment of laws. Many acts had been declared inconstitutional because they had
                    not been set out in full in the amending process, as the constitution requires.</p>
            <p>4. Others wished a restoration of annual sessions and a modified form of
                    legislation for special and local purposes, and a constitutional change was
                    especially desired to promote a betterment of conditions on behalf of
                    temperance.</p>
            <p>On March 5, 1859, the Governor signed a bill again submitting to the voters the
                    question of calling a constitutional convention. <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-010-3-014"/> The question was to be voted on at the regular
                    election in October, 1859. If a majority of the voters voted in the affirmative,
                    then one hundred delegates were to be elected (one for each of the
                    representative districts) on the first Monday in April, 1860. The convention was
                    to assemble on the second Tuesday in May, 1860. Its proposed amendments were to
                    the submitted to the people separately or together as the convention should
                    determine. This proposal, coming so soon after the convention of 1851, was voted
                    down by the people in the ensuing election.</p>
            <p>Other proposals for a new convention were made in the General Asembly in 1871 and
                    in the Special Session of 1872, and again in 1875, but they were not acted upon.</p>
            <p>In 1879 a series of amendments were submitted to the voters:</p>
            <p>1. To strike out the word 'white' from the suffrage
                    requirements in order to bring the State constitution into conformity with the
                    recently amended constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>; and to prescribe a residence of sixty days in the township and
                    thirty days in the ward or precinct before voting; and to require that all
                    voters be registered according to law.</p>
            <p>2. To strike out the provision prohibiting negroes and mulattoes from voting.</p>
            <p>3. To abandon the October election and to provide for holding all general
                    elections in November; for holding township elections at such time as
                    legislative acts may provide; to provide special, elections for judicial
                    officers; and to provide for the registration of all voters.</p>
            <p>4. To strike out the word 'white' where it occurs as to
                    enumeration of male inhabitants of the State for apportionment of senators and
                    representatives.</p>
            <p>5. To prohibit local laws as to fees and salaries, but providing graded
                    compensation in proportion to population and services required.</p>
            <p>6. To provide that the judicial power shall be vested in a supreme court, circuit
                    courts and such other courts as the General Assembly may establish.</p>
            <p>7. To strike out the negro exclusion and colonization clause and insert a
                    provision to prohibit political and municipal corporations from becoming
                    indebted to an amount in excess of two per cent of the taxable value of their
                    property, except in case of war, foreign invasion, or other public calamity, and
                    on petition of a majority of the property owners affected and in the discretion
                    of the public authorities.</p>
            <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-010-3-015"/>
            <p>These amendments were approved by the governor on March 10, 1879, and were
                    submitted to the voters on the first Monday in April (5th), 1880. They were all
                    approved at the polls by majorities ranging from 17,000 to 50,000. But the
                    highest vote received for any one of the amendments was 181,000, while the whole
                    number of votes cast in the election was 380,000, the majority of which is one
                    above 190,000. The last official enumeration of voters, taken in 1877 showed
                    that there were 451,000 voters in the State and in the election of 1876, 434,000
                    votes had been cast. It will certainly be held reasonble to infer that there
                    were as many in 1880, but the supreme court subsequently did not so infer. The
                    constitution provides that in order to carry an amendment it shall be sxibmitted
                    to the electors of the State, 'and if a majority of said electors shall
                    ratify the same, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of this
                    constitution.' Obviously none of these amendments had carried by a
                    majority of the voters of the State, although each of them had a good majority
                    of those interested enough to vote on the proposals. The governor had no power
                    to declare whether the amendments had been rejected or adopted. The matter was
                    submitted to the supreme court for decision, and the court held that the
                    amendments were neither ratified nor rejected, the vote being ineffectual for
                    want of a constitutional majority. Therefore, the amendments were still pending.
                    But the court suggested that there would be no irregularity in submitting them,
                    or any one of them, to the voters of the State at a special election, where only
                    the amendments themselves could be voted on; and while it requires a majority of
                    the electors of the State to ratify an amendment to the constitution, the whole
                    number of <hi rend="sup">ir</hi>otes cast at the election at which the amendment
                    is submitted may be taken as the number of the electors of the State. (State <hi rend="i">vs.</hi> Swift, May term, 1880.)</p>
            <p>This decision, or the indifferent vote on which it was based, gave rise to a
                    demand for a constitutional convention, which repeatedly found voice in the
                    ensuing General Assemblies, but without action. Instead, a special election for
                    the amendments was resorted to. Following the suggestion thrown out by the
                    supreme court, the General Assembly passed an act in 1881 providing for the
                    submission of the foregoing amendments at a special election to be held on March
                    14, 1881. In this election none of the amendments received as many as 130,000

                    State–but they were declared adopted and were made part of the

                    assumption and a legal fiction which every member of the court knew to be untrue
                    as a matter of fact. The majority of the electors of the State had not voted for
                    the amendments–far from it; but the political power of the courts was
                    equal to the emergency and the amendments by a forced construction were
                    incorporated into the fundamental law. It may have been a desirable
                    consummation, but it must be admitted that it was done in flagrant disregard of
                    the plain provisions of the constitution. I admit that the amending provision of
                    the constitution is absurd in the difficulties of its working, and we may be
                    pleased to see a court disregard or circumvent it; but there is a more orderly
                    and law-abiding way to abrogate the constitution among a law-loving people. The
                    constitution is as plain as the English language can make it upon this point,
                    but the court 'construed the constitution away' by assuming
                    that there were no more voters in the State at the time of this election than
                    had voted upon these propositions. By which it appears that the courts may amend
                    the constitution easily enough, though the people may not. What the courts may
                    do in the future in declaring amendments carried is uncertain and problematical.</p>
            <p>Two amendments, one permitting an enlargement of the supreme court and another
                    relating to the qualifications of lawyers, were submitted to the voters at the
                    general election of November 6,1900. The vote on the first was 314,610 for, and
                    178,960 against; on the second, 240,031 for, and 144,072 against, a majority of
                    135,000 in one instance and 96,000 in the other. But as the total vote cast for
                    secretary of State was 655,000 and as the amendments required a majority of this
                    vote (327,000) the court has ruled that they were not adopted, but are still
                    pending. The State constitution says that while an amendment is pending,
                    'awaiting the action of the electors, no additional amendment shall be
                    proposed.' This bars further action toward amending the constitution
                    until these amendments are out of the way. An amended act again submitting them
                    (at a special election) would require three years. Any new amendment would
                    require three more years, since it must be agreed to by two successive General
                    Assemblies, So if the pending amendments can be gotten out of the way and new
                    amendments be gotten by two successive General Assemblies, and if the judgment
                    and temper of the court should again be favorable, we might, with the best of
                    expedition, hope to get a new amendment to the constitution by 1920.</p>
            <p>The 'lawyer amendment' was again voted on by the people at the
                    general November election of 1910. It received 60,357 votes for <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-010-3-017"/> adoption, to 18,494 against. Since there were
                    627,133 votes east for secretary of State, it was clearly not adopted. There was
                    no interest in it. but it is still held to be pending and is thereby blocking
                    other amendments.</p>
            <p>It is now contended that these amendments are not pending; that, failing to get a
                    majority of the votes cast, they were rejected and are out of the way.
                    Ex-president Harrison, I am informed, expressed an opinion to this effect. In re
                        Denny,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> decided in 1900, the court virtually reversed
                    the ruling in the Swift case on this point. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> Bar Association contended that the 'lawyer's
                    amendment' had been passed in 1900, and it accordingly established
                    rules and regulations requiring an examination for admission to the bar. One
                    Denny contested the right of the bar to impose such a test and, while the Bar
                    Association was sustained in the lower court, Denny was sustained by the Supreme
                    court, which decided that the lawyer's amendment was not adopted but
                    was rejected in 1900, Four successive General Assemblies since 1900 (1903,
                    1905,1907, 1909) have approved the amendment for submission to the voters. The
                    popular vote on the amendment in 1910 was about one-fifth of that in 1900, and,
                    falling far short of a majority of the vote cast, it was not carried. Following
                    the court's ruling in the Denny case one would suppose that the
                    amendment was rejected but we are evidently left in doubt on that point (and as
                    to what a future court will do with the amending provision) since in the case of
                    Ellingham vs <hi rend="i">Dye</hi> in 1911 the court, in obiter dicta said:
                    "Once again the General Assembly at its session in 1909 referred this
                    amendment to the will of the voters at the general election in 1910, and once
                    more it received the majority of the votes cast thereon but not a majority of
                    the votes cast, at the election. And so it stands obstructive of further
                    proposals for amendment, by reason of the provision of section 2 Article 16,
                    while waiting definite action of the people." In their comments on the
                    Ellingham-Dye case both the supreme court of Indiana and that of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> recognized that in 1911 an "amendment was still awaiting
                    the action of the electors" in this State. From these facts and
                    conflicting rulings it appears obvious to the plain citizen that our
                    constitution needs an overhauling in its amending process. Can the unworkable
                    amending process be gotten rid of without a convention?</p>
            <p>I can refer but briefly to the recent effort to give us what has been called the
                    'Marshall Constitution.' Instead of calling a constitutional
                    convention, the usual process and agency for making a <list type="footnotes">

                    under the control of the Democratic party legislative caucus, agreed upon a
                    series of amendments proposed by Governor Thomas R. Marshall, for submission to
                    the voters of the State for ratification or rejection. This act of the 67th
                    General Assembly of March 4, 1911, purported to be a new constitution for the
                    State. A citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName>, John T. Dye, brought suit in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> Circuit Court against Lew G. Ellingham, secretary of State, and the
                    State election commissioners, enjoining said Ellingham from certifying for the
                    election board this legislative act to the clerks of the counties, to prevent
                    the election commissioners from placing a statement of the proposed constitution
                    on the ballot to be voted at the next general election. Mr. Dye in his complaint
                    contended that the act of submission was in direct violation of the existing
                    constitution, which prescribes a definite way in which an amendment, or a series
                    of amendments, shall be added to the constitution. When the mode of exercising
                    the amending power is prescribed, then the power can be exercised in no other
                    way. The people may form an original constitution, abrogate an old one and form
                    a new one, without restriction except as restrained by the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but if they undertake to add an amendment they must do it in the
                    way laid down in the State constitution for its own amendment.</p>
            <p>By the defendants it was contended that the act provided not a series of
                    amendments but a new constitution; that the people were pot limited as to the
                    method of making a new constitution; that the General Assembly, since there were
                    no specific limitation on this power, might prescribe the mode by which the
                    people should exercise it. And even though the act in question should be
                    considered as a series of amendments, since the constitution does not prohibit
                    this method of submission, it would be a valid process.</p>
            <p>Judge Remster, of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> Circuit Court, in an able decision and after a full view of the
                    case, decided that the legislative act of 1911 proposing the Marshall
                    constitution was void, as being beyond the legislative power to draft a new
                    constitution. (Dye <hi rend="i">vs.</hi> Ellingham.) Judge Remster held that
                    this broad power of constitution-making is inherent in the people. It is not
                    conferred upon the General Assembly, nor can the people divest themselves of it.
                    The power to propose amendments is not a part of the general legislative power
                    to be exercised where there is no specific limitation, at the discretion of the
                    General Assembly; but it was so clearly and specifically stated, that it must be
                    exercised in the way laid down in the constitution and only in that way. The
                    conclusion <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-010-3-019"/> reached by Judge Remster was
                    that the proposed constitution or amendments are void and nugatory, consequently
                    the same in law as an act entirely unauthorized by law.</p>
            <p>This decision from an able and upright judge has quite generally been regarded as
                    sound in law. This decision upon appeal was virtually sustained by the Supreme
                    Court of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which held that it had no jurisdiction in the case.</p>
            <p>This left the people of the State facing the two alternatives, whether they would
                    seek reforms and amendments in their constitutional law by the slow and
                    uncertain process of the present amending power, or resort to the more
                    democratic, thorough, and speedier process of a constitutional convention. It is
                    this question which the people are asked to decide in the referendum vote next
                    November. The convention has long been regarded as one of the greatest of our
                    political inventions, the greatest agency by which democracy finds expression.
                    It is designed for the express purpose of 'formulating the public law,
                    to secure the popular rights, and to subordinate powerful interests to the
                    public welfare. '<hi rend="sup">*</hi>

            <p rend="center">INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>In undertaking an article of this sort, there must naturally be some limitations
                    and the writer has limited himself to the four subjects indicated by the titles
                    of the four chapters. This limits us to the consideration of the history of only
                    two towns. Prior to 1815, Vallonia was the only settlement, and the history
                    prior to that time, of course, centers around that settlement.</p>
            <p>After the location of the county seat at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brownstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1816, that town became the center of activities and Vallonia
                    made little progress. Seymour, by far the largest town in the county, was not
                    established till 1852 and hence is not included in the scope of this account.</p>
            <p>In the history, prior to 1815, there are many traditions to be dealt with, and
                    little means of verifying them exist. The writer has compared the various
                    accounts and has given what seems to be the most satisfactory version.
                    Authorities are quoted in nearly every instance and where there seems to be
                    doubt as to the authenticity of a statement, it is indicated.</p>
            <p>In the last three chapters, the establishment of the county, its organization,
                    and the construction of county buildings are considered in more or less detail,
                    in order to give an idea of the early county business and the methods by whieh
                    it was carried on. Most of this information is taken directly from the county
                    records, especially the commissioners' records, and hence it is well
                    substantiated.</p>
            <p rend="center">CHAPTER I. JACKSON COUNTY PRIOR TO 1815</p>
            <p>When one travels over the Driftwood and the Muscatatuck bottoms of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName> today, it is difficult to realize the changes that the land has
                    witnessed during the last hundred years. On every hand are beautiful and
                    comfortable homes. Near them are well filled barns and surrounding both are well
                    tilled fields, where one may see at the proper time of the year, bountiful crops
                    of corn, wheat, oats, watermelons, nutmegs, and cow peas together with gardens
                    and orchards, while here and there still remain small tracts of virgin forests,
                    whose stately oaks, ashes and beeches remind one of the time when only the
                    Indian hunters broke the silence of the <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-010-3-021"/>
                    forests, as they hunted bear, deer and wild turkey for their daily meat supply.
                    According to early accounts, a week's supply of game could be killed in
                    a half day.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Single flocks of wild turkeys numbered five
                    hundred.- Deer in winter ranged in herds of ten to twenty. There were shoals of
                    fish in the river covering half an acre. Despite this abundance of game we of
                    today find it difficult to realize the hard conditions that confronted the early
                    settlers. We can picture them as they made their way up, or down the river or
                    laboriously toiled through the trackless forests on foot, or horseback, or in
                    ox-wagons; one can imagine them hewing out the logs for their new cabin home, or
                    clearing the forest for the first crops, but we can never realize the hardships
                    that such labor entailed.</p>
            <p>We can see thriving towns and villages now and do not stop to think that at one
                    time none of these existed, or that the little village of Vallonia was once the
                    only business center in the community or county. On August 15, and 16, of this
                    year, this little village, the oldest in the county, celebrated its one
                    hundredth anniversary. The earliest settlers came several years earlier than
                    this but business activities really began in 1813.</p>
            <p>Tradition holds that there was a French settlement made at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vallonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the latter part of the eighteenth century, and some persist in
                    claiming the honor of its being the second oldest town in the State, although
                    this last statement is the merest conjecture. However, the descendants of the
                    earliest settlers, such as the Durhams, Schewmakers and Ewings, assert on the
                    authority of their fathers, that log cabins stood in the field once owned by
                    Jackson Miller near Vallonia, when the first settlers came.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Men sucn as Harrison, Durham, and Josiah Shewmaker, who died only a few years
                    ago, and Columbus Ewing, still living, mention seeing these old log cabins in
                    their early days. It is certain that there was a piece of cleared land here at
                    the coming of the earliest settlers, but this may have been the work of Indians
                    as Vallonia was on the direct line of travel between the settlements at <placeName>

                        a much frequented rendezvous for Indians. The fact that it was a hunting

            <p>According to Benton's <hi rend="i">Reminiscences<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </hi> there was a French and Indian trading post located, for facility in

                    rivers</geogName> and there was a smaller post over at the site of Vallonia
                    bearing the French name of "Vallon" meaning "a little
                    valley." This may have had some connection with the name Valloniai.
                    However he attributes the real origin of the name to Thomas Ewing, who being a

                    and settled a little northwest of the M. B. Singer place. He relates how they
                    came up the river, landed in the evening, made preparations to camp for the
                    night, and how they prepared to build a home. The building was small, but eight
                    families, all there were in the county, were called in to help. However, more
                    people came in that year and the next. He gives the names and the locations of

                    half miles above where Brownstown now stands. Hinton's killing, while
                    in search of his horse, was the first act of Indian hostility. He was scalped
                    and his body thrown into the shallow water at the river's edge. Most of
                    the horses were stolen. As a result two companies of rangers were sent to
                    Vallonia to guard the settlers. Two other men were killed about the same time,

                    and forts for their safety. John Sage built a fort on his place near the site of
                    the White Church; Abraham Huff and others built one near the mouth of what is
                    now Huff creek; John Ketcham and other built one where Brownstown now stands,
                    although this is disputed by some; and James Burcham one on what is now the M.
                    B. Singer farm. James Burcham, in his reminiscences, gives a good description of
                    the fort and states that it was occupied by nine families during the War. There
                    were two skirmishes and frequent alarms there during the war but no bloodshed.</p>
            <p>However, the principal fort was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vallonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This fort consisted of a stockade enclosing about one and one half
                    acres, and was formed of puncheons ten feet in height, planted three feet in the
                    ground. Blockhouses were built at each corner to guard against approach to its
                    sides, and the Vallonia branch runnning through it furnished a bountiful supply
                    of fresh water. It was not completed until January, 1813. There were no attacks,
                    but frequent alarms and constant efforts at horse stealing by the Indians. <hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    settlers from that place to Vallonia in that year to help eat a Fourth of July
                    dinner. In the same letter he relates that he helped draw a seine in

                    of Indian disturbances were without foundation" and that on their

                    bountiful supply. One of the men lost his blanket over on Walnut Ridge and
                    failed to find it on a return trip of several miles. Captain John Tipton, who

                    killing as they were given to him, in 1855, by Frederick Miller, who was a
                    nine-year-old boy in the fort at the time. He says that Sturgeon, in the face of
                    warning from the rest, proposed to be the first to reach the fort. The rest of
                    the party had hardly reached the top of the hill by the Half-mile Branch, above
                    Vallonia, when they heard shots, and rushing forward, they saw Sturgeon down on
                    the ground and surrounded by savages. A shot had broken the wrist of his bridle
                    hand which caused him to be thrown from his horse and placed at the mercy of the
                    savages. That night a party of six composed of Abraham Miller, Thomas Ewing,

                    of Joshua Lindsey, a couple of miles above the site of Brownstown, on what is
                    now the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> road. A lieutenant, with twenty men, came from Vallonia and carried
                    the dead body back to Lindsey's where they stayed all night. Next day
                    they left William Ruddick and two others to bury him, and went on a fruitless
                    search after the Indians. On the same day Ruddick and his companions were
                    ambushed. In the affray Ruddick was slightly injured and one of the Indians was
                    severely injured.</p>
            <p>Captain John Tipton mentions the killing of Doom in his official report of
                    "Aprille" 24, 1813, as occurring on March 18. In the same
                    spring <placeName>

                    Doom, he took twenty-nine men. went up <geogName>Driftwood river</geogName>
                    twenty-five miles, and met a party of Indians on an island in the river. Here a
                    fight ensued, which <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> characterized as a "smart skirmish" lasting only
                    twenty minutes. He dislodged the Indians from the island, and forced them to
                    swim to safety, leaving their boats behind. According to the Captain's
                    account, one Indian was killed on the ground and several were seen to sink in
                    the river.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The battle must have been fought shortly before
                    or after April 1, 1813.</p>
            <p>The Captain's report, as given by Benton, further states that on April
                    16, 1813, two men were killed, one wounded and eight horses stolen by the
                    Indians eight miles northwest of Vallonia. Ketcham in his autobiography says
                    that this happened in the Flinn settlement near Leesville. One of the men killed
                    was a Mr. Guthrie, the other, reported killed, was a Mr. Flinn, who was
                    captured, but escaped and made his way back in the fall of 1814.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Burcham tells of the great alarm caused by the news and how all the
                    neighbors sought refuge in his father's fort. Captain John Tipton,
                    according to his journal, followed the Indians for three days with thirty-one
                    men. But a surprise was prevented by the premature firing by one of the advance
                    guards. Ketcham relates that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> was so angry over this that he wept like a child and was tempted to

                    in the fork of <geogName>White river</geogName> for more than a year. Ketcham

            <p>According to Benton, the son of Hayes, George W., contests with Ewing Durham the

                    the fort in January 1812. Ewing Durham was born January 3, 1812, but Hayes could
                    not tell the exact date of his birth which leaves the matter in doubt.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Another authority claims that Catharine Miller, daughter

                    the settlers were careful to avoid surprises.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Burcham says
                    that the settlers kept soldiers in the field during the summer and fall of 1814.

            <p>Jackson county was created by the act of the territorial General Assembly,

            <p>Brownstown township was bounded by the western line of Jackson township.
                    Beginning at the mouth of Griffey's creek, it extended up the said
                    creek, thence with the knobs to opposite the Half-Mile Branch above Vallonia,
                    thence to the mouth of the Branch and finally in a north course to the Indian
                    boundary.</p>

            <p>All the rest of the county was to be called Flinn township, as the
                    Flinn's Avere prominent settlers there. On May 8, 1816, slight changes
                    were made in the boundaries of Brownstown and Jackson townships and of

                    Owen townships, on June 7, 1842, and March 7, 1843. Other changes were made but

                    Reddick, and Thomas Carr qualified as commissioners according to the law passed
                    by the General Assembly, December 17, 1816. They ordered that the qualified

                    1817, Alexander C. Craig was appointed county treasurer. On August 11, 1817
                    Leonard C. Schewmaker and James McGee were allowed $18.00 each for
                    services as associate judges, and Cyrus Douglas "was allowed
                    $4.00 for the same. Wickliff Kitehell, former sheriff, was allowed
                    $19.01 for former services. On November 11, 1817, William Crenshaw is
                    mentioned as clerk and was ordered to procure a county seal in the shape of a
                    piece of ordnance. On May 11, 1818, Charles Crabb was appointed lister with
                    about the same duties as the present assessor. On February 18, 1819 the same Mr.
                    Crabb was appointed commissioner by the associate judges in place of John
                    Reddick who resigned. Crabb was succeeded on August 9, 1819 by Mordecai
                    Red-click. May 11, of that year, Jonas Crane was appointed inspector of flour,
                    beef, and pork in the county. Mordecai Reddick was succeeded by James Hamilton,
                    as commissioner, on August 12, 1822. August 13, of that year, John Elliot was
                    appointed county treasurer in place of Alexander C. Craig, deceased, and he was
                    succeeded February 10, 1823, by David Benton who was reappointed in 1824. May
                    12, 1823, Obadiah M. Crane was appointed by the associate judges as commissioner
                    to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Abraham Huff. August 11, 1823,
                    General Iseminger qualified as commissioner. In August 1824, Abel Finley and
                    Jesse Roland appeared with McGee and Schewmaker as associate judges. On January
                    3, 1825, Charles Crabb was appointed treasurer and Jonathan Tullis,
                    pound-keeper.</p>
            <p>On September 13, 1824, was the first meeting of the board of justices agreeable
                    to an act of the General Assembly to regulate the method of doing county
                    business, approved January 31, 1824. William Williams was elected president of
                    the board. May 5, 1829, Allen Shepherd was recommended to the governor for the
                    office of surveyor as the office had been vacant heretofore. Such is the record
                    of the early office holders. The board of justices held sway until 1831 when at
                    a general election, held in the county on the first Monday in August 1831, Jacob
                    Wells was elected county commissioner for three years, Matthew Tanner for two
                    years and Mordecai Reddick for one year. They and their successors have
                    continued to constitute the commissioners' court.</p>
            <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-010-3-037"/>
            <p>In this connection it should be mentioned that on May 14, 1822, Ben, a man of
                    color, was allowed $3.00 for services for four days attending
                    "tiers" for the board of county commissioners. The same
                    allowance was made on August 13, 1822. Another of the several accounts is on
                    September 8, 1829, when Anthony Goodwin, a man of color, was allowed
                    $1.50 for janitor work in the court house. On March 5, 1824, mention
                    is made of help rendered to Richard, a man of color, under the Poor Act. Mention
                    is made of these instances because of the prevalence of negroes, especially
                    mulattoes, in the county in its earlier days. Columbus Ewing says they were the
                    best laborers to be had. He also describes the practice of roping negroes as
                    carried on at his father's store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vallonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They usually came for something to eat and were immediately roped
                    and handcuffed. If any reward was offered for them at the post office, they were
                    held for it.</p>
            <p>Turning now to the county finances, on Thursday, September 19, 1816, the first
                    rate of taxation was laid down as follows: <table>

            <p>It is interesting to note that each horse was rated as high as 100 acres of first
                    rate land. On January 17, 1817, Sheriff Kitchell reported that all the taxes,
                    after deducting delinquents and the per centum for collecting, were
                    $228.93½. County orders were taken up, and wolf scalps
                    paid for amounting to $158.21, leaving a balance of
                    $70.72½.</p>
            <p>A new tax rate was levied on May 12, 1817, which is worthy of comparison with
                    that of September 19, 1816. It is as follows: <table>

               </table> Wolf scalps were paid for at the rate of $1.00 each. The
                    report of A. C. Craig, county treasurer was made November 10, 1817. The amount
                    received was $445.09¾. The amount paid out was
                    $431.50¾, leaving a balance of $13.59. A

                    1817, shows that the receipts and expenditures during the year had nearly
                    doubled. In the tax levy of May 11, 1818 some changes are worth noting. Third
                    rate land had risen to 31 ¼ cts. per 100 acres. Town lots were
                    assessed 50 cts. on the $100.00. In 1821 were further changes. The
                    collector was ordered to collect a poll tax of 50 cts. on all male persons over
                    twenty-one years of age, 371/2 cts. on all horses, mules, or asses; 50 cts. on
                    gold watches; 25 cts. on silver watches; what the law directs on pleasure
                    carriages; 25 cts. on each head of work oxen; $5.00 on all ferriages
                    except that of Stephen Sparks' and $7.50 on that. On March
                    14, 1822, the tax subject to collection for county purposes on all lands was
                    ordered to be the amount of one third the State tax, and on other articles the
                    same as before.</p>
            <p>On May 3, 1825, the board of justices laid down the following rates of taxation

                    improvement of the ford and river hill.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The fact that the
                    purchaser was, within sixty days, to remove all parts of the bridge that

            <p>Thanks to the energy and foresight of a small but enthusiastic group of workers
                    in Indiana History, the documentary material for this field is fast becoming
                    accessible to students and writers. For two years, the Indiana Historical
                    Survey, under the direction of the State University, has diligently collected
                    and catalogued files of early Indiana newspapers, together with pamphlets and
                    other documents (some in manuscript form) bearing upon the history of the State.
                    In similar fashion, the State Archives Commission, with headquarters in the
                    Indiana State Library, has gathered from all parts of the State newspaper
                    collections and other documentary material of inestimable value to the
                    historian.</p>
            <p>Fortunate, indeed, for the project of that comprehensive history of the State
                    which is yet to be written, that these enterprises were put under way. For much
                    of this material, from neglect and misuse, was speedily passing beyond the reach
                    of human hands. Anyone who has delved into the uncatalogued records of a
                    community's history knows how relentlessly they are destroyed by the
                    ravages of time. As a people we of. the State of Indiana, are notoriously prone
                    to neglect the preservation of such records. Indeed, we have not hitherto
                    learned to cherish our traditions or to place high store upon the past. Almost
                    until the present generation, the Hoosier stock have been too deeply engrossed
                    with their material tasks to have either the leisure or the inclination to dwell
                    upon the achievements of previous generations of Indiana people. In the early
                    days, the titanic labor involved in draining the swamps, transforming the
                    forests into arable fields, constructing bridges and highways, quite absorbed
                    the restless energies of our people. Later the work of building the gigantic
                    forges and factories of industry has kept our minds in tense concentration upon
                    present problems. But as we near the century- mark, we are rapidly passing from
                    a purely agricultural order to one that is largely industrial. Wealth is
                    accumulating and with it have come that leisure and scholarly activity which are
                    essential to a full appreciation of the record of achievement of former days.</p>
            <p>And it is a record of which the native stock may well be proud. Admirers have
                    long been accustomed to sing the praises of Indiana's line of literary
                    workers. No less a source of pride and satisfaction <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-010-3-044"/> to the native Hoosier is the long and illustrious
                    array of warriors, statesmen, jurists, artists, and builders in education, who
                    have brought renown to the State since its foundation. The results attained from
                    early days in programs of social regeneration, in constructive statesmanship, in
                    educational experiment and pioneering, have been such as to induce older States
                    to study and copy.</p>
            <p>We are at last awakening to a sense of values in the study of the history of the
                    State. Although but three generations removed from the original pioneer stock,
                    we derive our knowledge of its characteristics almdst wholly from family
                    tradition. Anything like a connected and philosophical view of the development
                    of the commonwealth, a survey such as will reveal the stages of an evolving
                    social order, is wholly wanting. As for our children, their experiences, their
                    instruction, and their daily tasks are remote from the struggles and contests of
                    the early days of the fathers. Year in and year out, the youth of the State are
                    diligently instructed in the history of the nation, and properly so, but they
                    are left in almost total ignorance of the rich current of State history which is
                    sweeping past them. All the phases of social and industrial transformation, of
                    political and religious change, w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>hich appear in the
                    nation's history, may in the history of the State be seen in nearer
                    perspective, in clearer outline, and with more vivid reality. Indiana, as the
                    nation, has passed through the principal stages of social and industrial
                    development. Here are seen the successive frontiers of the Indian trader, the
                    ranchman, the farmer, and at last the manufacturer comes to add the capstone of
                    material comfort. On the political side, Indiana has had her colonial period;
                    her epoch of constitution-making; her time of internal growth, wherein questions
                    of public improvements, of banking, public lands, and Indian affairs, were
                    uppermost; she has had her struggle for and against slavery; her part in the
                    Civil War was most noteworthy. In stately pageantry, all the great movements of
                    the nation's life pass across the page of the State's history.</p>
            <p>To bring youthful minds into lasting touch with the historical drama of the past
                    of their State, there has wisely been planned a systematic course in Indiana
                    History for the schools. This has been incorporated in the State course of
                    study, not as a new and separate study, but one to be closely linked with
                    American History. The course is designed to continue through the grades and the
                    high school.</p>
            <p>For the teacher the problem is one of supply. "Where can I find material
                    for teaching Indiana History?" is the query which involuntarily <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-010-3-045"/> arises. A well-constructed textbooks in
                    State history, adapted to children of the grammar grades, is lacking. An
                    authentic and scientific history of Indiana, covering the period of statehood,
                    is yet to be written. Two or three books of children's stories, such as
                    the charmingly written <hi rend="i">Stories of Indiana</hi>, by Maurice
                    Thompson, and the literary product of Mrs. Levering, entitled <hi rend="i">Historic Indiana</hi>, constitute the sum total of available material for
                    teaching purposes. It was with a view of placing in the hands of teachers and
                    pupils a book of readable and first hand selections which may serve to bring out
                    strongly the salient facts in the history of the State, that a committee
                    recently chosen by the State History Teachers' Section, has undertaken
                    to compile such a book.</p>
            <p>The title of the book, which bears the imprint of Indiana University, is <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History.</hi> Four well-marked
                    "periods of State history appear in the grouping of the selections.
                    First comes the period, extending from 1765 to 1816, in which Indiana was still
                    an Indian country. The readings here chosen bring out the facts of Indian
                    occupation, of French trading posts, of the conquest for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> by Captain Clark, of the increased tension in the relations of
                    Indians and white settlers, and of the final outburst of war which culminated in
                    the destruction of the Indian power. Next, the period from 1816 to about 1836 is
                    called "Pioneer Indiana." In it the selections are such as to
                    bring out the aspects of pioneer life and the conquest of the wilderness. Then a
                    third period, covering the years from 1836 to 1844, is shown to be one of
                    internal growth. Questions, of internal improvement, of banking, and of
                    political organization hold sway and are illustrated by a series of carefully
                    selected readings. Finally the fourth period, from about 1844 to the years
                    following the Civil War is known as "Overshadowing National
                    Questions." Here the readings show the slavery struggle in the State,
                    its part in the great Civil War, and the treatment of the negro in Indiana
                    before and after freedom was attained.</p>
            <p>Something near one hundred and fifty selections, extracts from letters, journals-
                    narratives, newspaper accounts, written by participants and eye-witnesses,
                    compose the matter of the book. The selections were chosen primarily for their
                    inherent interest for children as well as for their type characteristics. The
                    style is in every case attractive and vigorous. The language of the selections
                    is that rare combination of literary English and practical colloquialism for
                    which the Hoosier is justly famed. The selections are grouped and woven into a
                    connected whole by means of introductory notes and comments written by the
                    editorial committee. A well- <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-010-3-046"/> written
                    historical introduction to the book, and other introductions to the periods,
                    serve well to give the historic setting and background. -A. detailed outline for
                    lesson assignments aids in making the book serviceable.</p>
            <p>Innumerable ways to use the book will suggest themselves to the skillful teacher.
                    Here is fresh material for daily reading and for composition lessons. The travel
                    and hunting tales, new and interesting, full of local life and color, suggest a
                    practicable basis for oral composition. And the geography lesson, in so far as
                    it may touch upon the State, finds abundant illustrative matter in the accounts
                    of early travellers. But it is as a source for the history lesson that we are
                    chiefly concerned. Occasionally the selections, such as those bearing upon the
                    slavery controversy, will furnish valuable sidelights upon the lessons in
                    American History. However, in the grammar grades, a definite period, on
                    designated days, should be allotted to the study of Indiana history. Time may be
                    found for this work by giving relatively less emphasis to certain less valuable
                    portions of American History. The problems which confronted the early settlers
                    in Indiana, the surmounting of physical obstacles in the conquest of the forest,
                    the dangers encountered in dealing with a savage foe, all furnish stimulating
                    exercises for the constructive abilities of children. Let the boys and girls
                    settle the question, in given situations, of how and why a certain course should
                    be pursued. Have them discover the advantages of canals over turnpikes and of
                    railroads over canals. Let the children find out why the people in certain parts
                    of the State were strongly pro-slavery and why those in other parts were equally
                    opposed to slavery.</p>
            <p>In Indiana history we have a subject close to the interests of children. They
                    will enter with enthusiasm into the stories of settlement and of Indian
                    captures. Often they will enrich the material at hand by bringing in their own
                    family traditions of similar adventures. The subjects should always be made
                    concrete and tangible. Encourage the making of models by the children. Most boys
                    can readily be interested in the work of constructing a Cones-toga wagon or a
                    "river ark." For small children, pictures and sketches are
                    essential. Crude drawings often serve the purpose of elaborating the
                    construction of an Indian canoe or a settler's cabin. A map should
                    often be made to show a wilderness trail, the State system of canals, the first
                    railway, or the three Indiana capitals. A story should never be left until its
                    exact locality is fixed and described. In this way the boys and girls will come
                    to know their State quite as intimately as they know their local community.</p>
            <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-010-3-047"/>
            <p>It is believed that a substantial contribution to the better understanding of the
                    State's history and her part in the national development has been made
                    by the preparation of this book. A some-Avhat pretentious volume it is, of about
                    500 pages of matter. But through the generosity of the State University, in
                    keeping with its ideal of public service, the book has been placed upon the
                    market at a nominal price, intended merely to cover the cost of publication. The
                    book may be ordered direct from the University Bookstore.</p>

            <p rend="center">CHAPTER III. SICKNESS AND PHYSICIANS</p>
            <p rend="center">PREVALENCE OF SICKNESS</p>
            <p>In novels and stories the western pioneer is pictured as a big rough, hardy man
                    with unbounded energy and intoxicating health. This picture is largely a
                    romantic one. The woods of Indiana were not settled without much sickness, many
                    deaths, and great suffering. The pioneers had to contend against invisible, as
                    well as visible foes, and, of the two, the former were the most deadly. No part
                    of America, outside of the tropics, was more subject to malarial visitation than
                    the rich flat lands in Indiana. The very fertility of the soil made it
                    miasmatic. Vast, dense forests, in whose shade immense <unclear/>umulation of
                    leaves, fallen timber, and other vegetable matter lay rotting from year to year,
                    and the innumerable streams and ponds of stagnant water, exhaled poisonous gases
                    which contributed toward disease. Exposure to the weather, also, was another
                    factor that made for sickness. For many years in the autumn season there were
                    more sick people than well ones. Occasionally whole towns were (depopulated. In
                    the southern border counties during the years 1820-1822 sickness was especially
                    prevalent. So alarming was the mortality that the General Assembly of the State
                    set apart a day for public prayer and supplication to the Almighty God, that he
                    might bless the country with fruitful seasons and bring health and peace to the
                    unhappy citizens. In 1821 an epidemic of fevers broke out and continued from
                    July to October during which time nearly every person was sick in some degree,
                    and about one eight of the population died. One third of the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> at one time were confined to their beds with sickness. The whole
                    Wabash country was especially afflicted, and the southern counties were never
                    free from fevers.</p>
            <p rend="center">HARD LOT OF THE SICK</p>
            <p>Medical aid was hard to secure. In the beginning there were few doctors, and the
                    settlers lived so far apart that it was almost impossible for a physician to get
                    around in times of heavy sickness. More <list type="footnotes">

                    On the whole the distress of the families during epidemics of fever was
                    pitiable. Often there were not enough well people to care for the sick.
                    Provisions gave out and it was difficult for the sick people to obtain food. A

                    nearly everyone would be down at the same time, not one to help the other when
                    the ague was on. Our provisions gave out and it was sixty or seventy miles to
                    the settlement. Conner had a little corn which he sold at a dollar a bushel.
                    This they had to pound in a mortar, sift out the finest of it for bread, and
                    boil die coarser of it and eat it with milk. They called it samp. O how tired I
                    got of such fare: but no help for it. They would pound the corn after the ague
                    went off and the fever subsided a little.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p rend="center">AGUE AND FEVER</p>
            <p>One of the greatest obstacles to the early settlement of Indiana was chills and
                    fever. The story of suffering from ague forms a pathetic part of the history of
                    pioneer life. To newcomers, it was a veritable terror, and, in the fall,
                    everybody looked pale and sallow,-the disease being no respecter of persons. It
                    developed, as we have stated, from the impurities of stagnant pools and streams.
                    From the first of August to the first of October in each year no serious labor
                    was undertaken. Sickness reigned supreme. At any gathering half the members wore
                    yellow faces, and moved about with heavy lassitude. The sickness began with a
                    chill of rather indefinite duration, followed by a burning fever, which lasted
                    for hours. Sometimes the attack came every day, but generally on alternate days.
                    Frequently the paroxysms of shaking were so violent that the bed upon which the
                    sick person lay would creak and rattle. But the exigencies of pioneer life would
                    not permit the ague-stricken man or women to give up work altogether. Sometimes
                    a plowman Trudged after his plow with a burning fever, while his poor wife,
                    equally afflicted, drugded at the household work, or ministered to her sickly
                    children. The following story illustrates the effect of the ague: A man was
                    passing through a forest hunting for a stray cow and calf when he came upon a
                    neighbor sitting on a log with a rifle across his knees. "Hello, what
                    are you doing there, John?" he <list type="footnotes">

                    teeth rattling together and his whole frame quivering. "I 'm
                    waiting for my ague to go off, so I can hold my gun steady enough to shoot that
                    squirrel up there," he replied, pointing with a shaking finger at the
                    little animal crouching amid the top-most twigs of a tall oak. The cow-hunter
                    kindly took the gun and shot the squirrel for his neighbor.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p rend="center">DOCTORS AND METHODS OF TREATMENT</p>
            <p>With so much sickness the life of the old-time doctor was not an easy one. Poorly
                    trained and poorly equipped, it is wonderful that they accomplished anything. No
                    course of preparation was necessary, and no license was required before they
                    began to practice. Some of them were men of little character, and could be
                    classified only as quacks. Most practitioners received a little training in the
                    office of another physician; some relied on natural wit and experience alone,
                    and hung out a naming clapboard sign at the first opportunity. Quinine, calomel,
                    tartar-emetic, castor oil, salts, and jalap were standard remedies, and a large
                    lancet for bleeding was found in every medical case. With his saddle-bags full
                    of these, and a good hardy horse, the pioneer physician counted himself the
                    equal of the mightiest disease. Whiskey was a universal remedy for malaria and
                    did not need a doctor's prescription. It was considered the best
                    possible remedy for the bite of a poisonous snake. A person, when bitten, was
                    made to drink as quickly as possible large amounts of the fiery intoxicant. Our
                    early grandmothers were experts at gathering herbs, from which teas and bitters
                    were concocted. Not a few of these simple home made remedies possessed curative
                    virtues, too.</p>
            <p>Fever and chills brought the largest number of patients to the doctors. When this
                    disease was deepset the experienced ones knew that it was necessary to secure a
                    reaction. When the doctor came he labored to bring this about. Stimulants, such
                    as brandy, capsicum, and quinine, were given in large doses, and heavy
                    applications of mustard were made. There are instances where, within a period of
                    fourteen hours, one hundred grains of quinine and a quart of trandy were
                    administered before a reaction could be brought about. In other cases they bled
                    the unfortunate patient and then dosed him with large amounts of calomel. This
                    method killed quickly and cured slowly. But, after all, the doctors are not to
                    be despised for they did the best they knew, and their patients frequently got
                    -veil in spite of them. Doctors traveled long distances, watched <list type="footnotes">

                    sick, and suffered much real hardship. Not infrequently they themselves,
                    succumbed to prevalent diseases. At one time, in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, only two out of the five physicians were able to answer calls.
                    Their services were so much needed that they rode from place to place on a
                    gallop. Often they traveled not less than fifty miles a day.</p>
            <p>It was a time of quackery and quack medicines. Often in the sickly season all the
                    quinine in the shops was consumed. Then the settlers had no remedy except
                    boneset and gentian. The sick were ready to try anything that promised relief,
                    and pills with big high-sounding names, and guaranteed to cure a whole category
                    of diseases, found a ready sale. Empty medicine bottles could be seen hanging
                    from the walls of almost every cabin. There were quack doctors too. A certain
                    Dr. Burr came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and advertised himself as a "Root-Doctor." He
                    nailed up to the weatherboarding of his hotel an enormous swamp lily root,
                    almost as large as a man, with head, eyes, ears, and nose nicely carved. Arms
                    and legs were attached, and above it appeared the glaring sign, "Joseph
                    S. Burr, Root Doctor: No Calomel." People came from all parts of the
                    country to see the doctor and the big root, and he quickly established a
                    lucrative practice. He granted diplomas to students upon the completion of a
                    three week's course of study. As a result the county was soon filled
                    with root doctors. One of his graduates was a constable who was barely able to
                    write his name. With his quack diploma he went to the "New
                    Purchase" and put out his shingle. Upon being asked one day how his
                    patients were, he replied, "Only tolerable; I lost nine fine patients
                    last week, one of them an old lady that I wanted to cure badly, but she died in
                    spite of all I could do. I tried every root I could find, but still she grew
                    worse, and there being nobody here to detect my practice, like the other regular
                    doctors. I concluded to try calamus, and dug up a root about nine inches long
                    and made tea out of it. She drank it with some difficulty, turned over in bed
                    and died. Still I don't think i t was the calamus that killed her, as
                    all the calamus doctors are giving it in heavier doses than I did."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Such was his ignorance that he did not know the difference
                    between calomel and calamus, and yet he got patients. Another kind of quack was
                    the "steam doctor."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He was not a man of
                    much learning, and often not reasonably intelligent. His pills were made of
                    walnut bark, and he carried around with him a rude apparatus for steaming his
                    ague stricken patients.</p>

            <p>One of the worst diseases with which the settlers had to contend was the
                    milk-sickness. It was peculiar to the new country, and to this day remains very
                    largely a mystery. Both people and cattle were subject to it. Whole families
                    were prostrated from using the milk of a single cow. Death usually came within
                    ten days after the attack began, or the victim gradually convalesced. Although
                    doctors disagree as to its cause, there can be no denial of its prevalence in
                    early times. With the increased cultivation of the fields and the substitution
                    of cultivated grains and pasturage for the wild herbage upon which cattle fed
                    for a large part of the year, it gradually disappeared. It destroyed the value
                    of lands in neighborhoods that were known to be afflicted with it. Indeed some
                    of the finest tracts of land in Indiana were unoccupied on account of springs
                    which were said to cause milk-sickness.</p>
            <p>The State suffered to some extent also from the Asiatic cholera.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In 1833 it first appeared on the <placeName>

                    summers of 1849 and 1854 it swept over the country. Almost every town and

                        charms.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> They sold their warts, and they carried
                    buckeyes or potatoes in their pockets to keep off the rheumatism. If a teamster
                    cut himself, he smeared the axe or knife with tar from the spindle of the wagon.
                    Asafoetida, catnip, southernwood, chamomile, and certain other herbs were
                    supposed to ward off disease if worn about the person. To cure epilepsy, they
                    split the body of a standing shellbark hickory, wedged it far apart and passed
                    the body of the patient three times through the opening, after which
                    performance, the wedges were knocked out. If the parts grew together. a cure was
                    assured. To a large extent those old superstitions survive today among the

                    for worship and called ministers of the gospel.</p>
            <p rend="center">EARLY CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES</p>
            <p>In 1769 La Salle came to explore the great west. From his alleged voyage down the "<placeName>

                    </placeName> and his exploration in the northern part of the State he may, in
                    truth, be called the discoverer of Indiana. The routes which he marked out were
                    followed by succeeding voyagers, traders and hunters. With these men, sometimes
                    preceding them, came the Catholic missionaries to spread the Christian gospel to
                    the benighted redmen. With a crucifix as their weapon, the Jesuit fathers
                    penetrated the forests, bringing some degree of civilization and religion to the
                    savages, and preserving the spark of religion in the hearts of their countrymen.
                    With the advent of permanent occupation, and the establishment of military
                    posts, the priests played a prominent role. In the midst of each settlement
                    stood the little log chapel with its rude, cross pointing heavenward, the only
                    reminder of civilization in the great wild forests.</p>
            <p>These early missionaries did a great work. Out of pure zeal for the faith they
                    left comfort and ease in the old world to labor among heathens in the new, where
                    they suffered hardships of every descriptions and often met death itself. A
                    beautiful legend has grown up about the work of the early priests, but at heart
                    of it all there was a heroism, courage, and faith such as is seldom displayed in
                    the history of Christian missions. Their work among the Indians will always be
                    remembered. Gently and kindly they led these simple people to some degree of
                    knowledge of the true God. It was The policy of the French, for the purpose of
                    trade, to encourage the natives to settle around the military posts. Here they
                    came under the influence of the church. They learned a little agriculture and
                    other simple arts; they were led to give up barbarous customs and habits; and
                    they were taught to dress and to live in some degree like a white man. This task
                    was hard enough indeed but it was rendered all the more difficult by the French
                    traders who debauched the artless Indian with fiery liquors for the sake of
                    paltry profits.</p>
            <p rend="center">EARLY PROTESTANT PREACHERS</p>
            <p>The Anglo-Saxon soon followed the Frenchman, and the Protestant ministers were
                    not far behind the Catholic missionary.</p>
            <p>In their cabins, or, in the summer, under the great forest trees, the early
                    settlers gathered for worship, clad in their buckskin or <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-010-3-054"/> coarse homespun clothes. At first there were no
                    resident pastors, but itinerant preachers came long distances on horseback to
                    minister TO the scattered settlements.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> These traveling
                    preachers represented all denominations, and visited in rotation within their
                    individual circuits every settlement and village. In an early community the
                    "appointment" for preaching was regarded as a gala day. It is
                    needless to say that all the pews were full. It was not necessary to advertise
                    for a congregation as some churches are compelled to do today. The Methodists
                    were especially active. Their system carried their churches into nearly every
                    settlement, and wherever two or three were gathered together, there one would
                    find a Methodist preacher or exhorter in their midst.</p>
            <p>The early itinerant preacher was an earnest man. His faith and zeal was no less
                    extraordinary than that of the Catholic fathers, and the hardships and dangers
                    he suffered were no less extraordinary. He went armed, perpared to defend
                    himself against man and beast. As vehicles of any kind were out of order, he
                    traveled on horseback. On his saddle he had a pair of saddle bags, in one side
                    of which was his clothing, in the other his food. Crosswise on the pommel he
                    bore his long rifle, while strapped to the rear of the saddle was a comfortable
                    blanket. Often when night overtook him, he wrapped himself in this blanket and
                    slept on the bare ground, his trusty horse grazing nearby till morning. At his
                    side hung a coonskin pouch containing ammunition, a good supply of punk, flints,
                    and a piece of steel with which to strike a fire. Thus equipped, he rode from
                    settlement to settlement, visiting the lowly cabins to which he brought the
                    gospel and good cheer. It is said that Reverent Francis Asbury in his ministry
                    rode a distance that would have taken him twelve times around the world. The
                    following quotation gives us a picture of an early itinerant: Lest you might
                    think there was danger of us becoming semi-barbarous in this wild region, I will
                    here state that we have circuit preaching every four weeks, by old father
                    Emmett, a veteran minister of the Methodist denomination, who has been a
                    faithful watchman on the walls of Zion for more than forty years. He is beloved
                    by all who know him–old and young, saint and sinner. His preaching is
                    of the plain, practical, but effective kind that reaches the hearts of his
                    hearers. He has three preaching places within reach of us, viz: at John
                    Simpson's, Kepner's Schoolhouse above the forks of Coal creek,

            <p>The trials and privations of the early pioneer preachers were almost beyond
                    belief. Most of them cleared their own farms and raised crops for the support of
                    their families. Along with this they ministered to the scattered congregations.
                    In early pioneer times a man who did not labor with his hands was held in scorn.
                    "While they were off on a long itinerary, their families were left
                    alone to face dangers from sickness, wild beasts, and savages.</p>
            <p>Sermons were long and tedious, discourses two or three hours long being the
                        rule.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Written sermons were not tolerated on the
                    frontier. The minister must speak extemporaneously and show his fire and zeal
                    chiefly on doctrinal and controversial points. These earnest men often preached
                    until they were exhausted and fell back into the arms of a brother. Frequently
                    religious debates were held where such questions as elections vs free grace,
                    immersion vs sprinkling, and many others were hotly disputed. The Bible was
                    interpreted liberally, and the people were very emotional.</p>
            <p>In many neighborhoods the settlers were not able to build a church for each
                    denomination, so union churches were built, in which the various sects held
                    service on alternate Sundays. In such communities services were held invariably
                    once a month. The minister always had a large congregation. The pioneers longed
                    naturally for companionship and turned out in large numbers. It was a fine sight
                    to see people flocking into the meeting house from every direction for eight or
                    ten miles around. Some families came in ox carts, some came in wagons drawn by
                    horse, and others on foot. Young ladies frequently walked a mile or two to
                    church carrying their shoes and stockings in their hands until within a hundred
                    yards of the place of worship.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> There were no musical
                    instruments, and usually there was no choir, the singing being entirely
                    congregational. More than one church was divided later by the introduction of an
                    organ. As there were few hymn books, the preacher "lined off"
                    the hymn which all sang with loud enthusiasm.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The sexes
                    were seated on opposite sides of the house. Services began by reading a chapter
                    from the Bible, followed by a prayer. The hymn was then "lined
                    off" by the minister, and a person, somewhat acquainted with music led
                    the singing, in which all the congregation joined. In later days the parts, bass
                    and treble, were carried in the song, for by that time the singing school had
                    become an established institution and the ringing master was a well-known
                    character. Then came <list type="footnotes">

                    which lasted an hour and sometimes longer. During the whole service there was
                    utmost decorum.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> There was no chatting aloud or in an
                    undertone, and whispering was considered such a breach of church manners that it
                    seldom occurred. The audience listened to the service with special interest. The
                    services were characterized by extreme simplicity. There were no flowers on the
                    preacher's stand, none on his person, and they were seldom worn by any
                    of the congregation. This was not due to any lack of respect or regard, but
                    rather to an excessive reverence for the sacredness of the time and place. At
                    the close of the sermon another hymn was sung, followed by a brief prayer or
                    benediction. As soon as the meeting was over the people crowded around the
                    minister to exchange greetings. They talked of the discourse continually on
                    their way home. In fact the sermon became the theme of conversation in the
                    neighborhood for many days. The minister's salary was very low. For
                    sixteen years the average salary of a typical Presbyterian preacher was only
                    eighty dollars, including money and gifts.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> To support his
                    family he farmed on a small scale, taught singing classes, wrote deeds, wills,
                    and advertisements, taught school, and then mended his neighbor's
                    shoes. Most preachers relied largely on their own little farms, and preached out
                    of pure love of the work. With all his limitations the pioneer preacher had a
                    remarkable influence. Being in many cases a man of decided learning, for
                    that' day, he was the "most considerable" man in the
                    community, and was sure of a warm welcome and a good chicken dinner. To him the
                    people appealed as arbiter of their disputes; to him the conscience-stricken
                    went for relief and guidance. To a much greater degree, than at present,
                    ministers tiien shaped the destiny of the State.</p>

                    a hymn, in the singing of which all joined. Then he closed the simple service
                    with a fervent prayer. When a pious guest was present he was asked to lead in
                    the exercises. The prayers especially were very wild and fervent. Indeed a man
                    who did not pray in this manner at home, and in public, was considered <list type="footnotes">

                    was no church in the neighborhood, the monthly services were held at a
                    settler's home. A double log cabin, inhabited by one of the more
                    prosperous members of the community was usually selected. The congregation
                    assembled at the appointed time. The preacher, before whom was placed a small
                    stand on which lay his Bible and prayer book, took a place in the middle of the
                    entry. The women sat in the rooms on the one side of this entry, the windows and
                    doors being open, and the men in the same way on the other side. The children
                    sat together just in front of the minister, but one or two older persons sat
                    with them as monitors. In simple improvised chapels of this kind, sermons have
                    been preached and prayers prayed that have lingered in the memory of the
                    congregation for a lifetime. In those days, religious subjects predominated in
                    ordinary social intercourse. With the pioneer, religion was a real, vital thing
                    to be applied to the daily walks of life to govern the conduct of men. They gave
                    a literal interpretation to the commandments. Sunday was strictly observed. No
                    work, except the most necessary, no hunting, sport, or play took place in the
                    more Puritanic neighborhoods. Occasionally wheat or hay was harvested on the
                    Sabbath, but only when the crop was in peril. When the last day of the year fell
                    upon Sunday, it was called "Long Sunday" and worship and
                    prayer lasted until midnight.</p>
            <p rend="center">CHURCH BUILDINGS</p>
            <p>Church arch tecture was as simple as the worship. Most of the meeting-houses were
                    constructed of logs with a heavy clapboard roof. No belfry was built, as a bell
                    would have been out of the question. Le later days frame churches with belfry
                    and bell were built. There were also stone and brick structures. An early

                    has a commodious gallery, supported by massive hewn pillars; and in the center
                    of the church was a stone hearth upon which charcoal was burned in cold
                    weather–for stoves were not common in the west in that early day.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    by its social features. In summer, after the harvest season, families of the
                    same faith gathered from far and near, traveling on horseback or in covered
                    wagons, sometimes from a distance of forty or fifty miles. The camp-ground was
                    usually located near a creek or river in the shade of a deep woods. The people
                    lived in rough cabins or tents. Some lodged and slept in their wagons. The
                    horses and wagons were arranged roughly in the shape of a horseshoe, at the open
                    end of which stood the preacher's stand. Before this, was the
                    mourner's bench, which was surrounded by a vacant enclosure about
                    thirty feet square. The space beyond this, to the line of the wagons, was filled
                    with seats made of logs and rough planks. Sometimes a rail fence separated the
                    male from the female portion of the congregation. At night the camp was lighted
                    by lanterns or by blazing logs. In a letter, Flint describes the scene thus:
                    "Large fires of timber were kindled, which glast a new luster on every
                    object. The white tents gleamed in the glare. Over them the dusky woods formed a
                    most romantic gloom, only the tall trunks of the. front rank were distinctly
                    visible, and these seemed so many members of a lofty colonnade.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The leading event of the day was the sermon at eleven o'clock, a more or
                    less formal discourse. In the afternoon a less formal service was held, and in
                    the evening a short discourse was preached followed by prayers and exhortation.
                    The mourners or "seekers" gathered around the
                    preacher's stand in the vacant enclosure. The stillness of the night
                    and the powerful, vivid, exhortations to prayer and repentance produced
                    memorable sensations. Great numbers "fell under the power of the
                    word," becoming unconscious, and remaining in that condition for hours.
                    To prevent others from treading on them they were collected in one place and
                    laid out in order, where they were cared for and prayed over by anxious friends.
                    Sometimes as many as three thousand fell into these ecstatic trances at one
                    meeting. There was much handshaking and giving of testimony. At large meetings
                    the number of worshippers was so great that it became necessary to divide them
                    into groups, to each of which an exhorter was assigned. Prayers, exhortations,
                    hymns, and the cries of the penitent arose from all parts of the ground. Flint
                    gives the following picture: "About dusk I retired several hundred
                    yards into the woods to enjoy the distant effect of the meeting. Female voices
                    were mournfully predominant, and my imagination figured <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Sinners led a hard life of it. Sometimes they were even forcibly converted. In a
                    camp meeting in 1820 a woman who had just been converted, was dragged away from
                    the altar by her unregenerate husband, who threatened vengeance on anyone who
                    would interfere. The minister took the man in hand, but seeing that persuasion
                    and arguments were of no avail, he seized the fellow, forced him to his knees,
                    and then flat on his face. Seating himself on the back of the victim, the
                    minister refused to let him up until the man would pray. The only response was a
                    chorus of oaths. But the wife and others prayed fervently, and finally the
                    minister joined in. As he prayed he felt the man's muscles relax. Soon
                    the poor fellow began to weep and cry out, "God be merciful to me a
                    sinner!" and at last the shout of victory came.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>These meetings, which always lasted a week or more, usually closed at midnight.
                    The woods rang with old familar hymns, and when the echoes resounded among the
                    distant trees one almost thought he was listening to a choir invisible. In the
                    morning the wagons were packed again, goodbyes said, and the worshippers slowly
                    departed for their homes.</p>
            <p rend="center">DENOMINATIONS</p>
            <p>Methodists and Baptists are predominantly identified with the early religious
                    life. Their ministers were largely of the itinerant class. The Disciples of
                    Christ founded by Alexander Campbell gained a strong foothold at a later period.
                    Quakers were especially numerous in the southeastern part of the State. Through
                    the large number of teachers which this sect furnished, its influence has been
                    widely extended. The Presbyterians, from the first, maintained an educated
                    ministry and located their churches in the towns instead of in the country. With
                    a large number of educated members they had little sensationalism in their
                    services and held to a rigorous theology. - They founded numerous schools, some
                    of which still exist and whose influence was very potent in shaping the
                    destinies of the new State.</p>

            <p rend="center">EDUCATION UNDER THE FRENCH</p>
            <p>The early French settlers cared little for education. The only instruction they
                    received was given by the missionary priests who labored diligently to prevent
                    the happy-go-lucky soldiers, traders, and trappers, who were naturally indolent
                    and careless, from forgetting the principles of their religion. In later years,
                    resident priests attempted to teach the children to read and write, but the
                    frontier Frenchman was as much averse to mental effort as to physical toil. They
                    had no education as we understand the term. All that they knew was handed down
                    from father to son. "What was perhaps the first regular school in
                    Indiana was established at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1793 by a priest named Bivet. So there was no school in the
                    territory until it came into American possession.</p>
            <p rend="center">INTEREST OF INDIANA IN EDUCATION</p>
            <p>Americans have always believed in education. The Ordinance of 1787 made provision
                    for the training of future citizens in the Northwest, and, from the very first
                    organization of Indiana, the people have had a deep interest in the education of
                    the coming generations. In one form or another the educational question has been
                    before every General Assembly from territorial days to the present time.
                    Succeeding Assemblies have been asked to aid in the establishment of schools, or
                    to grant special privileges for the building of academies and seminaries in the
                    various parts of the State. The General Assembly of 1821 appointed a committee
                    for the purpose of drafting a bill providing for a general system of education.
                    The conception of education as a public duty is evidenced by the fact that the
                    committee was instructed to guard well against any distinction between rich and
                    poor. The report of the committee was incorporated in the first general school
                    law of Indiana.</p>
            <p rend="center">HOME SCHOOLS</p>
            <p>Schools between 1805 and 1815 were very primitive. -The country was sparsely
                    settled; in fact half a dozen pioneers, located two or three miles apart, at
                    that time, formed a large settlement. Consequently the children were taught the
                    rudiments of learning at nome.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> There was usually someone
                    in the family capable of teaching <list type="footnotes">

                    simple elements of arithmetic. Even in later times, on account of the great
                    distance from the schoolhouse and danger from wild animals, children were
                    frequently taught at home. This home instruction was not altogether inefficient.
                    Twice a week in the afternoon the mother, usually, gathered the children around
                    her and taught them to read, write, and cipher as far as division. They worked
                    with goosequill pens and ink made from walnut hulls. Those who were old enough,
                    read in turn from some book taken from the family collection. On Sunday they
                    read in the same manner from the Bible, the stories of which were simply
                    explained by the mother. Sometimes children from a neighbor's home
                    would join the family Bible class.</p>
            <p>In these times of danger it was also the custom to employ an instructor to go
                    from house to house in the settlement. This circulating teacher spent one-third
                    of a day with each family giving instructions in the rudiments of education; in
                    this way with six families he could give three lessons a week to all the
                    children. When it became less dangerous for the children to pass through the
                    forest, they assembled at the home of the family most centrally located, where
                    they were taught in a lean-to built at the side or end of the cabin. A mother or
                    elder sister gave a little simple training, in reading, writing, and ciphering.</p>
            <p rend="center">A PIONEER SCHOOLHOUSE</p>
            <p>As soon as conditions were favorable the pioneers of the neighborhood constructed
                    a rude cabin schoolhouse, a structure, which at this date, would be a curiosity
                        indeed.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> There was no school revenue to be distributed,
                    so each voter himself had to play the part of the builder. The neighbors divided
                    themselves into choppers, hewers, carpenters, and masons. Those who found it
                    impossible to report for duty might pay an equivalent in nails, boards, or other
                    materials. The man who neither worked nor paid was fined thirty-seven and
                    one-half cents a day. A site most convenient to all the settlers was selected,
                    near a living spring if possible. Old- settlers still joyfully remember the cool
                    sparkling waters and the long-handled gourd. Logs were cut and hauled to the
                    site and a rough rectangular pen, usually sixteen feet wide by eighteen feet
                    long, was erected. A roof made of four-foot boards, held in place by weight
                    poles, tied with strong hickory withes to the ridge poles, covered the
                    structure. The only openings were a door and window about two- thirds <list type="footnotes">

                    the building. Greased paper pasted upon slats covered the opening, which gave
                    light to the room. If the school lasted into the fall and winter months, the
                    openings between the logs were chinked and daubed with clay mortar. In 1he other
                    end of the room a large fireplace was constructed. In later days, however,
                    stoves were used. The room was filled with dirt, to a depth equal to half the
                    thickness of the first side logs. After being well packed, the surface was
                    covered with a thick clay nortar, which was evenly smoothed down to make an
                    acceptable floor. Other school buildings had puncheon floors.</p>
            <p>Under the one window a thinly hewed puncheon, resting on wooden pins driven into
                    the log below, served as a writing desk. Seats were constructed of rough slabs
                    which were hewn to remove the splinters. "When this was imperfectly
                    done, the bad workmanship was unmistakably reflected on the seats of the
                    boy's pantaloons. Sanford Cox briefly describes a pioneer
                    schoolhouse:" The school-house was generally a log cabin with a
                    puncheon floor, stick-and-clay-chimney, and a part of two logs chopped away on
                    each side of the house for windows, over which greased newspaper or foolscap was
                    pasted to admit the light and keep out the cold. The house was generally
                    furnished with one split-bottom chair for the teacher, and rude benches made out
                    of slabs for the pupils to sit on, so arranged as to get the benefit of the huge
                    log fire in the winter time, and the light from the windows. To these add a
                    broom, water bucket, and tincups or gourd, and the furniture list will be
                        complete."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> While the early schoolhouses were
                    usually rectangular in shape, this was not always true. A five-cornered building
                    was erected in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hancock county</region>

            <p>Not all early schoolhouses measured up to the description just given. In parts of
                    the State it is said schoolhouses were constructed with portholes for shooting
                    at the Indians. Schoolmasters may have even gone armed to their work. The first

                    educational purposes. The fire was built on a raised clay platform in the
                    middle, the smoke escaping through an opening in the roof. This same opening
                    furnished light for study. Another school in the same county had no windows at
                    all, light entering through the open door and the throat of the large chimney.
                    So far as light is concerned, greased paper marks a later stage of window
                    construction.</p>
            <p rend="center">EARLY TEACHERS</p>
            <p>In many cases the pioneer teachers were men of families and had been educated in
                    eastern schools. Being instructors of real merit, they left a lasting impression
                    upon the communities in which they labored. Another class, hailing also from the
                    east, or from <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>

                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, were adventurers, who sought temporary employment in the winter,
                    while awaiting an opening for business.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The Southern
                    States and Pennsylvania also furnished their quota of pedagogues. The chief
                    drawback of the pioneer school was the want of competent teachers. In his
                    message to the State General Assembly in 1833, Governor Noble said:
                    "The want of competent teachers to instruct in the township school is a
                    cause of complaint in many sections of the State, and it is to be regretted that
                    in employing transient persons from other States, containing but little
                    qualification, or moral character, the profession is not held in that repute it
                    should be." In the early times there was a certain lack of respect for
                    the vocation of teaching, due to the fact that the teacher did not work with his
                    hands. Lawyers, ministers, and even doctors suffered in this respect. Frequently
                    they volunteered to show their mettle by acts of manual labor in order to
                    receive favor at the hands of the people.</p>
            <p>According to the law of 1824, every school district had three trustees, who were
                    empowered to examine teachers in reading, writing, and arithmetic. This feature
                    of local certification was continued up to the adoption of the new constitution
                    in 1852. Scarcely one in a hundred was fit to conduct a school, some of them
                    could neither read nor write, and yet they examined the candidates for <list type="footnotes">

                    illiteracy of the examiners, the candidate 's handwriting, which could
                    be seen by the uneducated and judged without comment, came to be the chief
                    accomplishment. A man who could write a full, round, smooth hand was considered
                    fully qualified to instruct in the district schools. Ex-Senator Turpie gives the
                    following interesting account of his experience in securing a certificate:
                    "I applied to the trustees of the district for a license to teach.
                    Under the statute then in force, there was a board of trustees who had charge of
                    the educational affairs, within their jurisdiction, and the chairman of the
                    board, upon application, called a meeting of the members and appointed a day for
                    the examination. When we met, the trustees asked me questions for an hour. These
                    were answered promptly and plainly; they were well pleased with the answers and
                    at. last asked me for a specimen of my handwriting. Taking a sheet of paper I
                    wrote one of the oldest legends m the copy-books of that time, 'At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dover</settlement>
                    </placeName> dwell George Brown, esquire, Good Carlos Finch and David
                    Pryor!' They were delighted with the copy, especially with the capital
                    letters. The chairman then asked me how many branches I intended to teach. I
                    told him I should not go much into the branches but should try and keep along
                    the main streams Turning towards his colleagues, he said the young man would do
                    very well. They made out, signed, and gave me my certificate."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In 1837 the law was modified so that the circuit judge
                    appointed three county examiners, in place of the-district trustees, to examine
                    all applicants.</p>
            <p>After securing a certificate, the teacher yet had <hi rend="i">no</hi> school.
                    The-State furnished a building and some furniture, but the teacher was
                    maintained by private payment and subscription. The subscription school was the
                    only kind taught. So, after securing a certificate, the prospective teacher had
                    to collect pupils. He canvassed from house to house with his subscription
                    articles under his arm.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> At every home there was free
                    conversation about the children, the lessons and their needs. He informed the
                    parents where he would hold the school, and what his curriculum would
                    include–usually spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic as far as the
                    rule of three. In addition he announced his charges, and frequently specified
                    the penalties he would inflict for breaches of discipline. For being idle there
                    was a penalty of two lashes with a beech switch, for whispering, three lashes,
                    and for fighting, six lashes. Each family subscribed for the three months

                    of the teachers eked out their salaries by chopping wood on Saturdays, and in
                    the evening after school. Probably a majority was obliged to take their pay in
                    kind. Wheat, corn, bacon, venison, hams, dried pumpkin, flour, leather,
                    coonskins, labor, and whiskey were given in exchange for teaching. One teacher
                    took his entire pay in corn, which, when delivered, he sent in a flat-boat to <placeName>

                    of seventy pupils. In 1844 Anderson B. Hunter taught a school in a smokehouse,
                    which had been repaired for the occasion, for $8 per month, and
                    boarded himself. When paid in kind, the teacher, at the end of the quarter,
                    would collect his tuition of wheat, corn, pork, or furs and take a load to the
                    nearest market where he exchanged it for such articles as he reeded.</p>
            <p>The unmarried teachers "boarded round" and thus took part of
                    their pay in board. The teacher computed the time he was entitled to board for
                    each pupil, and usually selected his own time for quartering himself upon the
                    family. But in most instances he was highly acceptable. Since newspapers and
                    books were scarce, and the wilderness was extremely isloated from the outside
                    world the conversation of an intelligent teacher was always welcome. Indeed in
                    most cases it was counted a privilege, if not an honor, to entertain the
                    teacher. Patrons frequently refused to charge a cent for his board and paid
                    their subscriptions in full. The married teacher did not board around. In later
                    days a schoolmaster's house for his own use was quite commonly built
                    adjacent to the school-house. School terms were called quarters. There was a
                    long quarter of thirteen weeks and a short quarter of twelve weeks.</p>

                    teacher who had been educated for the ministry but, on account of his habits of
                    hard drinking, had turned pedagogue, and the teacher who got drunk on Saturday
                    and whipped the entire school on Monday. The first teacher in <placeName>

                    </placeName> was an eccentric hermit, who lived by hunting, trapping and
                    trading. Once an ex-liquor dealer, who had grown too fat to conduct that
                    business longer, became a schoolmaster. Another pedagogue was so fond of drink
                    that he carried his spirits to school with him and drank at intermissions. Two
                    pupils who found his bottle one day and became drunk were whipped for setting
                    such a bad example to the other students. "Wesley Hopkins, a <placeName>

                    were supposed to study their lessons during this time, but when the
                    master's watchful eyes were closed, they amused themselves by catching
                    flies and tossing them into his open mouth. An old sailor who had wandered out
                    into the Indiana woods and become a pedagogue allowed his pupils to spend most
                    of their time roasting potatoes. Another teacher in the southwestern part of the
                    State employed his time between recitations by cracking hickory nuts on one of
                    the puncheon benches.</p>
            <p>Pioneer schools were controlled by the rule of the rod.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Its
                    use in those days was universal at home as well as at school. In fact the
                    teacher who did not use a birch was regarded as a failure. One pedagogue, who
                    had an agreeable school, taught six weeks without whipping anyone. Parents began
                    to suspect that something was wrong, and one fond father politely informed him
                    that he was making a mistake, and must mend his methods if he expected to
                    continue in the profession. Schoolmasters punished freely, and often savagely,
                    usually with the full approval of the parents. An <placeName>

                    always stood with a rod in his hands and prayed with his eyes open. If he caught
                    a youngster in mischief he stopped short in his supplications, called out,
                    "Woe be to you John," and struck him over the shoulders with
                    his rod, after which he resumed his prayer. Another teacher came early to school
                    in the morning to write a love-letter. <list type="footnotes">

                    while he proceeded to open school with prayer, kneeling with his rod in his
                    right hand and his right eye open. During his prayer one mischievous boy stole
                    up to the desk to purloin the letter. The teacher, discovering the youngster,
                    broke off in the middle of a sentence and soundly thrashed the culprit, after
                    which diversion he resumed his devotions with equanimity. Girls and boys of all
                    ages expected to be whipped if they should break the rules. The rod was used on
                    the slightest provocation, sometimes on no provocation at all. The boy who was
                    unfortunate enough to get a blot upon his spelling book had to face a corporal
                    reckoning with the master, and a girl caught in the act of tickling the ear of
                    another had' to stand up and receive a merry switching. The rod was not
                    the only means of punishment. The "Dunce Block",
                    "Foolscap", and "Leather Spectacles" were
                    employed, besides such exercises as standing in' the corner, and
                    standing on one foot. Boys and girls were always seated on different sides of
                    the house. As a punishment, a boy might be required to sit on the
                    girls' side of the house or vice versa. On one occasion a teacher
                    removed a large puncheon from the floor and imprisoned a big girl in the hole
                    beneath.</p>
            <p>The pictures of the pioneer schoolmaster given above are not altogether
                    characteristic. They merely show conditions as they were in some instances. On
                    the whole the oldtime country teacher was a man of worth in the community. He
                    usually possessed a certain simplicity of character and singleness of heart that
                    would do, honor to any man in the profession today. Although he was, frequently
                    from necessity, a jack-of-all-trades, he was zealously devoted to the duties of
                    his calling, and certainly he worked for the love of the task, because the
                    salary offered no attractions. In the elementary branches he was often
                    exceptionally well versed, especially in geography, spelling, and parsing, as
                    these subjects were understood in that day. Many were expert penmen, some even
                    being able to write short sentences using a pen in each hand at the same time.</p>

                    professional men were very scantily supplied. Persons hearing of new books went
                    long distances to borrow them. One boy became so hungry for reading matter that
                    he read over and over again two exposed pages of the "Western
                    Luminary" which were pasted upon the inside of the lid of his
                    mother's linen box. A few family books found in most neighborhoods were
                    Weem's <hi rend="i">Life of Washington,</hi> the Bible, <hi rend="i">Pilgrim's Progress, Life of <placeName>

                    books and spelling books. It thus became a difficult matter for parents to
                    provide their children with text books. They even went so far as to cut up a
                    volume and paste the parts on boards for the different children of the family.
                    Children were usually taught their letters at home. When the child went to
                    school he first learned to spell out of Dillworth's or
                    "Webster's spelling book. About 1850 McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Eclectic Speller</hi> came into use. As old time schoolmasters
                    placed great emphasis on spelling, it was the custom to give half a day of each
                    week to a spelling match. Pupils knew the book so well that 'they could
                    spell the words in the exact order in which they came. After the pupil learned
                    to spell sufficiently well he was set to reading. The elementary spelling book
                    served both as a speller and a reader. But the pupil had to be able to pronounce
                    all the words in the, book before he was permitted to do formal reading. In the
                    early period there were few readers of any kind. Any book from home might be
                    used, the Bible often serving the purpose. Even newspapers were elevated to the
                    dignity of readers when nothing alse could be obtained. About 1835
                    Emerson's readers came into use, but they were displaced later by
                    McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Eclectic Series.</hi> The latter books ranked
                    high for the time. They introduced the children to higher American literature
                    and gave them a taste for reading that was worth while: so that the name of
                    Longfellow, Irving, Bryant, Hawthorne, and others became familiar to pupils of
                    that day.</p>
            <p>The next step on the educational ladder was learning to write. Mothers made
                    copybooks by sewing together a few sheets of foolscap paper. Pens were cut from
                    goose quills. Ink was manufactured from oakballs saturated with vinegar. Even
                    pokeberry juice was employed, but its use was not general because it soured too
                    easily. A favorite inkstand was a section of a cow's born sawed off and
                    fitted with a wooden, water-tight bottom. The copies set by the teachers were
                    generally moral or patriotic precepts such as, "Commandments ten God
                    gave to men," "Evil communications corrupt good
                    manners," "Eternal Vigilance is the price of
                    liberty."</p>
            <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-010-3-069"/>
            <p>The next thing in order for the boys was arithmetic, for this was considered
                    peculiarly a boy's subject. Few girls gave much attention to it.
                    Students in arithmetic did not recite, they merely "ciphered"
                    the sums in the book, the teacher giving little attention unless called on for
                    help. Ray's <hi rend="i">Arithmetic</hi> was generally used about 1850.
                    In every case the abstract rule was first given, and, with this as a basis, the
                    pupils solved the problems according to rule. Such a system did not foster much
                    thinking. When an applicant for a teacher's license was asked how much
                    25 times 25 cents are, he was unable to give the answer, stating that he had
                    never met such a problem in any arithmetic. Girls studied geography and grammar,
                    especially, since they were not considered to have "heads for
                    figures." Of all the pioneer text books, geographies were almost the
                    only ones which were illustrated. Yet these two subjects were not much studied
                    by anybody in the early days. The former was considered proper if there was time
                    for it, but the study of grammar was considered an absolute waste of time. As
                    late as 1845, a teacher at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> in his written contract was required not to teach grammar. Most
                    school work was done with quill pens, and the making and mending of quill pens
                    was a part of the regular duty and employment of the teacher. Steel pens were
                    not used until later. The blackboard, in some form, came into use earlier,
                    however. Each pupil owned his individual eraser made of raw wool.</p>
            <p>In addition to the rudiments of learning some of the masters taught a little
                    correct deportment. They instructed pupils how to stand erect, to walk and bow
                    in good form, to remove the 1 at on entering the room, and how to replace it on
                    departing. They were especially admonished to respect old age and to reverence
                    the 'ministers of the "Word."</p>
            <p rend="center">LOUD SCHOOLS</p>
            <p>"Loud" schools were the rule in the early days in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In fact that kind was considered more efficient than the
                    "silent" school. Boys and girls spelled and read at the top of
                    their voices, and sometimes the roar of lesson-getting could be heard as far as
                    three-quarters of a mile. One teacher regularly took his fiddle to school and
                    solaced himself with music while his pupils were shouting over their lessons. It
                    was difficult to keep pupils at work in such an uproar, there being too great an
                    opportunity for the idler, who, while shouting as loudly as the others, really
                    did no work at all. The lazy boy <list type="footnotes">

                    wiser. In later times the loud school gradually went out of fashion, supplanted
                    by the more orderly form of the present day.</p>
            <p>Friday was often observed as a speech day. In the afternoon the older boys
                    recited selections which they had committed to memory, and the girls read
                    compositions. Both were publicly criticised by the master. Many people who
                    became eminent in later years attributed their success to the old-time speech
                    day.</p>
            <p rend="center">BARRING THE TEACHER OUT</p>
            <p>A common practice in early school days was that of barring out the master. This
                    usually accompanied the Christmas celebration, in case the master did not treat
                    the school. The big boys usually barred the door and kept him out until he
                    agreed to furnish a treat, usually apples. Of course he resisted, otherwise
                    there would have been no fun. If he was obstinate and held out too long he might
                    be ducked in a neighboring creek. One stubborn teacher was ducked in an icy
                    pond, and, when this did not bring a treat, his tormenters placed chunks of ice
                    on his bare bosom. If outsiders had not interferred serious consequences would
                    doubtless have followed. Another pedagogue, who had just had a tooth extracted,
                    despite his warning as to the risk, was plunged into the cold waters of a creek.
                    Lockjaw followed, from which he died. But most teachers yielded after a show of
                    resistance, getting as much merriment out of the affair as the pupils. However,
                    the treat did not always consist of apples. The following quotation describes a
                    treat offered by a certain pioneer teacher-. "One Christmas morning our
                    teacher brought a jug of whiskey to which he added some eggs and sugar; he shook
                    it up and called it' egg-nog.' When noon came he made a little
                    speech and said that the egg-nog was his treat to us; that we must not drink too
                    much of it, and must be good children while he went home to take dinner with his
                    wife and some invited friends. We were good, but we did not leave any of the
                    egg-nog for the teacher and his friends who came to school with him in the
                        afternoon."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> A <placeName>

                    of whiskey. He dealt out the whiskey liberally and it was not long before some
                    of the boys were too full for utterance and had to be sent home. One youngster
                    went home as happy as a lark but his father met him with a big rod that <list type="footnotes">

            <p rend="center">HARDSHIPS OF PIONEER SCHOOL CHILDREN</p>
            <p>Pioneer children endured many hardships in their efforts to secure the rudiments
                    of knowledge. It was not unusual for pupils to attend from a distance of three
                    or four miles. Many times they encountered wild beasts, or even sulking savages.
                    In the autumn they found it delightful to travel along the winding paths as they
                    trudged over the hills and hollows, to view the many-hued leaves and inhale the
                    fragrance of the flowers, to hear the merry chatter of the squirrels and the
                    glad notes of the birds as they flitted from tree to tree, to walk on the light
                    carpet of velvety leaves, cool and soft to the bare young feet. But in winter
                    there was a different picture. Boots were not in fashion, so boys and girls came
                    to school with their feet encased in old sock's or stockings which kept
                    the snow out fairly well. Some children went barefoot winter and summer.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> It seems that their feet and legs, like our hands, became
                    enured to cold. Sanford Cox in his <hi rend="i">Early Settlement</hi> draws a
                    graphic picture of the youngsters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                    with shoes, and some barefoot. In some cases a barefoot pupil would carry a hot
                    board or stone, by which he made his way through the cold. When his feet became
                    too chilled he stood upon the board or stone until the numbness wore off, after
                    which he would make another dash for the schoolhouse. As the schoolhouse
                    fireplace consumed immense quantities of wood the teacher detailed a number of
                    pupils each day to cut and carry wood for the fire. Indeed our fathers and
                    mothers did not travel an easy path in their quest for knowledge.</p>
            <p rend="center">REAL EDUCATION OP THE EARLY HOOSIERS</p>
            <p>After all, the pioneer children received their real education in the great
                    out-of-doors, in the forests and by the streams. There was plenty of arithmetic,
                    manual training, and physical culture for boys, in the work they did with their
                    fathers, building and plastering cabins, clearing and fencing the farms, and in
                    doing hundreds of other things which had to be done on a pioneer farm. The girls
                    learned likewise through the assistance they rendered their mothers, in spinning
                    and weaving, in making butter and cheese, and in <list type="footnotes">

                    housewife found to do. And best of all the training the girls and boys received
                    in those days fitted them for their life's work, which is more than can
                    be said of much of our modern education.</p>
            <p rend="center">CHAPTER VI. SOCIAL LIFE</p>
            <p>The life of the Hoosier pioneers was not all hardship and deprivation. They had
                    many pleasures and amusements to relieve their hard toil. Of course there were
                    no theatres, Sunday excursions or league baseball games, or other more genteel
                    amusements to which we are accustomed today, but there was no lack of wholesome
                    fun and frolic. Above all there was about it a hearty and jovial spirit that is
                    altogether absent in our modern commercial merrymaking. Our fathers lived an
                    isolated life in sparsely settled communities; so, any neighborhood social event
                    was anticipated with delight and glee that was almost childish in its nature.
                    Social pleasures, too, were largely connected with the neighborhood tasks of the
                    settlers. If logs were to be rolled, the neighbors assembled to roll them; if a
                    cabin was to be built, the pioneers came for miles around to assist. There were
                    corn huskings, sheep-shearings, apple-parings, sugar-boilings, quilting bees,
                    and hog-killing.</p>
            <p rend="center">LOG ROLLING</p>
            <p>The pioneer himself could fell the trees of his farm, cut them into proper
                    lengths, clear away the brush and limbs, but in order to roll the logs into a
                    heap for burning he was compelled to call in his neighbors.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> On the appointed day, they all came, they and their wives and children,
                    the men to pile the logs and the women to cook for the feast that always
                    followed the work. Log-rollings, at first sight, do not suggest fun and
                    pleasure, yet they were eagerly looked forward to, especially by the young
                    people. Such undertakings meant much hard, even excessive work, nevertheless the
                    toil itself was turned into sport and play. When the last log was in position
                    feasting and enjoyment began.</p>
            <p>Usually the men were separated into two divisions, and the clearing was
                    apportioned so as to give each division relatively the same amount of work. Each
                    chose an experienced man as leader and, when begun, the contest never flagged.
                    The section which first disposed of the last log was declared the winner. This
                    was no little honor, for the victory would be discussed in other setlements

                    wide. As great individual rivalry occurred among the younger men, some amazing
                    feats of strength were performed. A favorite test was to determine which of two
                    men could outlift the other, each lifting at one end of a log with a handspike.
                    After the work was done the log heaps were fired, and a hundred bonfires
                    reddened the sky. A more beautiful sight can scarcely be imagined.</p>
            <p>Log rollings were especially frequented by candidates and politicians. Here they
                    had an opportunity to present their claims and defend themselves against trivial
                    or unfounded charges. But such seekers were required to show their mettle.
                    Sometimes rival candidates were assigned as leaders of opposing sections of
                    workers. Then work proceeded under the highest stress. In fact some enterprising
                    farmers, it is said, made a practice of deferring their log rollings until
                    campaign time (some kind of an election was held every year), about a month
                    preceding the election, in order to reap the benefit of the labor and enthusiasm
                    of the various candidates.</p>
            <p>After the hard day's work, the boys and young men were still equal to
                    foot races, wrestling matches, pole-vaulting, tug-of-war, lap-jacket, and other
                    feats of skill on which the young fellows prided Themselves. Pitching quoits was
                    also a favorite pastime on such occasions.</p>
            <p rend="center">HUSKINGS</p>
            <p>The husking of corn was an important work and was a neighborhood affair. Both
                    sexes participated. They usually assembled in a large barn which was arranged
                    for the occasion, where they sat in a circle and played "brogue it
                    about" while they worked. Each gentleman selecting a lady partner when
                    the husking began, and under the zest of the frolic, the work progressed with
                    surprising rapidity. When a lady found a red ear she was entitled to a kiss from
                    every gentleman present; when a gentleman found one he was entitled to kiss
                    every lady present. After the corn was all husked a good supper was served.
                    Then, after the old folks had left, the remainder of the evening was spent in
                    dancing and in games.</p>
            <p rend="center">QUILTING BEE</p>
            <p>Of equal importance was the quilting bee, where the women had their gossip. In
                    the afternoon, ladies for miles around gathered at the appointed home to
                    manufacture warm quilts, often of curious patterns and design. Such meetings
                    were busy news exchanges for <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-010-3-074"/> the women
                    could talk as they worked. As soon as the quilt could be "got
                    off", the entertainment began. In the evening the men came and the time
                    was spent by the young people in games and dancing.</p>
            <p>Bounteous feasting always accompanied the hard labor of neighborhood gatherings.
                    A meal, consisting of venison, roast turkey, fried chicken, hominy, ham and
                    eggs, potatoes, wild hog, steaming cornbread, hot biscuits, gingerbread,
                    preserves, jellies, tarts, pies, and good milk and butter, all set on a large
                    table, about which the workers gathered, could not fail to satisfy the appetite
                    of an epicure. Good cider was always at hand to moisten thirsty tongues. Total
                    abstinence was not in fashion in those days, and the farmer who did not supply
                    his hands with liquor was considered stingy indeed. A jug of whiskey was
                    considered necessary for any undertaking of importance.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
                    The beveridge was homemade and often of such little strength that it was likely
                    to freeze or sour.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE SHOOTING MATCH</p>
            <p>To pioneer people and early settlers the rifle was perhaps the most indispensable
                    weapon. With it they procured their meat from the forest, defended their homes
                    from wild men and wild animals, preserved their live stock from prowling
                    enemies, and saved their cornfields from the depredations of squirrels and
                    bears. To be a sure shot was a matter of no little importance Nothing did more
                    to promote good marksmanship than the shooting match.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> But
                    it served also a larger purpose. It was a day of recreation and amusement, when
                    friends gathered for social intercourse, to crack jokes, spin yarns, and talk of
                    former experiences. Often these matches virtually became political meetings,
                    where candidates read their certificates and made stump speeches. They were
                    usually held on Saturday, and every fellow in the community who could
                    "split a bullet on his knife blade" or "take the rag
                    off the bush" came to display his skill and try his luck. The prizes
                    were beeves, hogs, turkeys, venison, and' on some occasions a quanity
                    of meal or a half-barrel of whiskey was the reward of skill. Often a live turkey
                    or goose furnished the target. Each participant was charged his proportionate
                    share of the value of the things offered, the charge depending, of course, on
                    the number of participants. Or, if the number of participants was not equal to
                    the number of chances <list type="footnotes">

                    prize took the remaining chances and shot for himself. A level place in the
                    woods was selected for a range, and a roughly outlined rectangle cleared of
                    bushes and twigs. Along the sides the spectators formed, standing, stooping, or
                    lying in characteristic attitudes. A large tree at one end often served as a
                    target. Prom its trunk were measured off in a straight line towards the other
                    end of the rectangle two distances for shooting, eighty-five and one hundred
                    yard lines. On the former the marksman who fired off-hand stood; at the
                    one-hundred yard line rests were placed by those who preferred to shoot in that
                    fashion. Each man prepared for himself a separate target which was a poplar
                    shingle having near the center a spot blackened with powder or charcoal as a
                    ground. On this ground a piece of white paper, about an inch square, with a
                    diamond shaped hole in the center, was tacked. The point of intersection of the
                    diagonals of the diamond was the true centers of the target and from this as a
                    center was described a circle with a four inch radius. Each participant was
                    allowed three shots. If any one of them struck beyond the circumference, even by
                    a hair's breath, all the other shots, even if in the center, did not
                    count. The unhappy marksman lost. But if all three struck within the circle they
                    were measured by a line from the center of the diamond to the nearest edge of
                    the bullet hole; however, if a ball grazed the center, the line was drawn from
                    the center of the diamond to the middle of the bullet hole. Then the three
                    lengths were added and estimated as one. The man showing the shortest length won
                    the prize. This was called line shooting. The most scrupulous exactness was
                    always observed in determining distances so that there might be no appearance of
                    cheating. Each man placed his own target against the tree and fired his three
                    shots in succession. On an average it required about fifteen minutes for the
                    firing. One or two fellows stood behind the target trees to announce the
                    results. This seems dangerous, yet accidents rarely happened. On one occasion,
                    however, one man peeped out to learn the cause of delay in the shooting and was
                    unluckily killed. On another occasion an old man was standing behind the tree
                    awaiting the report. At the flash of the gun he fell dead from behind the tree.
                    The trunk was hollow–a mere shell at the place where he
                    stood–and the bullet had passed through it into his body. Practical

            <p rend="center">GOOSE PULLING</p>
            <p>One of the rudest of early sports was goosepulling.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> A goose
                    with its neck well greased or soaped was fastened to a post at the proper height
                    from the ground, or suspended from the limb of a tree. Men, on horseback, racing
                    at full speed endeavored to grasp the neck of the fowl and tear its head from
                    the live and struggling body. It often took hours for the winner to accomplish
                    his purpose. This cruel practice died out in later years.</p>
            <p rend="center">DANCING</p>
            <p>Neighborhood tasks like house raising or corn huskings as we have stated, were
                    usually followed at night by a dance or play party. The country fiddler came in
                    with his battered old violin, and the dance was held on the puncheon floor by
                    the light of the fire. Occasionally when no fiddler was to be had the-party had
                    to depend on vocal music to which they danced. But this was unusual. From his
                    instrument the musician drew such tunes as "Old Zip Coon,"
                    "Jay Bird," "Old Dan Tucker," and
                    "Possum up a Gum Stump," all the while violently flourishing
                    his bow and patting his foot in accent. A "caller" called out
                    the different formations of the square chances. Each neighborhood had its own
                    "caller," many of whom attained not a little notoriety, and
                    were even in demand outside the community. The following is an example of a
                    common call: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The dancing was vigorous. They knew little of glides, and high steps with
                    flourishing swings were altogether good form. A jig or a
                    "hoe-down" was often thrown in, and some of the gay young
                    fellows could "cut the pigeon's wing" or throw in an
                    extra "double shuffle" to fill out the measure. In later years
                    round dances such as the waltz, polka, and schottische were introduced, much to
                    the dissatisfaction of the old time dancers who had difficulty in acquiring the
                    new setps. Some even refused to learn, claiming that they were new fangled,
                    "citified" notions after all, and quite beneath the notice of
                    a true dancer.</p>
            <p>A special form of dancing' was the dancing picnic, a reminder of which
                    we Still have at the country fourth of July celebrations. People came to a new
                    barn or a green lawn, but more often to some beautiful grove, with baskets of
                    dinner to spend the day in social converse and enjoyment, heightened by a dance
                    in the afternoon. A circular piece of ground was cleared off and covered with
                    green, new saw-dust. Seats were provided around this. A platform on one side was
                    provided for the musicians. Those who danced "paid the
                    fiddler" but all were welcome. This form of dancing was introduced from
                    the South.</p>
            <p rend="center">SOCIAL GAMES</p>
            <p>In some sections of the State dancing was not approved. Drinking and disorder had
                    become so prevalent at such gatherings that ministers and church people made war
                    upon the entertainment and drove it from the better neighborhoods altogether. In
                    such communities the chief amusements were forfeit games and marching games.
                    "Keeping Post Office," "Picking Cherries,"
                    and "Building the Bridge," were forfeit games. The forfeits
                    were always kisses. Marching plays had in them all the elements of a dance. In
                    fact "Sociability," "Weev'ly
                    wheat," and "Four Hands Around" were often called
                    compromise dances. Because kissing always formed the chief feature of marching
                    plays, they came to be known familiarly as "gum sucks."

                    interesting, were in high favor with the pioneer belles and beaux. They were
                    sung as the players marched, often with little regard for time or rhythm, but
                    with unbounded energy; and many of them were so similar in air and measure that

            <p rend="center">SLEIGH RIDES</p>
            <p>In winter young people had real unalloyed fun. The bob-sled was an important
                    factor in winter enjoyment. It consisted of two short pairs of runners set
                    tandem fashion, the front pair responding freely to the tongue like the front
                    wheels of a wagon. Thus it afforded extra length for a sleigh. At the same time
                    it allowed turns to- be safely made. When surmounted by a big box-bed partially
                    filled with clean straw it made a snug warm nest for a dozen or more boys and
                    girls. Probably no social crowd was so hilarious as a jolly bob-sled party on a
                    bright moonlight night. The big runners sang a song to the crisp white snow, and
                    the night resounded with flying hoofs and jangling bells and the gay songs of
                    boys and <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-010-3-079"/> girls. Doubtless the old bob-sled
                    was a strong factor in promoting early marriages, for a half-score of buxom
                    girls and husky young men crowded within the compas of the bed of a sleigh was a
                    powerful stimulus to love's young dream. Sleigh-riding to the spelling
                    match or to the singing school was the great joy of the winter months.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p rend="center">THE SPELLING SCHOOL</p>
            <p>One of the chief public entertainments of the early settlers was the spelling
                        school.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> It was looked forward to with much
                    anticipation and anxiety. When the time came the whole neighborhood, or even
                    several neighborhoods, came together for an intellectual contest. Two young
                    people chose sides, and the teacher who was master of ceremonies pronounced the
                    words. They spelled in various ways, each section having its favorite method.
                    Sometimes they spelled across, sometimes "word-catchers" were
                    employed, again the "spelldown" process was the means of
                    determining the contest. After the match the country swains took the girls home,
                    often by very round-a-bout ways.</p>
            <p rend="center">SINGING SCHOOLS</p>
            <p>Singing schools were scarcely less popular than the spelling matches.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> They served the double purpose of social gatherings and
                    schools of vocal instruction. The meetings were usually held on Sunday afternoon
                    in a district schoolhouse or church. Here the local singing master, with his
                    tuning fork in his hand and without any accompaniment taught the whole
                    neighborhood to read buckwheat notes and sing sacred songs from the old song
                    books. In the early books, like the <hi rend="i">Sacred Melodeon, Christian
                        Psalmist</hi> and <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Harmony,</hi> the tunes were represented by four buckwheat
                    notes; the round one called "sol," the square on
                    "la," the triangu-Jar one "fa" and the
                    diamond shaped on "mi." They were repeated to make the full
                    octave. About 1850 the round note system was introduced by Yankee singing
                    masters. The pioneer book of the new system was the <hi rend="i">Carmina

                    the early songs which they had learned in their youth. A charge of fifty to

                    meetings were often held at which there was great rivalry between the classes.
                    Singers were chosen very much as in spelling matches. At the price charged

                    this that the second generation of Quakers has changed its attitude toward

            <p>Debating clubs, moot courts, and mock legislatures were common, especially in the
                    smaller villages of Indiana. They furnished an opportunity for social fellowship
                    and afforded practice in impromptu speaking and parliamentary usage. Many of the
                    State's great statesmen, orators, and thinkers received their first
                    inspiration at these meetings. A literary society was found in almost every
                    neighborhood in the early fifties. Joint meetings were often held with
                    neighboring societies. The modern literary club originated in the old Hoosier

            <p>A wedding was always an event of the greatest importance because it meant a
                    season of feasting and frolic for young and old, lasting several days.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Young people in the early days were married much earlier
                    than they are today. A boy of sixteen or seventeen was counted on to do a
                    man's part in the farm work, in hunting, or in scouting against the
                    Indians. There was no inequality of social position or wealth to blight the
                    hopes of cupid, for all occupied practically the same position in life. Money
                    was not necessary. Intoxicating health balanced the lack of a bank account.
                    Money of any kind was very scarce in those days, so scarce that fathers often
                    found it difficult to make financial provision for the legal part of the

                    place for his awkward form, sat down in it, falling in head and heels in his new
                    tow linen suit. When last seen he was fleeing from the place like a blue streak
                    in the moonlight. The expression, "went like a blue streak"
                    may have originated in that incident. But courtships in those days were as
                    successful as in these, and a marriageable girl that found no husband was
                    considered unfortunate indeed.</p>
            <p>Everybody in the entire neighborhood knew he would be invited to the marriage
                    celebration. In fact in most communities no invitation was needed; the latch
                    string was out to all who wished to come, especially to neighbors. In some
                    cases, however, those who wished to do something beyond the ordinary sent a
                    written invitation to the intended guests. A single' invitation was
                    sent to all of them, the groomsman riding from house to house with the
                    "invite" as it was called. This important document was
                    composed by the local schoolmaster. Almost every neighborhood had a local
                    preacher who was empowered to perform the ceremony, and there were squires also
                    who could tie a knot for very reasonable fee. The following interesting note was
                    sent to a local minister asking him to perform a marriage ceremony:<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>On the nuptial day the bridegroom and his best fellows usually ten, gathered at
                    his father's home, and all went to the home of the bride, timing their
                    progress so as to arrive about noon. In connection with this journey, a
                    diversion called "running for the bottle" was often indulged
                    in. Two of the best mounted were selected to compete. "When within a
                    half mile of the bride's home the word was given and the two started
                    out at breakneck speed. The one who first reached a designated spot became the
                    winner of the prize, a bottle of corn whiskey, with which he treated the
                    remainder of the party when they came up.</p>

            <p>The guests usually came on horseback. The men folks went ahead to direct the way
                    through the woods, clear away the brush, and let down the fences.</p>
            <p>Wedding garments in those days were entirely homemade like everything else; but
                    the bride in her dress of linsey-woolsey and the groom in his shining new
                    cowhide boots were as well married as any modern bride and groom, even if they
                    did not carry themselves with the same ease and grace.</p>
            <p>The ceremony was usually performed about twelve o 'clock in the day,
                    although it sometimes took place as late as three o 'clock. After the
                    words were pronounced the important part of the celebration– so far
                    as the guests were concerned–began. Great preparations were made for
                    the wedding meal. Tribute was levied upon the whole neighborhood; so in a
                    literal way the whole neighborhood was interested in the event. Dishes of china,
                    pewter, and silver; spoons of pewter, wood and horn; table linen; all things
                    necessary for the occasion, were collected from various parts of the settlement.
                    So few china dishes were possessed that scarce a whole neighborhood could set a
                    wedding table. The menu consisted of the best that the land could afford. Often
                    a monster potpie, holding from ten to twelve chickens, occupied the center of
                    the table.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Potpie was a favorite dish with the early
                    woodsman. Meats of all kinds, (wild meat was plentiful) steaming cornbread,
                    potatoes, onions, pumpkin, butter, pies, preserves of all kinds, wild honey, and
                    delicious pound cakes, weighted down the long rough table which was covered with
                    a piece of white linen that had lain in the garden for weeks to bleach. Around
                    this board the hungry people were seated, the bride and groom at one end, and
                    the bridesmaid and groomsman at the other. After the dinner the old folks
                    returned to their homes, but the young folks always remained for a dance that
                    lasted frequently until the next morning. The happy party played games and
                    tripped away to the merry tunes of the sleepy, old fiddler.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE INFARE</p>
            <p>The infare, the wedding reception at the home of the groom's father the
                    next day, was a repetition of the entertainment of the previous day.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> The same people gathered, the young men again raced for
                    the bottle, and all had a feast of good things, followed by another dance at
                    night.</p>

            <p>Little capital was needed to start a new home. The young people were content to
                    begin life as their fathers and mothers before them had done, with nothing more
                    than what they could manufacture with their own hands. Money was not to be had.
                    The following story illustrates the lack of coin and the scant capital with
                    which some marriages were consummated.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> A certain
                    "squire" Jones saw a young man ride up with a young lady
                    behind him. They dismounted; he hitched his horse and they went toward the house
                    and were invited to be seated. After waiting a few minutes the young man asked
                    if he were the "squire." He informed him that he was. He then
                    asked the squire what he charged for tying the knot. "You mean for
                    marry you?"–"Yes
                    sir."–"One dollar," said the
                    squire–"Will you take it in
                    trade?"–"What kind of trade,"–
                    "Beeswax."–"Bring it in." The
                    young man returned to where the horse was tied, and brought in the beeswax, but
                    it lacked forty cents of being enough to pay the bill. After sitting pensive for
                    some minutes the young man went to the door and said, "Well Sal,
                    let's be going." Sal followed slowly to the door, when,
                    turning to the justice, with an entreating look, she said: "Well,
                    Squire, can't you tie the knot as far as the beeswax goes
                    anyhow?" And he did and they were married.</p>
            <p rend="center">TRAINING DAY</p>
            <p>In the county town was held the general muster which was a meeting of the militia
                    of the county for the purpose of instruction and drill. It was held late in the
                    summer after the crops had been "laid by." All persons subject
                    to military duty were notified to attend and take their places in the company
                    and regiment to which they were assigned. The militiamen were not uniformed but
                    came in ordinary clothing. Their weapons were of no particular pattern
                    –rifles, shotguns, carbines, and muskets–and with them
                    they awkwardly went through the manual of arms. This military force was often
                    called the "corn stalk" militia, because it is said they
                    carried corn-stalks in place of guns.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> This doubtless is
                    untrue, but some times they wore corn tassels in their hats or caps, which fact
                    may have given rise to the sobrioquet.</p>
            <p rend="center">CIRCUS DAY</p>
            <p>In many of the communities a circus came once a year in the summer. In the rough

                    or the amphitheater." It traveled by the ordinary country roads, and
                    the people turned out en masse to see the elephant cross the river. At high noon
                    the grand entry into the village was made with gorgeous chariots, horseback
                    processions, and martial music. The whole country attended, and the big tent was
                    filled with simple people, gazing in open-mouthed wonder at the astonishing
                    feats performed in the ring.</p>
            <p>On Saturday afternoon the early Hoosiers went to town. It was a holiday and no
                    man was expected to work. A load of produce might be taken for sale or barter,
                    but no serious labor was tolerated. Here the farmers transacted a little
                    business, "swapped" horses, and exchanged gossip with their
                    neighbors.</p>

                    Sackville stood.</p>
            <p>The following evidence has lately come to light. Among the papers of the late

                    </placeName> drawn by John Mellish in 1818. This was drawn from the surveys of

            <p>In J. B. Finley's <hi rend="i">Life Among the Indians,</hi> page 188,

                    who was well acquainted with the facts repeats the statement in his own
                    language. These two evidences leave little doubt as to the location of the old
                    Fort.</p>
            <p>This fort was built in 1787 by Major John F. Hamtramck under orders of General
                    Josiah Harmar who then commanded the <placeName>

                    occupied by strong garrisons, sometimes numbering 1,000 men. Armies of much
                    larger size under Hamtramck, Russell, and Hopkins rendezvoused there at
                    different times. No description of the fort has been found.</p>
            <p rend="center">CHURCH HISTORY</p>
            <p>The Methodist Church in Indiana is devoting considerable attention to historical
                    matters connected with the early church of Indiana. Dr. Sweet, professor of
                    history at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">DePauw</region>
                    </placeName> University, is aiding in the work. Dr. Herrick was recently
                    appointed historian by the North Indiana Conference. Dr. John Poucher is doing a
                    similar work for Southern Indiana. Professor Sweet is hopeful that the other two
                    Indiana Conferences will undertake systematic and <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-010-3-086"/> thorough surveys. Every church in Indiana and every
                    church organization should be investigated and its record preserved. Nothing can
                    be more interesting or in the end more valuable to the churches themselves than
                    such a study. It was no easy task to found the churches of Indiana and fight
                    their. early battles. The men and women who did that work are entitled to have
                    their records preserved. If the present generation is so much engrossed in other
                    ways that it has no interest in such things it should at least rest assured that
                    future generations will appreciate the work of the pioneer preachers and place a
                    proper value on their history.</p>
            <p rend="center">THE INDIANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY</p>
            <p>This is one of the oldest organizations in the State, dating from December 11,
                    1830. Its first president was the distinguished federal judge, Benjamin Parke,
                    who died of cholera, at his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, July 12, 1835. His death perhaps had much to do in preventing a
                    complete organization of the work the Society had undertaken. At that time the
                    first settlers of the State, and the founders of the government were alive. Had
                    the society succeeded in getting well-organized and providing a substantial home
                    it doubtless would have received all the valuable documents of our early
                    history.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately no master hand took hold of the organization and its work has not
                    been accomplished. This does not mean that many able men have not devoted a
                    great deal of time and money to the work. The historian, John B. Dillon, did
                    some valuable work in connection with the society. But the man who did most for
                    it and who took deepest interest in preserving the State's history was
                    the late "William H. English. The Society has numbered among its
                    members many of the most distinguished men of the State. It has now a membership
                    of about seventy-five. It has never had funds adequate to its work.</p>
            <p>It seems that now would be an opportune time to revive interest in the
                    organization and its work. Many leading men have expressed an interest in it
                    lately. There are men and women in Indiana able to do this work as well as it is
                    being done in any other State. Why not have a mass meeting of all persons in the
                    State interested in the work of the Society as soon as the political campaign of
                    the year is over? This is merely a suggestion. It is believed there are 1,000
                    persons in Indiana sufficiently interested in the work to join the society.</p>

            <p rend="center">PRIDE'S FORT</p>
            <p>About 1800 a pioneer named Woolsey Pride settled at <placeName>

                    </placeName> near the present city of Petersburg. He soon found that he had
                    located near one of the favorite hunting trails of the redmen. They came down
                        <geogName>White River</geogName> or down the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and up White Eiver to a point near Pride's fort from which
                    place they crossed over to hunt in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As soon as a few white settlers came up they built a fort at the
                    springs. This fort was used as a meeting place for the rangers who patrolled the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands. Pride's fort has stood, or a part of it, up
                    until the present used for all manner of purposes from a church and school house
                    to a barn. Recently its owner has decided to destroy it and it seems that one of
                    the last, if not indeed the last, of the old frontier stockades will soon be
                    gone.</p>

            <p>This is an attempt to perpetuate a bit of local history. There is a general
                    movement throughout the West to perpetuate the history of individual churches
                    and schools. At least one Western State has undertaken a religious historical
                    survey in which it is planned to compile a complete history of every church in
                    the State. Dr. Poucher has divided his subject into three parts. In the first he
                    gives a brief history of the town of Orleans from its founding in 1815 by
                    William McFarland and Samuel Lewis down to the present. The main portion of the
                    pamphlet is devoted to the History of the Church. Dr. Poucher here encounters a
                    trouble that will often be met by the ser ious historian in our State. The
                    earliest records are lost. Who the first preacher was, or what denomination he
                    represented will perhaps never be known again. Orleans was on an early line of
                    travel and doubtless was visited before Indiana was a State. The celebrated
                    Presbyterian preacher W. W. Martin preached in the neighborhood in 1816. Lorenzo
                    Dow the eccentric Methodist preacher of that early day, often visited Orleans.
                    Dr. Poucher has been able to find a record of the Methodist preachers beginning
                    about 1822. There is an unbroken succession from that time on to the present. In
                    1826 the little Methodist congregation built a 30x40 log church. The long list
                    of preachers contains many names well-known in Indiana History. The third part
                    of the pamphlet is devoted to the members whom the auditor calls the
                    "Personals workers."</p>

               <hi rend="i">Drainage and Reclamation of the Swamps and Overflowing
                    Lands,</hi> by C<hi rend="sc">HARLES</hi> K<hi rend="sc">ETTLEBOROUGH</hi>,
                    Indiana Bureau of Legislative Information Bulletin, No. 2, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, pp. 68, 1914.</head>
            <p>This is a historical discussion of the drainage question in Indiana. The purpose
                    of the <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> is to awaken the people of the State and
                    especially the General Assembly to the fact that the State is losing millions of
                    dollars every year through lack of proper drainage. The State has already
                    reclaimed 2,500,000 acres valued at $68,000,000 but it is believed
                    that a scientific drainage system would do much more. The sanitary side of the
                    question is also emphasized. A revival of interest in drainage sprang up ten or
                    fifteen years <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-010-3-089"/> ago simultaneously with the
                    great rise in land values. A part of this drainage impulse came also from the
                    fact that the arable free public lands in the west had all been occupied.</p>
            <p>A table showing the undrained lands in the various States gives Indiana 625,000
                    acres of such land. The total for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is given as 79,000,000, acres, one fourth of which is in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>. The main reasons for drainage are given as follows: to improve the
                    roads, to reclaim the land, and to improve health.</p>
            <p>Systematic drainage did not begin till about 1880 when the rising price of land
                    began to justify the use of costly machinery. The writer estimates that
                    3,500,000 acres of land in Indiana were originally swampy. Of this amount about
                    1,500,000 acres have been fairly well drained, while at least one million acres
                    can hardly be said to be drained at all.</p>
            <p>It is an interesting little pamphlet and suggests a line of work which the State
                    government can do with great profit to the citizens. In closing, the author sums
                    up the work now being done in other States.</p>
            <p>Seven suggestions are made to the General Assembly, should it undertake
                    legislation along this line. (1) A new systematic drainage law. (2) A State
                    engineer. (3) Flood control and river improvement. (4) The public health. (5)
                    Co-operation with experts. (6) Public ownership of dredging machinery. (7)
                    Preservation of water power.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Unknown God mid Other Orthodox Essays</hi> is the title of a
                    small volume of miscellaneous essays by Jacob Piatt Dunn. The first essay is a
                    discussion of the meaning of the dedication, Paul found on the Athenian altar
                    "To the Unknown God." Mr. Dunn comes to the conclusion that
                    the expression refers to the Greek "Supreme First Cause."</p>
            <p>The second essay is entitled "The First Heresies." The author
                    is not disposed to let his religion draw him into any of the conflicts of
                    science and philosophy. These latter he says are making the same bluffs to day
                    as in the time of the apostles; but "The Simple faith is greater than
                    the wisdom of men."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most interesting of these short essays is one entitled "The
                    Passing of Darwinism-" Here, as in all the rest, the author's
                    mind takes the path of least resistance. He rejects Darwinism in to-to. But he
                    leaves some consolation, for he admits that "There are thousands of
                    fairly intelligent people who still accept the Darwinian theories as established
                    facts."</p>
            <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-010-3-090"/>
            <p>In his essay on the "The Debt of English Literature to the
                    Bible" he is on easier ground. There is only one side to this question
                    and of course Mr. Dunn is "orthodox." It is a neatly executed
                    little volume of 178 pages, and is interesting in the fact that it reveals a
                    type of mind not uncommon in the world's history.</p>

                    bank was chartered and later broken by supporting doubtful commercial ventures.
                    A State Bank was organized about the same time as that of Indiana. The State
                    Bank failed partly by reason of trying to carry the State debt and partly by
                    reason of falling into the hands of dishonest politicians. After the failure of
                    the State Bank the State tried a system of free banking with customary
                    disastrous results. Dr. Dowrie has held close to his subject and has given us a

                    opinions born of the atmosphere of his researches. These opinions are valuable
                    to the general reader. They are in the nature of expert knowledge and one has a

                    1860, 1864 and 1866. Col. Stormont speaks from personal experience. One is
                    especially struck with the change that has come about in the conduct of such
                    campaigns. The personalities and bitternesses of politics as well as the
                    corruption are disappearing.</p>
