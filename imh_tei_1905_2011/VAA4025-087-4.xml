            <p>They were fiercely independent craftsmen. They were gamblers, playing great odds against all the
                    elements that seemingly conspired against their trade—shaky economics, contrary weather,
                    limited and at times nonexistent supplies, transient help, and oppressive working conditions. Yet
                    their industriousness persevered. They were the newspaper publishers and printers who
                    "wested" when the American frontier reached across the Alleghenies and the
                    Cumberlands to stretch into the dark forests and loping prairies of the middle lands. Despite
                    hardships that plagued their makeshift printing offices, they knew there was civic importance to
                    their labors. Their rickety machines turned out the endless forms needed to maintain records of
                    legal, constabulary, land, and business transactions. But more importantly, the newspapers they
                    printed kept their readers in touch with their distant government and the world. Never more than
                    four pages in length and sometimes only two, the pioneer weekly newspaper was a platform for
                    opinions, an alert to the goods and services available in an isolated settlement, a caution about
                    shady schemes and the perils of intemperance and immorality, and an organ for intellectual
                    reflection and even amusement.</p>
            <p>The newspaper history of the American frontier is littered with the skeletons of failures. Yet that
                    history is continuous as well, for although many an early publisher was restless, eager to establish
                    a more stable and profitable foothold for his press, his failure almost always offered a challenge
                    for still another newspaper. And because of that challenge, the frontier printer prevailed.</p>

                    </placeName> was one of six Indiana settlements that had printing offices with their attendant

                    Indiana's interior, the "New Purchase" of 1818.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Yet
                    even before the New Purchase, the end, in 1815, of the War of 1812 had ignited a great western surge
                    of emigration. By the summer of 1816, land and river routes to Indiana were crowded with traffic.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    with press and types, who comes to direct his politics, and keep him posted up on all subjects of

                    </placeName> to attract a printer, because such attempts were not unusual. William Henry Harrison,
                    Indiana's first territorial governor, wrote Secretary of State James Madison in November,
                    1803, for permission to employ a printer. Five or six months later, Elihu Stout arrived in <placeName>

                    </placeName> with press, type, paper, and the enthusiasm of a twenty-two-year-old.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In 1816, John Francis Dufour, the founder of <placeName>

            <p>Generally, two printers operated the press, taking turns in their functions.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                    One printer was the "beater," whose task was to ink the type. To do so, he slicked
                    ink on a pair of leather balls stuffed with horsehair or wool and attached to short wood handles,
                    and then "beat" the balls four or five times on the type. Meantime, the other
                    printer—the "puller"—loaded the paper, dampened so ink would
                    take to it, and prepared to make a pull. An apprentice, often called a "fly boy,"
                    stood by to receive the printed sheets and hand over fresh sheets, hence his sobriquet. From all
                    three, speed, coordination, quick reflexes, and skilled hand movements were required.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ramage used for newspaper work was a "two pull" machine, the bed long and wide
                    enough to hold forms for two newspaper pages, thus requiring two impressions to print one side of a
                    newspaper-size sheet or four impressions altogether for a four-page newspaper. The usual page size
                    of <placeName>

                    although page size obviously depended on the press's dimensions. The bed of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> press accommodated not only the forms for two newspaper pages but, of course, smaller
                    forms, such as one for a handbill.</p>
            <p>Only one newspaper page could be printed at a time; thus, the bed was moved forward for the second
                    page. Most often, a day or two separated the printing of the outside and inside pages, which not
                    only allowed the ink to set properly from the earlier printing, but in offices where type was in
                    short supply, type from the outside pages was needed to compose matter for the inside pages. When
                    printing was completed and the paper was dry, sheets were hand-folded to create the folio.</p>
            <p>Type was "set" by hand, a process no different than the one developed in the
                    mid-fifteenth century by Johann Gutenberg (1400?–1469). Each letter, number, punctuation

                    Caxton (1422?–1491), the first English printer.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Type prices were
                    fairly consistent during the first half of the nineteenth century, costing from thirty-two to ninety
                    cents a pound according to size. Printers usually ordered new type by "bills," a
                    bill being five hundred pounds. Until the early 1820s Indiana printers normally obtained type from
                    eastern suppliers, which frequently was a problem due to the distance and freight charges.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Added to the inconvenience of distance was the foundries' demands
                    for payment in specie and the fact that the pioneer printer "was bedeviled by variations in
                    line and design on what was supposed to be the same type face," Thomas Roy Jones has
                    written. "Each foundry did as it pleased, and deliberately made variations in type faces to
                    retain the trade of the printers who were its customers."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>In the third issue Morris offered an explanation for the newspaper's name. It is apparent
                    that he intended the <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer</hi> to be neither a sheet for personal trumpeting
                    nor an organ of political favoritism or persuasion. He would be free, however, to criticize
                    political actions when he felt it necessary. He also implied that he would not allow letters intent
                    on character assassination: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Since the commencement of <hi rend="i">The Plain Dealer,</hi> I have frequently been
                            questioned on the motives that induced me to adopt so strange a name for my paper. It is an
                            opinion too generally received, that a newspaper, or public journal, is a kind of <hi rend="i">political engine,</hi> by which a few individuals endeavor to foist themselves
                            into office, or traduce the characters of individuals, for the mere gratification of
                            personal pique. That <hi rend="i">plain dealing,</hi> should be pursued in transactions of
                            this kind; or in fact, in any thing that has any connection with politics, or the
                            administration of government, is to many, an enigma they cannot solve. There are many, who
                            judging from these premises, conclude that every protestation of honesty, or name indicative
                            of impartiality, that is assumed, is but a refined manner of <hi rend="i">double

                    buildings, exclusive of shops, stables, and outhouses." Industries included "one
                    grist mill … two sawmills … four boot and shoe makers … 2
                    blacksmiths, a chairmaker … five taverns, 7 stores … a market house,"
                    a brick courthouse "nearly finished," and, of course, "one printing
                    office." As for the land, "The last harvest produced several crops of wheat
                    … that weighed from sixty-five to sixty-eight pounds per bushel; and the best crops of
                    grass I have ever seen, are produced without the aid of manure. Corn, oats, rye, flax, hemp, sweet
                    and Irish potatoes, &amp;c. &amp;c. are produced in abundance."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> This glowing account was obviously intended to attract settlers. Morris was aware that some
                    of his fellow citizens would send their <hi rend="i">Plain Dealers</hi> "back
                    home" and perhaps expected that some newspapers on his exchange list would reprint the

            <p>Although there probably was enough business to keep the <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer</hi> going, at one

               <hi rend="sup">44</hi> Another common cause of suspensions was lack
                    of paper.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer</hi> contained a wealth of information. For instance, readers were

                    "smooth and genteel" dark-eyed gentleman named Vanhorn who arrived in

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>." Venette, he said, would astound the populace with a thrilling ascent
                    "200 feet in the airy regions." An obliging printer made up, on the cuff,
                    handbills and tickets, and Vanhorn sold several hundred. On the day before the ascension, Vanhorn
                    chartered a seat on the mail stage and rumbled north, presumably to fetch Venette and his balloon.
                    The next afternoon "a considerable crowd assembled on the Capitol Square; but no Venette,
                    no Vanhorn … the Prince of Pickpockets…. His plunder estimated at 2 or 300

            <p>In the literary vein, Morris offered two poems printed beneath a small head that read "The

                    "The Lady's Wish." An anecdote related a tale about a student who,
                    desiring to learn to play the flute, discovered to his dismay that lessons would cost twice as much
                    the first month as the second. He decided to "come the second month." There also

                    assisted Scott with the printing is unknown. There may have been a salaried printer in the office,

                    rejoinder appeared. She accused him of threatening "to <hi rend="i">Kick me out of Bed and

                    about how "could a woman's Constitution have been broken by making fires, when, in
                    making her elopement she travelled at the rate of forty miles per day on foot with a large budget

            <p>Within seven months the <hi rend="i">Enquirer and Indiana Telegraph's</hi> staff was in
                    disarray. The partnership ended in September, 1819. Eggleston left and was soon elected presiding
                    judge of Indiana's third judicial district. Around this time Caswell was thinking of
                    relocating in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName>. Drew may have been in poor health. The September 10 issue carried a notice that the
                    newspaper "Will be sold on good terms one divided half: an excellent press, a quantity of
                    good type comprising an assortment of job type."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The notice claimed
                    that the newspaper had a weekly circulation of eight hundred and that the office did
                    "considerable JOB PRINTING." The newspaper's thirty-second issue,
                    September 24, 1819, was the last under the control of John Scott and Company. Morris almost
                    immediately bought back into the printing office.</p>
            <p>Under "B. F. Morris &amp; Co.," the newspaper continued without interruption
                    one week after the dissolution of John Scott and Company. Morris's enterprise apparently
                    consisted of lawyers Caswell and Drew, but there is no evidence that Scott stayed on with the new
                    editorship. A significant change occurred with the March 2, 1820, issue when the title was shortened
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Enquirer.</hi> If Scott was a shareholder, the change possibly came about through
                    disagreement between him and Morris, for it seems that the relationship ultimately reached an
                    impasse. In September Morris published a warning: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">CAUTION</p>
                        <p>THE public are cautioned against taking an assignment of any NOTES given by me to John Scott
                            as I have equitable claims against the said Scott to balance the whole.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Enquirer</hi> under Morris was no different journalistically than it was under
                    Scott. The news columns were filled with federal acts and reprinted items. In December, 1819,
                    Morris, perhaps exasperated by complaints his editorial decision elicited, published a piece likely
                    copied from an eastern gazette. "It is hard for a Printer to please every body,"
                    the item reads. "Many censure the Printer for copying articles of news from other papers of
                    the same state or neighborhood"; some want more advertisements yet others complain
                    "your paper is filled up too much with advertisements…. <list type="footnotes">

                            Morris owed Scott the amount written on each, and could be given as tender to third parties
                            willing to accept them. If the "Caution" was truthful, Scott was equally
                            in debt to Morris. The question of Scott and money survived even into the twentieth century.

            <p>Local news of an ordinary nature received almost no notice from early Indiana editors. Only the
                    largest papers could afford the luxury of a team of local reporters, and even they did not employ
                    reporters until the 1840s. Obituaries and marriages were only occasionally recorded, and little
                    space was given to local election returns. But local news of tragic, violent, or dramatic nature was
                    almost never overlooked: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            beside all this, shocking to relate, one of the millers a young man perished in the flame!
                            it is said that he was seen sleeping on the bags in the evening, and immediately under the

            <p>John and Hanna found quick buyers for the printing office—brothers D. W. and Charles W.

                    substituting "With all who make our country's good their aim, we union seek and

            <p>At the very start of their <hi rend="i">Inquirer</hi> the Hutchen brothers were shaken by the
                    possibility of competition. "Great exertions are being made to establish another printing
                    office in this place," they remarked in an editorial, "and no doubt it has been

            <p>Jocelyn's first <hi rend="i">Repository</hi> motto strongly identified him with Indiana and
                    its aims: "The Constitution of Indiana—sound republicanism—good order
                    and steady habits." And unlike Silentia's Keepmoney, who saw the New Purchase as
                    the shining future, Jocelyn encouraged local development, making his gazette a booster for progress.
                    An early supporter of a Whitewater canal, he argued that an engineered waterway would help the
                    region's strained economy and even led a delegation to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, to discuss
                        plans.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> His booster zeal was matched by his religious enthusiasm, too;
                    occasionally he used his press to publish religious tracts.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>

            <p>Jocelyn eventually dispensed with the front page nameplate that had been strung across the top of
                    page one since the birth of the <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer.</hi> The nameplate was reduced to a
                    modest head at the top of column one, and a new motto—"Intelligence is the Life
                    of Liberty"—replaced the former. By this time, Jocelyn was in poor health, a
                    condition that gradually worsened. In the autumn of 1827, he decided to sell the printing office:

            <p>Jocelyn went on to accomplish what may be considered a journalistic first in Indiana if not the
                    nation by conducting and publishing a newspaper interview with a politician. He queried Governor
                    James Brown Ray, who was seeking reelection on a ticket that embraced none of the national parties.
                    Ray's opponent was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>'s Harbin Moore, an avowed supporter of Adams. At the moment Indiana
                    enthusiasts of Andrew Jackson had no candidate for governor, but they immediately found one after
                    the interview was published. Dr. Israel T. Canby was so confident that he would be the
                    state's next governor that he immediately resigned his post as state representative for
                    Jefferson and Jennings counties. In June, 1828, Ray appeared in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his former residence, and said publicly that he could back anyone who supported the
                    American system. The governor's fence straddling alarmed Jocelyn, whose political loyalty
                    was still with Adams and Clay, because he believed Ray's talk would be interpreted by
                    Jacksonians as friendly toward their cherished "Old Hickory." The interview likely
                    took place almost immediately after Ray completed his speech.</p>
            <p>The governor's published replies to Jocelyn's questions are oddly brief and
                    repetitious, unlike Ray's normally long-winded speech patterns. Jocelyn's

                    on either side of the Presidential question; meaning (and we presume were so understood) that what
                    had passed already, made it sufficiently clear on which side his judgment and love of country had
                    permanently placed him." Jocelyn asserted that he was appending his remarks "For
                    the purpose of showing the opposition that there exists not the slightest pretext in fact, for their
                    claiming the Governor of Indiana for Jackson …. when his name is used … they
                    practice a foul deception upon the public, as well as upon their adherents."<hi rend="sup">93</hi>

                    the editorial hubbub only bruised Ray's ego and did not kill him politically; in fact, the

                    neutral status to a Jacksonian paper after Gregg left the sheet. New editor Culley obviously studied
                    the election returns. Meanwhile, Jocelyn's health continued to decline.</p>
            <p>In November, 1828, Jocelyn informed his readers that "we shall stop the press after having
                    issued two numbers more … Several persons we well know, wish to possess themselves of our
                    printing establishment … but knowing at the same time that we have long since determined,
                    on account of our bad state of health, to close our business either by selling or stopping the
                    press, they may perhaps be waiting until we have done the latter, with the expectation of obtaining
                    the press and other materials of this office, for a mere song, as the saying is." He
                    cautioned potential buyers that if they were thinking of getting the printing office at a bargain
                    price "They will find themselves as much mistaken as we have been on the presidential
                        question—<hi rend="i">for we have given them our lowest terms, under any
                        circumstances.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Since the electoral college vote was still
                    two weeks away, "presidential question" undoubtedly referred to Jocelyn's
                    controversial interview with James Brown Ray.</p>
            <p>There still were no takers. Jocelyn then terminated the gazette. At the end of February or the
                    beginning of March, 1829, Jocelyn and J. W. Holland<hi rend="sup">98</hi> published the first issue

            <p>The emergence of Andrew Jackson's democracy broke the hold of the aristocracy on American
                    politics. As a consequence, journalism and politics split into separate camps with journalism
                    becoming a separate profession.<hi rend="sup">109</hi> The editorial contents of many newspapers

                    the frontier—had struggled against all adversities. They persevered. James Green, a

                    "The debt which the Middle West owes to its early printers and to its circuit riders and to
                    the men who established schools and insisted on the three R's, is beyond calculation. Those
                    were the men who kept alive the burning torch of inspiration, who added to life the finer and better
                    things, the larger outlook and the wider hopes, which has put a great gulf between the country

            </byline>
            <p>Surely one of the lesser lights of Indiana's political tradition, William Wade Dudley
                    rescued himself from complete obscurity by one momentous indiscretion. In October, 1888, Dudley
                    wrote a circular letter to Indiana Republican leaders urging them to carry the state for native son
                    Benjamin Harrison by organizing "floaters" (nonaligned individuals available to
                    the highest bidder), into "blocks of five." The ill-advised letter provoked an
                    ugly controversy during the closing days of the election and introduced into the vernacular the
                    terms <hi rend="i">floater</hi> and <hi rend="i">blocks of five</hi> as synonyms for electoral
                    sleaze. For a season Dudley was an albatross for Harrison and the Republicans and a celebrated
                    bogeyman among opposition Democrats. In one forum in particular, the cartoon art of Joseph
                    Keppler's <hi rend="i">Puck,</hi> Dudley became a reigning symbol of Republican iniquity,
                    and for the duration of Harrison's term Dudley, blocks of five, and floaters served as
                    ubiquitous reminders of his tainted victory over Keppler favorite Grover Cleveland.</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> on August 27, 1842, Dudley attended Phillips Academy and Russell's Collegiate
                    Institute, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and settled in 1860 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Commissioned a captain in Indiana's Nineteenth Volunteer Regiment in
                    1861, Dudley led troops in combat at Second Manassas, South Mountain, Antietam, Chancellorsville,
                    and Gettysburg, where an injury required amputation of his right leg. After serving out the war as
                    an army judge-advocate, Colonel Dudley came home to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> to practice law and work as a clerk of court and as a cashier of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> Savings Bank. His personality, combat record, missing leg, and penchant for
                    "bloody shirt" oratory made him popular among veterans and increasingly
                    influential in Republican politics as a minion <list type="footnotes">

                    Cleveland's 1884 victory and won praise for reforms that streamlined claims processing. In
                    1884 Dudley enjoyed some support among Indiana Republicans for the governorship but ultimately
                    decided to remain in <placeName>

                    Republican National Committee (RNC). He quickly became treasurer and for two years unwittingly
                    immortalized floaters in blocks of five. He later practiced law in <placeName>

            <p>Contemporary assessments, discounting the hyperbole of friends and foes in the wake of
                    Dudley's blocks-of-five gaffe, provide a portrait of an engaging and personally honorable
                    man whose intensely combative partisan zeal brought him to the brink of criminality. "A
                    thorough gentleman, upright in all his business and professional relations," Matilda
                    Gresham wrote of him, but "in politics he believed the end justified the means."
                    As a banker and lawyer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later even at the helm of the scandal-plagued Bureau of Pensions, he earned a
                    reputation for relative probity. As a political campaign operative, however, his reputation was
                    unsavory. "In the effective use of money for purchaseable votes," wrote defeated
                    1880 Democratic gubernatorial candidate <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Landers, "there is no man in the country superior to Colonel Dudley."
                    As historian H. Wayne Morgan has written, "If Dudley had a motto, it was ‘Vote
                    early and often.’ He was familiar in circles that counted
                    ‘persuasion’ more salutary than propaganda, and he did not shrink from the
                    two-dollar bill that took ‘floaters’ to the voting booth."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Dudley was well versed in such "competitive bidding" in 1880 and was certain that

                    to GOP leaders back home to urge preemptive measures: "Divide the floaters into blocks of
                    five, put a trusted man with the necessary funds in charge of these five and make him responsible
                    that none get away and that all vote our ticket." Democratic officials secured a copy from
                    a curious railroad clerk, and the closing days of the 1888 campaign were dominated by charges and
                    countercharges over Dudley's rash dictum. While Democratic speakers and newspapers
                    exploited his indiscretion, Dudley and other Republicans ingenuously declared the letter a forgery
                    and threatened retaliatory lawsuits, and an angry and thoroughly embarrassed Harrison moved to
                    distance himself and his campaign from the furor and from his old friend and lieutenant.
                    Nevertheless, "Blocks of Five" Dudley reigned improbably as an American political
                        celebrity.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the uproar, Dudley was patently no pioneer in political chicanery. Intensely polarized and
                    almost perfectly balanced in partisan strength, "venal Indiana" was notorious
                    during this period for bitterly contested, frequently corrupt elections with miniscule margins
                    between victory and defeat, margins often secured with the votes of nonresident or irregular
                    floaters at two to five dollars each. In a perceptive and persuasive study of the Dudley scandal,
                    historian James L. Baumgardner has argued that aggressive but surreptitious pursuit of the floater
                    vote, while simultaneously accusing the opposition of similar conduct, was standard practice for
                    both parties in Gilded Age Indiana. Moreover, Baumgardner's analysis of the 1888 returns
                    indicates that all but five Indiana counties voted altogether typically and that Democratic success
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> balanced abnormally high Republican turnouts in Carroll, Whitley, Ripley, and Perry
                    counties, which effectively dismisses the possibility that Dudley's missive held the key to
                    Harrison's 1888 Indiana margin. Concludes Baumgardner, Dudley's cardinal sin was
                    one of indiscretion, a violation of the code of silence on the commission of corrupt practices:
                    "It was one thing to be involved in corrupt practices; it was another to ‘rub it
                    in’ by seemingly openly advocating their use."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Whatever its configuration, Dudley's transgression continued to occupy the American
                    political limelight for more than two months in the wake of Harrison's narrow victory. It
                    was only after Dudley's blatant threat to "explode a lot of dynamite" on
                    GOP campaign machinations if made a scapegoat that frantic Republican topsiders quashed a pending
                    federal indictment for campaign fraud. By now a pariah of gargantuan proportions in administration
                    circles, Dudley managed to cling stubbornly to his position as RNC treasurer under Matthew Quay for
                    two more years until new allegations of unethical activities finally prompted his resignation, but
                    long before his eventual departure from the national political stage he had faded back into
                    obscurity as a public figure.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A noted exception to Dudley's rapid fade into oblivion was the cartoon art of Joseph

                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1876 by the Austrian-born Keppler as a German-language venture patterned upon the

                    and rapidly revolutionized the medium of American political cartooning. In contrast to the stark
                    black-and-white style and strident dogmatism of the legendary but fading <hi rend="i">Harper's Weekly</hi> pioneer Thomas Nast, Keppler and his <hi rend="i">Puck</hi>
                    lieutenants endowed their lithographed cover and centerfold cartoons with rainbow coloration, wry
                    tongue-in-cheek Viennese levity, and an affinity for elaborate scenes featuring caricatures by the
                    dozens. Keppler's cartoons exhibited in abundance what Nast's most conspicuously
                    lacked: a sense of humor that chided rather than condemned. Targets were cast not as Satanic
                    monsters but as droll grotesqueries, as barnyard animals or vegetables or as men clothed in female
                    finery, or even in such mildly risqué roles as ladies of the evening or pregnant brides.

            <p>Although <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> was born politically independent, its cartoons always represented
                    Keppler's abiding disdain for political organization in general and political corruption in
                    particular. He rivaled Nast in his hatred of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s notorious Tammany Hall, and on the national stage his favored foils were the
                    Ulysses S. Grant-Roscoe Conklin "Stalwart" Republicans and the various Bourbon
                    Democratic regimes of the South. Since the emergence of Grover Cleveland as a force in national
                    politics, however, Keppler had come increasingly to link political sleaze with Republican
                    opposition. For Keppler and other Cleveland loyalists, paid floaters in Indiana and
                    "colonial tramps" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> City provided a less painful rationale for defeat than did the reality that their party
                    had been thoroughly out-campaigned. For men of such mindset "Blocks of Five"
                    Dudley provided a precious resource in an ongoing campaign to vilify the Harrison presidency until
                    they could exact revenge in 1892.</p>
            <p>Dudley had begun his odyssey toward political infamy too late for Keppler to exploit as a cartoon
                    convention during the campaign, but in the four years that followed <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> artists
                    featured him with regularity, along with floaters and blocks of five, as generic symbols of
                    Republican corruption. Dudley's debut in the medium came in the <hi rend="i">Puck</hi>
                    centerfold "Uncle Sam's Thanksgiving <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tu">Turkey</region>

                    "hungry patriots" as Dudley, machine kingpins Thomas Collier Platt and Matt Quay,
                    and Star Route scandal culprits Stephen W. Dorsey and Thomas J. Brady. Keppler's January 9,
                    1889, centerfold, "The Woods are Full of Them," included Dudley among the many
                    Republican luminaries and rogues eyed for positions in the new administration by Harrison through
                    his spyglass. Although Keppler's caricature resembled Dudley in facial features, it
                    portrayed him standing on two sound legs, which was unusual after the prominence given by Dudley and

                    </placeName>. The first <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> cartoon to truly feature him, again on two healthy
                    legs, was C. Jay Taylor's centerfold of January 16, 1889, "When Harrison Sounds
                    that ‘Bugle Call’—the Friends of a Pure Ballot Will
                    Rally—As Above." Depicted were Dudley and his scroll—"Work
                    the Floaters in Blocks of Five"—representing satirical symbols of Republican
                    electoral purity; Quay with a barrel of campaign fund "fat," presumably fried from
                    protectionist industrialists to aid Harrison's cause; and prominent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> retailer and Harrison fundraiser John Wanamaker, with his $400,000
                        moneybag.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Harrison's government began to take shape, Dudley continued to grace <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> cartoons with regularity, in company with a cast of party regulars who tilted somewhat
                    toward the disreputable. A Keppler centerfold portrayed Dudley feasting upon a banquet of patronage
                    delicacies, and a Taylor cartoon featured him in Union officer's attire lined up with Quay,
                    Platt, and kindred souls under a White House sign "Promoters of Political Bribery Rewarded
                    Here." A Louis Dalrymple centerfold, while not picturing Dudley, included a circus
                    stepladder with one rung inscribed "Floaters in Blocks of Five." Another Keppler
                    centerfold, "The Triumph of Boodle," cast Dudley as a Roman centurion marching
                    alongside a bloated moneybags representation of Boodle, as another reveler held up a block-of-five
                    parade standard. Such color cartoons, which were all efforts to establish Dudley as a key player in
                    the new regime, surely reflected reality less than did Taylor's February 27 black-and-white
                    drawing "A Bad Dream—After the Ball." The cartoon depicted a Harrison
                    nightmare—an advancing mob of floaters inside blocks of five.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>It soon became obvious that Harrison, whose prickly propriety intensified after attaining the
                    presidency, had no place in his heart or his administration for his former cohort, who had first
                    imperiled his victory and then threatened naked political extortion to evade indictment. Frederick
                    Burr Opper's May 15 <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> centerfold, "Going Back on the
                    ‘Blocks of Five,’" lampooned Dudley's pariah status superbly
                    through a parody of William Shakespeare's <hi rend="i">Richard III.</hi> Harrison as
                    Richard proclaimed, "Thou troublest me. I am not in thy vein!" Dudley was the

                    contempt? Made I him King for <hi rend="i">this?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still another <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> commentary two weeks later referred to "the unspeakable

                    as disappointed "boomers" drifting back east empty-handed. One of only two <hi rend="i">Judge</hi> cartoons to feature Dudley, it followed the <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> practice

                    cartooning: it laughed at his banishment and yet continued through 1889 to portray him as an
                    administration mainstay. A Dalrymple centerfold parodied the Eiffel Tower with an "Awful
                    Tower" of Republican corruption; Harrison rested at the summit upon the shoulders of Dudley
                    and Quay. In other cartoons Dalrymple drew Dudley as an anti-civil service African native, as a
                    Harrison protectionist reveler indifferent to the suffering of unemployed factory workers, as a
                    worshiper of <placeName>

                    bundle of dirty laundry with Platt, Wanamaker, and Quay. Keppler featured him with other unsavory
                    Republican rogues and special interests that forced a perspiring Harrison to churn out jobs from a
                    patronage mill for party heelers and Grand Army of the Republic "boys in blue."
                    Opper drew him as a sidewalk carnival shill trying to gull Uncle Sam into buying a ticket to the

                    "blocks," and in some instances, they were linked directly to innocent parties
                    with more exalted standing in official circles. Especially victimized in this manner was Postmaster
                    General Wanamaker. Although a veritable pillar of probity, Wanamaker was apparently offensive to
                    Keppler, perhaps because of his fund-raising skills, mercantile background, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> roots, and ostentatious display of evangelical piety. A Taylor cartoon portrayed
                    Wanamaker pasting a Republican party elephant, head to foot, with broadside ads that imitated his
                    legendary drygoods promotions, including "Blocks of Five for Children." Similarly,
                    Dudley was not included with Wanamaker and others who were trying to keep a "Blocks of Five
                    Scandal" skeleton confined in a "Republican Family Closet." Appropriately
                    enough, Dalrymple's January 22, 1890, cartoon was entitled, "They Can't
                    Keep Him Hid!" A Keppler centerfold depicting the admission of new states as a picnic
                    featured a box of "Blocks of Five Cigars" but not Dudley himself. A savage Keppler
                    centerfold that castigated braying holier-than-thou jackasses Wanamaker and purity gadfly Anthony
                    Comstock (for Comstock's attempt to ban a Leo Tolstoy volume from the federal mail)
                    utilized a Wanamaker emporium backdrop and featured such specials as the volume <hi rend="i">How to
                        Make a President,</hi> by W. W. Dudley, and Wanamaker's "Patented Pictorial
                    Blocks of Five (to teach the alphabet of political morality)."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the blocks of five were taking on a separate symbolic identity in 1890 <hi rend="i">Puck</hi>
                    cartoons, Dudley remained in his own right a useful convention for Keppler and his artists. One
                    Keppler centerfold cast Dudley with Harrison, Wanamaker, Quay, and others as crewmen throwing
                    overboard the ballast of morality and reform ideas to lighten the load of the foundering clipper
                    ship <hi rend="i">Grand Old Party.</hi> Dudley's utility as a generic symbol of campaign
                    fraud grew even more attractive as the 1890 congressional contests neared. Taylor's
                    September 17 centerfold, "A Monument of Scandals," creatively caricatured the
                    Harrison administration as a human tower of corruption. The cartoon included Dudley holding a
                    figural block-of-five with the heads of a quintet of floaters. A Dalrymple centerfold that featured
                    long columns of farmers parading for tariff reduction placed Dudley in a protectionist balcony with
                    Harrison, Wanamaker, Quay, William McKinley, and others. Such efforts continued even after
                    Republicans lost control of Congress in 1890 and were put on the defensive for 1892. The October 28,
                    1891, Keppler cartoon, "Sizing It Up," featured Cleveland eyeing
                    Harrison's <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>By this time, however, Dudley was beginning to provoke the interest of cartoonists less for his old
                    indiscretions intended to elect Harrison in 1888 than for his new activities aimed at dumping him in
                    1892. Michener's unstinting efforts to reconcile his two close friends had not borne fruit,
                    and during the winter of 1890–1891 another incident had foreclosed any possibility of
                    such an event. Dudley, it seems, had purchased three acres of reclaimed swampland in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and immediately tripled his investment by selling the land for the new Government
                    Printing Office—all done at the assent of Secretary of the Treasury William Windom.
                    Alerted to the potential of a new Dudley scandal by Attorney General William H. H. Miller, Harrison
                    enlisted George Frisbee Hoar of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and Preston B. Plumb of <placeName>

                    </placeName> to annul the deal in the Senate after branding Dudley's venture in debate
                    "a little fishy" and exhibiting "certain badges of fraud."
                    Concurrently, Harrison finally secured the resignations of Dudley as RNC treasurer and Quay as RNC
                    chairman; the latter was an even greater embarrassment in the wake of a felony indictment for misuse
                    of public funds. The housecleaning did not come without cost to Harrison, however. Dudley and Quay
                    were soon working actively with Platt, Russell A. Alger, and J. Donald Cameron as leaders of an
                    anybody-but-Harrison movement for 1892.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    James G. Blaine. Keppler's immediate response was to avoid taking sides in a Republican

                    symbolic of the party's endemic ethical shortcomings. A panel in an Opper Thanksgiving

            <p>As the 1892 campaign unfolded, however, <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> managed to malign both Blaine and
                    Harrison with the onus of Dudley and Quay. The latter pair were portrayed in a Keppler centerfold
                    among the "Ancient Order of Blainiacs" pushing their champion into the fray in a
                    wheelchair. A black-and-white cartoon drawn by Keppler's son Udo featured Dudley, Quay,
                    James S. Clarkson, and Joseph B. Foraker as assassins lurking with daggers behind White House
                    pillars for an assault on Harrison. <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> solicitude toward Harrison was short
                    lived, however, for once he became the Republican standard-bearer for 1892, cartoon after cartoon
                    down the homestretch vilified him as master of spoils statecraft and the beneficiary of campaign
                    corruption exemplified by "Blocks of Five" Dudley. A Keppler centerfold parody
                    upon Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier's painting <hi rend="i">The Last Review</hi> depicted
                    Harrison on a wooden hobbyhorse reviewing a loyal army of protected trusts, corrupt lobbyists and
                    pension agents, tariff-fattened tycoons, and men identified by their banner as "Floaters in
                    Blocks of Five." An October 5 Dalrymple centerfold, "The Great Republican
                    Bluff," featured Harrison sanctimoniously proclaiming the GOP a "party of purity
                    and righteousness," obscuring a Republican Supremacy monument exalting King Boodle on a
                    platform held up by various figures and symbols of party infamy, including Dudley and five numbered
                        blocks.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>"The Great Republican Bluff" marked Dudley's final appearance as a color
                    cartoon caricature, although his legacy as founding father of blocks of five and floaters lived on
                    monochromatically for another season. An October Keppler centerfold portrayed Quay lieutenant David
                    Martin, whom the Democratic press was promoting as the Dudley of 1892, holding out for GOP pharisees
                    filing into church with a sack inscribed "Republican Fund to Buy Floaters." <hi rend="i">Puck'</hi> s other nominee for honors as 1892 "son of
                    Dudley" was Thomas H. Carter of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>, who was vulnerable as chairman of the Republican National Committee and
                    Harrison's reelection effort despite his spotless reputation. An Opper election-eve
                    centerfold cast Carter as Boodle deploying the "Republican Corruption Fund" to
                    "work blocks of five" and "to buy floaters." Several weeks after
                    the Harrison defeat, a Keppler centerfold included in the wreckage of the Republican campaign a red
                    block sporting the numeral <hi rend="i">5</hi>.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ended the legacy of William Wade Dudley and his infamous blocks of five in American political
                    cartoon art. A peripheral player at best, without the notoriety or significance of such miscreants
                    as William M. Tweed or, for a later generation, Richard M. Nixon, Dudley lacked the stature to
                    develop into an enduring, generic symbol of sleaze in American politics.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> His
                    infamy, and by implication Indiana's infamy, lasted less than four years. And yet for that
                    short season Dudley proved almost uniquely useful to <hi rend="i">Puck</hi> cartoonists eager to
                    portray his Republican party as a cesspool of spoils, special interests, and campaign corruption.
                    Keppler and his staff artists utilized many Republicans in that effort. In a majority of instances,
                    including their sustained sorties against such figures as Harrison, Carter, and Wanamaker, creative
                    character assassination was compromised by the ethical probity of the figures targeted. Even with
                    the likes of Quay, Platt, and Blaine, suspect reputations were balanced by lofty titles, positions
                    on the salient issues of the day, and in some cases by praiseworthy deeds. Dudley, however, was
                    unsullied by great honors, thoughts, or deeds. An obscure figure, his renown had come completely
                    through his advocacy of floaters deployed in blocks of five to deny the integrity of the democratic
                    process. Rarely in two centuries of American political cartooning has partisan art been afforded the
                    luxury of such a faithful imitation of life.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana Historical Society, 1990. Pp. xv, 286. Illustrations, notes, select
                    bibliography, index. $19.95.)</head>
            <p>Indiana native Gene Stratton-Porter was the premier symbol of "nature lover" for an
                    entire generation of readers early in the twentieth century. As a popularizer of natural history for
                    the masses, she has no equal. Combining a love of storytelling inherited from her father with a
                    genuine interest in nature, she spun out best seller after best seller. She was, in fact, one of the
                    last romantic writers, an "apostle … of the Impossibly Virtuous" (p.
                    7), as one person said.</p>
            <p>But because she wrote neither literary nor natural history classics, she has remained in limbo,
                    ignored but not forgotten. The late Judith Reick Long, convinced that Gene
                    Stratton-Porter's influence on reshaping the national perspective toward nature was every
                    bit as powerful as that of Theodore Roosevelt's, has written the first in-depth biography
                    of this charismatic woman. The product of a thirty-five-year interest, Long's book will
                    provide an introduction to Stratton-Porter as a latent feminist, frustrated with her role in life
                    but unable to become either a focused naturalist or a literary novelist.</p>
            <p>"She was," Long writes, "a master of the whopper, at first assessment
                    seemingly even a victim of self-deceit, who appears to have believed the fairy tales she liked to
                    concoct about her early homelife and her supposedly harmonious family relationships. Shortcomings
                    aside, however, this consummate prevaricator emerges predominantly as a perennial child with a zest
                    for life and a boundless expectation for what she might accomplish" (p. 18).</p>
            <p>That said, the reader expects Long to progress beyond a mere narration of Stratton-Porter's
                    life. Yet she rarely does more than mention what Stratton-Porter did, with few attempts to analyze
                    why. For instance, why did she treat her husband so badly, finally even leaving him to move to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and not even mentioning him in her will? Long, herself, seems puzzled by this, writing,
                    "How ironic. Charles Porter was the only person who ever cared enough about Gene Stratton
                    to give her what she needed most … her personal freedom" (p. 253). Granted
                    Stratton-Porter was a complex, even "unsound," person as Long says in her
                    excellent first chapter. And she may have continually doctored her own papers and interviews to
                    reflect the person she wanted to be known as <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-087-4-054"/> instead of the
                    person she was, making it impossible for Long to sift fact from fancy. But Long also fails to
                    convince the reader of Stratton-Porter's skills as a novelist and a naturalist. Since most
                    modern readers know little about the writer's work, Long could have spent more time
                    discussing her books and her natural history research. She seems to presume that everyone has read
                    Stratton-Porter's novels, dismissing each one—even the most
                    famous—with a sentence or two.</p>
            <p>Long does no better with Stratton-Porter's nonfiction books and makes little mention of <hi rend="i">Moths of the Limberlost</hi> (1912), one of Stratton-Porter's best nature
                    books. Probably that is because Long herself was no naturalist. To write a book celebrating a
                    naturalist without using the correct, popular names of the creatures, as Long does with annoying
                        frequency—<hi rend="i">i.e.,</hi> "cacklers and loud honkers" (p.
                    31) instead of, one presumes, "<placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> geese"; "wild pigeons" (p. 46) for "passenger
                    pigeons"; "indigo finch" (p. 120) rather than "indigo
                    bunting"—is to diminish the subject matter.</p>
            <p>In contrast, nature writer Paul Brooks, in his book <hi rend="i">Speaking for Nature</hi> (1980), is
                    able to capture Stratton-Porter's inherent love of and interest in nature and natural
                    processes with only a few well-chosen examples from her journals and books. Imagine a woman so
                    involved in her research on moths while she was writing <hi rend="i">Moths of the Limberlost</hi>
                    that she slept with a pinned cocoon close to her pillow because it was ready to emerge, according to
                    Brooks.</p>
            <p>Long, like her subject, seems to get caught up in fame and fortune and relegates
                    Stratton-Porter's books to numbers sold and money earned. Why did
                    Stratton-Porter's books influence the ordinary person to be interested in nature? What was
                    her expertise as a naturalist? Long never answers either question satisfactorily.</p>
            <p>The reader is left with the impression that Stratton-Porter was nothing more than a self-centered
                    promoter of herself, an opportunist who used nature as a metaphor for human virtue and who used
                    people, when it suited her, for her own purposes, and then tossed them aside, as she did her
                    husband, a husband Long earlier described as generously helping her in her research work in the
                    swamp, providing critiques of her writing at Stratton-Porter's request, and letting her be
                    her own person.</p>
            <p>But perhaps that is the conclusion Long wishes readers to reach. If so, she has succeeded admirably
                    in trivializing Stratton-Porter as a novelist and naturalist, leaving no doubt in this
                    reader's mind that neither her novels nor her nature books are worth reading and that she
                    deserves to be remembered only as an early twentieth-century phenomenon—a quintessential
                    writer of best sellers who wrote what the people wanted to read.</p>

            <p>Both Stein children left legacies worthy of further scholarly pursuit. Orth (1862–1901)
                    was a brilliant and erratic journalist who traveled across America leaving scandals and one dead
                    body behind. He worked for newspapers in many cities from Indiana to <placeName>

                    wrote many books for children, including the very successful <hi rend="i">Little Shepherd of

            <p>Kriebel's book is strong on description but short on analysis. He weaves the four lives
                    together in a linear manner with scant attention to cause and motivation. He also leaves large gaps
                    about which readers can only speculate. The limited bibliography suggests that the author may not
                    have located sufficient materials to flesh out the bare bones of their lives. Kriebel quotes
                    frequently from the Stein writings, a logical technique for literary subjects. More comparison of
                    their work with that of their contemporaries would have been helpful, however. The author's
                    prose is brisk but sometimes gets overheated. His principals wallow, warble, rumble, squat, thunder,
                    buzz, trot, and rattle, and the effect is, ultimately, exhausting. Their lives were exciting enough
                    without accelerating the pace posthumously.</p>
            <p>With minor caveats, Kriebel's work is worthy and Indiana is richer for having a record of
                    the Steins, even this abbreviated version. Historians will lament that footnotes are in the back of
                    the book and that some of them are vague regarding locations of manuscripts cited therein. Purdue
                    University Press has done a competent job with the production: mistakes are few, illustrations are
                    generally well reproduced, and the index is adequate. For $16.50, <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-087-4-056"/> it would be ungracious to quibble too much about this pleasant and

            <p>This book is not so much a biography as a celebration of life. It expresses the values of its author
                    as much as the values of its subject. Harlan Hubbard, student of life and artist of a beloved
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, provides the focus for essayist Wendell Berry's latest exploration into the
                    relationships among people and environment and locality. That the two men shared many values and
                    that the younger author's view of the world was influenced by his older subject (in
                    respectful relationship rather like student and teacher) makes for an impassioned narrative artfully
                    rendered.</p>
            <p>Chapters stand as carefully crafted vignettes placing Hubbard into context. Here was a day laborer
                    who painted, but who also read, wrote, played the violin, took long walks through the countryside,
                    canoed and boated on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, worked with wood as a skilled carpenter,
                    and kept bees. Hubbard, as a latter-day Henry David Thoreau, sought his own special, independent
                    relationship both with nature and with society. According to Berry, Hubbard's life
                    represented a habitual willingness to reconsider fundamentally modern society and its uses of
                    nature. "His effort was to move backward along the line of technological development toward
                    a complex practical orientation to the landscape," a course that constituted
                    "reuniting in his life many of the modern divisions of labor" (p. 28).</p>
            <p>Outlined are Hubbard's eccentric bachelorhood, his marriage to Anna Eikenhout (his partner
                    of forty-three years), their yearlong trip down the <placeName>

                    partnership of two extraordinary people, and if the book can be said to have a shortcoming, it is
                    that Anna, as one of the partners, seems to be made overly secondary to her husband. Together at
                    Payne Hollow they sought fully to respect its "essential dignity and integrity" as
                    a place (p. 88) through the buildings they built, the gardens they tended, and the wilder aspects of
                    nature they spared. They, not <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-087-4-057"/> Harlan alone, sought to take
                    "life directly and lovingly from the country, and thus to belong to it" (p. 89).</p>
            <p>The message is clear. Locality (and the distinctions and peculiarities of locality) counts. Familiar
                    landscapes can never be exhausted as sources of inspiration. Awareness of place can be made a
                    central focus of life.</p>

            <p>Published on the centennial of Thomas Hart Benton's birth, this collection of eight essays
                    ranges in style from erudite to chatty and in content from psychohistory to personal reminiscences,
                    all devoted to the substance and interpretations of Benton's major murals, but not to his
                    artistic style. As such, the book provides little basic biographical information, except for the
                    discussion of Benton's "rejection of modernism and the left," a rejection
                    based upon a Freudian interpretation of the artist's relationship with his father (p. xii).</p>
            <p>However, the essays are provocative enough to arouse the interest of some readers, making them want
                    to pursue one of the biographical works available on Benton or one of Benton's

                    exploiting Indians, Eugene V. Debs speaking to a group of workers, and a Ku Klux Klan rally, Matthew
                    Baigell discusses the murals in his essay, "Benton and the Left," to support his
                    position that Benton's early proleftist political leanings can be found in his art. The

                    with many of Benton's paintings, this volume provides insight into the views of a central

            <p>In August, 1908, a two-day riot rocked the city of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. It
                    began at the jail where two black men were believed to be awaiting trial, one for raping a white
                    woman, the other for murdering a white man. Angry whites gathered outside the jail, demanding that
                    the prisoners be released to them. When the mob discovered that the men had been secretly removed,
                    it turned on the black community instead. Before the violence ended, white rioters lynched two black
                    men and destroyed many blocks of African-American businesses and homes.</p>
            <p>In this book, Roberta Senechal deconstructs the riot, closely analyzing the events as well as the
                    participants and victims. Her approach departs from other studies of race riots, which have
                    generally drawn on social-strain theory and attributed antiblack violence to tension caused by rapid
                    change. Race relations, Senechal notes, were relatively stable in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> around 1908. Social strain, moreover, does not explain why some whites rioted while
                    others did not.</p>
            <p>Class differences and racial concerns shaped by class, Senechal argues, are central to understanding
                    the violence. As the riot progressed, poor whites dominated, and they carefully targeted victims,
                    generally choosing successful African Americans. The presence of a few successful blacks did not
                    disturb better-off whites, whose class assured their status in relation to the majority of African
                    Americans—the majority, after all, was poor. Because of a segregated labor market, blacks
                    posed no real economic threat to poor whites. Yet poor whites felt threatened by black achievement.
                        <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-087-4-059"/> They also resented elite whites' indifference
                    toward more restrictive racial measures, and thus, the riot revealed class tensions among whites as
                    well. Better-off whites, however, contributed to the riot more than they cared to admit, even though
                    they tried to distance themselves from it. They first applauded the riot as racial
                    "reform" and then refused to acknowledge the racial tensions underlying the
                    violence.</p>
            <p>While Senechal convincingly argues that the riot suggests the existence of different racial
                    ideologies, she leaves some important areas unexplored. She primarily focuses on the ways these
                    ideologies were expressed and does not fully explore their content. It is not clear, for instance,
                    whether whites expressed the same ideas in different ways during the riot or whether their actions
                    represented fundamentally different ideas about race. Nonetheless, Senechal's analysis of
                    the riot is compelling. Ultimately her work goes beyond an exploration of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s race riot to provide telling insights into the larger issue of race

                    cultural forces shaping the institution. The <placeName>

                    "freak vegetables" (p. 20) generated more interest. Fair managers realized greater
                    crowds and profits resulted from displaying novelties and exciting competitions between horses or
                    machines. More explanation on the nature of nineteenth-century fair competitions and the rise of
                    spectators in leisure culture would enhance her discussion.</p>
            <p>By the 1880s "the new professionalism of <placeName>

                    </placeName> agriculture" (p. 37) facilitated the modern agricultural fair. The flourishing
                    fair embodied rural-urban tensions as new entertainment jarred with traditional agricultural
                    exhibitions advocated by fair purists. Social reformers questioned the morality of lady cyclists and
                    freak shows, worrying that they tainted fair-going youth and agricultural betterment. Marling
                    analyzes the role of women and reform at the fair and new definitions of womanhood in rural culture.
                    Women showed their domestic productions and were important to the fair's success. Male fair
                    supervisors wanted farm women's participation to "counter the emergence of a new,

                    wonderful illustrations of changes in fair architecture and the mosaic of far exhibitions. Social

            <p>Mark E. Neely, Jr., has written an important book that explores the record of President Abraham
                    Lincoln's maintenance of order and security during the Civil War. He studies arbitrary
                    arrest and military trial, topics not systematically treated since James G. Randall's <hi rend="i">Constitutional Problems under Lincoln</hi> (1926). His research is broad and deep, not
                    only in range of the usual primary materials but in a massive amount of sources in the National
                    Archives on specific cases, hitherto unused.</p>
            <p>Each of the several chapters is an informative essay: on worrisome <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, on Lincoln's rationale of emergency power, on the character and numbers of
                    actual cases, on the darker side of the story, and on the historical significance of the policies.
                    This is a compact volume, requiring careful reading, and cannot be summarized in brief form, though
                    a couple of highlights ought to be noticed.</p>
            <p>Neely can confidently generalize on types of cases, the preponderant part of them involving persons
                    from the Confederate South (blockade runners, contraband traders, guerrillas) and not northern
                    citizens committing sedition and raising free-speech questions, thus contrary to views of previous
                    historians. As for the perennial puzzle about numbers of cases, he concludes there were
                    "far more" than the traditional figure of thirteen thousand. He counted up to
                    fourteen thousand and then stopped because he was more interested in substantive features.</p>
            <p>His assessment is moderate, rather cautious. He recognizes the imperatives of controlling disorder
                    and winning the war, but he sees the darker side of sloppy, unjust administration, the instances of
                    torture and anti-Semitism, even the willingness to hold hostages. And on the key case from Indiana,
                    that of <hi rend="i">Milligan,</hi> invalidating military trial in peaceful areas of the Union, he
                    says the famous decision is "irrelevant" to future protection of civil rights. <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-087-4-062"/> The only lesson from that episode, and for that matter the
                    whole wartime policy, he believes, is that there is "no clear lesson." One feels
                    Neely would not protest too much a rejoinder that this conclusion remains debatable.</p>

            <p>History has not been kind to General John Henry Winder. He has been portrayed as a dictator who
                    established a reign of terror while provost marshal general of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and as a brutal, inhumane fiend responsible for the fate of Union prisoners at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Libby</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Andersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Arch Fredric Blakey believes this image is inaccurate and incomplete. In this volume, reportedly the
                    first biography of Winder to examine his antebellum career, the author attempts to rescue a villain
                    from history, to overturn a historical myth.</p>
            <p>In trying to alter Winder's reputation, Blakey wisely avoids picturing the general as a
                    saint. Instead, he describes Winder as abrupt, abrasive, arrogant, vain, short-tempered, impulsive,
                    stubborn, profane, and aloof. At the same time, Winder is also characterized as loyal, somewhat
                    innovative, moderately flexible, honest, efficient, and courageous. He is seen as highly qualified
                    by training and experience for the responsibilities he had during the Civil War. And most important
                    to Blakey, Winder was neither cruel nor vindictive, and to describe him as either is totally untrue.</p>
            <p>One of Blakey's clearest contributions is to demonstrate that Winder often found himself in
                    a catch-22 situation; no matter what he did, he would be criticized. For instance, at the same time
                    he was being castigated in the northern press for treating the prisoners inhumanely, he was being
                    maligned in the southern press for pampering the prisoners and for showing them undue leniency.</p>
            <p>The author aptly points out that much of Winder's troubles were beyond his power to correct.
                    The Confederacy never mobilized the necessary resources nor established an efficient system of
                    prison organization. The inability of the two governments to agree to a general exchange doomed
                    prison reform. Overcrowded conditions, clothing shortages, and insufficient food are all viewed as
                    problems created by others, not Winder. There is truth in all this, but the author has a troublesome
                    tendency to brush aside too lightly some of the criticism of Winder and to spread the blame so
                    widely as to remove nearly all sense of wrongdoing on Winder's part.</p>
            <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-087-4-063"/>
            <p>The monograph is clearly written and provides its readers with a thorough account of
                    Winder's life, his own liabilities, and the limitations under which he operated, all of
                    which may cause some to modify their evaluation of the controversial general. It remains to be seen
                    if Blakey's book brings about any significant reevaluation of Winder.</p>

            <p>While it may be unwise to judge a book by its cover, in the case of Joseph E. Stevens's
                    guide to American battlefield parks, happily the contents are equally as absorbing and gripping as
                    the jacket front's striking artistic color recreation of a scene from the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In thirty-eight chapters, one for each battle-field park administered by the National
                    Park Service, Stevens surveys much of America's military heritage, beginning with the
                    American Revolution and ending with the War in the Pacific Historical Park in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gu">Guam</region>

                    real-life experiences of the participants.</p>
            <p>With the traveler in mind, the chapters are arranged geographically: North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic,
                    Midwest, South, and West. By far the largest number—nineteen—are southern
                    Civil War battlefield parks. Each chapter is also geared to the park visitor. A box insert gives
                    directions to the park, availability of gas, food and lodging, and information on handicapped access
                    and park activities. The guide offers detailed, self-guided walking and auto tours keyed to National
                    Park Service numbered tour stops. Fifty-two clear and simple maps, prepared by Beth Silverman,
                    indicate present-day roads, trails, and visitor facilities. Visuals also include eighty drawings,
                    paintings, and modern and historic photographs.</p>
            <p>Each battle is faithfully and skillfully recreated in an engaging narrative style. Stevens gives the
                    background, strategy, tactics, and significance of the engagements. In nineteen pages the battle at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> comes alive, and the carnage—51,000 casualties in three days—is
                    poignantly portrayed. The twelve pages on Vicksburg, another turning point of the war, include a
                    wartime lithograph showing Union forces firing at the forts around Vicksburg <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-087-4-064"/> and a wartime photograph of the Union ironclad <hi rend="i">Cairo,</hi>
                    sent to the river bottom in 1862, salvaged a hundred years later and currently on display. The only
                    Midwest entry is George Rogers Clark National Historical Park, which stands on the site of old Fort
                    Sackville in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The park commemorates the seizure of the fort from the British on February
                    25, 1779, and the role of the Clark expedition in conquering the old Northwest Territory. Stevens
                    graphically portrays the successful siege of the fort by Clark and his men after they had spent
                    eighteen days slogging through freezing mud and wading chest deep in icy water.</p>
            <p>The narrative is a mix of the heroic and the tragic. The human dimension is ever-present. A letter
                    written by a dying son to his father during the twenty hours of nonstop savagery at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spotsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> is reproduced. Some of the photographs are worth a thousand words: the dead among
                    shattered trees on the slope of Little Round Top at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

                    one of George Custer's men fell; Union infantrymen sitting in a trench, waiting for orders
                    to advance.</p>
            <p>The guide is a treasure for anyone who plans to visit battlefield parks. It will make tours more
                    rewarding and more easily manageable. It is readable and comprehensive enough, however, to appeal to
                    a wider audience. It makes great armchair reading for the sedentary who love dramatic and
                    well-crafted historical writing.</p>

            <p>In this insightful selection of Lincolniana editor Waldo Branden presents eulogies and ceremonial
                    tributes that have contributed to a prevailing Lincoln mythology. For some seven generations
                    politicians and preachers have been getting "right with Lincoln," as the late
                    Senator Everett Dirksen once astutely noted. In this process of getting right, political and
                    spiritual leaders have created an atmosphere that permits little if anything to despoil the
                    Emancipator's sainted memory, thereby successfully securing the mythos of this epic hero in
                    the American mind.</p>
            <p>In a perceptive introductory essay Braden notes the change in public sentiment from a
                    "maligned Old Abe" to his "personification" as "Father
                    Abraham" and "Savior of the Republic" (p. 1). Explanatory <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-087-4-065"/> commentary gives meaningful detail about speaker, audience, and
                    occasion for each of the selected twenty-three speeches. The texts reveal a rhetorical artistry that
                    flourished in contributing to the legend. Two of the leading eulogists, like Lincoln, spent
                    significant periods of their lives in frontier Indiana. Henry Ward Beecher's first
                    pastorates were in <placeName>

                    Bishop Matthew Simpson, onetime president of Asbury (DePauw) College in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was selected to deliver "the final benediction" at the open vault in
                        <geogName>Oak Hill</geogName> Cemetery, Spring-field. Lincoln's rail-splitter heritage
                    became a cherished feature of the mythology. Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized this frontier influence
                    "upon the American character," anticipating the thinking of Frederick Jackson
                    Turner (p. 28).</p>
            <p>Four presidents are included among the selected ceremonial orators (James A. Garfield, Theodore
                    Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and William Howard Taft). Four others ran for the presidency. Democrats,
                    unlikely eulogists in the immediate postbellum period, became entirely acceptable as public
                    sentiment shifted, ultimately enabling Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo in 1986 to proclaim before a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> audience of scholars and politicians that honoring Lincoln was "beyond the
                    scope of partisan politics." In an eloquent address Cuomo proclaimed, "We have
                    lifted Lincoln to the very pinnacle of our national memory…. We have chiseled his face on
                    the side of a mountain, making him appear as a voice in the heavens" (p. 233).</p>
            <p>Ceremonial oratory resounds with sainthood, martyrdom, and "epic grandeur," but
                    seldom is there a whisper of the apocalyptic cost of warfare. Elihu Root came closest to describing
                    the cost when he quoted the words of Lincoln to Mrs. Bixby, mentioning "the solemn
                    pride" of having "laid so costly a sacrifice" as five sons "upon
                    the altar of freedom" (p. 201). Braden's excellent book illumines not only Lincoln
                    but the thought of postwar generations that followed him.</p>

            <p>Residents of the Midwest, where interurban railways made a powerful impact in the first few decades

                    which contains two narratives of interurban travel in the lush years. One of these contributions,
                    "Riding the Interurban," is a 1909 account of a trip over electrified lines

            <p>Of the three aspects of American modernism's trinity—liberty, equality,
                    fraternity—the last might be the most difficult to realize. Liberty, as freedom from
                    restraint and as self-generated activity, is well known in the nation's past and present.
                    The historic struggle to define equality remains current too. Fraternity or community, however, is
                    difficult to trace from the past to the present, except in some form of nationalism.</p>
            <p>Now Casey Nelson Blake has investigated the problem of community in the writings of four well-known
                    intellectuals from the first half of the twentieth century. The result is a finely crafted book up
                    to a point; the only criticism is the choppy presentation of biographical and literary material. A
                    chronology of each man and his major books would have been handy along with the old mundane business
                    of birth and death dates.</p>
            <p>This critical comment is not fatal to Blake's presentation. The chapters are well organized
                    with a strong clear theme. The book is well written. And the thesis is of historiographic
                    importance. Bourne, Brooks, Frank, and Mumford were radical critics who sought a
                    "communitarian vision of self-realization through participation in a democratic
                    culture" (p. 2).</p>
            <p>Blake's argument is advanced along two interpretative lines: romantic critique of capitalism
                    and civic republicanism (another popular theme in American scholarship today). He does a better job
                    of exploring the first line of inquiry. Finding examples of civic humanism among twentieth-century
                    writers is a very difficult task, especially among progressives who were displeased with Marxism and
                    also with the culture of consumerism that debuted in the 1920s.</p>
            <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-087-4-068"/>
            <p>Collectively known as Young Americans, these writers desired the impossible. "The ideal of
                    an interactive self," Blake writes, "reshaping its own consciousness as it
                    humanized the environment, of the craftsman uniting knowledge and action through a collective
                    practice, remained the Young American's most powerful alternative to the culture of
                    industrialism" (p. 180). Together they discounted the pragmatism of John Dewey as morally
                    suspect due to his support of America's entry into the Great War.</p>
            <p>More mystic than modernist, particularly Frank and Brooks, they sought a "usable
                    past," one that would illuminate the future. It was not possible. Ralph Waldo Emerson and
                    transcendentalism failed them. Never attracted to relativism, they sought some historically based
                    creed about culture and contributions of aware citizens. As Blake reveals in a first-rate analysis,
                    the Young Americans wanted political radicalism—egalitarian and
                    participatory—and cultural radicalism in which not all cultural forms were equal and in
                    which radical intellectuals helped shape a community of hierarchical values.</p>
            <p>Blake shows that the consequences of their literary and philosophical efforts were limited.
                    Bourne's writings had a brief revival among the New Left and peace groups. Frank has no
                    followers today, and historical and architectural writings have moved beyond Brooks and Mumford.
                    They do have in Blake, however, an interested and outstanding historian to tell their collective
                    story.</p>

                    Bartlett); single-subject works (<hi rend="i">e.g., Ragbag of Legal</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Quotations</hi>); single-person quotation books (Shakespeare and other well-known
                    authors, of course, but one would be amazed at some of the persons whose words have been collected
                    and organized for posterity—Spiro Agnew and Mae West, for example); dictionaries
                    containing quotations, such as the <hi rend="i">Oxford English Dictionary;</hi> concordances to
                    English-language authors; keyword, first- and last-line indexes to quotations; hints on a strategy
                    for searching; searching classical and foreign quotations; and finally, a very helpful annotated
                    bibliography of books of quotations and of other reference materials useful for searching
                    quotations. Only one notable omission from the extensive listing was found—books of
                    quotations by women. They have been seriously underrepresented in most collections of quotations.</p>
            <p>The book is intended for the "person just now beginning to need to know how to identify the

                    "should provide a useful review of helpful materials, some information about reference
                    tools not yet examined or long since forgotten, and a handy bibliography" (p. x). While
                    most historians probably fall somewhere between the two groups, there is undoubtedly not a single

            <p>The range of Thomas J. Schlereth's interests in aspects of American history is a challenge
                    to a reviewer of <hi rend="i">Cultural History and Material Culture,</hi> although the title and
                    subtitle manage to establish some limits. There are familiar things here for scholars, teachers, and
                    museum curators who are acquainted with Schlereth's work, for this book is largely a
                    collection of previously published articles and essays. Many of these, however, appeared in
                    newsletters and conference proceedings that could be difficult to locate, so it is a truly valuable
                    service to include this collection in the excellent <hi rend="i">American Material Culture and
                        Folklife</hi> series. Schlereth imposes order on the selections in several ways. One is to
                    divide the book into three parts: <hi rend="i">Everyday Life,</hi> including "Plants
                    Past," "Mail-Order Catalogs," "Material Culture of
                    Childhood," "Artisans in the New Republic," and a new (and delightful)
                    essay, "The World and Workers of the Paper Empire"; <hi rend="i">Public</hi>
                    <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-087-4-070"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Landscapes,</hi> including "The City as Artifact," "The <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Presence on the Midwest Landscape," "Chautauqua,"
                    "City Planning as Progressive Reform," and "The Material Universe of
                    American World Expositions"; and <hi rend="i">Museums as Artifacts,</hi> including
                    "The History behind, within and outside the History Museum," "Pioneers of
                    Material Culture," the revolutionary "It Wasn't That Simple,"
                    "Causing Conflict, Doing Violence," and a recent theoretical and methodological
                    essay on "History Museums and Material Culture."</p>
            <p>The last essay may be where some readers, such as teachers in graduate programs in American studies,
                    history, and muscology may choose to begin, because it is more than a comprehensive survey of the
                    field of material culture studies; Schlereth has worked out two paradigmatic charts, one that
                    classifies and compares the historical emphases of this fairly recent branch of study and the other
                    doing the same for current trends in research. These paradigms incorporate brief lists of published
                    works that represent the subject matter and methods of each category. In short, this chapter
                    encapsulates the history and current state of the study of material culture as done in the academy
                    and in museums.</p>
            <p>Most readers, though, will prefer to start at the beginning, drawn into each essay by
                    Schlereth's frankly personal forewords, his engagingly clear style, and by sheer curiosity
                    about how the author will give meaning to the many illustrations drawn from family albums,
                    advertisements, certificates, maps and historic paintings, engravings and photographs. Each essay
                    illuminates these by showing how to read simple visual and material data and how to understand them
                    in the broader contexts of significant human values and concerns.</p>
            <p>For Schlereth's encyclopedic bibliographic references alone, this book should be in every
                    historical society and on every American history scholar's desk, but even more it is worth
                    returning to for guidance in researching, interpreting, and appreciating the material things of the
                    natural and cultural environments.</p>

            <p>Victoria Brehm, who holds a Master's License for Great Lakes and Inland Waters, has
                    assembled and edited a marvelous collection of tales about the Great Lakes, ranging from Native
                    American stories to twentieth-century fiction. Most of her selections represent <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-087-4-071"/> pieces of larger works. What binds this collection together is a
                    continuing effort to make sense of place—to examine, to explain, to understand the
                    interplay between people and the lakes that make up a freshwater sea in the midst of a continent.</p>
            <p>Brehm argues in her introduction that the literature of the Great Lakes is unique and not merely an
                    imitation of the more popular and widely read stories of the saltwater seas. Place has been a key
                    variable in shaping the tales of the lakes, many of which were "inspired by the paradox of
                    sailing a sea in the midst of a continent, where a seven-hundred-foot ship loaded with wheat from
                    the tranquil farms nearby can be ripped apart by a gale worthy of the North Atlantic" (p.
                    3). According to Brehm, stories of storms, shipwrecks, and disasters ran counter to American and
                    Canadian beliefs in the conquest and control of the continent. As a result, much of the fiction
                    about the lakes ended up in obscure publications.</p>
            <p>Victoria Brehm has divided <hi rend="i">Sweetwater, Storms, and Spirits</hi> into five thematic
                    sections: "Masters and Men," "St. Elmo's Fire,"
                    "Fishermen," "Lighthouses and Lockkeepers," and "White
                    Squall." The twenty selections that comprise these sections include collected Ojibwa and
                    Menomini myths and tales, anonymous stories, and signed articles. Many of Brehm's
                    selections address the challenges of navigation on the lakes—in wooden three-masted
                    schooners in the nineteenth century and in steel, propeller-driven, bulk carriers in the twentieth.
                    Not surprisingly, most of the author's and characters are male, but Brehm has added depth
                    by including a few stories by and about women.</p>
            <p>The selections in <hi rend="i">Sweetwater, Storms, and Spirits</hi> are interesting, and they add a
                    useful dimension to what is known about the history of the Great Lakes. History, fiction, and myth
                    are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The stories in this volume contain some historical
                    information, but more importantly, like "objective" history they forge connections
                    between past and present. They help the reader understand how people in the past struggled to come
                    to terms with their relationship with the lakes, and they assist in understanding that relationship
                    in the present. Some readers might wish for an index, but that aside, the collection offered by
                    Brehm is satisfying indeed.</p>

                    Englishman Graham Hutton (1904–1988) through this work first published in 1946
                    established himself as an unusually perceptive, if sympathetic, interpreter of the <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-087-4-073"/> American Midwest, a land for him of extremes, of paradoxes, of immense
                    size and diversity, and of endless fascination. During World War II he directed the Office of

                    region" (p. 341) of the country. Modern readers will be struck by Hutton's ability
                    to weave the past into the present, to reveal how close the region remained to its pioneer origins
                    in 1946, and by the accuracy of his predictions nearly half a century ago. Northern <placeName>

                    drew on years of experience as director of a Lincoln library/museum and on canny historical
                    imagination to write an accessible and useful history of Abraham Lincoln's early life in
                    Indiana. Documentation for Lincoln's youth is scarce, and Warren's reconstruction,
                    based on a combination of oral history, local histotry, and popular psychology, is the most
                    convincing argument one is likely to find. Warren's command of local history is

                    William Ganson Rose traces Cleveland's year-by-year development from a pioneer settlement
                    on the Western Reserve to what he describes as the best location in the nation. His romanticized
                    vignettes and illustrations highlight Cleveland's successful individuals, institutions, and
                    events. Rose's omission of racial, ethnic, and labor controversy is not an omission of
                    neglect but rather a conscious elimination of inappropriate content for the city's
                    sesquicentennial booster history written at the onset of the cold war. <hi rend="i">Chrystyna Huk,

            <p>The State Archives will publish updates of <hi rend="i">A Biographical Directory of the Indiana
                        General Assembly</hi> every ten years beginning in 1995. Justin E. Walsh and Alan F. January,
                    the principal authors/editors of the two volumes published in 1980 and 1984 as part of the
                    legislature's Centennial History, are now on the Archives staff. The volumes contain
                    sketches of the more than six thousand persons who served in the General Assembly between 1816 and
                    1984. The update in 1995 will include sketches of all legislators who served between 1985 and 1995,
                    plus updated information on lawmakers who served previously.</p>
            <p>Four Governor's Fellows engaged in summer internships at the Archives in 1991 compiled a
                    computerized database of county records. The materials, dating primarily from the nineteenth
                    century, were largely unprocessed and consequently unknown to and unused by Archives patrons. The
                    new inventory permits access to the records through both comprehensive printouts and automated
                    searches.</p>

            <p>Recent acquisitions of the State Archives include:</p>
            <p>PAPERS OF JOHN KENNEDY GRAHAM, 1804–1841; 1 cubic foot; unrestricted access; inventory
                    available.</p>
            <p>John Kennedy Graham was a delegate to the 1816 Constitutional Convention and an early Indiana
                    legislator, businessman, and surveyor. The materials, donated to the Archives by a direct descendant
                    of Graham, had been in the family since Graham died in 1841. The papers include seventy-eight
                    letters dealing with business, political, and family life in Indiana between 1805 and 1841.

            <p>Handouts on the "AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS COLLECTION" and on "MAJOR GENEALOGICAL

            <p>The Archives collection of more than one hundred thousand aerial photographs was enhanced during 1991
                    by a donation from Purdue University's agronomy department of some fifteen thousand of the
                    earliest such pictures taken in Indiana. In all, the collection constitutes a survey of the
                    state's physical development from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. The handout, a
                    comprehensive listing arranged alphabetically by county, is an abstract of information about the
                    sets, noting the date each was compiled and explaining the marks stamped on each photo for
                    identification. At least one index is available for each county, but because flight lines change
                    from set to set, an index can be used only with the set from which it was compiled.</p>
            <p>The handout for African-American research includes information on censuses of blacks in particular
                    counties; records of the state Board of Colonization, 1852–1865; Civil War and other
                    military records; records of the Indiana Fair Employment Practices Commission
                    (1941–1961); Indiana Civil Rights Commission (1961–present); and a variety of
                    materials from agencies that may include information on individuals: applications from the
                    Professional Licensing Agency, records of the State Supreme and Appellate Courts, state hospitals,
                    and departments of Education, Public Welfare, and the State Board of Health.</p>

                        <salute>Editor: <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>
                        </salute>
                        <p>I wish to publically thank Thomas Hamm for the complimentary observations that he
                                    made in his review of <hi rend="i">Conscience and Slavery,</hi> but I also want to
                                    call attention to three mistakes he made in his report that were apparently due to a
                                    cursory and superficial reading of parts of my book. "This book,"
                                    he writes, "delivers less than its title promises." The title
                                    promises nothing except a discussion of religion and slavery. Neither conscience nor
                                    slavery were qualified and the subtitle restricts the narrative to evangelical
                                    Calvinists. Conscience is basic to and at the heart of evangelical religion.</p>
                        <p>Hamm questions the accuracy of my conclusion concerning the efforts of abolitionists
                                    and antislavery members of the Calvinist churches following the political
                                    developments in the 1850's. Hamm writes that he and many others would not
                                    agree with the conclusion that, "The action of abolitionists in criticizing
                                    the northern church was less effective in purifying the moral outlook of the
                                    northern church than it was in strengthening the proslavery stance of the southern
                                    church." He wrongly cites the quote as being on page 189. The Presbyterian
                                    General Assembly of 1853 resolved that the southern church should answer questions
                                    about the extension of slavery in the New School Presbyterian Church when
                                    antislavery presbyteries petitioned the Assembly to consider such measures. Neither
                                    the Assembly nor the AHMS proposed action based on the facts that might be
                                    furnished, but ministers in the southern church answered with an aggressive
                                    offensive.</p>
                        <p>In the Assembly of 1856 William Holley of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                                    </placeName> admitted that he held slaves for personal gain and that it was common
                                    practice throughout the southern church. Some northern presbyteries asked the
                                    Assembly to discipline Holley and when he died shortly after making his statement,
                                    his presbytery unanimously resolved that all the members of the presbytery took the
                                    same stand as Holley. Fred Ross of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> threw out the greatest challenge to the North. He attempted to refute
                                    Presbyterian Albert Barnes' antislavery, <hi rend="i">The Church and
                                        Slavery</hi> in all of the Presbyterian journals that would accept a series of
                                    letters, and he dominated the floor of the Assembly of 1856 by contradicting and
                                    resisting all the measures the Assembly had taken on slavery in the 1850's.
                                    The southern Presbyterians forced the Assembly to choose between the antislavery
                                    presbyteries and the slaveholding southern presbyteries. Only then did the Assembly
                                    of 1856 resolve that it had the power to remove slavery from the church. The
                                    southern synods responded by withdrawing from the church. This was all clearly
                                    delineated in my book. (160–63)</p>
                        <pb n="[373]" id="VAA4025-087-4-077"/>
                        <p>The antislavery presbyteries had control of the Assembly by 1853 and the New School
                                    Presbyterian Church should certainly be viewed as antislavery after 1857. Hamm
                                    states in his review that "Howard's argument that true Christians
                                    could have resolved the problem of slavery through compromise is
                                    unconvincing". I took a totally opposite position. It was not possible for
                                    the northern Presbyterians to compromise with what they viewed as sin because it was
                                    a moral question that offered no possibility of compromise. This was as much a fact
                                    as any undisputed act. I wrote, "There was no option between principles and
                                    expediency … and the tendency was to slavishly follow principle even
                                    though a departure from principle might have moved society closer to the final
                                    objective …, but ironically, the seeds of failure were inherent in the
                                    inability of antislavery Christians to envision a working compromise that would have
                                    permitted a partial victory over the sin of slavery." (Italics added.)
                                    Nowhere did I use the term "true Christians" as Hamm accuses, but
                                    I did refer to the sin of slavery in agreement with the most determined antislavery
                                    Christians who based their belief on the golden rule, and I stated, in accord with
                                    the antislavery men, that the church could not be purified as long as it tolerated
                                    slavery. Even the politicians could not compromise on the critical questions in
                                    1861. If the Old School Presbyterians could not compromise on loyalty to nationalism
                                    that year, it would be futile to expect the New School Presbyterians to compromise
                                    on a fundamental moral question, and no one did. Finally, to quote from my book: New
                                    School Presbyterians "believed a special burden rested on them to act
                                    morally and to purify the republic by resisting compromise." (188)</p>

                        <p>I am sorry that Professor Howard believes that the critical portions of what was a
                                    generally favorable review must be the result of dereliction on my part, rather than
                                    the product of the sort of scholarly difference of opinion that often advances
                                    knowledge. To charge a fellow scholar with publishing a review based on
                                    "cursory and superficial reading" is a serious thing.</p>
                        <p>Professor Howard charges me with three "mistakes." The first I
                                    acknowledge freely—the quotation in question, although accurately
                                    rendered, is on page 188, not 189. I apologize for that error. As for whether the
                                    title of his work promises more than the book delivers, I do not think that I am
                                    alone in expecting that a work entitled <hi rend="i">Conscience and Slavery,</hi>
                                    even given the subtitle, would be more than an account of the ecclesiastical
                                    politics of the American <pb n="[374]" id="VAA4025-087-4-078"/> Home Missionary
                                    Society. But that seems a minor point, especially since my review pointed out how
                                    well Professor Howard told that story.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental difference between Professor Howard and me is the moral he draws from
                                    his meticulously researched work, or, in the terms his Calvinist clergy would have
                                    used, the "application." Here, since he essentially claims that I
                                    misrepresented him, I think it best to let Professor Howard speak for himself in the
                                    last two paragraphs of his book: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>Early in the nineteenth century the church had been more concerned about
                                            spreading the gospel, not offending the South, and increasing membership
                                            rolls than they were in doing what they felt was morally correct. They
                                            winked at slavery while it was increasing its strength in the lower
                                                <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. In this sense there was a
                                            neglect of duty in the church that was as grievous as that on the part of
                                            statesmen who suppressed the discussion of slavery in the halls of Congress.
                                            After the Mexican War the evangelists were swept along by the antislavery
                                            movement toward war as a means of obtaining their objective because they
                                            were incapable of finding a peaceful solution to the problem of the
                                            expansion of slavery. The Civil War indicated a failure in leadership on the
                                            part of the clergy just as much as on the part of statesmen and politicians.
                                            The coming of the war was helped along by evangelists who held that they
                                            were right and that God was on their side. The action of abolitionists in
                                            criticizing the northern church was less effective in purifying the moral
                                            outlook of the northern church than it was in strengthening the proslavery
                                            stance of the southern church. Changes came in the northern church because
                                            of what northern churchmen considered excesses of the South and because of
                                            the growing influence of radical Christians within the church that awakened
                                            the Christian conscience.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
                              </p>
                                        <p>The church could no longer compromise with sin and evil; no deals could be
                                            made with Satan. The religious community was often more concerned with
                                            safeguarding its moral position and listening to its newfound conscience
                                            than with finding a solution that would avoid resorting to war. Until the
                                            slavery question moved into the realms of a strictly political issue after
                                            the Mexican War, the church saw evidence that progress was being made. But
                                            faced with the choice of voting slavery "up or down," the
                                            question took on the nature of a moral absolute when slavery threatened to
                                            expand into the territories. There was no option between principles and
                                            expediency in this context, and the tendency was to slavishly follow
                                            principle even though a departure from principle might have moved society
                                            closer to the final objective. If the war had not intervened, enough
                                            anti-slavery sentiment might have been created in the churches to bring
                                            about a peaceful end to slavery, but ironically the seeds of failure were
                                            inherent in the inability of antislavery Christians to envision a working
                                            compromise that would have permitted a partial victory over the sin of
                                                slavery.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> From the viewpoint of our day, it is not
                                            for us to condemn the refusal of many to compromise on questions of
                                            morals—or even to attempt to evaluate whether this was right or
                                            wrong. The lesson for contemporary society seems to be that, after weighing
                                            the extent of harm to society involved on each side of the question and the
                                            extent to which practices confirm or contradict the ethical standard of our
                                            civilization, questions of a moral nature on which society does not agree
                                            would best remain, if possible, outside the realm of politics.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                                    </quote> I leave it to readers to decide whether I was unreasonable in summarizing
                                    this argument as I did. We can quibble over the adjective "true,"
                                    but certain assumptions implicit throughout the book are most clearly stated here:
                                    that abolitionists pursued their cause <pb n="[375]" id="VAA4025-087-4-079"/> with
                                    reckless disregard for consequences, that a more moderate approach might have
                                    brought the Southern church to an antislavery position, that bringing Southern
                                    Presbyterians to such a position might have moved the rest of Southern society with
                                    them, that slavery was not a political issue before the rise of the abolitionist
                                    movement, and, most of all, that there was some compromise on slavery short of
                                    abolition and that would not have been political. I think that many historians will
                                    regard all of these as untenable.</p>
                        <p>I regret that this letter has necessarily dwelt on what I saw as the flaw in
                                    Professor Howard's work. I stand by the judgment of my review that
                                    Conscience and Slavery is a work admirable in the depth and breadth of its research,
                                    one from which historians can learn much. I did.</p>
