                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                                <l>Fearfully gazing on that scene of death:</l>
                                <l>Then with a shuddering groan of pain I shrouded</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">My straining eyes, and turnâd, a cowering worm,</l>

                                <l>On one low cross a dark and fearful brow,</l>

                                <l>They shrank from me, I say, as, gaunt and wild</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">I wanderâd on through the long summerâs day</l>
                                <l>And every mother snatchâd her cowering child</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">With horror from my solitary way!</l>
                                <l>I fled from land to land, a hunted wretch;</l>

                                <l rend="ti-1">A long dark cloud my fairest hopes to kill.</l>
                                <l>I grew a wanderer: from Africâs coast,</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">Where gaily dwelt the yet unfetterâd black,</l>

                                <l rend="ti-1">I went along my dim and cheerless track.</l>
                                <l>Oâer the blue Mediterranean, with its isles</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">And dancing waves, and wildly pleasing song,</l>
                                <l>By Lusitaniaâs land of sun and smiles,</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">My joyless bark in darkness sailâd along!</l>
                                <l>On many a soil my wandering feet have trod,</l>
                                <l>And heard the voice of nations worship God.</l>
                                <l>Where the dimâminded Heathen raised his prayer</l>
                                <l>To some bright spirit dwelling in midâair,</l>
                                <l>I have stood by, and cursed the stiffenâd knee</l>
                                <l>Which would not bow like him to Deity.</l>

                                <l>Each meek and humble head they gently bowâd,</l>

                                <l>Through which the pious crowd had ceased to pour:</l>
                                <l>A sudden faintness came upon me there,</l>

                                <l>Forbid it, Powers of Hell!ââA lowly cot</l>
                                <l>Stood near that calm and consecrated spot:</l>
                                <l>I enterâd it:âthe morning sunshine threw</l>
                                <l>Its warm bright beams upon the flowers that grew</l>
                                <l>Around it and within itââtwas a place</l>
                                <l>So peaceful and so bright, that you might trace</l>

                                <l>There was no taint of shame, or crime, or care.</l>
                                <l>On a low humble couch was softly laid</l>
                                <l>A little slumberer, whose rosy head</l>
                                <l>Was guarded by a watchâdog; while I stood</l>
                                <l>In hesitating, halfârepentant mood,</l>
                                <l>My glance still met his large, bright, watchful eye,</l>
                                <l>Wandering from me to that sweet sleeper nigh.</l>
                                <l>Yes, even to that dumb animal I seemâd</l>
                                <l>A thing of crime: the murderous deathâlight gleamâd</l>

                                <l>Responded to my sigh, whose echo fell</l>
                                <l>Heavilyâas âtwere loth within that cot to dwell.</l>
                                <l>My inmost heart grew sickâI turnâd me where</l>
                                <l>The smouldering embers of a fire still were;.</l>
                                <l>With shuddering hand I snatchâd a brand whose light</l>

                                <l>And then with desperate step I bore that torch</l>
                                <l>Unto the chapelâs consecrated porch!</l>
                                <l>A moment more that edifice had fired</l>
                                <l>And all within in agony expired;</l>
                                <l>But, dimly swelling through my feverish soul,</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">A chorus as from heavenâs bright chancel came,</l>

                                <l>And, as I leant my almost bursting brow</l>
                                <l>On the cold walls, the words came sad and slow</l>
                                <l>To me, the exiled one, who might not share</l>

                                <l>Where their young lips first learnâd to breathe of love;</l>
                                <l>I sought them by the fountainâs playful stream,</l>
                                <l>Where they were wont of happiness to dream;</l>
                                <l>I callâd them out to breathe the open dayâ</l>
                                <l>But none came forthâoh! where, my heart, were they?</l>
                                <l>That heart beat thickâI enterâd where the couch</l>
                                <l>Bedeckâd with flowers had wooâd their fond approach;</l>
                                <l>I gazed aroundâno sign of life was there;</l>
                                <l>My voice unanswerâd died upon the air;</l>
                                <l>The yet unfaded flowers were blooming gayâ</l>
                                <l>But none came forthâoh! where, my heart, were they?</l>
                                <l>Where were they?âay, where were they? once again</l>
                                <l>I sought them, though I felt the search was vainâ</l>
                                <l>Through every wellâknown path and sunny spot</l>
                                <l>I sought those truantsâbut I found them not;</l>
                                <l>And when at length the weary day was done,</l>
                                <l>I sat me down, and knew I was alone.</l>
                                <l>Oh! had a sob, a sound, but broke my sleepâ</l>
                                <l>Had I but been allowâd to rise and weepâ</l>

                                <l>Convulsively to strain them, ere they went,</l>

                                <l>Methought I could have borne it; but to rise</l>

                                <l>To greet the sun with joyfulness,âto wait,</l>

                                <l>To twine those flowers, and see them fade away,</l>
                                <l>Frail as the hopes that sickenâd with the day;</l>
                                <l>To groan and listen, and to groan again,</l>
                                <l>While Echo only answerâd to my pain;</l>
                                <l>To start from feverish dreams, and breathe unheard</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">Loud words of welcome to that visionâd pair;</l>
                                <l>To listen in my sleep some singing bird,</l>
                                <l rend="ti-1">And wake and find it was not Zara there;</l>
                                <l>To stretch my eager arms those forms to bind,</l>
                                <l>And with redoubled bitterness to find</l>
                                <l>The shadowy vision gone I loved to trace,</l>
                                <l>And darkness where had beamâd each youthful face:â</l>
                                <l>This was my lotâand this I learnt to bear,</l>
                                <l>And cursed the human links which bound me still to care.</l>

                                <l>She was the same bright, happy, loving thingâ</l>

                                <l>And felt, with breathless and bewilderâd pause,</l>
                                <l>Her early death foredoomâdâher love the cause:</l>
                                <l>As Jephthah struggled with the vow that still</l>
                                <l>Bound his painâd soul against his own free will;</l>
                                <l>And heard her fond and meeklyâworded prayer,</l>
                                <l>To climb the wellâknown hills, and wander there,</l>
                                <l>Weeping to think that in her virgin pride</l>
                                <l>The beautiful must perishâno manâs bride;</l>
                                <l>And that her name must die away from earth;</l>
                                <l>And that her voice must leave the halls of mirth,</l>
                                <l>And they be not less mirthful: so to me</l>
                                <l>It was to gaze on Miriam silently:</l>
                                <l>Miriam, who loved me; who, if I had said,</l>
                                <l>âLo! thou must perishâbow thy gentle head,ââ</l>
                                <l>Would have repressâd each faint lifeâlonging sigh,</l>
                                <l>Bared her white bosom, and knelt down to die,</l>
                                <l>Without a murmur.âSo when she upraised</l>
                                <l>Her quiet eyes, and on my features gazed,</l>
                                <l>Asking me to come forth and roam with her</l>
                                <l>Around her favourite haunts, the maddening stir</l>
                                <l>Of agony and vain resolve would rend</l>
                                <l>My bosom, and to earth my proud head bend.</l>

                                <l>She breathedâto bid farewell to all <emph>her</emph> share</l>
                                <l>Of life and sunshine; to behold again</l>

                                <l>Glad to be with me, sorrowful to go</l>
                                <l>From the dear scene of joy and transient woe.</l>
                                <l>As Eve to Edenâtowards that land of rest</l>

                                <l>To Italyâs sweet shores we bent our course;</l>
                                <l>And for a while my grief and my remorse,</l>
                                <l>And all my fearful thoughts, forsook me, when</l>
                                <l>We mingled in the busy haunts of men.</l>

                                            with far greater distinctness than he could without its
                                            aid, owing to the sight not being dazzled. A lens of

                                            dread and horror I experienced on a similar occasion to
                                            the one related in the poem. It was my misfortune that
                                            night to go to rest at variance with some of those ânear
                                            and dear unto me;â and, with a humility natural to my
                                            waking hours, exaggerating the effect produced on their
                                            minds by my conduct, I supposed them all dead of grief.
                                            Remorse instantly took possession of my hitherto callous
                                            heart, and, with a passionate invocation on the names of
                                            the departed, I threw myself back on my visionary sofa
                                            and wept. I had not been in that situation many minutes,
                                            before I heard those familiar voices calling me by my
                                            name. The tones sounded as if from a distance;
                                            whereupon, uncovering my face, I looked towards the
                                            window, but, to my surprise, the speakers were close at
                                            my feet, looking just as they did before my unnatural
                                            conduct caused their untimely end. A feeling of being
                                                <emph>hoaxed</emph> flashed across my mind, and I
                                            was tempted to exclaim with the Giaourâ<q>

                                        <p>Fearful, however, of offending my newly recovered
                                            friends, I remained silent, and so did they, till their
                                            silence, and the unalterable composure of their
                                            countenances, produced that sick dread which is only
                                            felt in dreams. There was neither grief, gladness,
                                            displeasure, nor surprise visible on their
                                                countenancesâ<emph>they merely looked at me</emph>;

                                            the whole, (not even excepting their features,) became
                                            one deadly white, the eyes only retaining a sort of
                                            faint tinge of their original hue, at the same time that
                                            the resemblance of each figure to its living original
                                            was perfect; they stood quite still, and might have

                                            full and heavily, I thought it would have burstâit did
                                            not however: I met my friends at breakfast, convinced
                                            that ghosts appear precisely in that way, and praying
                                            Heaven to preserve me from such another night.</p>

                                        <p>In the year 1778, the London East Indiaman was run down
                                            by the Russel manâofâwar, when upwards of one hundred
                                            people perished. I was discussing this species of danger
                                            at sea, with a person I met in a steam packet bound for
                                            Edinburgh: he assured me the case was by no means
                                            uncommon, and that he recollected, during the war, being
                                            on board a merchant ship, which, having no arms on
                                            board, <emph>purposely</emph> ran down a small French
                                            vessel; he added, there was no sound but<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7186-163"/> one wild scream of several
                                            voices in unison, and a <emph>grating</emph> as the
                                            merchant ship passed over. There were thirty souls on
                                            board the French vessel. I asked whether the captain was
                                            not dreadfully shocked: âYes,â said my informant, âI
                                            remember he set his teeth very hard <emph>at the
                                                time</emph>; but he considered himself justified by
                                            the fact of his having neither arms nor ammunition to
                                            defend himself, in case they should attack him.â</p>

                            <l>Each evening Edward weary came from a day of honest toil,</l>
                            <l>And Mary made the fire blaze, and smiled a cheerful smile.</l>
                            <l>Oh! what was wealth or pomp to them, the gaudy glittering show,</l>
                            <l>Of jewels blazing on the breast, where heaves a heart of woe!</l>
                            <l>The merry laugh, the placid sleep, were theirs; they hated sloth,</l>
                            <l>And all the little that they had, belonged alike to both,</l>

                        <l>Fraught with a certainty of happiness.</l>
                        <l>Years past; and she was wed against her will,</l>
                        <l>To one who sought her for the gold she brought,</l>
                        <l>And they did vex and wound her gentle spirit,</l>
                        <l>Till madness took the place of misery.</l>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7186-198"/>
                        <l>And oft I heard her low, soft, gentle song,</l>
                        <l>Breathing of early times with mournful sound,</l>
                        <l>Till I could weep to hear, and thought how sad.</l>
                        <l>The envied <emph>future</emph> of her life had provâd.</l>
                        <l>And then I grew a fond and thoughtful girl,</l>
                        <l>Loving, and deeming I was lovâd again:</l>
                        <l>But he that won my easy heart, full soon</l>
                        <l>Turnâd to another:âshe might be more fair,</l>
                        <l>But could not love him better. And I wept,</l>
                        <l>Day after day, till weary grew my spirit,</l>
                        <l>With fancying how happy she must be</l>
                        <l>Whom he had chosenâyet she was not so;</l>
                        <l>For he she wedded, loved her for a time,</l>
                        <l>And then he changed, even as he did to me,</l>
                        <l>Though something later; and he sought another</l>
                        <l>To please his fancy, far away from home.</l>
                        <l>And he was kind: oh, yes! he still was kind.</l>
                        <l>It vexâd her more; for though she <emph>knew</emph> his love</l>
                        <l>Had faded like the primrose after spring,</l>
                        <l>Yet there was nothing which she might complain,</l>
                        <l>Had cause to grieve her; he was gentle still.</l>
                        <l>She would have given all the store she had,</l>
                        <l>That he would but be angry for an hour,</l>
                        <l>That she might come and soothe his wounded spirit,</l>
                        <l>And lay her weeping head upon his bosom,</l>
                        <l>And say, how freely she forgave her wrongs:</l>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7186-199"/>
                        <l>But still, with calm, cold kindness he pursued</l>
                        <l>(Kindness, the mockery of departed love!)</l>
                        <l>His wayâand then she died, the brokenâhearted;</l>
                        <l>And I thanked heaven, who gave me not her lot,</l>
                        <l>Though I had wishâd it.</l>
                        <l>Again, I was a wife, a happy wife;</l>
                        <l>And he I loved was still unchangeable,</l>
                        <l>And kind, and true, and loved me from his soul;</l>
                        <l>But I was childless, and my lonely heart</l>
                        <l>Yearned for an image of my heartâs beloved,</l>
                        <l>A something which should be my âfutureâ <emph>now</emph></l>
                        <l>That I had so much of my life gone by;</l>
                        <l>Something to look to after I should go,</l>
                        <l>And all except my memory be past.</l>
                        <l>There was a child, a little rosy thing,</l>
                        <l>With sunny eyes, and curled and shining hair,</l>
                        <l>That used to play among the daisy flowers,</l>
                        <l>Looking as innocent and fair as they;</l>
                        <l>And sail its little boat upon the stream,</l>
                        <l>Gazing with dark blue eyes in the blue waters,</l>
                        <l>And singing in its merriment of heart</l>
                        <l>All the bright day: and when the sun was setting,</l>
                        <l>It came unbid to its glad motherâs side,</l>
                        <l>To lisp with holy look its evening prayer:</l>
                        <l>And, kneeling on the green and flowery ground,</l>
                        <l>At the sweet cottage doorâhe fixed his eyes</l>
                        <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7186-200"/>
                        <l>For some short moments on her tranquil face,</l>
                        <l>As if <emph>she</emph> was his guiding star to God;</l>
                        <l>And then with young, meek, innocent brow upraised,</l>
                        <l>Spoke the slow words with lips that longed to smile,</l>
                        <l>But dared not. Oh! I loved that child with all</l>
                        <l>A motherâs fondest love; and, as he grew</l>
                        <l>More and more beautiful from day to day,</l>
                        <l>The halfâinvoluntary sigh I gave</l>
                        <l>Spoke but too plain the wish that he were mineâ</l>
                        <l>My childâmy <emph>own</emph>. And in my solitude,</l>
                        <l>Often I clasped my hands and thought of him,</l>
                        <l>And looked with mournful and reproachful gaze</l>
                        <l>To heaven, which had denied me such a one.</l>
                        <l>Years past: the child became a rebel boy;</l>
                        <l>The boy a wild, untamed, and passionate youth;</l>
                        <l>The youth a manâbut such a man! so fierce,</l>
                        <l>So wild, so headlong, and so haughty too,</l>
                        <l>So cruel in avenging any wrongs,</l>
                        <l>So merciless when he had half avenged them!</l>
                        <l>At length his hour had comeâa deed of blood,</l>
                        <l>Of <emph>murder</emph>, was upon his guilty soul.</l>
                        <l>He stood in that same spot, by his sweet home,</l>
                        <l>The same blue river flowing by his feet,</l>
                        <l>(Whose stream might never wash his guilt away;)</l>
                        <l>The same green hills, and mossy sloping banks,</l>
                        <l>Where the bright sun was smiling as of yore:</l>
                        <pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7186-201"/>
                        <l>With pallid cheek and dark and sullen brow,</l>
                        <l>The beautiful and lost; you might have deemed</l>
                        <l>That Satan, newly banished, stood and gazed</l>
                        <l>On the bright scenery of an infant world.</l>
                        <l>For, fallen as he was, his Makerâs hand</l>
                        <l>Had stamped him beauteous, and he was so <emph>still</emph>.</l>
                        <l>And his eyes turned from off his early home</l>
                        <l>With something like a shudder; and they lighted</l>
                        <l>On his poor brokenâhearted motherâs grave.</l>
                        <l>And there was something in them of old times,</l>
                        <l>Ere sin had darkened oâer their tranquil blue,</l>
                        <l>In that most mournful lookâthat made me weep;</l>
                        <l>âFor I had gazed on him with fear and anguish</l>
                        <l>Till now. And, âweep for <emph>her</emph>,â my favourite said,</l>
                        <l>For she was goodâI murdered herâI killed</l>
                        <l>Many that harmed me not.â And still he spoke</l>
                        <l>In a low, listless voice; and forms came round</l>
                        <l>Who dragged him from us. I remember not</l>
                        <l>What followed then. But on another day,</l>
                        <l>There was a crowd collected, and a cart</l>
                        <l>Slowly approached to give to shameful death</l>
                        <l>Its burden; and there was a prayer, and silence,</l>
                        <l>Silence like that of death. And then a murmur!</l>
                        <l>And all was over. And I groaned, and turned</l>
                        <l>To where his poor old father had been sitting;</l>
                        <l>And there he sate, still with his feeble limbs</l>
                        <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7186-202"/>
                        <l>And palsied head, and dim and watery eyes,</l>
                        <l>Gazing up at the place where was his <emph>son</emph>;</l>
                        <l>And with a shuddering touch I sought to rouse him,</l>
                        <l>But could not, for the poor old man was dead.</l>
                        <l>And then I flung myself upon the ground,</l>
                        <l>And mingled salt tears with the evening dew;</l>
                        <l>And thanked my God that he was <emph>not</emph> my son;</l>
                        <l>And that I was a childless, lonely wife.</l>
                        <l>Toâmorrow I will tell thee all that now</l>
                        <l>Remains to tellâbut I am old and feeble.</l>
                        <l>And cannot speak for tears.</l>
                        <l>She rose and went,</l>
                        <l>But she returned no more. The morrow came,</l>
                        <l>But not to her;âthe tale of life was finished,</l>
                        <l>Not by her lips, for she had ceased to breath.</l>
                        <l>But, by <emph>this</emph> silent warning joined to hers,</l>
                        <l>How little we may count upon the future,</l>
                        <l>Or reckon what that future may bring forth!</l>

                        <l><hi>LOST</hi>ânear the âChange in the city,</l>
                        <l>(I saw there a girl that seemed pretty)</l>
                        <l>âJoe Steel,â a short, crossâlooking varlet,</l>
                        <l>With a visage as red as scarlet:</l>
                        <l>His nose and chin of a hue</l>
                        <l>Approaching nearly to blue:</l>
                        <l>With legs just the length, and no more,</l>
                        <l>That will trot him from door to door;</l>
                        <l>And a most capacious paunch,</l>
                        <l>Fed with many a venison haunch.</l>
                        <l>Whoever will bring the same</l>
                        <l>To a tailorâs of the name</l>
                        <l>Of Patterson, Watson, and Co.,</l>
                        <l>Shall receive a guinea or so.</l>

                        <l>And that all may understand,</l>
                        <l>And bring him safe to hand,</l>
                        <l>I subjoin as well as I can,</l>
                        <l>The character of the man.</l>
                        <l>Heâs a grumpy sort of a fellow,</l>
                        <l>Till liquor has made him mellow;</l>
                        <l>The sort of man who never</l>
                        <l>Wishes your guests to be clever,</l>
                        <l>When heâs asked to come and dine,</l>
                        <l>But only wants his wine.</l>
                        <l>He is but a stupid ass,</l>
                        <l>Even when heâs filled his glass,</l>
                        <l>And emptied it too, a dozen</l>
                        <l>Times, with some civil cousin.</l>
                        <l>I donât remember his saying</l>
                        <l>Aught, that meant more than braying.</l>
                        <l>We met and we talked together</l>
                        <l>Of politics and the weather,</l>
                        <l>Of the taxes and the king,</l>
                        <l>And that silly sort of thing;</l>
                        <l>But he never would give an opinion</l>
                        <l>As to the sort of dominion</l>
                        <l>He should like to live under, if we</l>
                        <l>To think of such things were free.</l>
                        <l>He said it was all speculation,</l>
                        <l>More harm than good to the nation.</l>

                        <l>He wouldnât abuse the Commons;</l>
                        <l>Nor admire a pretty womanâs</l>
                        <l>Ancle, that tripped throâ the park</l>
                        <l>When it wasnât light or dark.</l>
                        <l>Laugh at himâhe turned sour;</l>
                        <l>Talk gravelyâhis brow would lower.</l>
                        <l>Sometimes he wished to grow fat,</l>
                        <l>(Iâm sure it was needless, <emph>that</emph>)</l>
                        <l>When he was overâfed,</l>
                        <l>Or <emph>out of spirits, he</emph> said.</l>
                        <l>Sometimes he wished to be thin,</l>
                        <l>(When he poured <emph>fresh</emph> spirits <emph>in</emph>.)</l>
                        <l>But he never, when we were alone,</l>
                        <l>Said any thing new of his own.</l>
                        <l>The merrier <emph>you</emph> were, the more</l>
                        <l>He grumbled, and fumed, and swore;</l>
                        <l>The happier <emph>you</emph> were, the less</l>
                        <l>He cared for your happiness.</l>
                        <l>We never agreed for a day,</l>
                        <l>Except when one was away.</l>
                        <l>And meeting too often of late,</l>
                        <l>It was my peculiar fate</l>
                        <l>To say something bitter and bad</l>
                        <l>About wives being not to be had,</l>
                        <l>When a batchelor got a red nose,</l>
                        <l>And his short legs were shrunk in his hoseâ</l>

                        <l>It was witty; but cost me my friend:</l>
                        <l>For, being too late to amend,</l>
                        <l>He took it amiss that <emph>I</emph></l>
                        <l>The defects of his form should spy.</l>
                        <l>Perchance he had borne a few jeers</l>
                        <l>On the purple hue of his <emph>ears</emph>,</l>
                        <l>But to say that his <emph>legs</emph> were small!</l>
                        <l>Oh! his heartâs blood was turned to gall.</l>
                        <l>So leaving his bottle, he swore</l>
                        <l>That he never would enter my door.</l>
                        <l>And I chuckled within my own heart,</l>
                        <l>Snapped my fingers, and saw him depart,</l>
                        <l>But, alas! now Iâve lost him, I find</l>
                        <l>There was no one so much to my mind.</l>
                        <l>I have now got a goodâtempered fellow,</l>
                        <l>But he tells me my face is grown yellow.</l>
                        <l>Iâve got a new friend that is clever,</l>
                        <l>But heâs brewing his good things for ever:</l>
                        <l>Another, who talks at a rate</l>
                        <l>That is frightful, of church and of state,</l>
                        <l>And never will give in a jot,</l>
                        <l>Thoâ you reason and bawl till youâre hot:</l>
                        <l>Anotherâbut why should I bring</l>
                        <l>Of friends, as of onions, a string</l>
                        <l>To my dinners, except that I <emph>feel</emph></l>

                        <l>I miss him, and draw this conclusion,</l>

                                    <emph>fair</emph>:</l>
                            <l>(I had it in my album for three years,</l>
                            <l>And often looked, and shed delicious tears.)</l>
                            <l>I didnât fall in love, however, <emph>then</emph>,</l>
                            <l>Because I never saw that man again.</l>
                            <l>And I remember Popkinsâah! too well!</l>
                            <l>And <emph>all</emph> who once in love with ChloÃ« fell.</l>
                            <l>They called <emph>me</emph> ChloÃ« for they said my grace</l>
                            <l>Was nymphâlike; as was also <emph>half</emph> my face.</l>
                            <l>My mouth was wide, but then I had a smile</l>
                            <l>Which might a demon of its tears beguile.â</l>
                            <l>As Captain Popkins said, or rather swore,</l>
                            <l><emph>He</emph> liked me, (ah! my Popkins!) all the more.</l>
                            <l><emph>He</emph> couldnât bear a little mouth, for when</l>
                            <l>It laughed, âtwas like a long slit in a pen;</l>
                            <l>Or buttonâhole stretched on too big a button;</l>
                            <l>Or little cut for gravy in boiled mutton.</l>
                            <l>(Popkins was clever)âbut I must proceed</l>
                            <l>More regularly, that my friends may read.</l>
                            <l>I didnât marry, for I couldnât get</l>
                            <l>A man I liked; I havnât got one yet;</l>
                            <l>But I had handsome lovers by the score:</l>
                            <l>Alas! alas! I always sighed for more.</l>

                            <l>First came young Minton, of the ninth Hussars,</l>

                            <l>And only came, when he, one cold bivouac,</l>
                            <l>Gazed on the foe, and could not turn it backâ</l>
                            <l>The chill was so intense! Poor Minton, I</l>
                            <l>Really did think he certainly would die.</l>
                            <l>He gave me of himself a little print;</l>

                            <l>Squint it was <emph>not</emph>âbut one eye sought the other</l>

                            <l>He gave it, and he sighed: oh! often after</l>
                            <l>The memory of that sigh hath chillâd my laughter.</l>
                            <l>Iâm sure I might have married <emph>him</emph>, but then</l>
                            <l>I never did enough encourage men:</l>
                            <l>And somehow he made love to Anna Budge;</l>

                            <l>With thy proudly arched and glossy neck, and dark and fiery eye;</l>
                            <l>Fret not to roam the desert now, with all thy winged speedâ</l>
                            <l><emph>I</emph> may not mount on thee againâthouârt sold, my Arab

                            <l>The further that thou fliest now, so far am I behind;</l>
                            <l>The stranger hath thy bridle reinâthy master hath <emph>his</emph>
                                goldâ</l>
                            <l>Fleetâlimbed and beautiful! farewell!âthouârt sold, my steedâthouârt

                            <l>The morning sun shall dawn again, but never more with thee</l>
                            <l>Shall I gallop through the desert paths, where we were wont to
