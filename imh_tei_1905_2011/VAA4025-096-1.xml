            <p>Gayle Thornbrough's work as a historian falls into several periods: for the first decade of
                    her working life—from 1937, the year after she was graduated from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University as a history major, until 1947, when she succeeded Nellie Armstrong
                    Robertson as Indiana Historical Bureau (IHB) editor—she was principally an editor of
                    other people's manuscripts for the Indiana Historical Society (IHS). During the next twenty
                    years (1947–1967), she was mainly an editor of historical documents. For twenty months in
                    1967 and 1968 she left editing and Indianapolis to work as a manuscripts specialist in the Library
                    of Congress. She returned to Indiana in 1968 to take charge of the publications and library of the
                    Society, which had been reorganized in large part in order to bring her back to IHS. And from 1976
                    to 1984, she served as the first executive secretary of the newly independent IHS, which had become
                    the most prosperous historical society in the country and under her guidance was to become one of
                    the most innovative as well.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before 1967 Gayle's thirty-year career was enormously productive, but it was not surprising.
                    She was a superb editor, nationally recognized for her work in documentary editing, in an
                    institution, the Bureau, that had a tradition of superb editors; Gayle followed Robertson and
                    Dorothy L. Riker in this line.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It is true that the resources she brought to
                    editing were more broadly-based than those of her older colleagues. Gayle was an urbane and cultured
                    person, knowledgeable about the arts, well traveled, and an insatiable reader. She was also notably
                    tactful and patient in working with authors.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>While Gayle did her job as editor outstandingly well, it was the job she had signed on for and was
                    expected to do. But after 1966, she changed careers, several times. After 1966, her career became
                    surprising.</p>
            <p>In what must have been a wrenching decision for her, and was unquestionably shocking to her
                    colleagues, Gayle left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and historical editing in 1967 to take a position in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., as a manuscripts specialist at the Library of Congress, where she classified and
                    summarized documents, especially from the colonial period. When I interviewed them in 1984, both
                    Riker and Shirley McCord, Gayle's colleagues at the Bureau, discussed the dismay they had
                    felt at her leaving.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Gayle was 52 years old in 1967; when she left the Society
                    and the Bureau, the question of the future of those institutions was raised in an urgent way.</p>
            <p>Eli Lilly and the board of trustees of IHS responded to her departure in dramatic ways. In May 1967
                    they reorganized the administration of the Society to create a leadership position for Gayle
                    Thornbrough, and a year later, after Gayle had accepted the position, Lilly gave IHS two and a half
                    million dollars' worth of stock to fund an expansion of the Society's programs.
                    Here was a an explicit and institution-transforming testimony (though a private one, since few knew
                    about the Lilly gift) to Gayle's importance to the Society's future; and it marked
                    another major turning point in Thornbrough's career.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When she returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1968 Gayle was no longer one of the group of old friends and coworkers who had
                    lunched together for years; she was now quietly in charge of transforming an institution most of
                    whose principal figures were older women who had known her since she was a girl. Distancing herself
                    from them was no doubt difficult; Thornbrough was both unpretentious and gentle. Dorothy Riker
                    remembered that some people thought she had bitten off more than she could chew. Riker herself was
                    full of admiration for what Gayle accomplished: "It took a good head to get through all
                        that."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From 1968 to 1976 Gayle, working with the Society's board of trustees and through the
                    library committee, found ways to bring order to the crowded and chaotic library, on the one hand,
                    and on the other began the fulfillment of one of IHS's oldest dreams, the publication of
                    the massive Calvin Fletcher diary, which was to be Thornbrough's crowning achievement as an
                    editor. Enlisting Riker as her coworker and training the new Marian College graduate Paula Lents
                    Corpuz to work with them, Thornbrough worked from 1968 to <list type="footnotes">

                    history during the fifty-year period it covers and one of the most humanly appealing of American
                    diaries. The editing is masterly.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Gayle also undertook another large project,
                    the publication of the documentary history of the Indiana years of George Rapp's Harmony
                    Society.</p>
            <p>In 1976 Thornbrough's career took its last turn: after her eight-year apprenticeship as
                    director of publications and the library, she was appointed executive secretary of a once-again
                    reorganized Indiana Historical Society. This time the Society was entirely separated from the
                    Bureau, with which it had been closely associated since the Progressive era. Under Gayle's
                    leadership IHS took its place as an independent and, after 1977, very wealthy institution: with
                    Gayle installed as its leader Eli Lilly left the Society 10 percent of his holdings in Lilly stock
                    upon his death.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thornbrough's last career was truly surprising. There was no other institution like
                    the one she headed and no other administrator, much less another woman administrator, called upon to
                    transform the resources for state, local, and regional history in the way Gayle was. Thornbrough
                    never made a speech, never wrote a monograph, never read a paper at a professional meeting; and yet
                    she was one of the most productive and influential historians in the history of the state. She
                    fostered a vast array of research projects, seeking out ideas from others, quick to respond to
                    imaginative suggestions, willing to try something new—like funding a position in the
                    history of medicine at Indiana University, publishing historic recordings and a monograph on Indiana
                    ragtime, supporting a newsletter and new collecting program in black history, seeking out a talented
                    biographer for Eli Lilly, microfilming Indiana newspapers … and on and on.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thornbrough was more than the sum of these parts: it was the person that she grew to be who
                    created this legacy for Indiana history. Modest, private, down-to-earth, endlessly interested in the
                    past and in fostering its study and preserving its records, confident of her own good sense, she
                    ventured beyond familiar territory in the last two decades of her life to take on the challenge of
                    leadership when she was chosen for it. We are indebted to her for her courage in doing so.</p>

                    Expressing "shock and pain and bewilderment," the sports reporters dissected the
                    troubling loss. They blamed the weak Attucks schedule and dubious calls by the referees, both
                    factors of a "prejudice that still is widespread in Indiana." The team, however,
                    deserved high praise. Although the fans' victory song would not be heard again that season,
                    "the melody lingers on."</p>
            <p>On the editorial page, analysis of the loss continued. Andrew W. Ramsey, the lead columnist and a
                    teacher at Attucks, urged sportsmanship and a tempering of the bitterness among the legions of fans
                    who supported the team. In an "Open Letter to Attucks Fans," he argued that the
                    loss was not the fault of the players, coaches, administrators, or game officials. Rather,
                    "what is to blame is your unfounded belief that the team is invincible." He

                    assigned to sport were all based on a set of harsh truths: during an era of racial integration in
                    both education and sport, Crispus Attucks High School was an all-black school, with an all black
                    faculty and an all-black administration. The fans who supported the school's athletic
                    endeavors were predominantly African American. The issues raised in the newspaper that
                    day—confronting racial bias in the form of poor officiating, struggling to gain
                    legitimacy as a program despite a weak schedule and inadequate facilities, and above all determining
                    whether athletic success could promote racial equality—would continue to be addressed by

                    people who daily experienced the reality of segregation and discrimination.</p>
            <p>The Attucks loss was also an anomaly. It was the only year between 1951 and 1959 that the school
                    failed to advance beyond the sectional round. Indeed, the school's athletic accomplishments
                    during this era remain a rich chapter in Indiana's storied tradition of high school
                    basketball. Their success was staggering: eight sectional titles, eight regional titles, six
                    appearances among the final four teams, and three state championships. The first Attucks state
                    championship in 1955 was also the first won by any <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> high school. The following year Attucks became the first state champions to be
                    undefeated for an entire season. The best player on those teams, Oscar Robertson, later enjoyed
                    great success at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the professional ranks. Players like Hallie Bryant, Willie Gardner, Willie
                    Merriweather, and Bill Scott also earned fame beyond their high school years. Coach Ray Crowe
                    remained a revered figure in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Yet the legacy of Crispus Attucks basketball in the 1950s extended far beyond athletic success. The
                    basketball team mobilized the black community, furnished role models for black youths, and provided
                    an arena where African Americans could witness their representatives legitimately confronting and
                    vanquishing teams composed primarily of whites. Among both middle- and lower-class <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks, no greater or more widespread source of cultural pride existed. Attucks
                    basketball provided a forum for debate over issues of race relations and the social and political
                    impact of sporting success, as the sports coverage and the Ramsey editorial in the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> illustrated. Moreover, the team's success influenced Indiana race
                    relations in both obvious and subtle ways. Attucks earned respect and fan support from whites as
                    well as blacks. To some extent, the team represented the entire city; newspapers increasingly
                    referred to "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Attucks" as the team accumulated athletic honors. Thus, when Crispus Attucks
                    took the floor for a basketball game, more was at stake than an athletic contest.</p>

                    </placeName>, however, Attucks remained an all-black institution during the 1950s. African Americans
                    could feel pride for an all-black sports team throughout the era. The high school was part of the
                    fabric of the community, and the basketball team served as a focus for racial pride and political
                    awareness. Certainly, larger demographic, economic, and political forces also encouraged racial
                    integration in Indiana and throughout the country: northern migration, the expansion of the black
                    middle class, and increasingly effective political organization played important roles. Yet perhaps
                    no greater, more visible, or more dramatic cultural weapon existed for fighting racial inequality in

            <p>Crispus Attucks's greatest athletic success arose within a context of racial separation and
                    discrimination that was countered by a resilient black community. Educational segregation in Indiana

                    and used different cultural institutions. In 1920, nearly 800 black students attended local high
                    schools (Emmerich Manual, Arsenal Technical, and Shortridge) along with whites, but school officials
                    segregated sports, club activities, and even classroom seating along racial lines<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    </placeName>, brought previously muted racial tensions into public prominence. Groups like the White
                    Supremacy League and the White Citizens Protective League fought for a residential zoning ordinance
                    in 1926, which the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter
                    successfully challenged. But black resistance failed in the face of a similar grass-roots drive for
                    a segregated high school. White civic leaders, parent-teacher associations, and the Chamber of
                    Commerce appeared before the school board, arguing that black education would thrive in a racially
                    segregated environment. They also expressed fear of exposing white children to tuberculosis, which
                    was more common among African Americans. The school board approved construction of a building in the
                    northwestern part of the city, near the heart of <placeName>

                    </placeName> schools for three years. Black citizens protested, but the school board's only
                    concession was to change the school's name from Thomas Jefferson High School to Crispus
                    Attucks High School, in honor of the black Revolutionary War hero.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Though the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) did not directly establish Attucks High School, its pervasive influence
                    in 1920s Indiana politics helps explain the forces that created such a dramatic example of racial
                    separation. David Curtis Stephenson, a man <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> historian Edward Leary described as "a squat, powerfully built master salesman
                    who exuded charm and good fellowship, but could be as dangerous as a timber rattlesnake,"
                    led Indiana's klan. Known to have proclaimed, "I am the law in Indiana,"
                    Stephenson promoted populist, Protestant values and a white ethnic consciousness. Indiana's
                    was the largest and most powerful state klan during the KKK's national resurgence in the
                    1920s; 25 percent of the white men in the state joined. Before the Indiana klan disbanded in the
                    early 1930s, its name sullied by Stephenson's conviction for rape and second-degree murder,
                    it had managed to dominate the era of Indiana politics that included the establishment of Crispus
                    Attucks. The klan generally directed its hostility towards Catholics, Jews, and immigrants, but
                    klansmen also fought "to keep the black man black and the white man white." When
                    Attucks opened its doors in 1927, the klan led a parade past the school. The procession took an hour
                    to pass.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Yet African Americans transformed the school that had been forced upon them into a symbol of black
                    pride and cultural unity. The school's first principal, Matthias Nolcox, combed the east

                    </placeName> in search of the finest black faculty. Attucks had a higher percentage of teachers with
                    advanced degrees than any other area school; some, like distinguished writer and educational
                    advocate Joseph C. Carroll, had even earned doctorates. An active club life flourished, including a
                    student council, the Attucks Sisters (a charity organization), a Junior Red Cross, and a History
                    Forum. The school further served as an unofficial community center. Administrators turned the vacant
                    back lot into a playground; the National Association of Colored Physicians used the school for their
                    convention in 1930, and the elementary schools, churches, and a variety of civic organizations took
                    advantage of the Attucks library.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>During Russell A. Lane's tenure as principal from 1930 to 1957, the school achieved its
                    highest educational stature. Lane had earned three advanced degrees and was an able administrator,
                    yet he encountered constant barriers at Attucks. Years later he reflected, "The white
                    people didn't expect to give you anything and didn't want to give you anything.
                    You had to fight tooth and nail to get anything you wanted." Through a series of
                    initiatives, Lane prompted an expansion of the school building that would include sixty-four
                    classrooms, sixteen offices, three gyms, thirteen shop classes, and a nine-hundred-seat theater. He
                    also expanded the curriculum to include college algebra, economics, sociology, current events, and
                    five foreign languages. He promoted an extension of educational programs to include vocational
                    subjects and a popular evening school that served both adults and teenagers. He further encouraged a
                    sense of black self-awareness, establishing clubs for black literature, music, and history.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lane emphasized cultural pride, discipline, and respect. Students dreaded the waiting area outside
                    his office, known as "the mercy seat." His faculty and staff continually reminded
                    students that they represented Attucks and African Americans. Most took the message to heart, and
                    many applied their educational skills to benefit their community. By 1963, 9 physicians, 3 dentists,
                    4 attorneys, 4 college professors, and 34 of Attucks's 125 teachers were Attucks <list type="footnotes">

                    with all-black schools, so Attucks's main competitors were the other two all-black schools

                    </placeName>. The football team played preliminary games at black colleges. Black student athletes
                    enjoyed meeting nationally known celebrities like Joe Louis and Althea Gibson at Douglass Park, the
                    golf course where the Attucks team practiced and the only one in <placeName>

                    a paucity of funds and a lack of willing opponents forced them to play men's independent
                    teams. Only as the coaches and administrators developed personal relationships with some of their
                    counterparts at other schools did Attucks begin to play a more substantial schedule, although it
                    consisted primarily of rural and small Catholic schools. Originally bested by rivals Gary Roosevelt

                    </placeName> African Americans throughout the school's existence. Not just athletic
                    success, but also the athletes' discipline and status as high school students fed their
                    prestige in the community. Before Attucks, the major black sports team in <placeName>

                    "Sambos." Like the Harlem Globetrotters of basketball, the Clowns ran comic
                    routines during games and sacrificed athletic achievement for white acceptance. In contrast, Attucks
                    basketball teams—like Joe Louis or the Harlem Rens, a successful all-black barnstorming
                    team of the 1930s—played with discipline and dignity; African Americans might be proud
                    not only of their winning, but also for how they won.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>It galled many black civic leaders that, in a state where high school basketball attracted a
                    fanatical following, the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) banned Attucks from its
                    annual state basketball tournament. As soon as Attucks opened in 1927, black leaders met with Arthur
                    Trester, the secretary of IHSM. The dictatorial "King" Trester refused to admit
                    Attucks, along with other black and Catholic schools. He did not consider them
                    "public" schools if their student body was restricted to blacks or Catholics.
                    Black leaders, who had been forced to swallow educational segregation and were now being punished
                    for it, maintained pressure on IHSAA. Political pressure during World War II led to Senate Bill 181,
                    which banned segregation in IHSAA tournaments. The bill passed the state senate in 1941 only to die
                    in the house of representatives. The uproar from black and Catholic civic leaders eventually
                    convinced IHSAA to open the tournament for the 1942-1943 academic year, stating that all
                    "public, private, parochial, colored, and institutional high schools" in Indiana
                    would be permitted to participate in the famed tournament that sparked "Hoosier
                    hysteria" every winter.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first time, Attucks basketball could gain widespread exposure. Victories in the tournament
                    meant attention for the players and the school throughout the city. Success on the basketball court
                    against established white opponents also stoked the pride of black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to a far greater degree than it had done under athletic segregation. Beginning with the
                    1942-1943 season, basketball at Attucks served as a powerful agent of black achievement and
                    equality.</p>
            <p>Crispus Attucks High School was also part of a broader development among Indiana African Americans in
                    the first half of the twentieth century. Because of the exigencies of both <hi rend="i">de jure</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">de facto</hi> segregation, African Americans created their own culture. Nowhere was
                    this culture more in evidence than along Indiana Avenue, the center of black business and
                    entertainment. At one end of "The Avenoo" loomed the Walker Theatre, built by

                    as rallying grounds for organized politics; for example, they spurred the successful fight to
                    integrate public theaters. Flanner House, a social agency funded by both black and white
                    philanthropists, promoted economic development. Masons, civic and social clubs, churches, and
                    newspapers all served the neighborhood. Yet in the era preceding World War II, churches and other

            <p>The black community underwent a cultural transformation in the midst of the second, larger phase of
                    the "great migration" following World War II. Between 1940 and 1950 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black population increased twice as fast as the overall population, despite
                    the rapid influx of many ethnic groups into the city. All flocked to the city for employment
                    opportunities in wartime defense, electronics, and auto production. Between 1950 and 1960 the black
                    population grew five times as fast as the rest of the population. By 1960, one in five <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents was African American. Class divisions heightened. Southern blacks were often
                    poorer and had less schooling than their northern counterparts. More members of the black middle
                    class found opportunities previously denied them and moved to affluent, predominantly white
                    neighborhoods. Indiana Avenue and even Crispus Attucks High School began to change as the interclass
                    unity forged by segregation started to erode. By the 1950s gamblers and saloons replaced some
                    respectable businesses on Indiana Avenue. Although Attucks continued to attract educated, talented
                    blacks, the school increasingly served poorer southern migrants, and some wealthier students found
                    opportunities at Shortridge and Arsenal Tech.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>On the national stage World War II and the ensuing Cold War had served as catalysts for racial
                    consciousness and activism. African Americans, particularly in the Jim Crow South, began to protest
                    in organized, systematic forms against injustice. In <placeName>

                    northern city in the South"), many of the same problems existed and black leaders attempted
                    some of the same solutions. A body of unified support, including NAACP, the Congress of Industrial
                    Organizations (CIO), black fraternal and church groups, and an assortment of other groups, including
                    the League of Women Voters and the <placeName>

                    1949. Although some senators proposed amendments that would have substantially weakened the bill, it
                    received little overt opposition and ultimately passed with few changes. Despite the passage of the
                    bill, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials avoided desegregation throughout the 1950s in two ways. First, students could
                    apply for vouchers to attend schools outside their district; many black students chose to attend
                    Attucks, and all of the whites in the Attucks district chose to go either to Manual or to
                    Shortridge., Second, economic inequalities and racial prejudice served to segregate black and white
                    housing. Thus few schools had substantial populations of both white and black students. Educational

                    city's youths attended integrated elementary and secondary schools. Of these schools,
                    however, two had only one white student, and two others had only one black student. Attucks remained
                    all black. In 1958 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Schools (IPS) Assistant Superintendent Paul I. Miller claimed integration was
                    proceeding smoothly, noting that of 561 black teachers, 156 were teaching in integrated schools.
                    Although there were some white teachers at Attucks, the student body still remained all black. Also
                    in 1958 Shortridge High School Principal J. W. Hadley wrote to the Fair Employment Practices
                    Commission assuring them of racial harmony in the schools. "If adults would stay out of
                    this problem of high school integration," he contended, "it would be worked out
                    very nicely by the students. The problem is not with the youths but the adults." Attucks
                    had an all-black student body until 1968.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>In this context—a growing black political self-awareness on both a national and a local
                    scale, a network of black cultural organizations, an expanding black population, early signs of
                    class division among African Americans, and an all-black school in the midst of a slow movement
                    towards integration—Crispus Attucks basketball enjoyed its greatest success. The games,
                    the championships, and the recognition prompted a discussion during the 1950s about the familiar
                    problem of twentieth-century African Americans: how to achieve black consciousness and pride while
                    participating in a larger society on an even footing.</p>
            <p>The Fitzhugh Lyons-coached Attucks teams of the 1940s laid the groundwork for the school's
                    zenith as a basketball program in the 1950s. Lyons coached when Attucks still struggled to gain
                    legitimacy, and his philosophy mirrored that of Principal Lane and Athletic Director Alonzo Watford.

                    Attucks was still patiently accumulating good-will and educating the populace to inter-racial

                    Attucks coach to install a basketball "system." The teams learned to play
                    technically sound basketball. Yet Lyons's training also included a passive,
                    nonconfrontational approach. Historian Randy Roberts called basketball under Lyons a game of

                    His replacement, former assistant coach Ray Crowe, deserves credit for the emergence of the Crispus
                    Attucks Tigers as a basketball juggernaut and a powerful cultural agent. As a math and physical
                    education teacher the soft-spoken Crowe earned the respect and even fear of the student body. He
                    could discipline students with a glare or a raised finger, and he was a father figure for many of
                    his students and players. He visited players' homes, helped them with financial or
                    discipline problems, and organized picnics, basketball tournaments, and even summer scrimmages
                    against inmates at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> prison. Ironically, while Crowe and his team became symbols of black pride and
                    consciousness, Crowe tried not to filter his life or his team's success through the lens of
                    race. As a member of the only black family in rural Whiteland, Indiana, he claimed never to have
                    felt the sting of discrimination, despite the area's large klan population. In college at
                    Indiana Central, in his first job as a manual laborer at Industrial Harvester Corporation, in his
                    position at Attucks, he rarely complained of unfair blows dealt to him and other African Americans.
                    "I don't talk a lot about being black and what all of that might or might not
                    mean," Crowe once said. Lane and Watford perceived the conservative, middle-class, and
                    impeccably dressed Crowe as a natural successor to Lyons.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Crowe's quiet demeanor, however, concealed an intense conviction that the status quo at
                    Attucks should be challenged. Although Crowe had played structured basketball since his childhood,
                    he rejected the "defeatist" attitude of the team and a playing style that failed
                    to incorporate the talent developing on the playgrounds and courts of black <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As a coordinator of an afternoon basketball program at Lockefield Gardens, the local
                    federal housing project for African Americans constructed during the New Deal, Crowe had observed a
                    kind of basketball quite different from the rigid play-making <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-096-1-023"/> Lyons preached at Attucks. "The Dust Bowl," as
                    residents called the Lockefield playground, hosted games that were "faster, louder, more
                    stop-and-go, and … defiant of established standards of performance." It was a
                    style that emphasized showmanship, athleticism, and improvisation, and it was a style that was
                    distinctly black.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fans responded enthusiastically to Attucks's distinctive playing style. Crowe's
                    teams replaced organized plays and self-conscious restraint with behind-the-back passes, pressure
                    defense, and fast breaks. Although other Indiana teams practiced a run-and-shoot offense, Attucks
                    placed its own stamp on the game, one forged on urban playgrounds. Authors Nelson George and Philip
                    Hoose have each compared Attucks basketball to the jazz that only a decade earlier had flourished
                    along nearby Indiana Avenue; while other teams "moved around the court in patterns as if
                    there were square dances and ballads running through their heads," Attucks basketball was
                    "a free-lance festival of running hooks, length-of the-court rushes, thirty-foot
                    jumpers." Like jazz artists, the team improvised, quickened the pace, and allowed for
                    individual style in a team context.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Crowe's success as a basketball coach reflected his ability to combine the structured
                    conventions of traditional basketball with the flamboyant, athletic style of the "Dust
                    Bowl." He did not discard the talented traditional center Bob Jewell and his teammate John
                    Davis. Rather, Crowe meshed their styles with those of younger and poorer southern migrants whom
                    Crowe had coached since they were in the eighth grade. Among the new players was Hallie Bryant, a
                    forward who played with charisma and grace. Willie Gardner was the tallest man on the team, but he
                    also had dribbling and playmaking skills that resisted typecasting. Bailey "Flap"
                    Robertson was a brash, fearless long-distance jump shooter. These players became Attucks's
                    greatest stars in the early 1950s.</p>
            <p>Some traditionalists criticized the new developments. Jep Cadou, sports editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, complained that Naismith never intended that players with "jumping
                    jack legs" would be able to rewrite basketball's traditional patterns. Cadou cried
                    that "One <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> team, Crispus Attucks, has six boys who can 'dunk' the ball and such
                    lads are common around the state." Black players were transforming Indiana's
                    cherished game, to the chagrin of longtime fans like Cadou. But black fans naturally enjoyed a style
                    that was both effective and associated with black players. Moreover, many white fans also fancied
                    the athletic innovations. Attucks made passionate fans <list type="footnotes">

                    abilities and even resentment of their success. Yet Crispus Attucks provided a visually exciting
                    style of basketball just as television began to broadcast tournament games. More important, the
                    stylistic changes led to an unprecedented level of athletic success.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Crowe noted that "Some of the older teachers still believed that the best way to improve the
                    perception of blacks was to avoid being aggressive and confrontational …. I needed to
                    make them understand that the worst disgrace they could bring to our school was to lose when they
                    had a chance to win." The team responded by sailing through his inaugural season with only
                    a single loss. While the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> trumpeted the team's feats, white
                    reporters typically gave mixed reviews. The <hi rend="i">Star's</hi> Corky Lamm claimed
                    Attucks "doubtless can be stopped." After Attucks defeated Howe decisively in the
                    sectional final, however, reporter Bob Collins realized that "Attucks can win it."
                    Yet the team's reputation would not be secured until the regional final against perennial
                    basketball power Anderson. Despite some officiating calls that inspired howls of disbelief from the
                    Attucks faithful, the Tigers had the ball and only a one-point deficit with seconds remaining on the
                    clock. Flap Robertson, a sophomore substitute, remained imperturbable as the ball came into his
                    hands and the seconds ticked away. He calmly took a long jump shot that, according to most accounts,
                    bounded high off the back rim. With most of the African Americans in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>The victory song began. Fans clapped their hands, swayed to the rhythm, and loudly launched into
                    their "Crazy Song," written by an Attucks cheerleader in the 1940s: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    the 1951 tournament began, black writers claimed that democracy thrived in the annual tournament,
                    despite the social injustice prevalent in nearly every other area of Indiana life. The <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> editorialized, "It is not too much to say—for nothing is too
                    much to say at tourney time— that in the Tournament we are vouchsafed a little glimpse of
                    Heaven." Dismissing referee bias and the racial remarks of a few spectators, the paper
                    optimistically argued that the IHSAA tournament allowed equal opportunity to all types of schools
                    and boys of every faith and ethnicity. "Sometimes we think it would be a good idea to keep
                    The Tournament and reshape the rest of Indiana's institutions to conform to
                        it."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Just before the Anderson game, the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> again praised democracy through sport;
                    "It is with pride almost to the point of tears that one looks back on the long struggle of
                    Crispus Attucks for its rightful place in the sun of Hoosier basketball." A new era of
                    racial integration seemed to be dawning. "'Weary the road we trod' of
                    being excluded from the tournament; of traveling great distances to play
                    'intersectional' contests with other schools whose only relation to Attucks was
                    that they were also Negro schools." The editorialist further recognized the skills of the
                    players, Crowe's vision, and the efforts of Lyons, Lane, and Watford. As Attucks advanced
                    through the sectional and earned fans from outside the black community, the team, he believed,
                    contributed immeasurable good. Indeed, "the rise of Crispus Attucks has been a major part
                    of the improvement of race relations and the advance of democracy in this state during the past
                        decade."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    spurred by the team: "Where the appeals of religion, reason and education seem to have
                    fallen on deaf ears, the spectacle of brilliant basketball has turned the trick." Ramsey
                    interpreted the success of the Tigers as an example of African Americans' potential
                    achievement when given equal opportunity. He further realized the social power of the team: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            youths who saw little opportunity for themselves in a town and community where most of the

                    </quote> Sports became the vehicle through which editorialists urged racial justice. Ramsey chided
                    state legislators who cheered for Attucks on the weekend and argued against a fair employment
                    practices bill the following week. Similarly, he admonished restaurants that admitted and celebrated
                    the team after Attucks victories, yet refused to serve most blacks, in violation of
                    Indiana's civil rights statutes. The best way to praise the athletic accomplishments of the
                    Tigers, he argued, would be for whites to follow equal-opportunity employment policies and for all
                    to make donations towards college scholarship funds for Attucks students. The Attucks basketball
                    team took a step towards equality, but larger hurdles still remained.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    culture. The civil rights movement promoted integration as its chief goal and achievement,

            <p>Gilbert Taylor, the Attucks student body president in 1955, remembered that "as far as I was
                    concerned, the community and the school were one." Teachers lived in the same neighborhoods
                    as their students and took a personal interest in them. Principal Lane and the faculty continually
                    reminded the student body that they represented African Americans. Bill Scott, a guard on the 1955
                    championship squad, recalled how he and his friends refrained from juvenile pranks and petty theft
                    because of their loyalty to the school. "In the neighborhood, or no matter where we went,
                    we were representing Attucks."</p>
            <p>Lane communicated this message most forcefully to the basketball players, who were the most
                    conspicuous representatives of the community. Before games, he would come into the locker room and
                    remind the team of their social importance: "You are black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>." The faculty rarely granted players special privileges, even after late
                    midweek games. Academic achievement was a priority at Crispus Attucks, and commencement brought the
                    entire community together. <hi rend="i">"Everybody</hi> was there," recollected
                        Taylor.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because the tiny gymnasium at Attucks could not accommodate many spectators, the team often played in
                    rivals' facilities. As the Attucks team became more popular, it began to play more
                    frequently at the cavernous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> Fieldhouse, splitting a small portion of the net gate receipts with their opponents.
                    When Attucks consistently filled up arenas with thousands of fans and curious spectators, more
                    prestigious opponents contacted the school about scheduling regular season games. Not only did
                    Attucks begin to play against established schools like Arsenal Tech, Shortridge, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gerstmeyer, but they also added significant sums to the school's resources. In
                    a few years, brilliant green and gold uniforms with caped warmup suits replaced the old, thin,
                    tattered Attucks jerseys. As Watford's athletic account grew, the basketball team funded
                    new printing presses and engineering equipment for the school.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Attucks athletic success similarly benefited black business. Local establishments associated
                    themselves with the team in efforts to boost sales. Every week during the state tournament,
                    proprietors filled the pages of the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> with advertisements designed both to

            <p>Crispus Attucks High School also affected the political life of the community. Since the school

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and served as a community cultural center, it is not surprising that some of its former
                    students became political leaders; six of the ten black state legislators representing <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County in the 1960s and 1970s were educated at Attucks. They used the team's
                    success to establish good will and emphasized the integration of sport as part of African
                    Americans' political struggle. State Senator Robert L. Brokenburr spearheaded the 1941
                    drive for black teams' admission to IHSAA. Indiana University coach Branch McCracken and
                    his first black star, Bill Garrett, came to a Senate Avenue YMCA Monster Meeting to praise the
                    Tigers' success in 1951. Scovel Richardson, head of the U.S. Parole Board and the first
                    black ever to serve as chairman of a large federal agency, came to a Kiwanis Club banquet to commend
                    the team after they won their 1955 title. Even politician Henry J. Richardson, who sent his son to
                    Shortridge High School and actively supported Shortridge athletics, contributed to a trophy fund for
                    the Attucks 1956 championship team. Shortridge student Marcus Stewart recalled during the first
                    championship celebration, "I kept thinking, Attucks means black. Attucks means
                        us."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    Reflecting on those games, Bryant chuckled, "Imagine three busloads of black folks
                    descending on some sleepy farm town on a Saturday night." Yet there were few racial
                    incidents. At home, celebrations at Northwestern Park following playoff victories could last into
                    the early hours of the morning; after the 1955 championship, an orchestra even came from <placeName>

                    The Attucks team felt they had been victimized by some poor officiating, but they remained in a
                    position to win the game as the clock ticked towards the end. Patiently, Attucks players looked for
                    the perfect opportunity to take the lead. Bryant, who would later be voted that year's
                    "Mr. Basketball," suddenly cut to the basket, swiftly bypassing his defender. As
                    he leaped to score, two <placeName>

                    </placeName> players converged upon him in mid-air, trying not to concede an easy basket. The
                    players fell to the ground in a tumble, and the ball bounced off the rim. Attucks forward Winifred
                    O'Neal tipped in the rebound. Only then, the whistle blew. To everyone's shock,
                    the referee called a charge on Bryant and awarded foul shots to <placeName>

                    "'This Will Be With Me Rest of My Life,' Says Hallie." The

            <p>Three days before the Bryant controversy, the all-white Indiana Officials Association (IOA) had
                    denied admission to black referee Bernard McPeak, who had been an official in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and refereed a state final before coming to Indiana. IHSAA had certified him and a few
                    other blacks to referee in Indiana. Their exclusion from IOA sat poorly with black fans, who often
                    detected prejudice in the highly subjective task of officiating. Every year the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> noted a few instances when it appeared referees favored the Attucks opponents.
                    Mainstream papers like the <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, by contrast, ignored any officiating controversy
                    that might have revealed racial prejudice. Although any contention of referee bias remains
                    impossible to prove conclusively, African Americans suspected that some crucial games—in
                    particular the 1952 sectional loss, the 1954 city tournament final, and of course the 1953 semifinal
                    loss involving Bryant—hinged on dubious officiating decisions in the late stages of close

            <p>Urging McPeak's admission into IOA became a rallying cry for the black press. "Men
                    who discriminate in their own association," argued sports columnist Charles Preston,
                    "are not fit to referee a fast-moving basketball game." Preston singled out white
                    referees Dubis and S. T. Profitt for their bias against Attucks and was incensed when both were
                    among the six referees chosen to work the 1954 Final Four. The <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> selected
                    McPeak for its 1954 "Race Relations Honor Roll," honoring his "untiring
                    efforts to end discrimination in the ranks of the basketball referees, and to elevate Negro
                    officials to first-class status." Ironically, the Attucks players dreaded the sight of
                    McPeak at the officials' table. Crowe recalled, "He was bending over backwards so
                    he wouldn't look like he was giving us any breaks. At the same time, he was killing
                        us."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite Crowe's general unwillingness to emphasize racial bias, he felt that referees often
                    discriminated against his team. "That's one of the problems I feel was a racial
                    problem," he asserted. Consequently he designed his game plan to avoid situations where
                    referees could influence the game's outcome. He stressed the importance of obtaining an
                    early lead for his team, so that they could protect the lead and never let the referees make a
                    decisive call in a tense situation. Although Crowe frowned upon the kind of
                    "clowning" associated with the Harlem Globetrotters, he arranged for all his
                    tallest players to dunk the ball in succession during warmups; the opposition often stopped and
                    watched open-mouthed, clearly intimidated before the game even began. In their pregame huddle, the
                    Attucks players would hold hands and say in unison, "The first ten points for the refs
                    … the rest are for us."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The public disapproval of biased referees and the pressure from black journalists to improve the
                    situation continued throughout the 1950s. Preston in particular expressed disgust with
                    "favoritism" and "toadying" within high school athletic
                    departments. He encouraged IHSAA to oversee all referee assignments and called for a ban of IOA. In
                    1957 a group of thirteen black "sportsmen" wrote an open letter to the
                    superintendent of schools, the public schools athletic supervisor, the IHSAA commissioner, and all
                    the athletic directors in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> area. "Two developments of recent years have greatly increased the
                    participation of Negro athletes in high school sports," the letter read. "One is
                    the rise of Crispus Attucks in basketball, and the other is the integration of schools." <placeName>

                        <p>We are not accusing any officials of prejudice. But it is just common sense that if the teams
                            are integrated, the officials should also be integrated. The players and coaches would feel
                            better about it and the fans would have less temptation to blame or bait the referee.</p>
                        <p>What we are advocating is the employment of officials in any or all games without regard to
                            color. In practice, this would mean the more frequent use of Negro officials who are already
                            certified by the IHSAA.</p>
                    </quote> Tellingly, the letter did not address the continued racial segregation at Attucks; instead
                    the writers urged the less politically charged and more attainable goal of fair hiring practices for
                    referees. Preston continued to fight for black admission into IOA, featuring that topic in a 1959
                    panel discussion among sportswriters. Yet during Attucks's finest years, black suspicion
                    and anger towards referees remained widespread. The question of whether Attucks would compete on a
                    truly level playing field hovered over each season.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    accommodate the school's huge fan base; over 11,000 people came to see a 1955 game against
                    Shortridge, a regular-season record at the time. Attucks attracted such a large following that other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName>. Most of the Attucks tournament games were thus on its "home"

            </p>
            <p>But the revenue and exposure Attucks received from games at Butler came at a cost. The team played
                    "home" games all over the city in their rivals' gymnasiums. Also, <placeName>

                    </placeName> University naturally assigned priority to its own teams, which limited
                    Attucks's access and led to an irregular schedule that often changed over the course of the
                    season. For example, during the 1955-1956 campaign, the team played three games in five days,
                    another three in seven days, no games for ten days, and then six games in ten days. Most other
                    schools scheduled their games for weekends and Wednesday nights, but the "gym-less

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as symbolic. Despite persistent inequality and segregation, legislation had expunged
                    some aspects of discrimination in Indiana basketball and society. The exclusion of competent
                    referees from IOA and the lack of a gymnasium for one of the top teams in the state reminded African
                    Americans of the persistence of racial inequality. IHSAA and the city ignored journalists'
                    calls for decisive action on these issues.</p>
            <p>More satisfying to the black community was the success of the team itself. After Bryant and Gardner
                    graduated, fans considered the 1953-1954 Attucks Tigers an unknown quantity, lacking in height and
                    established stars. But the team defied skeptics and performed well early in the season, led by Flap
                    Robertson's little brother, an inconsistent fourteen-year-old sophomore named Oscar. Ten
                    days before its December 17 game against archrival Arsenal Tech, however, three black men
                    brandishing knives threatened Tech athlete Dave Huff, a steady shooter and role player for the
                    school. "If you make one single point," one of the men sneered,
                    "we'll come back and cut you wide open." Days later Huffs mother received
                    a threatening telephone call and a menacing note. Tech star Don Sexson also reported that someone
                    had attempted to intimidate him.</p>
            <p>Just days before the game, Attucks players also received mysterious threats. Crowe received a letter
                    threatening players Bill Mason and O'Neal, and Robertson also reported receiving a
                    suspicious call. The teams played the game as scheduled, although concerned adults withheld Huff
                    from the match. The police and school authorities took extra security measures to keep Attucks and

            <p>Although there were no arrests, the Huff scandal showed again that basketball did not escape the
                    racial tensions within Indiana. Some representatives of Tech wanted to eliminate games with Attucks
                    as a result of the threats made against Huff and Sexson. Indianapolis police responded to the
                    incident by cracking down on gambling along Indiana Avenue, which raised cries of a double standard
                    from the black press. "Every sportsman is indignant," Preston bemoaned,
                    "but it is worse than useless to start jumping on your favorite scapegoat, when nobody
                    knows who the punks are and what are their motives." There was no evidence that gamblers
                    were involved, let alone any based on Indiana Avenue. Nor was there any evidence that the threat
                    against Huff was more serious than the subsequent harassments of black players. Yet some Tech

            <p>Later that same season, however, basketball seemed to be once again uniting the races. Shrugging off

            <p>The Tigers did not win the state championship in 1954. Indeed, as all fans schooled in Hoosier lore
                    are aware, 1954 was the year of the "Milan Miracle," when tiny Milan High School
                    defeated a succession of larger schools (including Attucks) on the way to a dramatic 32-30 final win

                    Although its status as a small, rural school chiefly prompted the outpouring of support, the Milan
                    legend had racial undertones as well. Milan's team was all-white; in fact, not a single
                    African American lived in the town. Before Milan's victory over Attucks in the semifinal
                    round, shooting star Bobby Plump remembered, "When we went out to dinner that night, an
                    unusual number of people followed us around. One of the frequent remarks we heard was,
                    'C'mon Milan, beat those niggers.' People were saying it
                    everywhere." The triumph of the rural white squad recalled a time before blacks influenced
                    the sport and before racial integration became an issue.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Black columnists detected racial tension throughout the 1954 tournament. As early as the sectional
                    round, Andrew Ramsey claimed the Attucks win was "much to the disappointment of the vast
                    majority of the crowd which was white." He saw the basketball game as another manifestation
                    of racial conflict: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To the anti-Attucks white rooters, Tech represented the great white hope despite the fact
                            that two of Tech's players belonged to the group which was the target of their
                            hatred.</p>
                        <p>To the Negro fans, the game was a sort of vicarious struggle against the stumbling block of
                            second class citizenship…. These Negroes, who daily take a beating from the white
                            man in industry, in business, in religion and in their living conditions were jubilant to
                            see a symbol of white supremacy bite the dust.</p>
                    </quote> As the tournament drew to a close, Ramsey further pondered the nature of basketball and
                    race relations. While he appreciated the gesture of cheerleaders from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools supporting Attucks, he also noted incidents like a small white boy calling his
                    friend a "Nigger lover" for cheering an Attucks play. When police steered Attucks
                    celebrations to "the ghetto" rather than downtown, or when reporters went to
                    solicit public opinion of the team on Indiana Avenue (the same street which they portrayed as the
                    center of organized crime and gambling), Ramsey contended that a long road still needed to be
                    traveled to improve race relations. The success of the basketball team encouraged African Americans

                    have allowed racial prejudice to become a factor, but most fans supported Attucks in the sectional
                    round and did not let race influence either their cheering of spectacular plays or their booing of

                    wrote, "I said to myself, 'Man, TIMES HAVE CHANGED.' And they
                    have!" The Attucks basketball success, as far as Parker was concerned, meant that the
                    school had come a long way since it was established in the era of the Ku Klux Klan. Although the
                    existence of an all-black school was an unfortunate remnant of segregation, Parker contended that
                    "we have actually arrived at the dawn of a NEW DAY; and we should greet that day without
                    fear or skepticism." There was no greater example of that new day than the spirit of racial

                    into even greater public prominence. That season Attucks lost only one game, at <placeName>

                    While the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> trumpeted black achievement, papers like the Star sounded a
                    more conservative note. In fact, the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> never mentioned that Attucks was an

                    </placeName> residents certainly knew Attucks remained segregated. Yet considering the racial
                    context of Attucks basketball games, the newspapers' avoidance of racial issues in sports
                    seems significant. Segregation obviously persisted, and African Americans mustered little effective
                    political action during the decade. Whites rarely discussed black cultural achievements of any kind.
                    Attucks basketball allowed whites to appreciate a black institution without directly confronting
                    racial prejudice. This evasion would inform the debate over the social and political impact of the
                    Attucks athletic success in the coming years.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    Attucks, paced by Robertson's 30 points, easily won their first state championship. After
                    the game police redirected the celebration parade, which traditionally ran through downtown <placeName>

                    </placeName>, to Northwestern Park in the black section near Attucks. Some, like Robertson, resented
                    the slight and never forgot it. Others, like his teammate Scott, did not care: "That was
                    the way it had been the whole time. I was glad to be with my own people, where we felt
                        safe."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>The all-black final between Attucks and Gary Roosevelt added to the atmosphere of black pride during
                    the championship weekend. Some white fans made clear their disgust at how Indiana basketball had
                    changed; Ramsey noted a number of "sullen and hostile looks" and the occasional
                    "racial epithet." Yet many blacks saw the all-black final as evidence of black
                    achievement. Scott remembered, "I said to myself, 'This is ours, not
                    theirs'." Ironically, three southern athletic officials attended the final weekend
                    as guests of IHSAA commissioner L. V. Phillips. An all-black final would have been unthinkable in
                    the South, but the three men were gracious. A high school coach from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> even gushed, "I wish we had some boys who could shoot like that."
                    Phillips smiled as he turned towards the man, "Perhaps you do."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The win, naturally, stoked the pride of the entire black community. Twenty-five thousand people
                    celebrated around the huge bonfire at Northwestern Park that evening. Lane, usually a rigid advocate
                    of discipline and academic achievement, canceled school on the following Monday and held a dance in
                    honor of the championship. The team attended several banquets, received scores of citations, and
                    reveled in the attention they received. The following week's <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi>
                    included a large supplement devoted entirely to the Tigers, including articles on the history of
                    basketball at Crispus Attucks, a play-by-play record of the winning game, the unique style and the
                    obstacles overcome by the team, Crowe's success, the origins of the Crazy Song, the debate
                    over the school's greatest ballplayer, and the final game itself. But civic leaders did not
                    forget that Attucks was an educational institution. In honor of the championship, the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>The success of the Attucks team that season, culminating in the championship, also extended the
                    debate over the nature of sport and its relationship to social change. Before the 1955 tournament
                    began, the <hi rend="i">Recorder's</hi> Ramsey wrote another examination of basketball and
                    race relations. In a column entitled "Basketball, The Hoosier Opiate," Ramsey
                    argued that basketball success among the all-black schools did not reduce the level of segregation
                    in housing, employment, religion, and politics. Moreover, "basketball is an opiate against
                    the painful experiences of everyday realities along the color line." When black fans,
                    including those with no connection to Attucks besides the color of their skin, turned out to support
                    Attucks in large numbers, they witnessed a "battle for and against the recognition of the
                    essential humanity of Negroes." Yet for Ramsey, the battle on the basketball court
                    deflected attention from the real problems that plagued African Americans in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The optimistic Preston responded the following week. He agreed that basketball brought racial
                    discrimination into the public eye, "but the end result is A GREAT IMPROVEMENT rather than
                    the opposite." He argued that basketball's popularity discouraged racial
                    discrimination. Coaches and fans searched out the best players and chose not to discriminate. Where
                    African Americans and whites played alongside each other, myths and stereotypes eroded.
                    "Basketball," Preston contended, "is something the common man can
                    grasp." Preston implied that although sport by itself could not end segregation and
                    discrimination, it could change racial attitudes on a personal and cultural level because of its
                    visibility and its tendency to recognize excellence.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Recorder's</hi> lead editorial reflected Preston's optimism.
                    Beginning with a quotation from Matthew 21:42—"The stone which the builders
                    rejected is become the head of the corner"—the newspaper congratulated the
                    Tigers "with a spirit of profound reverence and thanksgiving." <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Persons unfamiliar with our state may believe that we are overdoing it in going down on our
                            knees and giving praise to Almighty God that this glorious thing has come to pass.</p>
                        <p>But basketball—especially the high school variety—occupies a peculiarly
                            lofty place in the Hoosier scheme of things. It is far more than a boys'
                            sport—in fact, [it] is just about the most important thing there is.</p>
                    </quote> The editorial also praised Crowe for writing "a triumphant climax to the dramatic
                    battle of Negro schools through the decades," since Attucks and Gary Roosevelt had made it
                    to the final round only twelve years after they were admitted into one of the most competitive high
                    school tournaments in the country. The <hi rend="i">Recorder's</hi> religious imagery and
                    unstinting praise suggested a role for basketball larger than that of an
                        "opiate."<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>Ramsey and Preston, despite their different perspectives, did share common ground about the political
                    and social benefits of the championship. Ramsey praised Mayor Clark's participation in the
                    cheering section and the other white fans who supported Attucks. Preston acknowledged "an
                    undercurrent of poor sportsmanship" in the city, including comments like the one made by a
                    woman cashier who hoped Attucks would not win, because then "There'd be no
                    livin' with 'em." And everyone undoubtedly agreed that "[a]s
                    long as one section of the Fieldhouse is filled with Negroes and the others predominantly with
                    whites, the question of color will be present either in actuality or suspicious fancy."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

            <p>The following season the Crispus Attucks Tigers assured themselves of a lofty status in the annals of
                    Indiana high school basketball by winning every game they played. Attucks played excellent
                    basketball the entire year; no team ever led them in the second half of a game. Scores from the
                    season proved the team's tremendous offensive and defensive capabilities: 90-35, 86-32,
                    91-30, 123-53. In the quiet, determined mold of Coach Crowe, the Attucks team established an
                    unprecedented level of dominance; they set records for the most points ever scored in a single game
                    and for the state's longest consecutive winning streak. The Star's front page
                    proclaimed the Attucks 1956 squad "the greatest team in the history of Indiana high school
                        basketball…."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>By 1956, Attucks had gained a national following. Although their appeal partly depended on earlier
                    success, Attucks was also the home of Oscar Robertson, one of the best high school basketball
                    players in the country. Cyril Birge, a high school referee of the era, said it best: "If
                    there's a better ballplayer than Oscar Robertson, it'd have to be Jesus Christ
                    himself." Robertson was the envy of every college recruiter in the country and the hero of
                    every basketball-playing boy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. African Americans adored Robertson to the point that when he injured his hand during
                    the 1956 regionals, a picture of his bandaged hand was on the front page of the <hi rend="i">Recorder.</hi> Oscar's hand healed, and he eventually set a single game playoff
                    scoring record with 39 points in the final game against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Jefferson. Writer Philip Hoose has suggested that Robertson was the first local black
                    person in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> about whom whites were curious. Eager and intense on the court, yet reserved and polite
                    off it, Robertson as an individual exemplified the qualities that inspired the black
                    community's passionate loyalty to Attucks. Three years after he left <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Robertson won a citywide poll in the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> as "the one I admire most."<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In third place in that same poll was Ray Crowe. Despite city wide admiration, however, Crowe was
                    never named Indiana Coach of the Year. Some critics maintained Crowe was an ordinary coach with
                    great players, yet in 1957 he took a team of average, undersized Attucks players on a third
                    consecutive trip to the state finals. Although they lost in the final game to an undefeated team
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> Central, Crowe's performance ranks as possibly the finest coaching in Attucks
                    history. The next year he resigned at the behest of the new principal, Alexander Moore, and began a
                    ten-year tenure as athletic director. Crowe soon regretted his decision to resign, and rumors that
                    he would get a job with a college program did not materialize. In fact he could not even find a
                    position at another Indiana high school. Crowe did, however, capitalize on his local popularity and
                    went on to serve five consecutive terms as a state representative, a four-year stint as Director of
                    Parks and Recreation, and on the City Council. Crowe continues to command the respect of his former
                    players, many of whom regularly keep in touch with him. They still call him "Mr.

            <p>With the prolonged success of the Tigers, however, came a series of new problems. Lane's
                    resignation before the 1957-1958 school year touched off a new era in Crispus Attucks basketball.
                    When Lane accepted a job as administrative assistant to the superintendent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools, Attucks teacher Moore took over as principal. Crowe became athletic director
                    and hired Bill Garrett as the new coach. Moore, complained Crowe, "couldn't have
                    cared less about the athletic program." Crowe found that the athletic department received
                        <pb n="40" id="VAA4025-096-1-046"/> far less financial support from Moore than it had from Lane.
                    Sadly, the lack of support resulted in lower gate receipts for the team and less revenue for the
                        school.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Crowe who chose Garrett as his successor. According to Stanley <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, Garrett's playing career was nearly as important as the Attucks rise in
                    fostering the acceptance of African Americans in Indiana basketball. Garrett, "an all
                    American in everything he did," had led <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the 1947 Indiana state title and then attended Indiana University, which broke the
                    color line in the Big Ten Conference. By his senior year, he was Indiana University's
                    leading scorer, rebounder, and most valuable player; he was named to the All-American team and
                    consistently shared headlines in the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> with the first great Attucks teams
                    of the early 1950s. Yet despite Garrett's celebrity, he could not match Crowe's
                    local prestige. Attendance at games and enthusiasm for the program, though still significant, began
                    to dwindle. Crowe recalled that "people just felt the Attucks era was over."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Garrett coached effectively, however. In 1959, despite little support from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> media, he led Attucks to its third state championship of the decade. Unlike the
                    previous champions, this Attucks team did not crush its opponents. Rather, the team squeaked out a
                    number of tense victories during the tournament. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, which had ranked them ninth in the state at the end of the regular season,
                    later proclaimed that Attucks rated among the finest in the country, "the best darned team
                    here or anywhere."<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Days after the team won the title, Cadou claimed in a <hi rend="i">Star</hi> column that if Attucks
                    had lost in the sectional round (as they almost did, trailing Shortridge by three points with less
                    than a minute to play), then Garrett would have been fired as coach. Moore took "sharp
                    exception" to Cadou's contention, claiming that Garrett was "excellent at
                    building character and mental attitude and that's what we want." Indeed, firing
                    Garrett would have seemed out of character for Moore; as one wag put it, "He might have
                    been fired for winning a game, but never for losing one." Nevertheless, the very existence
                    of the rumor suggested a subtly changing role for Attucks basketball. The team, the school, and the
                    community now expected continued success, yet African Americans in <placeName>

                    Davis in the final, many white fans threw drink carton tops onto the gym floor. Attucks had
                    obviously forfeited the underdog status they held in the early 1950s, but the insulting display
                    deserved the indignation of the <hi rend="i">Recorder:</hi>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is wrong and shameful for any responsible citizen even to suggest that the Attucks Tigers
                            ignore the basic reason for sports' being and start losing games they could win; it
                            was disgraceful for hundreds of high school pupils to show such a complete lack of
                            understanding of what basketball, the high school variety, is all about as to shower the
                            floor with drink carton tops.</p>
                    </quote> The newspaper argued that even if Attucks could not rouse the broad-based support it once
                    had, the tournament still deserved graceful losers and sportsmanship. The journalists once again
                    suspected racial prejudice as a factor in the white fans' behavior.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ramsey also commented on the incident. In the early 1950s he had claimed that basketball fostered
                    great progress toward racial justice. But through the years his disenchantment with the social
                    effects of sport grew. In the wake of the 1958 sectional, he offered his most scathing and
                    pessimistic analysis of the decade: the scene in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Fieldhouse represented "America in Microcosm." He complained that no
                    one mentioned the players' academic futures and instead only discussed their athletic
                    prospects. Members of the "Black Bourgeoisie" cheered the accomplishments of
                    Attucks but enrolled their children at Tech and Shortridge, and they drew "a line between
                    themselves and other Negroes." The seating of the fans along racial lines represented the
                    residential and economic segregation that left many African Americans "in
                    ghettoes" and Attucks entirely black. Attucks, with its racially homogeneous contingent of
                    players, coaches, and fans, remained segregated in an era of integration. White fans "filed
                    out in disgust" after the Attucks victory, hallways and bathrooms echoed with racial
                    epithets, and trash littered the court. Ramsey expressed concern over the racial animosity of the
                    students: "Such an attitude in high school-age youngsters does not speak too well for
                    America's future."<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gone were the usual comments about racial pride through athletic success. Gone was the idea that
                    basketball improved racial understanding. Instead, Ramsey outlined the trends that would plague
                    American race relations for the remainder of the century: the growing divisions between middle- and
                    lower-class African Americans, the lack of economic and educational opportunities in poor <list type="footnotes">

                    races, and the resentment and lack of understanding that followed. Basketball, according to Ramsey,
                    could not solve these problems. In fact, it was part of the problem.</p>
            <p>Ramsey's comments overlooked the significant social benefits African Americans had accrued
                    as a result of the Crispus Attucks basketball success. If nothing else, the players had won
                    educational and employment opportunities that they might not have received otherwise. Oscar
                    Robertson, Flap Robertson, Bill Hampton, Willie Merriwether, Hallie Bryant, Bill Scott, Bob Jewell,
                    and Sheddrick <placeName>

                    </placeName> Harp, Bryant, and Flap Robertson all played in the Harlem Globetrotter organization.
                    Following their basketball careers, nearly all the players were successful in business or as
                    educators. Most attributed their success to Crowe's guidance; Harp said, "He put
                    us in the right direction. None of us would have gotten as far as we did if it wasn't for
                    Mr. Crowe." Though only Oscar Robertson achieved fame and glory, most players built
                    successful, fulfilling lives, unlike many of their classmates.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, the legacy of Crispus Attucks basketball extends beyond the players themselves. As Crowe
                    put it, "We brought about some change. No doubt about that." The team changed how
                    many black and white <placeName>

                    </placeName> citizens thought of themselves and each other. By consistently beating teams made up
                    either entirely or mostly of whites, Crispus Attucks performed on a local level what Joe Louis had
                    done for many American blacks in the 1930s and 1940s; Scott remembered, "It was something
                    'The Man' couldn't take away from us." Robertson elaborated:

                    the school undoubtedly helped to shape the teams both on and off the court. As an athletic

                    problems that hampered many lower-class African Americans were not solved and may have worsened
                    during this era, as more members of the black middle class fled segregated neighborhoods and chose
                    not to enroll their children at Attucks.</p>
            <p>What significant social change, then, did Attucks basketball actually bring? Collins of the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> stated the common belief that "the success of Attucks'
                    basketball integrated the high schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They became so dominant that the other schools had to get black basketball players or
                    forget about it." Indeed, black players who in an earlier era might have enrolled at
                    Attucks often led the integrated championship teams of rival high schools in the 1960s. Yet the
                    contention seems impossible to prove, since the team influenced attitudes and ideas rather than
                    directly shaping policies and laws. In Indiana, where high school basketball has sometimes seemed
                    almost a form of religion, Attucks basketball was conspicuous and influential. Both the black and
                    the white "common man," as Preston recognized, understood the social significance
                    of an all-black team's beating a white one. But the increased black self-awareness and
                    softened white resistance to integration occurred only because Attucks was the product of
                    discrimination. "Yes, it was more than a game," admitted Ramsey, "but it
                    should not have been."<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>Richard M. Nixon was, even in the estimation of admirers, a complex and often contradictory man. One
                    of the contradictions that critics have for half a century found hard to comprehend was that this

                    not be reconciled with the well-known commitment of the Quakers to nonviolence.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The critics have long-standing popular perceptions on their side. If any single characteristic
                    dominates the public image of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, it is the
                    group's historic commitment to pacifism, what Friends call the Peace Testimony.
                    "We certainly do know, and so testify to the world, that the spirit of Christ, which leads
                    us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither
                    for the Kingdom of Christ, nor for the Kingdoms of this world," English Friends proclaimed
                    in 1661. For two centuries official <placeName>

                    </placeName> statements in Europe and in North America adhered to this precedent. In the twentieth

                    a minority position among American Friends. In contrast to other historic peace churches, like the
                    Amish and Mennonites, among whom rates of conscientious objection have been high, the available

                            Hicksite. Orthodox Friends emphasized views of the authority of the Bible and the divinity
                            of Jesus that were similar to those of evangelical Protestants. Hicksite Friends emphasized
                            the primacy of the traditional <placeName>

                            into Gurneyite and Wilburite factions. Gurneyites, the larger group, were open to ties with
                            other evangelical Protestants in reform and humanitarian efforts; the more conservative
                            Wilburites shunned such ties as threatening <placeName>

                            during the Hicksite Separation; only about 3,000 of its 18,000 members were Hicksites. In
                            the 1840s and 1850s, almost all of its members sided with the Gurneyite group. See Hugh

                        <p>The basic organizational unit for Friends since the seventeenth century has been the monthly
                            meeting. It has the power to receive and expel members, hold property, and solemnize
                            marriages. Two or more monthly meetings make up a quarterly meeting, which traditionally
                            held its sessions four times a year. It handled business considered beyond the competence of
                            the monthly meetings. Several quarterly meetings make up a yearly meeting. The yearly

            <p>Quakers have always been good record keepers, so this study has been able to draw on a rich variety
                    of sources. Every year since 1821, Indiana Yearly Meeting has published a volume of minutes, which
                    in the twentieth century has always included reports from the yearly meeting Peace Committee. We
                    also made extensive use of the records of thirteen local congregations or monthly meetings. Seven of
                    these were urban meetings with relatively large memberships: <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>, <region type="county">Marion</region>, <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>, <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>, <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName>, and
                    West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Six were from rural meetings varying in size: <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>, <settlement type="city">New Garden</settlement>
               </placeName>, Oak Ridge, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Walnut Ridge. These meetings represent a cross section of the yearly meeting in
                    every respect: a mix of rural and urban, large and small, liberal and evangelical. We also conducted
                    oral history interviews with Indiana Yearly Meeting Friends who have been active in supporting peace
                    policies.</p>
            <p>Our conclusion is that in the twentieth century pacifism has lost much of its force in the lives of
                    the members of Indiana Yearly Meeting, and it has lost that force because Indiana Quakers have been
                    almost totally absorbed into the larger culture of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The Peace Testimony has not totally disappeared from Indiana Quakerism. The yearly
                    meeting in its official statements has adhered to pacifism. And an active and articulate minority of
                    Indiana Friends has been committed to pacifism, not merely refusing to participate in war, but
                    working to remove the causes of war and criticizing <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> policies that rely on military force. Paradoxically, such activities, at least since
                    World War II, have probably weakened the appeal of the Peace Testimony for many other Indiana
                    Friends, since it has often been tied to a political and religious liberalism that they rejected.</p>
            <p>To test this argument, we have focused on four periods when Indiana Friends faced the implications of
                    the Peace Testimony: World War I, World War II, the Korean "Police Action," and
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War. We have defined the period of each war expansively in order to gauge the reactions
                    of Hoosier Quakers at the onset of conflict: for example, our consideration of World War II begins
                    in 1936. In each period, we found a combination of official statements upholding the Peace
                    Testimony, some pacifist Friends working for it and in other types of peace activities, some Quakers
                    who actively supported involvement in each war, and considerable indifference to the Peace Testimony
                    by most members.</p>

               <item>for members. Since 1900, the yearly meetings with Hicksite origins have been joined together
                        in Friends General Conference. In 1902, most of the Gurneyite yearly meetings in North America
                        joined together to form the Five Years Meeting. In 1965 the latter changed its name to Friends
                        United Meeting. See Barbour and Frost, <hi rend="i">Quakers</hi>, 220, 239, 241; and Thomas D.

            <p>In fact, support for the Peace Testimony has never been unanimous among Quakers, nor, even among
                    those who accepted it, has there been complete agreement about all of its implications. Before 1860
                    Friends disagreed over the acceptability of traveling in armed ships, paying war taxes, or even
                    holding offices in governments that used military force. In the various colonial conflicts, the
                    Revolution, and the War of 1812 some Friends took up arms. In these cases the response of the body
                    of the society was uniform. Friends who fought were offenders against the Discipline who, if they
                    would not repent and condemn their misconduct to the satisfaction of Friends, would be
                    "disowned," the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> term for excommunicated.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This stance broke down during the Civil War. Virtually all southern Quakers were staunch unionists,
                    and those who were mustered into the Confederate army were nearly all unwilling conscripts, many of
                    whom passively resisted efforts to arm and train them. In the North, young <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> men faced an agonizing choice. Virtually unanimous in their support for the Union and
                    for generations opposed to slavery, Friends confronted what by 1863 had become an antislavery war.
                    This was reason for many to break with the Peace Testimony. For the first time, some monthly
                    meetings looked the other way and did not deal with such men as offenders against the Discipline.
                    This was especially true in Indiana Yearly Meeting. One analysis has concluded that about a quarter
                    of all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> men of military age in the state, about twelve hundred in all, enlisted in the Union
                    army. While some monthly meetings did proceed against enlistees, many others ignored them
                        entirely.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Civil War, Indiana Yearly Meeting experienced dramatic and lasting change. A wave of
                    revivalism that transformed their lives and modes of worship swept up most Orthodox Friends in
                    Indiana. At the heart of this "Great Revival" was a group of young <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> ministers who had been caught up in the interdenominational second-experience holiness
                    movement. Such holiness advocates argued that all Christians should have two distinct, instantaneous
                    experiences: first conversion, or being "born again," and secondly sanctification,
                    which purged believers of the desire or propensity to sin. Such ministers used these teachings as
                    tools for a radical transformation of Gurneyite Quakerism, especially in the Midwest. Most of the
                    traditional <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> peculiarities, such as the "plain dress" and "plain
                    language" of "thee" and "thy," disappeared.
                    Unprogrammed worship, based on silent waiting, gave way to music and regular preaching by ministers
                    whom by the 1890s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> congregations called pastors. By 1900, even the venerable labels of "Society
                    of Friends" and "Friends Meeting" were giving way to "the

                    was the Peace Testimony. Now largely acculturated, most Indiana Friends embraced views on war,
                    pacifism, and conscientious objection that were not that much different from their neighbors in the
                    small towns, cities, and rural districts of the Middle West.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Part of this transformation was theological, as demonstrated by a debate that took place in 1878 and

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> holiness advocates. These influences led Updegraff to argue that Quaker pacifism was
                    based on misinterpretation of scripture; the Old Testament wars proved that sometimes God might
                    command believers to fight. Moreover, many non-<placeName>

                    their families. Such new members had no predilection to pacifism, and many revivalists in their
                    eagerness to win converts did not emphasize it.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Still, while powerful forces operated to undermine the Peace Testimony, other forces struggled to
                    uphold it. The holiness emphasis on biblical literalism and revivalism eventually bred a reaction.
                    After 1895 a group of young modernists emerged among Gurneyites, mostly affiliated with <placeName>

                    would prove to be the most influential American Friend of the twentieth century. Melding commitments
                    to modernist biblical study with an interest in the Social Gospel, these Friends also turned to the <placeName>

                    to pacifism, but to peace activities, joining non-Quakers in groups like the Fellowship of
                    Reconciliation or the Women's International League <list type="footnotes">

                    will come among them and lead them to agreement. Thus when Indiana Yearly Meeting considered
                    revisions of its doctrinal statements, it took only a determined and articulate minority to force
                    retention of traditional statements on peace, even if a majority was uninterested or hostile.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Certainly, anyone surveying official statements from the yearly meeting would find that it had not

                        <p>We feel bound explicitly to avow our unshaken persuasion that all war is utterly incompatible
                            with the plain precepts of our divine Lord and Law-giver, and the whole spirit of His
                            Gospel, and that no plea of necessity or policy, however urgent or peculiar, can avail to
                            release either individuals or nations from the paramount allegiance which they owe to Him
                            who hath said, "Love your enemies." In enjoining this love, and the
                            forgiveness of injuries, He who has bought us to Himself has not prescribed for man precepts
                            which are incapable of being carried into practice, or of which the practice is to be
                            postponed until all shall be persuaded to act upon them….</p>

                    were to gauge their spiritual states and those of their members: "DO you maintain the
                    Christian principle of peace and consistently refrain from bearing arms and from performing military
                    service as incompatible with the precepts and spirit of the Gospel?" By 1950, this query
                    had been somewhat enlarged: "DO you consistently practice the Christian principles of love
                    and good will toward all men? Do you work actively for peace and for the removal of the causes of
                    war? Do you observe the testimony of Friends against military training and service? Do you endeavor
                    to make clear to all whom you can influence, that war is inconsistent with the spirit and teaching
                    of Jesus?" A similar query remains in the <hi rend="i">Faith and Practice.</hi>

            <p>Historians of religion are familiar with official statements of faith that have ceased to be
                    normative for most members. Considerable evidence shows that these doctrinal arguments did not
                    persuade most Indiana Friends.</p>
            <p>Before 1917 the military held little appeal for Indiana Quakers. A survey by the yearly
                    meeting's Peace Committee in 1915 showed that only eight members out of nearly twenty

                    Among the leaders were Walter C. Woodward, the long time executive secretary of the Five Years
                    Meeting and editor of <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi>, and Allen D. Hole, a professor at Earlham

                    involve exactly the same sacrifice of the principles of the Christian religion which has
                    characterized other wars." When it convened in the fall of 1917, the yearly meeting

                    conducted a debate on "Peace vs. Preparedness." The "appreciative
                    audience" voted the peace advocates the winners. In 1915 and 1916 several of the monthly
                    meetings surveyed received requests from the Peace Association of Friends to petition Congress to
                    oppose increases in military spending and other such "preparedness" activities. <placeName>

            <p>Indiana Friends may have escaped further harassment because so many publicly supported the war. Some
                    simply repudiated pacifism. Alpheus L. Baldwin, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> from Webster, Indiana, wrote in the spring of 1917 that 90 percent of the Friends he
                    knew "hold a view concerning war and the carrying of arms similar to that of other
                    Christians in other churches." He condemned as "very, very wrong" any
                    "printed or spoken word advising, urging, or suggesting that conscription be resisted, and
                    that Friends refuse to carry arms." Baldwin was exceptional in taking such a public stance,
                    but other actions of Indiana Friends were consistent with his views. A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friend, George M. Barnard, was the chairman of the county Council for Defense, charged
                    with advancing the local war effort, while a <placeName>

                    </placeName> Friend, Edward H. Harris, headed the Liberty Loan drive there. The experience of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Monthly Meeting is telling. Twenty-six members served in the military, while only three
                    were conscientious objectors. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Friends followed the careers of all, but clearly they took pride in the achievements of
                    their soldiers. In 1917 "a record book was secired [sic] and the names and addresses of the
                    boys were listed as they left for camp. Each month a letter was written by some one to the
                    boys…. Each time a transfer was made to a new camp or company, or a promotion given, the
                    proper notation was made in the book." By the end of the war <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Friends had written three hundred letters and mailed four hundred packages to their
                    soldiers. However, at least one <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Friend who enlisted in the marines, Loren J. Talbert, came home a confirmed pacifist

            <p>Some faculty and students at Earlham College, the yearly meeting's school, also supported
                    the war. Most of the faculty were Quakers, and they included some of the yearly meeting's
                    leading pacifists, such as Hole. The college newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Earlham Press</hi>,
                    deplored the wave of militarism that it saw sweeping the country. Yet the overwhelming majority of
                    Earlham men of military age went into military service: at least 253 served, as opposed to only 47
                    who can be identified as conscientious objectors. The first to enlist from campus, Thomas R. Ban,
                    was the son of a well-known Indiana Yearly Meeting pastor, Daisy Douglas <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Barr</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who served as president of the Indiana War Mothers organization. The Earlham soldiers
                    enlisted with the blessing of President Robert L. Kelly, who said, in a statement endorsed by the
                    college board, "Each man is answerable before God as to his duty in the situation which now
                    confronts him. Every man <list type="footnotes">

            <p>There are no complete figures on the number of Indiana Yearly Meeting Friends who served in the
                    military during World War I; it may be significant that the yearly meeting did not collect
                    statistics. One historian has estimated that about two-thirds of all American <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> men of military age rendered military service. In Indiana Yearly Meeting, the figure
                    may have been higher. Suggestive is a survey done in the spring of 1919 by Althea <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an Earlham student. She sent out questionnaires about participation in war-related
                    activities to all of the monthly meetings in Indiana. Of the My monthly meetings in Indiana Yearly
                    Meeting, thirty-eight responded. While some important monthly meetings, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> First Friends and most of those in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, are not included, the results reflect a cross section of the yearly meeting.
                    The statistics, shown in Table 1, are revealing. In some monthly meetings, like Amboy and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairmount</settlement>
                    </placeName>, conscientious objectors were in the majority. In others, every eligible man entered
                    the service.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Explaining these results is difficult. No geographical pattern emerges. The two monthly meetings in
                    the city of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> showed striking divergence—South <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> had a strong contingent of conscientious objectors, while <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> First Friends had none. Similarly, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairmount</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Back Creek</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Oak

                        <region type="county">Grant County</region>
                    </placeName>, but their members' responses to the war differed considerably.
                    Liberal/evangelical divisions in the yearly meeting also appear to have been irrelevant. Meetings
                    sympathetic to theological modernism, such as <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>, <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
               </placeName>, and West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had high rates of army enlistment. So did those that were strongly evangelical, such
                    as Farmland, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Garden</settlement>

            <p>Indiana Friends had an alternative to military service that many supported, the Reconstruction Unit
                    of AFSC. Growing out of a conference held in <placeName>

                    clothing, an activity that continues down to the present day. AFSC would become more controversial
                    as, later in the century, it grew more radical and political in advocating peace.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>World War I thus set a pattern for Indiana Friends. The yearly meeting would continue official
                    adherence to traditional positions, but most of the members would not consider them binding.
                    Pacifists would be a minority. World War II continued this trend.</p>
            <p>By the mid-1930s, pacifists, especially those in the Society of Friends, appeared to have reasons for
                    optimism. World War I had created a backlash against the use of military force, reinforced by
                    revelations of the machinations of bankers and armaments manufacturers who had seemingly duped the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into conflict. Certainly, as conflicts in Asia and Europe claimed increasing American
                    attention late in the decade, there is considerable evidence that Indiana Quakers opposed U.S.
                    participation. Anecdotal accounts suggest that the overwhelming majority were isolationist
                    Republicans in their sympathies. Earlham College President William C. Dennis was one of the
                    state's leading isolationist figures. In 1941 he toured the nation, speaking on behalf of
                    the America First Committee. "Every day I am more convinced that this is not our
                    war," he wrote to his congressman in 1940. When war broke out in Europe in 1939 the yearly
                    meeting sent a telegram to President Franklin D. Roosevelt stating its opposition to anything that
                    threatened American neutrality.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isolationism was not necessarily pacifism; Dennis, for example, was outspoken in justifying defensive
                    war. Late in the decade, however, some saw encouraging growth in pacifist sentiment. The yearly
                    meeting's Peace Committee, headed by Earlham professor Perry Kissick, a conscientious
                    objector who had gone to jail during World War I, organized conferences and distributed literature.
                    At Earlham pacifist groups attracted broad student support. At the local level some Friends made
                    uncompromising pacifist commitments. In 1937, for example, twenty <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friends, led by pastor Howard W. Cope, recorded in the monthly meeting minutes their
                    determination "not to participate in the prosecution of any war of any nature."
                    Thirty Anderson Friends signed a similar statement.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>When the U.S. entered the war after Pearl Harbor, most such sentiments evaporated. The editors of the
                        <hi rend="i">Earlham Post</hi> probably described the experience of most Indiana Friends:
                    "There is a minority which still holds that conflict was avoidable and to be regretted, but
                    what was for the most part a previously more or less isolationist campus swung quickly over to the
                    band-wagon with the national collapse of isolationist leadership." Willard Heiss, a Friend
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, doubtless stood for hundreds in believing that, at the time, the most important
                    thing in the world seemed to be stopping Hitler; he enlisted in the navy. Although the yearly

            <p>Some members used the war to advocate a new understanding of the Peace Testimony. Among them was
                    Dennis, a specialist in international law. He argued that since Friends approved of police forces,
                    they should support them on an international basis, distinguishing such "police
                    actions" under international auspices from traditional warfare. In 1943 the yearly meeting
                    debated Dennis's proposals; some journals, like <hi rend="i">Time</hi> magazine, gave them
                    wide coverage as a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> endorsement of the war. A badly divided yearly meeting approved them with some
                    modifications; members differed about whether Dennis's ideas conflicted with traditional <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> teaching. The statement affirmed pacifism but also recognized divisions in the yearly
                    meeting. "We do not censure Friends who have conscientiously participated in any way in the
                    war effort," it recorded. "We know that it is extremely difficult for anyone to
                    avoid a relationship to the war and to maintain the status of an absolute pacifist and that we are
                    all in some way aiding the present conflict." The yearly meeting also endorsed the concept
                    of an international peacekeeping organization, recognizing that such an organization might well use
                    force "in a world accustomed to the use of force."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Friends took strong stands for traditional <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> pacifism. Percy M. Thomas, a well-known pastor and former clerk of the yearly meeting,
                    branded participation in the war a denial of Christ. When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> endorsed the decision of its pastor to become an army chaplain, the monthly
                    meeting's clerk (or presiding officer), Clara Symons, resigned in protest,
                    "stating that she could not conscientiously sign this minute." The most visible
                    means of protest was conscientious objection. When Congress approved conscription in 1940, a few
                    Indiana Friends recorded statements with their monthly meetings. Typical was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friend Stanton Baily, who wrote, "I believe that war is wrong …. I
                    believe that in war time a person can do nothing both to help democracy, or to put forward the
                    divine qualities of man, or to show a belief in the brotherhood of man,—than to protest
                    taking part in the military system." In January 1941 Milo S. Hinckle, then the yearly
                    meeting superintendent, urged pastors not to take ministerial exemptions, but to register as
                    conscientious objectors. There are no statistics on the number of conscientious objectors from the
                    yearly meeting. In the summer of 1941 a survey by the yearly meeting Peace Committee showed that 42
                    men in 16 meetings intended to become conscientious objectors, but some may have changed their
                    positions after Pearl Harbor.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    poll found that between 1940 and 1944 the Midwest changed; after having been the section of the
                    country most sympathetic to conscientious objectors in 1940, it became the least supportive in 1944.
                    Pacifist Friends found that non-<placeName>

                    deferment that he almost surely would have received because he felt that he "must register
                    as great a protest as possible to this whole thing by stressing the C.O. position." He
                    fought a long battle with a hostile draft board, which was determined that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> would have no "slackers," before gaining a conscientious objector
                    classification. One enlistee from West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> was frank in writing to his pastor that "one has to have more gumption than I
                    to keep out of the conflict." In 1941 the yearly meeting Peace Committee bemoaned what it
                    saw as "the long failure to stress peace in local meetings." More disturbing was
                    opposition from other Friends. In some places the issue was so controversial that meetings refused
                    to discuss it. At one rural meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, for example, the sole conscientious objector, who had only recently joined the
                    meeting, found himself facing suspicions that he had become a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> only to dodge the draft. James P. Mullin vividly remembered his experience in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> working for AF'SC in 1941. AFSC wanted to open a CPS camp at <geogName>Quaker
                        Hill</geogName> on the northern edge of the city. This brought protests from the American
                    Legion, which objected to the planned presence of such "yellow-bellied slackers."
                    Public opinion quickly turned against the project. Several area Friends went to work to change
                    feelings, but they made little headway. Finally, Mullin told a conference of local Quakers
                    that" we need to … lay this concern before the First Friends Men's
                    Bible Class." Silence followed; then someone responded, "I think the
                    Men's Bible Class at First Friends will feel just like the American Legion does."
                    "You can see what that did to me inside. I was absolutely devastated," he recalled
                    fifty years later. "During that particular period of crisis, there wasn't support
                    here in the area for conscientious objectors." The yearly <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>So, during what has come to be called "the good war," Indiana Friends continued the
                    course that they had set earlier in the century. Officially, they remained committed to the Peace
                    Testimony and to support of conscientious objection. For many Friends, these were fundamental <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> tenets for which they made real sacrifices. For most Indiana Friends, however, these
                    views had to give way to the need to combat evil. What is striking is that Friends'
                    disagreement about peace activism seemed to lack political consequences. In the 1950s, that changed,
                    following changes in the larger American peace movement.</p>
            <p>Many conscientious objectors were radicalized by their experiences in CPS; they spoke out not only
                    against injustices in the larger society but also against the churches for cooperating with the
                    military in administering the camps. Influenced by such views, AFSC announced that in future
                    conflicts, it would not compromise with the government. Increasingly, peace activists resisted war
                    and denounced the injustices that they saw underlying war. This often meant forming ties with
                    leftist political groups. Some Indiana Friends embraced this new peace activism, but many others,
                    including some who had previously been sympathetic, found it troubling.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From 1945 to 1955 the yearly meeting remained officially committed to the Peace Testimony. Statements
                    regularly came forth denouncing the draft and proposals for universal military training. In 1946,
                    for example, the yearly meeting condemned the latter "heartily and unhesitatingly"
                    and characterized it as "a most apt and dangerous instrument of authoritarian dictatorship.
                    We know of no other measure which strikes more directly at the very foundation of our free
                    society." Some monthly meetings and individual Friends sent letters to their congressmen in
                    this vein or collected funds to use in opposition.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The yearly meeting's Peace and Service Committee continued to work; they held conferences,
                    distributed literature, and in 1949, produced a "monthly peace program calendar."
                    At the local level pastors gave "peace sermons." Friends donated money, soap, and
                    old clothing to AF'SC for relief work, while women's circles contributed items
                    they sewed. Collections were taken for the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) to use
                    to lobby against new draft legislation. In 1948 <placeName>

                    provided counseling on conscientious objection, and conscientious objectors continued to come from
                    meetings whose evangelicalism was unquestionable. Some meetings invited staff members from the Five
                    Years Meeting to speak on peace at worship or in Sunday school classes. In 1951 four <placeName>

            <p>While these manifestations of the Peace Testimony found support in the yearly meeting, others proved
                    more controversial. The most public disagreements came in 1948 and 1949, when eleven Earl-ham
                    College students, citing reasons of conscience, protested the newly enacted draft law by refusing to
                    register. Although only two of the students were members of the yearly meeting, the cases of all
                    received considerable publicity, and they left Earlham and Indiana Quakers facing a dilemma.</p>
            <p>Nonregistration first became an issue for Indiana Quakers in the summer of 1948. In July the Five
                    Years Meeting and Friends General Conference sponsored a peace conference at Earlham. Wide divisions
                    quickly became apparent, mirroring splits in the national peace movement. Traditional <placeName>

                    </placeName> pacifists were determined to take maximum advantage of provisions for conscientious
                    objectors in the recently approved draft law. Radicals wanted to protest the draft by refusing to
                    register. The conference participants, running out of time and unable to reach consensus, let a
                    subcommittee summarize the conference's conclusions. The result was radical, especially

                    disobedience under Divine Compulsion as an honorable testimony fully in keeping with the history and
                    practices of Friends." For many Indiana Friends, this was too much, especially after the <placeName>

                    </placeName> American Legion came into possession of some pamphlets distributed at the conference by
                    a radical absolute pacifist group, the Peacemakers, and branded them "criminally
                    seditious." Leading Indiana Quakers such as Errol T. Elliott, editor of the <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi>, and Earlham president Thomas E. Jones, quickly distanced themselves from
                    the conference. Soon Indiana Friends had to deal with the Earlham draft resisters.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The draft resisters, not all of whom were Quakers, all cited religious convictions in refusing to
                    register. Even to give their names voluntarily to the government was a compromise with evil, to do
                    something that Christ would not do. In 1949 the yearly meeting endorsed their right to take this
                    position. "We believe that every young man who, under a sense of religious compulsion,
                    feels that he must refuse to comply with the Draft Law, at any point, should follow the supreme
                    authority of his inner guide," the yearly meeting recorded. "We believe that every
                    Christian and every Christian Church body should encourage and support him in his loyalty to the
                    highest that he knows." Clyde Harned, a member of Richsquare Meeting in <placeName>

                    </placeName> daily newspaper that vociferously denounced the "draft dodgers,"
                    Harned wrote, "Your editorials stink." Mills, the new clerk of the yearly meeting
                    Peace Committee, headed an informal committee to raise funds for the nonregistrants' legal
                    defense, while Earlham professors Wildman and George Scherer, both members at West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, administered the funds.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most Indiana Friends, even those who respected conscientious objection, apparently looked askance at
                    such activities. Robert N. Huff, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friend, doubtless spoke for them in arguing that very few Quakers were such
                    "zealots"; Huff was sure that most Indiana Friends viewed nonregistration as
                    simple lawbreaking. While Earlham president Jones refused to condemn the nonregistrants publicly,
                    neither did he endorse their decision. Privately he tried to persuade them to change their minds, as

            </p>
            <p>The willingness of some Indiana Friends to question pacifism publicly is even more striking. While
                    Jones at Earlham remained personally a pacifist, he was also a passionate supporter of the United
                    Nations, and he argued that the Korean War was a "police action" that did not
                    violate the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> testimony against war, a view that Elliott thought had merit. Philip Johnson, the
                    pastor at West Elkton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, cited the defeat of Hitler as evidence of the impossibility of pacifist methods:
                    "Fortunately for the pacifist," he wrote, "the majority of men are
                    willing to meet evil with adequate means, even if that means war." Pacifists, he argued,
                    were proponents of "a false doctrine and a dangerous practice." Trueblood, who
                    served as an official in the Eisenhower administration in 1954-1955, was equally emphatic. In 1956
                    he denounced proposals by Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson to end both the draft
                    and atmospheric nuclear weapons tests: "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, providing he is sincere about wanting peace, will not try to undermine the deterrent
                    power of the West, as a few misguided ones do now."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the years following the Korean War tensions over pacifism erupted into open conflict in at least
                    one meeting. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName> was polarized between Friends who were World War I veterans and members of the American
                    Legion and pacifists like Mills and Ray Stewart, a World War II veteran who had resigned a
                    lieutenant colonel's commission when he became convinced that war was wrong. The breaking
                    point came in 1956, when nonpacifists forced the dismissal of a pastor who was an articulate peace
                    advocate. The pacifists left to take over the nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> meetinghouse, which had been closed a few years earlier. There they made the reborn

            <p>The split at <placeName>

                    </placeName> Meeting highlighted new lines of cleavage in the yearly meeting. With the onset of the
                    Cold War, fear of communism pervaded American society, and Indiana Friends shared such fears.
                    "With communism creeping in our government, schools and churches as it is we must seek
                    God's grace often," Walnut Ridge Friends recorded. In the minds of many Americans,
                    pacifism was tinged with "procommunism." Neighbors <list type="footnotes">

                    pacifist Friends combined their peace advocacy with liberal politics and theology. <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi> advocated a nuclear test ban and recognition of Red <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It condemned loyalty oaths and McCarthyism. "Thought control wrapped in the
                    American flag is just as repugnant and as dangerous as thought control bearing the stamp of the
                    hammer and sickle," it editorialized. Members of the yearly meeting expressed increasing
                    discomfort with AFSC, which was becoming more leftist in its politics. In 1960 the editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> daily newspaper, a member of First Friends Meeting there, wrote articles attacking a
                    local AFSC youth camp as being under communist influence, charges that many in the yearly meeting
                    echoed in an acrimonious debate. The editor claimed that "reds" were using
                    gullible Friends to undermine national defense. Perhaps in reaction to such developments, the yearly
                    meeting Peace Committee increasingly stressed the Christian and biblical bases of the Peace
                        Testimony.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout this period, local meetings and the yearly meeting were frank in acknowledging the limits
                    of their peace witness. Some meetings admitted that they had no members capable of counseling young
                    men about conscientious objection. "As we look over the last year's work we
                    realize very little has been done in the name of Peace," Walnut Ridge Friends recorded in
                    1949. "We are still weak in our Peace Testimony," was the conclusion at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName> six years later. That same year Friends at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Garden</settlement>
                    </placeName> noted that the only activity of its Peace Committee in the past year had been to
                    collect a free will offering to be sent to AFSC for clothing for refugees. "It is with
                    grave concern that we note the indifference and in many meetings the complete disregard of some
                    members to the basic teachings of the Society of Friends," the yearly meeting told members
                    in 1948. "We deplore the trust our members put in military preparedness and use of force as
                    a substitute for Christ's teaching of Love and Brotherhood among all men." In 1952
                    the Peace Committee reported that it found little interest in its activities because "the
                    Peace Testimony of Friends is neglected in all too many of our monthly meetings."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

                    </placeName> War reflected this reality. In its official actions the yearly meeting called for a
                    negotiated peace and affirmed its support of conscientious objectors. Active antiwar activity was
                    largely confined to theologically liberal Friends in a small number of meetings, especially West

                    held on the Earlham College campus. By 1967 more conservative Friends were responding to the antiwar
                    movement with protests of their own, denouncing what they saw as its "un-American"
                    bent.</p>

                    bombing, and negotiations by all parties. The yearly meeting repeatedly urged monthly meetings to
                    provide draft counseling and support for conscientious objectors. Still, after 1966 the yearly
                    meeting minutes show little relating specifically to the war, other than in reports from AFSC and
                        FCNL.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>Some individuals and meetings were extremely active in upholding conscientious objection and opposing
                    the war. Lorton Heusel, the general secretary of Friends United Meeting, in 1972 signed a national
                    statement of religious leaders opposing the <placeName>

                    Friends United Meeting, regularly ran articles supporting a wide variety of antiwar activities,
                    ranging from conscientious objection to active involvement in the antiwar movement. The yearly
                    meeting did not collect statistics on conscientious objection, but scattered records and anecdotal
                    evidence indicate that some <placeName>

                    Some came from meetings not known for political or doctrinal liberalism. At least one <placeName>

                    </placeName> War exposed and probably widened fissures in the yearly meeting. While there are no
                    statistics available, observers agree that a majority of young men of draft age in the yearly
                    meeting were not conscientious objectors. Some members of the yearly meeting openly backed the war,
                    while others were vocal in dissociating themselves from the antiwar movement in general and liberal <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> antiwar activists in particular.</p>
            <p>Among the members of the yearly meeting who were public supporters of the war was David W. Dennis, a

                    1968, where he consistently supported Nixon administration policies. More vexing to liberal Friends
                    was the support of the war by Trueblood, unquestionably the yearly meeting's best-known
                    member. Trueblood valued his personal ties with Nixon and consistently argued that Nixon's
                    "Peace with Honor" policies were in accord with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> beliefs. Trueblood, while upholding the integrity of conscientious objectors, blasted
                    the New Left elements of the antiwar movement. There is no doubt that Dennis and Trueblood spoke for
                    many Indiana Quakers, like those at <placeName>

            <p>Divisions like these underscored the discomfort of socially and politically conservative Friends with
                    the drift of American society in the late 1960s: they simply could not endorse lawbreaking. The case

                    </placeName> Friend who returned his draft card demonstrated the hostility of Indiana Yearly Meeting
                    Friends to civil disobedience. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hopewell</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friends took the lead in raising a defense fund; the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, because it would split the meeting. The contrast with the Friends' reaction
                    to the Earlham draft resisters in 1949 is striking; then the yearly meeting expressed sympathy for
                    their actions. No endorsements of civil disobedience were forthcoming in the late 1960s; at least
                    two monthly meetings specifically condemned it. Patriotism played a part as well; most Indiana
                    Friends considered themselves intensely loyal Americans, and they doubted whether that was true of
                    many protesters. Antipathy to AFSC, which took the lead in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> antiwar activities, doubtless played a part as well. "I was aware of an
                    enormous amount of violent, negative reaction against AFSC in most of the circles I moved in
                    … in this yearly meeting," one prominent Friend remembered. Criticism of AFSC
                    ranged widely. Many Indiana Friends saw it as a bastion of theological liberalism; one Friend noted
                    that the most furious denunciations of the <hi rend="i">Phoenix</hi> came from fundamentalist
                    Friends in the yearly meeting. Such theological conservatives could respect conscientious objection
                    but found peace advocacy frightening. In turn, the meetings most involved in peace activities, such
                    as West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

            <p>A century after it first began to tolerate active participation in war by members Indiana Friends
                    were still pondering the Peace Testimony. Officially and institutionally, they remained committed to
                    it; as recently as 1990 the yearly meeting recorded its opposition to the use of force in the Gulf
                    War. Increasingly, however, Indiana Friends have become part of the world around them. A small

            <p>This article discusses a selection of primary sources used to study the black population of Gary,
                    Indiana, from 1906 to 1920.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The sources include federal manuscript census
                    schedules, city directories, school enumerations, and marriage application records.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Through a brief description of each type of document, the author will try to underline the
                    importance of name-based sources in the study of the Great Migration and examine ways social
                    historians can make the most of the wealth of the information contained in them.</p>
            <p>This research note also addresses three concerns raised by the critics of the Great Migration
                    literature: that migration should be studied as a process; that black women and their families
                    should be included in this process; and that smaller "promised lands" (like Gary)
                    should be considered by historians.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Obviously, these documents are not the only primary sources available to
                        examine the twentieth-century northern migration of African Americans to Gary, Indiana. Other
                        sources include, for example, local newspapers, Sanborn fire insurance maps, papers of the
                        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (Gary files), and indexes of birth,
                        marriage, and death compiled by the Works Progress Administration. However, these will not be
                        examined here. The sources discussed reflect the author's experience in attempting to
                        reconstruct the entire black population of Gary before 1920, using the resources of the Calumet
                        Regional Archives (Indiana University Northwest), in Gary, Indiana. The decision to focus on
                        name-based sources was made after the first two research trips. While the manuscripts and
                        archival records available at the Calumet Regional Archives are rich, some sources were not very
                        helpful in building a database for an entire group of individuals. Documents such as the Mid
                        City Investment Company records have, nevertheless, unique qualities that will soon be exploited
                        to enrich the database on the black population of Gary, Indiana. The database has also been
                        supplemented by interviews with migrants. Compare these sources with the list of documents used

            <p>Federal Manuscript Census Schedules</p>
            <p>The richest sources for research on the Great Migration are the 1910 and 1920 federal manuscript
                    census schedules.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> As is well known, these government records contain an
                    impressive body of information on the population of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>: name, sex, race, age, and marital status, along with place of residence, tenure,
                    relation to the head of the family, citizenship status, place of birth, level of education, and
                    occupational condition.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> While helping to confirm basic facts such as
                    migrants' birthplace (Gary's black migrants were born mainly in states located in
                    the East South Central region), the federal manuscript census schedules also offer unique
                    opportunities to present a more complete picture of the migrant population. In the case of Gary,
                    this author found that African Americans migrated in families, not as
                    "solitaires." This finding suggests that the occupational analysis of migrants
                    needs to be placed in a family context; women and children family members could migrate to a city
                    that offered them limited employment opportunities because the wage-earning potential of their adult
                    male family members was adequate to provide for them if all family members contributed their
                    services (including children, who attended school to improve the family's future
                    prospects).</p>
            <p>Since the manuscript schedules have been used extensively in the last thirty years by social
                    historians, it would be superfluous to try to add to a body of work that convincingly established
                    the value of census-based research. However, to make sure future historians of the Great Migration
                    profit from the recent availability of the 1920 federal manuscript census schedules (March 19921,
                    one thing must be repeated: historians need to complement the census by looking at other name-based
                    sources, mainly because it is only by reducing their dependence on "snapshots"
                    produced once per decade that scholars will truly improve the quality of their results.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>City directories often serve as complements to the census.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Published on an
                    annual basis, they are particularly helpful to historians who wish to improve their knowledge of
                    local populations in the interval between each decennial census.</p>
            <p>Scholars studying black migrants to Gary will find the most complete collection of city directories
                    at the Gary Public Library. Four considerations should make it clear, however, that the Gary city
                    directories are not rich enough to be the only supplement to the federal manuscript census
                    schedules. First, even if all city directories enumerated the black residents of Gary, only three
                    directories (out of the nine available between 1910 and 1920) list African Americans with reference
                    to their racial identity: those of 1911, 1913, and 1918. Second, these alphabetical lists of names
                    give too little information on each individual.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Third, like information in the
                    federal census, the data in city directories represent a snapshot of the population visited.
                    Finally, the focus on the adult male population and the absence of listings for children make it
                    impossible to study women and family life.</p>
            <p>To state that city directories have limits does not mean that they cannot be used to understand
                    historical change. The Gary city directories are particularly rich for labor history, whether the
                    objective is to compile facts on labor, civic, and business organizations and leaders or to study
                    the occupational and geographical distribution of the population at specific times. The number of
                    laborers working in the steel mills serves as an example.</p>

                    temporary and highly selective response to pressures exerted by the reduction of immigration and
                    working-class protest. In comparison with the information presented by Potts, data collected from
                    city directories make it clear that almost a quarter of the labor force at the Gary Works commuted
                    to work on a daily basis, which should make scholars more aware that the realities observed in one

            <p>Marriage Application Records</p>
            <p>Used mostly by genealogists interested in retracing family roots, marriage records have become an
                    important source of knowledge for social historians since the 1960s.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The

                    license and the marriage application forms (one for each spouse). The first record is a marriage
                    certificate, signed and sealed by officials of the state and county. It provides little information
                    (name, date, and county), and none that is relevant for a study dealing with migration and family
                    strategies. The second record, considerably longer, is a form each spouse had to file to apply for a
                    marriage licence. Clearly, attention should be given to the latter.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi> City directories have received their share of criticism in the last
                        thirty years. Recently, however, scholars have presented a more nuanced picture of their
                        usefulness and reliability. For example, historians admit that problems such as underenumeration
                        and misspelling are influenced by the size of a city: city directories of large urban centers
                        usually record a higher percentage of errors than those of small urban centers. Our own detailed
                        analysis of underenumeration and misspelling has shown that other factors besides the size of a
                        city may help reduce the number of errors found in city directories of small urban centers like
                        Gary: the distinction between racial and ethnic patronymics; the influence of local (political)
                        events on the perception of enumerators; and the impact of the labor market on the presence of
                        respondents. See Nelson Ouellet, "The Flaws of Enumeration Events and African-American

            <p>The "race" section is certainly one of the most important elements of the marriage
                    application, for it gives the researcher an opportunity to use an individual's racial
                    identity to speed up the process of data collection. But the county also asked applicants to
                    identify themselves by name, age, and sex, and also to give the state information such as place of
                    birth, residence, and the occupations of themselves and their parents. Of course, these forms are
                    too extraordinary a source to ignore.</p>

                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> early in the century (the Works Progress Administration marriage index does not
                    identify the "race" of each spouse), direct access to the microfilmed records is
                    crucial, and that requires a special permission from the Clerk's office. In the
                    author's study, more than 1,782 individual forms (or 891 couple's applications) of
                    African Americans living in Gary who applied for a marriage license in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>

                    base.</p>
            <p>The information on place of birth and residency are extremely useful to fill in the gaps left by city
                    directories and the federal manuscript census schedules on migration patterns. Unlike the federal
                    population census (both in published and manuscript forms), in which data on birthplace are confined
                    to the state or country of birth, marriage application records identify both the state and also
                    (most importantly) the city and county of birth and residence of each individual whose name appears
                    on the form. For example, the marriage application records helped this author show that fewer than
                    20 percent of the migrants had left a rural setting before arriving in Gary. Also, whether because
                    they were born in southern cities, or had lived outside the cotton belt, it was revealed that more
                    than 80 percent of Gary's black migrants were not "pushed" out of the
                    South by the boll weevil. Furthermore, the findings based on marriage application records confirmed
                    the results found in the census regarding the relation between migrants and their families, since
                    more than 40 percent of the applicants whose parents were still alive had left the South in their
                    company and lived with them in Gary.</p>
            <p>These results are unique for two reasons: first, historians of the Great Migration have rarely worked
                    with sources such as manuscript censuses (the number of researchers dwindles almost to nothing if we
                    include the 1920 census); second, historians have generally used statistics (compiled and published
                    by the Bureau of the Census) that do not distinguish a place of birth from a place of exodus, a
                    fundamental consideration in any migration study.</p>

                    migrants to Gary "from the bottom up." Produced annually by the state of Indiana

            <p>The school enumeration records are censuses of the school age population that were done under the
                    jurisdiction of the state superintendent of education, whose responsibility it was to supervise the
                    work of county officers in charge of the annual collection of information. Several amendments to the
                    state school law modified the nature of the school enumerations, the most significant one being the
                    March 8, 1873, amendment that stipulated, for the first time, that separate schedules had to be
                    provided for black children.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    and their families. With them, one can follow children from school to the labor market and marriage
                    and examine their experiences in a family context. As the school enumerations give the
                    children's "occupation" (whether he or she was going to school or
                    working), they help explain why so many migrated to the steel city between 1906 and 1920 and show,
                    for the entire period, what their role within the family was: some were students, who were
                    encouraged to improve their lot in the community, and others were secondary workers on whose help

                    researcher's analysis of these documents revealed that boys worked more often than girls;
                    that reaching age twenty one did not mean leaving the family, especially for girls; and that school
                    attendance laws influenced entry into the labor market as much as family needs and civic
                    responsibility. Thus, the school enumeration records constitute an excellent source to give gender
                    its due attention; more generally, it is a way to reconstruct the experiences of those who left no
                    written records.</p>
            <p>The school enumeration records also permit researchers to compare the strategies of Gary's
                    black families with those of black families in rural and urban areas of the postbellum South. By
                    looking at the school enumeration records, and tying the results to other sources, the role each
                    individual played within the household can be presented in a nuanced fashion: the impact of the
                    local community never overshadows the experiences African Americans brought with them from the
                    South. Through this approach, the author concluded that work and education were two elements that
                    had shaped families' decisions since Emancipation and was able to establish how a better
                    understanding of the migration process begins with the idea of tradition, or the connection between
                    place of birth and exodus and place of destination. In fact, to study migrants' adaptation
                    to urban life in the North strictly from the perspective of the destination is methodologically
                    wrong, mainly because it neglects how African Americans coped with similar situations before their
                    arrival in cities of the North and how earlier experiences were tools to improve their condition,

            <p>Other name-based sources can be used to enrich the study of the Great Migration, namely birth and
                    death records and the census index known as the Soundex. They help to improve the analysis of family
                    strategies, migration patterns, and, ultimately, traditions. Unfortunately, for financial, legal,
                    and logistical reasons these records are not always easily accessible. Where, then, should social
                    historians look for alternative documents?</p>

            <p>This analysis of new and old sources available for studying the black population of Gary, Indiana,
                    attempts to overcome the weaknesses of traditional studies of the Great Migration. The analysis
                    poses a fundamental challenge to researchers for two reasons. First, studies based on the sources
                    discussed here succeed better than earlier methodologies in showing the migration process
                    "from the bottom up." Second, these same studies, when based on sound

                    call into question findings obtained through more traditional documentary research.</p>
            <p>This comment should not be interpreted as a call to abandon traditional sources like newspapers,
                    published government statistics, personal papers of "talented tenth"
                    representatives and those produced by organizations such as the National Association for the
                    Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League. Nor should it be seen as an attempt to
                    claim that name-based sources are more valuable than manuscript and archival records in the study of
                    the Great Migration. It is rather intended to stimulate a dialogue between sources that have so far
                    been isolated from one another. Name-based sources can direct the historian's attention to
                    the lives of "ordinary people," to the study of migration from the perspective of
                    families or of women and children as they interact with male breadwinners. Without this attention
                    historians of the Great Migration can contribute little to understanding the actual process of
                    migration. Therefore, the way one determines the differences between life in small towns and large
                    urban centers will remain incomplete as long as similar studies are not undertaken for cities like

            <p>In 2002 the 1930 federal population census schedules will become available. Therefore it is a fitting
                    time to consider the best ways to use this new source of information to study black migrants in the
                    first year of the Great Depression. The challenge issued in this essay for scholars to expand the
                    use of name-based sources is intended to initiate a debate on the obstacles and rewards of
                    census-based research in preparation for the rich new opportunities soon to be opened.</p>

                    Donald L. Parman. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    bibliography, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>A wonderful introduction to nineteenth-century Indiana Methodists, a counterview to the mythologizing
                    of Methodism by the Peter Cartwrights, a depiction of Methodist machinery in evolution, William
                    Graham's memoirs and Donald L. Parman's editing deserve high praise. Midwesterners
                    wanting to understand early Methodism could find no better starting place.</p>
            <p>The book succeeds in evoking an institution in transition, both because Graham clearly set out to
                    describe both his own life and that of the church and because Parman follows Graham's
                    narrative with almost every kind of explanation and apparatus one can imagine. In a seventeen-page
                    introduction informed by recent scholarship on Methodists and Indiana, Parman situates Graham in a
                    church evolving into a middle-class denomination that embraced education and a professional ministry
                    and made itself at home in ever finer buildings. Throughout, Parman translates technical and
                    idiosyncratic Methodist language into terms readily comprehensible to those unfamiliar with the
                    denomination. In elaborate glossaries of place names (pp. 197-205) and personal names (pp. 207-63),
                    he describes Graham's world and those who peopled it (examples are captured in fifty
                    pictures and plates). The glossary of names is a who's who of national Methodists, and its
                    sources are itemized in an eight-page bibliography. The index includes not only places, persons, and
                    events but also terms such as superannuation, love feasts, quarterly meetings, presiding elders,
                    class leaders, and other Methodist mysteries.</p>
            <p>Mysterious Graham was not. Indeed, he typifies border state Methodist clergymen. Born in 1821 into a
                    Pennsylvania family that produced several Methodist ministers, and converted at eight
                    "under the teaching of my Mother," he was licensed to preach in 1844 in the
                    citadel of the denomination, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> Conference. Graham moved west to begin his ministry in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> Conference, served several years in Indian missions (Indian Mission Conference), and
                    married a southerner, Mary Kinnibrugh. The 1844 split of episcopal Methodists put Graham in the
                    southern church, from which he extricated himself with a request for a transfer, the first of
                    several overtures made by or to him about changes in appointment. He moved to North Indiana in 1847
                    and served in Indiana conferences until his death in 1897. Graham paid his dues, rising from junior
                    circuit preacher through a succession of important station appointments. Earning a reputation as a
                    church builder and troubleshooter, he was early appointed presiding elder. In this post, now termed
                    district superintendent, <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-096-1-091"/> which was perhaps the key strategic
                    post for nineteenth-century Methodist churchmen, Graham served twice, 1853-1857 and 1867-1874.
                    Graham divulges little about his exercise of the office, how appointments were made, what he and
                    other presiding elders did when huddled with the bishop. Indeed, seldom in the <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> does he permit himself introspection (he does not, for instance, say much about
                    slavery). Graham played other important roles, about which he also reflects little—twice
                    member of general conference, booster of Methodist colleges (trustee, visitor, agent), board member
                    of conference and national agencies, on the publishing committee of the <hi rend="i">Northwestern
                        Christian Advocate</hi>, and conference secretary. Not an astute analyst of his own actions,
                    Graham nevertheless was a good observer and commentator on the roles of others and of their exercise
                    of authority and power. And it is this that makes the book such a helpful window on Methodism in
                    evolution.</p>

                    the war, but especially during its all-western phase, the unit's courage and discipline
                    earned it the sobriquet of Iron Brigade. Its exploits have inspired numerous books and articles by

                    primary sources and strong narrative writing. Despite these strengths, even the Civil War buffs who
                    seem to be the book's intended audience may be disappointed because there is little that is
                    new in most of these essays. And Hoosier readers may be especially disconcerted by the
                    book's heavy emphasis on <placeName>

                    Indiana, and the bibliography cites few Indiana secondary or governmental sources. The authors

            <p>When author Juliet Strauss died at her home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1918, she was well known, both in Indiana and in the nation; her
                    "Country Contributor" column was regularly published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi>, and her column in the <hi rend="i">Ladies Homes Journal</hi>, "The
                    Ideas of a Plain Country Woman," was read by approximately one million readers each month.
                    Today she is scarcely remembered: her only book is out of print, and her role in saving the
                    woodlands that became Turkey Run State Park is largely unknown.</p>
            <p>Ray Boomhower, in writing a well-researched and very readable biography of this woman, rescues her
                    memory, and the excerpts from Strauss's writings in the book's appendices give a
                    feel for both her style and her basic convictions.</p>
            <p>In 1863 Juliet Humphries was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she lived her entire life. After her father's death when she was four,
                    Juliet and her three siblings were reared by their mother, who provided books and a happy home,
                    though they were poor.</p>
            <p>At the age of seventeen Juliet married a local boy who later became the editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, and she became a full-time homemaker and mother of two daughters. In
                    1893, the first of the weekly columns she was to write for twenty-five years appeared in <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-096-1-093"/> her husband's newspaper. She discussed local events, but she
                    also reflected on the meaning of her life, offering the viewpoint of a plain country woman who
                    enjoyed being a homemaker and rearing her family. This continued to be her theme throughout her
                    writing career.</p>
            <p>In 1903 the "Country Contributor" column began to appear in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> and was immediately successful. In 1905, Edward Bok, editor of the <hi rend="i">Ladies Home Journal</hi>, asked her to write a regular column. A little over a year
                    later he declared hers to be one of the most successful features the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> had
                    published. In 1908 her columns from the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> appeared as a book.</p>
            <p>In 1915, when she was at the height of her powers as a popular lecturer, author, and columnist, she
                    became passionately interested in saving a large tract of virgin woodland where she had played as a
                    child. Strauss contacted many people to try to avert the sale of the land to timber buyers. She was
                    able to interest Indiana Governor Samuel Ralston, Richard Lieber, and many others, and together they
                    persuaded the state to conserve the acreage as the Turkey Run State Park, as part of
                    Indiana's centennial celebration.</p>
            <p>After Strauss's death in 1918, the Women's Press Club coordinated donations for a
                    memorial in Turkey Run State Park, and in 1922 a statue by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> sculptor Myra Richards was dedicated to Strauss's memory.</p>
            <p>Juliet Strauss's writings were enormously popular in her time. To modern ears, her
                    exhortations on the duty of a woman to serve her family's needs in the home and to
                    sacrifice any ambitions of her own may seem outdated, but her appreciation of the value of the
                    simple life, devoid of artifice, rings as true as ever. Raised in a small Hoosier community she
                    never left, she preached to a national audience the values she had learned there. Hard work,
                    self-sufficiency, kindness, love of family, and acceptance of one's lot in life were the
                    virtues she recommended to others and practiced in her own life.</p>

            <p>An astonishing variety of maps, statistical graphs, and photographs are carefully integrated with

                    which can be viewed with plastic overlays (in pocket) showing county boundaries and names. The
                    thirteen chapters and the frontispiece feature superb oblique air photos in natural color, all of
                    them (as well as some thirty others) taken by <geogName>Keith Mountain</geogName>, a geographer at

                    "The Natural Environment." The thirty-two pages in chapter 3, "Historical
                    and Cultural Landscapes," offer an impressive array of illustrations depicting the human

            <p>Following the three-chapter overview are ten thematic chapters, each prepared by scholars with
                    special expertise. Organized in an almost sequential pattern, the chapter topics include:

                    the three oldest states in the Northwest Territory have yet to produce a my-integrated geographical

                    informative and lively," (p. xiii) and that it certainly is. Mark Wyman begins with the
                    voyages of John Cabot, Giovanni da Verrazano and Jacques Cartier along the Atlantic seaboard and the
                        <geogName>St. Lawrence River</geogName>. After a chapter on Indian life before contact with
                    Europeans, he traces the growth of the fur trade between the French and Indian peoples, the
                    international competition for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> resources, and the changes produced by American control of the region after the War of
                    1812. The history is not only a diplomatic study of competing interests but also a study of the
                    social, cultural, and environmental changes over three centuries of settlement.</p>
            <p>In a concluding chapter, fittingly entitled "Legacies," Wyman evaluates the
                    environmental costs of exploiting the area of <placeName>

                    historian Frederick Jackson Turner. Although both wrote to correct eastern notions, they perceived

                    chronicling the rise and fall of professional football in another area of the state, the

                    teams in the 191Os, their popularity in the 1920s, and, in the final third of the book, he explains
                    the surprising entrance of the Portsmouth Spartans into the young NFL in 1930. By this time, the NFL
                    had evolved from its small-town origins, but the Portsmouth Spartans fielded an excellent squad:
                    they played in the 1932 championship game against the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bears, and they might have survived except for the Great Depression. Their departure to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they became the Lions, marked the end of major professional football in this
                    region of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and, except for the Green Bay Packers, in small-town America.</p>
            <p>Becker tells his story clearly and well, and the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Press has published it in an exceptionally handsome edition. But finally, at its
                    center, the book contains a serious flaw. Except for the depression, the author rarely connects his
                    team-by-team and game-by-game story to wider events. <hi rend="i">Home and Away</hi> is sports
                    history at its most detailed, but, like so many works of that genre, it exists mainly in a sports
                    vacuum, only sporadically connected to the deeper social currents of the time.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the best book on the early days of pro football in Indiana, Emil Klosinski's
                        <hi rend="i">Pro Football in the Days of Rockne</hi> (1970), is much more modestly printed and
                    much richer in content. Becker never mentions Klosinski's book or the Indiana connections
                    to the <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-096-1-097"/> NFL, but, considering that the Hoosier history features
                    the legendary coach, Knute Rockne, and such players as George Gipp, Becker's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> parochialism does not serve him well.</p>
            <p>Finally, however, both Becker's book and Klosinski's contain one similar and
                    ongoing theme that is extremely important for the historical record: they describe in great detail
                    the corruption in college football during the first decades of this century and how almost every
                    semi-pro and professional football team recruited college players for Sunday games, usually
                    disguising their identities and paying them various amounts of cash. All of this contradicts the
                    standard histories of intercollegiate athletics, which depict this era as a golden age of
                    amateurism. Becker and Klosinski provide irrefutable evidence of the early professionalism of many
                    college athletes, and this aspect of their books serves as a valuable antidote to the official
                    histories published by various schools as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association.</p>

            <p>It is unfortunate that one of this country's largest internal migrations has gone unnoticed
                    by most historians. Hundreds of thousands of people from the southern <geogName>Appalachian
                        Mountains</geogName> flooded the Midwest during and after World War I and continued to do so
                    through the 1950s, leading jokesters to remark that the new capital of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was Akron, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Carl E. Feather's book, <hi rend="i">Mountain People in a Flat Land</hi>,
                    attempts to explain the experiences of that multitude by focusing on <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Ashtabula County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in the far northeast corner of the state. The son of West Virginians who
                    came north in 1956, Feather, a local journalist, highlights the ambivalence associated with leaving
                    home to put food on the table and dispels the nasty stereotypes leveled against the migrants. His
                    work is intended to be a "popular, oral history," he disclaims early on, not a
                    "genealogical research tool, social or economic history, or textbook of
                    migration." It is about "common people in search of a better life" (pp.
                    11-12).</p>
            <p>The author is forthright in his acknowledgment that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ashtabula County</region>
                    </placeName> was not the destination that Akron, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
               </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> were, but that admission neither discounts the importance of his book nor detracts from
                    its potential. Indeed, that Feather is able to construct a story about a second-tier destination
                    shows how pervasive southern white migration in general <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-096-1-098"/> and
                    Appalachian migration in particular were in the Midwest. Requiring less adjustment from migrants
                    than the inner city ports of entry of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s larger cities, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ashtabula County</region>
                    </placeName> "provided hundreds of southern highlanders with the same opportunities
                    … without the stresses inherent in an urban atmosphere" (p. 28), which was
                    exactly the reason why similar migrants could be found in cities <hi rend="i">and</hi> towns
                    throughout Indiana.</p>
            <p>Feather listened and gathered other people's stories, invoking the wonderful metaphor that
                    he was "but a weaver working with borrowed yarn" (p. xxv). In mini-chapters that
                    accent individuals whom Feather characterizes as heroic, he enriches the understanding of the larger
                    migrant experience by describing the range of migrant life: gardening, apple butter production,
                    kinship, religion, cultural persistence, intercultural growth, music, retirement. All of the
                    vignettes show the mountaineer migrant finding the economic success that prompted migration in the
                    first place, a refreshing twist on a story long plagued by an emphasis on maladjustment and economic
                    failure.</p>
            <p>A professional historian can find things with which to quibble. Feather occasionally lags far behind
                    current Appalachian historiography, such as when he lists cultural characteristics of migrants, and
                    at times he clearly loses critical detachment in setting his informants on so high a pillar
                    ("Appalachia gave the North its very best, hardest-working, most resourceful and ambitious
                    individuals" [p. 10]). But if good history is good storytelling, this book is largely
                    successful. What he has spun with borrowed yarn is a splendid tapestry of a long-neglected
                    experience.</p>

               <hi rend="i">For Courageous Fighting and Confident Dying: Union Chaplains in the Civil War.</hi>
                    By Warren B. Armstrong. (Lawrence: University Press of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, 1998. Pp. xii, 171. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>In this slim but impressive volume, Warren B. Armstrong tells the story of those who provided
                    spiritual sustenance for Union army troops. "Giving the chaplains a direct voice"
                    (p. x) to express their own thoughts and describe their diverse activities throughout the Civil War,
                    Armstrong shows the government's efforts to meet the religious needs of its soldiers, the
                    character and duties of the chaplains, and the value of their service, both to those who saw combat
                    and to those victimized by slavery. The result is a carefully researched and richly informative
                    addition to a mushrooming body of scholarly works on religion during the war.</p>
            <p>From the beginning the book reveals how the war transformed military chaplaincy. While previously the
                    chaplain's primary role <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-096-1-099"/> had been to invoke divine
                    sanction for military actions, the Civil War introduced "the idea of service to the
                    soldiers" (p. ix). Pastoral care thus became the central duty of chaplains.</p>
            <p>Starting small, with only thirty post chaplains in Union ranks when Sumter fell, their numbers grew
                    rapidly after May 1861, when the War Department issued General Orders numbers 15 and 16, which
                    provided for chaplains in volunteer regiments as well as in new units of the professional army.
                    Controversies arose regarding their role in the army, their status, and the way they should
                    function. Questions of remuneration and rank—and therefore of their standing in the armed
                    forces—shaped numerous congressional debates about chaplains, as did the requirements for
                    their appointment to posts. Moreover, as pastors began to function in military positions, they faced
                    a number of problems: regimental officers who resisted religious services or were openly
                    antagonistic toward the "Holy Joes"; surgeons who set rigid rules restricting the
                    activities of hospital chaplains; the stark reality of an underlying incompatibility between war and
                    the Judeo-Christian ethic; and the drunkenness, profanity, gambling, and Sabbath-breaking that
                    attended camp life.</p>
            <p>Yet, as Armstrong cogently demonstrates, the ministries of Union chaplains were strikingly effective.
                    As they fulfilled their primary calling "to offer both sustenance and solace" (p.
                    15) to the fighting men, chaplains gave confidence to men in crisis by exhibiting compassion,
                    courage, self-control, and, above all, flexibility, the capacity to "bend to the
                    extraordinary circumstances produced by a great civil war …" (p. 42). The author
                    is penetrating in his depiction of the relationship between chaplains and the men they served, an
                    account based both on the memoirs and reports of the ministers and on the journals of members of
                    their "flocks." He is equally incisive in analyzing the chaplains' views
                    on slavery and their efforts on behalf of the freedmen. The volume also contains colorful anecdotes,
                    such as how Ella Gibson almost became the Union's only female chaplain; how Copperhead
                    congressman Clement L. Vallandigham arranged for Jewish chaplains; how Notre Dame's Father
                    William Corby created a "military mass" (p. 21). Students of Indiana history
                    particularly will appreciate the many references to Hoosier chaplains and regiments sprinkled
                    throughout the book.</p>
            <p>Although Armstrong clearly provides a full account of the ministry of chaplains to the troops, his
                    coverage of the "confident dying" promised by the title is disappointing. Though
                    he alludes to it early in the volume (pp. 23-24), the solace chaplains provided to the dying appears
                    as a virtual afterthought in the brief closing chapter. Similarly, Armstrong's
                    concentration on the chaplains' contributions to freed-men's education and
                    welfare, while informative and insightful, seems questionable, especially since the author himself
                    admits that, to get a "coherent picture" of such activities, one has to go
                    "beyond the limitations of discussion concerning the work done among blacks by <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-096-1-100"/> chaplains as <hi rend="i">chaplains…</hi>" (p. 81,
                    emphasis Armstrong's). Despite these drawbacks, this study remains essential reading for
                    anyone interested in religion and religious leadership during the war.</p>

            <p>Frederick Jackson Turner continues to be one of the most controversial of American historians. Since
                    his death in 1932, his interpretation of American history has continued to be subjected to intense
                    scrutiny, both by those who would substantiate and those skeptics who would demolish his views. In
                    their now outdated <hi rend="i">Frederick Jackson Turner: A Reference Guide</hi> (1985), Vernon E.
                    Mattson and William E. Marion identified (in English language alone) and annotated nearly 1400
                    dissertations, published articles, and books on Turner.</p>
            <p>Since Turner has already received a major full-length biographical study in Ray Allen Billington, <hi rend="i">Frederick Jackson Turner: Historian, Scholar, Teacher</hi> (1973), it seems reasonable
                    to ask whether another is needed. Both Allen G. Bogue's study and Billington's
                    rely heavily on voluminous manuscript sources as well as the secondary literature; the overlap in
                    biographical coverage is considerable. Billington's emphasis was to portray Turner as a
                    college professor consumed with the trivia of administration, dedicated to his students and their
                    careers, frequently speaking to alumni and civic groups, and pursuing his professional life.</p>
            <p>In this study, Bogue, who is Turner professor of history emeritus at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, uses a broader canvas on which to portray a more detailed and intimate account of the
                    man and his life. Bogue's balanced examination of Turner's views on the frontier
                    and sectionalism should temper the sometimes total rejection of Turner's perspectives by
                    historians.</p>
            <p>Bogue traces the evolution of Turner's research and thinking. Because Turner's
                    explanations are not always clear and are vulnerable to varying interpretations, Bogue clarifies
                    what Turner did say and what he was trying to express. Further, Bogue establishes that
                    Turner's essays were status reports on their subjects as of the time of their writing and
                    that he continued to modify his ideas. Many critics fail to realize that Turner did not regard them
                    as being static in form or substance. While he was sensitive to criticism, Turner was also open to
                    evidence and analysis that could modify or revise his <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-096-1-101"/> views.
                    This is Bogue's considerable contribution to the examination of Turner's life and
                    intellectual legacy.</p>
            <p>The author's penchant for detail—the thought-by-thought analysis of
                    correspondence, a phrase-by-phrase examination of the essays, a thrust-by-thrust presentation of
                    speeches, the immersion into the nitty gritty of everyday living—unfortunately makes for
                    tedious reading. The reader gets lost in the details.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, for everyone interested in a better understanding of the frontier and
                    sectionalism—Transappalachia and the Old Northwest figured prominently in
                    Turner's studies—Bogue's biography is the essential well-balanced
                    introduction. For those who already know where they stand, a careful reading of Bogue may reaffirm
                    or unsettle some of their thinking. Further, it is a model biography and a case study of economic,
                    naval, and geographic determinism.</p>
            <p>Bogue acknowledges that Turner consistendy argued that racism and slavery played secondary roles in
                    American development and that Turner's views on recent immigrants, Indians, and Jews were
                    stereotypical. These positions need careful examination in their context as well as assessment from
                    today's perspective.</p>
            <p>Bogue's intriguing subtitle aptly encapsulates Turner's quest to understand the
                    unfolding of American history. He was fond of poetry, particularly that of Rudyard Kipling, who
                    ended one piece: "We yearned beyond the skyline, where strange roads go down" (p.
                    xvi).</p>

            <p>When most people think or read about West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, coal miners are the workers who probably first come to mind. But coal miners, however
                    important to West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s economic life, have never made up a majority of that state's
                    working people. To his credit, Jerry Bruce Thomas has produced a fine study of the Great Depression
                    in West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> that spreads the misery equally among miners, lumbermen, farmers, urban workers, and
                    their families. It is, in fact, one of this book's strengths that the author details the
                    many ways in which much of the New Deal legislation affected ordinary Americans on their farms, in
                    the mining and lumber camps, and in the towns and cities of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of New Deal policies on the state government and
                    people of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The author succeeds in this task and in the process fills gaps in our knowledge <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-096-1-102"/> of yet another state's history during this
                    nation's worst economic crisis. He more than adequately describes and analyzes the effect
                    of such federal programs as the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment
                    Act. He goes further than simple narration and provides the reader with a detailed analysis of how
                    groups in the state, from the Community Chest organizations to the United Mine Workers of America,
                    reacted to the economic crisis and federal intervention. While Thomas's efforts were not
                    specifically aimed at derailing any long-held notions about West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> during the depression, his work contrasts with another recent study of
                    Appalachia's economic development which cites the New Deal as partial cause of the mountain
                    states' long-term economic ills.</p>
            <p>Following the lead of many other historians who have studied the New Deal at the state and local
                    level, Thomas's conclusions about the impact of the New Deal on West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> are "charitable" (p. 2). While the national programs did not solve
                    the nation's economic crisis in the short-run, Roosevelt's policies "did
                    much to make the Depression more tolerable and to encourage in the American people a sense of
                    compassion" (p. 3). In other areas, too, Thomas's conclusions conform to those of
                    others. Examining the several governors of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> during the depression, Thomas confirms the "distracting influence of local
                    issues and economic interests and the difficulty of persuading state politicians to follow national
                    leadership" (p. 3). As in other parts of the country, West Virginians also experienced
                    long-term changes that derived from New Deal policies, but these programs did not provide enduring
                    solutions to West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s basic economic weaknesses. In an interesting epilogue Thomas concludes that
                    the New Deal did not provide an adequate economic stimulus to propel West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> into a period of post-World War II progress experienced by other southern states hit
                    equally hard by the depression. He lays a good deal of the blame for this on the state's
                    topography and history of economic exploitation by the coal industry. In the post-depression decades
                    "the prevailing concepts of progress and growth in the American economy offered no
                    sustainable alternatives suitable to West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s environment and unusual conditions" (p. 240).</p>
            <p>This work is based upon solid research in all relevant primary and secondary sources, and while the
                    author's writing style is neither imaginative nor engaging it is adequate to the task of
                    narrating the details of depression-era politics and economics at both the state and national level.
                    This work should take its rightful place in American historiography alongside other state studies of
                    the Great Depression in America.</p>

                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>'s independence was not unqualified. The <placeName>

                    Cubans were incapable of self-government were all central notions in the documents produced both by
                    government officials, including the presidents, and other writers of the time. Therefore, after the
                    explosion of the <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>

                    </hi> in February of 1898 and the Cubans' failure to acknowledge the cease-fire proposed by
                    the US. on March 27, 1898, it became clear that the Cubans were dictating the pace of
                    events—a fact that troubled the U.S., given its citizens' long-held interests on
                    the island. By then, support for the cause of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> Libre was widespread across the island and included Cubans of all classes, races, and
                    ages. President William McKinley faced the option of accepting Cuban independence or proposing an
                    invasion. In the end, a policy of "neutral intervention" was adopted, since it
                    would balance the competing claims of sovereignty by Cubans and Spaniards and guarantee U.S. control
                    of the island. However, since the cause of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> Libre had wide support in Congress, McKinley had to accept a joint resolution in which
                    article four, known as the Teller Amendment, disclaimed any exercise of U.S. sovereignty, except for
                    the pacification of the island. The resolution encouraged Cubans to cooperate with the U.S., since
                    the amendment's first article recognized <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>'s right to independence.</p>
            <p>The American intervention, as it was represented in the public debate of the time, became a
                    "war for humanity," a war of good intentions on behalf of the Cuban people. In
                    North America, songs, poems, and popular fiction created powerful images that reflected the general
                    mood and made the moral intentions of the U.S. seem unquestionable. After the war, the Teller
                    Amendment became ambiguous, and the word "pacification" came to imply a means of
                    protecting property and U.S. interests. In 1901 through the Platt Amendment the U.S. denied Cubans
                    full sovereignty over their nation by extending the work of pacification. Interestingly, students of
                    the war of 1898, as shown by Perez with an abundance of quotations from contemporary and recent
                    scholars, did not describe it as a war to defend American national interests. On the contrary, they
                    represented the <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-096-1-104"/> war as supporting Cuban independence and as the
                    achievement of noble intentions—even though these did not correspond to the central
                    convictions of a century of US. foreign policy.</p>
            <p>Because public opinion was vocal on the side of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> Libre, it seemed to validate the view that official policy was dictated democratically
                    by the people of the US. This invocation of idealism also seemed to support the U.S.'s
                    characterization of itself as a nation with high moral standards. Thus, for many historians, the
                    Teller Amendment became evidence of the Americans' true purpose. Furthermore, this
                    interpretation became so entrenched that it "assumed a logic of its own, self-evident and
                    self-validating" (p. 47). As a result, many scholars overlooked the long history of US.
                    strategic, commercial, and political interests in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>. New (and old) research paid little attention to Cuban archival sources or even to
                    published works. Such neglect has produced a self-contained US. historiography in which the
                    contributions of Cuban scholars—not to speak of those from the Caribbean and Latin
                    America—to our understanding of US. history have been sadly undervalued.</p>
            <p>Perez does not forget to "Remember the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>" and argues that the explosion of that battleship served to portray the war as
                    a matter of chance, not choice. Equally revealing are ways the US. denied the Cuban presence and
                    participation in the war, which explains why the events became known in the U.S. as the
                    Spanish-American War and not the Spanish-Cuban-American War. This is a critical point, since by
                    falsely claiming that Cubans did not contribute to their own liberation, the US. could justify
                    excluding them from participation in the peace agreements.</p>
            <p>Pérez concludes by demonstrating not only that many U.S. historians have shared the
                    conventional wisdom about the experience of 1898, but that they also have contributed to preserving
                    and maintaining these assumptions. Which is to say that many scholars have participated in
                    legitimizing imperialism from the academic balcony. Pérez also discusses the ways in
                    which, after 1959, Cuban intellectuals portrayed their Revolution as the culmination of the 1898
                    events that had been interrupted by US. control over the island. Therefore, the interpretation of
                    the past has served political agendas in both countries.</p>
            <p>This book is a valuable contribution to our understanding of 1898 and even more to analyzing what
                    lies beneath the construction of history: the garnering of power, cohesive identity, purpose,
                    memory, and the prolongation of silences.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Free Speech in Its Forgotten Years.</hi> By David M. Rabban. (<placeName>

            <p>Too often free speech is treated primarily as a twentieth-century constitutional problem. Most
                    textbooks, for instance, ignore the issue after the repeal of the Sedition Act of 1798 until the
                    Supreme Court decision in <hi rend="i">Schenck</hi> v. <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> (1919). This circumstance troubled David Rabban, who recognized in the nineteenth-century
                    landscape a host of controversial challenges to accepted notions of permissible speech.</p>
            <p>Free speech, Rabban discovered, had not entered a legal abyss during the nineteenth century. Rather,
                    there was substantial debate and scores of legal opinions on free-speech issues, especially
                    concerning the activities of labor organizers, socialists and anarchists, and sex radicals. No one
                    doubted the value of free speech to a democratic society, but the extent of this right and its
                    application in public life were matters of fierce dispute. Equally urgent—and equally
                    contentious—were claims that free speech was a fundamental right of personal autonomy and
                    individual liberty.</p>
            <p>What obscured this history was a shift in attitude, especially among Progressives, that resulted from
                    the experience with governmental repression of civil liberties during and after World War I. Early
                    Progressives frequently saw constitutional rights as barriers to social reform. They vilified the
                    late-nineteenth-century Supreme Court in particular for upholding the primacy of economic and
                    property rights over child labor and fair trade laws, among other reforms. Also, many Progressives
                    viewed rights as excessively individualistic and reacted against dissent that was not directed
                    toward positive social reconstruction.</p>
            <p>World War I forced a reconsideration of these views. The war's failure to make the world
                    "safe for democracy," combined with its widespread repression of speech,
                    undermined faith in a benevolent state. What happened in the postwar era—and this is the
                    force of Rabban's argument—was a major transformation of American liberalism, as
                    Progressives, who previously had viewed rights as barriers to reform, began to see them as the
                    stimulus and vehicle for change.</p>
            <p>Strongly influenced by the writings (for Rabban, the misconstructions) of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> law professor Zechariah Chafee, postwar civil libertarians (nee Progressives) based
                    their emerging interest in free speech on its contributions to democracy, rather than on its status
                    as a natural right. True to their prewar beliefs, they stressed the social benefits derived from
                    free expression and ignored the many other free-speech issues raised by libertarian radicals and
                    others during the nineteenth century. This stance allowed the Supreme Court, led by Justices Holmes
                    and Brandeis, to fashion "new" constitutional <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-096-1-106"/>
                    doctrine, rejecting the bad-tendency tests it had relied upon earlier in favor of the
                    clear-and-present-danger standard so familiar to modern jurists.</p>
            <p>This book marks a valuable contribution both to constitutional history and to the history of ideas.
                    Rabban helps us understand the transition from judicial hostility to free speech, a
                    late-nineteenth-century phenomenon, to the judicial activism of our time. He also helps us see how
                    social thought influenced positions on free speech. Our contemporary cultural commitment to personal
                    autonomy translates into a strong defense of free speech as an individual right beyond state
                    control. But earlier in this century the politics of reform required a different calculus, one that
                    linked speech and democracy. The story of how this transition occurred is a complex one, especially
                    for the uninitiated, but Rabban makes the effort worthwhile. For anyone interested in current
                    controversies over speech or in the meaning of rights talk in modern American society, this book is
                    essential.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Coolidge: An American Enigma.</hi> By Robert Sobel. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C.: Regnery Publishing, 1998. Pp. 462. Illustrations, notes, selected bibliography,
                    index. $34.95.)</head>
            <p>"The following pages," the historian Robert Sobel writes, "represent an
                    attempt to introduce or reintroduce Coolidge to those to whom he is a cartoon caricature and a
                    figure of derision" (p. 14). Sobel has written a modest study of a modest president. It is
                    "not based on original research" nor does it "present a complete picture
                    of the Coolidge presidency" (p. 15). The author promises "some fresh
                    interpretations" but "no major revelations" (p. 14). Nevertheless, as the
                    first scholarly biography of Calvin Coolidge in more than thirty years, <hi rend="i">Coolidge: An
                        American Enigma</hi> merits attention from students of the American presidency.</p>
            <p>Two themes, the president's simplicity and his complexity, run through <hi rend="i">Coolidge.</hi> These contradictions make Coolidge an enigma, something more than the silent,
                    do-nothing, tool-of-big business caricature of liberal historiography and something less than the
                    kind of jovial, backslapping, activist president those scholars usually label
                    "great" or "near great." Sobel's revisionism is not
                    fresh. Donald R. McCoy expressed similar ideas in greater detail and with more literary flair in <hi rend="i">Calvin Coolidge: The Quiet President</hi> (1967, reprinted 1988). But Sobel defends
                    Coolidge much more vigorously.</p>
            <p>Coolidge was a curious figure. The thirtieth president's youth was uncluttered by the
                    trappings of modern life. His <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Notch, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, home lacked indoor plumbing, electricity, and a telephone. Coolidge did not visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> until his college days. He was thirty <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-096-1-107"/> years old
                    when he rode in his first automobile and was the last president not to travel by airplane. Clinging
                    to traditional values of hard work, fiscal responsibility, and service to town and country, Coolidge
                    "remained a product of rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>" (p. 29).</p>
            <p>But there was another Coolidge, ambitious, cagey, practical, doctrinaire, and lucky. He became a
                    machine politician, reached out to Democrats, and climbed the ladder of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> politics. During the Progressive era, State Senator Coolidge backed women's
                    suffrage, workman's compensation, a minimum wage for women, legalized picketing, and direct
                    election of US. senators. During the more conservative 1920s, President Coolidge stressed lower
                    taxes, business prosperity, and diminished application of federal power. Taciturn, self-assured,
                    dignified, and principled, Coolidge the politician emerged as a workhorse, not a show horse. He had
                    a knack for being in the right place at the right time, and he projected stability, something the
                    electorate preferred during the "Aspirin Age." What Coolidge lacked in boldness,
                    Sobel asserts, he made up for in character.</p>
            <p>Sobel does well to puncture the myths surrounding "Silent Gal." Coolidge cultivated
                    his self-made, homespun, "wise-old-owl" persona (p. 235). He used radio to good
                    effect, and he mastered the press. Interestingly, his most famous axiom, "the chief
                    business of the American people is business," made no headlines and remained buried in a
                    speech extolling freedom of the press.</p>
            <p>Sobel's biography proves disappointing in several respects. The myths the author demolishes
                    may surprise the general reader: they will not surprise the specialist. Excessive block quotations
                    and tangential discussions slow down an otherwise brisk narrative. Although Sobel wants the reader
                    to reconsider the established formula, in which activism plus accomplishment equal presidential
                    greatness, he fails to frame his thesis clearly and address it fully. The author at times waxes
                    overly polemical, defending Coolidge's silence on the consequences of speculation in the
                    stock market. This reviewer was left to wonder how and under what circumstances Sobel believes
                    presidents should exercise leadership.</p>
            <p>Sobel provides an enigmatic study of an enigmatic president. Lay readers may want to know more about
                    Coolidge's personal life, religion, health, and place in history. Specialists will demand
                    greater analysis of the president's decision-making, administrative procedures, and actual
                    policies. But both camps will find this introduction or reintroduction provocative. It may even
                    reopen debate on a much-overlooked presidency.</p>

            <p>The Calvin Coolidge who emerges from these crisp, thoughtful pages is a man of parts, not all of them
                    flawless. Son of a farmer storekeeper in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Notch, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, he was shy, secretive, and terse to the point of rudeness. His mind was good, but his
                    reserves were so slight that concentration made him irritable and, at times, mean to his
                    exceptionally gracious wife, though he was not mean in spirit. At root, he was a modest, moral man,
                    of ambition and compassion. In college, his careful preparation and drollery earned him recognition
                    as a speaker, and H. L. Mencken came in time to perceive his "natural talent" for
                    writing. Meanwhile it was said in political circles that Coolidge could empty any hall. Following
                    graduation from Amherst in 1895, he read law in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Northampton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>,
                    then became city solicitor. Subsidized by his father for some years, he served as state
                    representative, mayor, president of the state senate, lieutenant governor, and governor. To all
                    these offices he brought a strong feeling for social progressivism, if not for the grand designs of
                    Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. "I have been in sympathy with virtually all
                    legislation to improve living conditions," he wrote in 1915, "[but] I do not make
                    so loud a noise as some others." In fact, writes Robert H. Ferrell, Coolidge made politics
                    his life work in considerable part because he believed it to be "subsumed in the word
                    'service'"</p>
            <p>Coolidge's conception of public service embodied more than humane social legislation. From
                    the beginning he had been committed to efficiency and the rule of law, and as he moved from
                    legislative to administrative office those commitments became preeminent. As mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Northampton</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1910, he reduced city taxes and debt while raising the salaries of teachers and
                    municipal workers. As governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> a decade later, he consolidated 118 separate departments into 18. He also vetoed a bill
                    for the sale of beer and wine in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment with a declaration that
                    "there can be no constitutional instruction of an unconstitutional act." Meanwhile
                    his reluctant intervention in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> police strike of 1919 became the scaffolding for his nomination for vice-president on
                    the Harding ticket in 1920.</p>
            <p>Ferrell's evaluation of Coolidge's presidency leans toward the underconsumption
                    theory of Keynesians and against the assumptions of the proponents of laissez-faire. He ascribes
                    Coolidge's failure to offer a comprehensive legislative program partly to the
                    president's belief that he should leave the apparently thriving economy alone. In
                    agriculture, where too many farmers were poorly farming too few productive acres, inaction may have
                    been wise economic policy. Other than in the South and Northeast, prices were down because
                    resumption <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-096-1-109"/> of production in Europe put American crops in
                    surplus. Correctly, Ferrell contends that Congress's solution, the McNary-Haugen export
                    debenture plan, would have stimulated further surpluses and that Coolidge acted sensibly in twice
                    vetoing the bill. As for the increasing disparity between the growth of profits and of wages, there
                    was not much that any administration could have done to close it. Mass unionism might have raised
                    purchasing power, but it took the Great Depression and the prospect of large defense profits to
                    raise wages. The notion that further reductions in income tax rates would have enabled middle-class
                    and blue-collar workers to buy more automobiles is similarly fanciful. As Ferrell's
                    statistics indicate, the disproportionate tax decreases of the era simply favored the super rich
                    over the very rich and the just plain rich; most middle-class workers paid nominal taxes, when they
                    paid any at all. By Coolidge's last full year in office, 98 percent of the American people
                    were exempt from income taxes.</p>
            <p>Coolidge might have tried to marshal the moral and political authority of his office behind
                    regulation of the stock market. His failure to do so, Ferrell suggests, may partly have reflected
                    his prolonged depression over the death of his son Calvin, Jr., in 1924; day-to-day routines, not
                    new challenges, became his refuge. Undoubtedly, too, the failure of economic analysts to accompany
                    their diagnoses with viable prescriptions reinforced Coolidge's predisposition to do
                    nothing. Most important of all, probably, was Coolidge's commitment to states'
                    rights and strict construction of the Constitution. He seemed not to see that the revolution in

                    inadequate. Yet even as Coolidge refused to face the new political-economic reality, he sought to
                    make existing federal agencies serve his own ideology. Thus, Ferrell concludes, he treated the ICC
                    with indifference, turned the FTC into a "shell of a regulatory body," and moved
                    "firmly to create a protectionist majority on the Tariff Commission."</p>
            <p>Calvin Coolidge, Elihu Root once remarked, "did not have an international hair on his
                    head." Neither did the American people: their main concerns, like those of their president,
                    were domestic. "That didn't mean they forgot about foreign policy,"
                    Ferrell adds with tongue in some part in cheek, "only that they did not think much about
                    it." Besides, they already knew what they wanted: no more immigrants (except of their own
                    kind); no cancellation of war debts regardless of the enormous disparity between Allied and American
                    contributions of blood and treasure in the war "to make the world safe for
                    democracy"; no membership in the World Court, let alone the League of Nations, without
                    ultra-nationalist reservations. Nevertheless, by giving reasonable rein to his abler foreign policy
                    officials and intervening more in decision-making than is commonly realized, Coolidge did grow a few
                    internationalist hairs.</p>

            <p>In the Caribbean, the long-established policy of protecting the Panama Canal area by supporting
                    seemingly stable governments won a messy, temporary success in Nicaragua. In Mexico, which was
                    threatening in 1927 to confiscate the $1.5 billion American investment in land, oil, and
                    mineral rights, Coolidge appointed Dwight Morrow ambassador with instructions to "keep us
                    out of war." Morrow won the affection of many Mexicans along with a nonconfiscatory
                    interpretation of the constitutional clause at issue. Toward <placeName>

                    balance of power and to help missionaries convert the Chinese people. One consequence, Ferrell
                    argues, was further strain in American relations with <placeName>

            <p>The final passage of this informed and informing work asks whether "failure to remedy
                    something that might have involved going beyond the possibilities of the times may not be a proper
                    measure for the presidency of Coolidge." Perhaps. Certainly it is doubtful that Coolidge or
                    "the best minds" could have averted the stock market crash with last minute
                    exhortations or regulations. Clearly, Coolidge's efficiency, good intentions, and modest
                    attainments were no substitute for national leadership. The self-contained New Englander so
                    convincingly portrayed herein was a well-meaning man of personal and public virtue whose temperament
                    and parochial vision prevented him from pushing himself and his administration to reasonable limits.</p>

            <p>Before the ink dried on the headlines announcing its outcome, the 1948 presidential election entered
                    folklore as an upset victory straight-shooting President Harry s. Truman, the "square root
                    of America," had defeated his formidable opponent, two party rivals, and every
                    gambler's odds. This book's title runs playfully across the dust jacket's
                    famous photo of a grinning Truman flaunting the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune's</hi> front page, which wrongly announced the contrary result.</p>
            <p>Gary A. Donaldson shows that the election had less to do with folklore than with conventional
                    political maneuvering, appeals to the normal components of the Democratic coalition assembled by
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt, bruising battles over the shape of the post-New Deal, postwar political
                    economy, and rising Cold War tensions. Many of these trends operated against Democratic prospects.
                    Inflation and consumer shortages aroused public rancor at the Truman administration's
                    reconversion policies, and massive strikes stirred antiunion sentiment. These events handed
                    Republicans a smashing <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-096-1-111"/> victory in the 1946 off-year elections,
                    giving them control of Congress for the first time since the Hoover era and an exaggerated sense of
                    their conservative mandate. This inspired them to pass the Taft-Hartley Act to rein in labor. Labor
                    turmoil had proven so vexing that in 1946 Truman had proposed a bill empowering him to <hi rend="i">draft</hi> strikers, but the GOP's overreaction rescued him from labor's hit
                    list.</p>
            <p>Donaldson's strength is his depiction of White House strategy after the 1946 election. He
                    tracks a small group of liberals, the "Ward-man Park group" (named for their
                    meeting place in the hotel suite of Oscar Ewing, a Democratic party and administration official).
                    They devised a scheme, generally adopted by the president's special counsel Clark Clifford,
                    to have Truman advocate a very liberal program. Republicans would never pass it, but so much the
                    better: Truman could then appeal to such key party constituencies as African Americans, labor, and
                    farmers and decry the "do-nothing" 80th Congress. Truman raised the civil rights
                    issue, but, pressed by the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, the Democratic convention went
                    well beyond what he sought. Ironically, the secession of the States Rights party (southern Democrats
                    peeved at this civil-rights plank) enhanced Truman's standing with black voters; and Henry
                    Wallace's Progressive party's defection to the left inured the president against
                    charges, in a season of heightening Cold War anxieties, of "softness on
                    communism." GOP nominee Thomas E. Dewey faced a dilemma: he must either disavow Congress or
                    defend it and thus back away from his liberal party platform.</p>
            <p>All this is sensibly argued. It does not deviate much from previous studies like Irwin
                    Ross's <hi rend="i">The Loneliest Campaign</hi> (1968), but it adds detail, reflecting
                    extensive archival research—in the collections at the Truman Library, the Dewey and
                    Wallace papers, and of such liberal mainstays as the Americans for Democratic Action, the National
                    Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and labor leaders and organizations.</p>
            <p>The main problem is the book's largely top-down approach. Donaldson concentrates most on the
                    Truman circle, somewhat less on Dewey and the other candidates, and least on the voters. Given
                    1948's low turnout, it is hard to gauge how well Democratic strategy worked. Donaldson
                    cites opinion polls, but contentions such as the claim that Truman's foreign policy
                    initiatives (their results not yet clear by fall 1948) profited him are speculative. The book might
                    usefully have drawn a clearer linkage between "inside" strategy and grassroots
                    voter behavior—a field in which political scientists were making pioneering advances in
                    that very era. It is plausible that what the Ward-man Park group proposed, the sovereign voter
                    disposed, but it is not self-evident.</p>

                                    Ellis and the Art of Jefferson Biography," <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of

                                    against Ellis's aspersions, among other things criticizing the
                                    latter's anti-Jefferson biases, tendency to project his own morose view of
                                    the American Revolution's "failure" onto Jefferson, and

                                    constitutional thought. However, after imputing illogical thinking to Ellis, in his

                                    </placeName>, Curtis goes bonkers, melodramatically stigmatizing
                                    Jefferson's desire for a secular institution as an authoritarian, fascistic
                                    "dark note" on his "commitment to liberty" and,
                                    ironically, the most unique part of his "legacy": "This
                                    denial [i.e., the absence of theology courses from the University curriculum],
                                    masked as a tribute to academic freedom and individual liberty of choice, failed to
                                    hide the assault upon inquiry into ideas and convictions central to the quest for
                                    liberty throughout much of the history of western civilizations" (201).
                                    Curtis's brief, unreasoning attack on Jefferson's attitudes to
                                    religious teaching has been implicitly refuted by numerous leading scholars on
                                    Jefferson's religious thought (Daniel Dreisbach, Edwin Scott Gaustad, Isaac
                                    Kramnick) in the October 1999 <hi rend="i">William and Mary Quarterly</hi>, which
                                    coincidentally contains six articles on this topic. Perhaps Jefferson himself
                                    provides his best defense, in a letter that he wrote precisely on the matter that so
                                    arouses Professor Curtis's ire. To Dr. Thomas Cooper, himself a fervid
                                    deist anticlerical, Jefferson wrote on November 2, 1822, when his university was in
                                    the planning stages: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>In our University you know there is no professorship of divinity. A handle
                                            has been made of this to disseminate an idea that this is an institution,
                                            not merely of no religion, but against all religion. Occasion was taken at
                                            the last meeting of the Visitors, to bring forward an idea which might
                                            silence this calumny, which weighed on the minds of some honest friends to
                                            the institution. In our annual report to the legislature, after stating the
                                            constitutional reasons against a public establishment of any religious
                                            instruction, we suggest the expedient of encouraging the different religious
                                            sects to establish each for itself a professorship of their own tenets, on
                                            the confines of the University, so near as that their students may attend
                                            the lectures there, and have the free use of our library, and every other
                                            accomodation [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] we can give them; preserving however
                                            their independence of us &amp; of each other. This fills the chasm
                                            objected to ours, as a defect in an institution professing to give
                                            instruction in <hi rend="i">all</hi> useful sciences [TJ's
                                            italics]. I think the invitation will be accepted by some sects from candid
                                            intentions, and by others from jealousy and rivalship. And by bringing the
                                            sects together, and mixing them with the mass of other students, we shall
                                            soften their asperities, liberalise and neutralise their prejudices, and
                                            make the general religion a religion of peace, reason and morality. [Thomas

                        <p>In any case, while Jefferson—fearless that orthodox minds might have an
                                    invidious impact on his students—was willing to permit divinity students
                                    to visit the secular realms of the University, where they might conceivably be
                                    tempted to abandon their religious studies for his college's worldly ones
                                    (as Robert M. Healey argues) [Robert M. Healey, <hi rend="i">Jefferson on Religion

                                    from the University might desert their secular studies after exposure to the august
                                    halls of the neighboring divinity schools in the course of their weekly (or oftener)
                                    worship. Indeed, before he died, Jefferson set aside a room in the University of <placeName>

                                    students initiated a movement, with the approval of the faculty and Visitors, to
                                    raise funds for the employment of a chaplain, preliminary to a great religious

                        <p>Despite Mr. Scherr's unfortunate proclivity for name-calling, he does raise
                                    an issue worth further eludication. A cursory survey of the Jefferson literature
                                    reveals several interesting points. Some biographers avoid any mention of the
                                    controversy over theological studies; others such as Ellis see the question from a
                                    twentieth-century reading of the "wall of separation" doctrine (an
                                    interpretation, incidentally, cast in substantial doubt in the
                                    "Forum" essays in the October 1999 issue of the <hi rend="i">William and Mary Quarterly</hi>), a doctrine that has assumed a position of
                                    civil religion in the minds of some; and a few, a very few, seek to understand both
                                    the context of the establishment of the institution and Jefferson's various
                                    and often conflicting personal, intellectual, and political interests. The
                                    historical context as well as the historiography is convoluted, to say the least.
                                    Jefferson's age, his gloomy sense of American decline, his mounting dislike
                                    for evangelical Presbyterians, his pride of ownership of the new university, and his
                                    long-standing ambition to create an educational institution in his image gave this
                                    final chapter a complex plot. Added to this were political considerations that
                                    surfaced in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

                                    </placeName> faced the formidable task of adding to its higher education investment,
                                    historically concentrated in William and Mary. The lightning rod of Thomas Cooper
                                    became the point where all the swirling and diverse interests seemed to converge.
                                    The result was a storm of controversy, one for which many biographers suggest that
                                    Jefferson was ill prepared.</p>
                        <p>On most of these matters, particularly the Cooper controversy that Scherr alludes to,
                                    Ellis remains silent. Instead, he elects to pair Jefferson's general
                                    interest in banning theological studies with carefully controlling the study of
                                    government so as to protect students from "the treasonable thoughts of
                                    'rank Federalists and consolidationists.'" Of course his
                                    objective in this was the creation of the carefully crafted citizen of a
                                    Jeffersonian republic, the ideal extension of the model Jefferson introduced in his
                                    first inaugural address. While he soon withdrew his prescriptions for political
                                    reading after <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> cautioned against politicizing the curriculum, Jefferson remained
                                    adamant on the question of excluding theology. Several biographers, particularly
                                    Merrill Peterson, craft a context wherein the reader is encouraged to see the
                                    long-term development of Jefferson's interest in education coupled with his
                                    growing concern for the quality of citizenship in the new nation. These strong
                                    convictions merged in Jefferson's investment in the University of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName>. Significantly, his concerns for the degradation of American politics,
                                    his displeasure with evangelicalism, and his dismissal of Presbyterian theology
                                    combined in distinct ways over the years, culminating in his angry November 1822
                                    outburst to Cooper.</p>
                        <p>For his part, Ellis, in concluding his discussion of the founding, celebrates
                                    Jefferson's innovative use of time and space. Ellis notes
                                    Jefferson's <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-096-1-115"/> elimination of traditional
                                    student grade classifications. Unfortunately he does not conflate this with a notice
                                    of Jefferson's advocacy of free election of academic courses. Finally,
                                    Ellis elaborates upon one of Jefferson's most important contributions to
                                    American education—the remarkable architecture that brought student and
                                    faculty together in an inward looking "academical village." At
                                    this point Ellis was in an enviable position to comment upon the implications of
                                    this geography for the Cooper letter that Scherr quoted, since space and time
                                    figured centrally in this exchange as well. Most of Jefferson's biographers
                                    agree that early in his thoughts about the university Jefferson conceived an
                                    architectural plan. It is important also to remember that Jefferson's
                                    antipathy for Presbyterian evangelicals was of long standing. The letter to Cooper,
                                    then, was frosting on an old cake. Unfortunately, Mr. Scherr chooses not to quote
                                    from the previous paragraphs of Jefferson's letter where he excoriated
                                    "the growth of Presbyterianism," but clearly, the paragraph that
                                    he does select deserves to be understood in the context of the paragraphs that
                                    precede it.</p>
                        <p>Contemporaries and historians alike have pondered Jefferson's recommended
                                    remedy for the Presbyterian updating in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName> of Benjamin Rush's call for the study of Christianity as a
                                    necessary adjunct of republican education. Mr. Scherr, like Leonard Levy before him,
                                    seeks to celebrate Jefferson as an unwavering champion of religious liberty, going
                                    to some lengths to argue that the Danbury letter controversy supports such a view.
                                    All of this is based in part upon Jefferson's politically astute proposal
                                    in 1822 to permit different religious sects to establish "a professorship
                                    of their own tenets, on the confines of the university." On the surface
                                    this has come to mean in the minds of some historians a nod by Jefferson to
                                    disinterested neutrality, a balanced approach to state-sponsored education in the
                                    early nineteenth century.</p>
                        <p>As charmingly sophistic as this appears, no one yet has plumbed the vagaries of
                                    "confines" with any real success. So there is a residue of the
                                    disingenuous about Jefferson's last ditch fix for a mounting political
                                    storm occasioned by suspicions born of his policy forbidding theological studies
                                    coupled with his advocacy for Cooper. Surely no one would mistake a principled stand
                                    on religious liberty with the notion Jefferson offered up here. Those with a special
                                    religious interest were promised a separate tent on the outside edge of the
                                    intentionally confined campfire that was the new "academical
                                    village." Situated on the periphery of this new state institution these
                                    outsiders, so conspicuous in their separateness, would become the special projects
                                    for professors at the university suddenly vested with the cause to "make
                                    the general religion a religion of peace, reason, and morality." The
                                    Jefferson conclusion revealed a clear state purpose, then, one that did not suggest
                                    neutrality so much as a desiccated rendering of free inquiry. At the new university
                                    content-based discrimination <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-096-1-116"/> was now given the
                                    muscle of the police power of the state. Mr. Scherr is correct in stating that this
                                    is a most important chapter in Jefferson's life. It is one that suggests
                                    the play of light and dark in ways that deserve the most careful attention, for the
                                    consequences of some of these decisions would resurface years later in far, far
                                    different guises in the world of burgeoning state universities. It may well turn out
                                    to be one of the sad ironies in the Jefferson legacy that in casting out centuries
                                    of inquiry all in the name of freedom from ecclesiastical monopoly, Jefferson opened
                                    the door for the exercise of discriminatory power on the part of the state that
                                    brought forth a very different monopoly indeed.</p>
