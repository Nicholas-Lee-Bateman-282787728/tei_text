            <p>On the eve of World War II, Indiana possessed almost no Japanese population and certainly nothing
                    that could be called a Japanese American community. The attack on Pearl Harbor brought this tiny and

                        submitted a letter of resignation to the dean of the College of Religion, who accepted the
                        letter, tore it into small pieces, and said no more about it. Nakarai continued on the faculty
                        at the college (later the Christian Theological Seminary) and became a prominent scholar of the
                        Dead Sea Scrolls after their discovery in 1947. <placeName>

            <p>That Nakarai and Sasaki were among a very small number of Japanese in Indiana in the early 1940s was
                    the end result of a historical pattern that dates back to the late nineteenth century. As the
                    American population diversified, Hoosiers held to an anti-immigrant position that was noticeably out
                    of step with the expanding and increasingly urban Midwest. Even as most Indiana residents looked
                    inward and tried to resist intrusive change from outside, however, a few had reason to take a much
                    more transnational view. Among them were religious denominations with ties to the international
                    scene through their missionary operations. I will show how a Protestant denomination with its
                    international headquarters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Disciples of Christ, took a leading role in a well-coordinated, national public
                    and private effort to move Japanese Americans out of internment camps and resettle them in towns and
                    cities across the nation's heartland. While the number of resettlers in Indiana would
                    remain small in relation to nearby states, the efforts of this dedicated group resulted in a tenfold
                    increase in the Hoosier state's Japanese American population by the end of World War II.</p>
            <p>The Asian presence in Indiana had never been very conspicuous. Twenty-nine persons of Chinese descent
                    resided in the state in 1880; a decade later their numbers were augmented by a handful of Japanese
                    (see Table 1). The increased presence of Japanese immigrants here and elsewhere coincided with the
                    beginning of the "new" or second wave of immigration that also brought growing
                    numbers of southern and eastern Europeans to America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                    centuries. Most of the Japanese settled on the West Coast; those who came to the Midwest followed
                    the pattern that James <placeName>

                    in much greater numbers than they did in Indiana. By 1920 Indiana had the largest proportion of
                    white, native-born citizens in the nation.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Economic factors account, in part, for Indiana's relatively low proportions of Japanese and
                    other new immigrants in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> lagged behind other large midwestern cities both in its total population and in the
                    total number of industrial jobs. Ball State professor of social sciences Robert L. LaFollette
                    rejoiced in the pages of this journal in 1929 that Indiana had all but missed "the
                    pollution of the stream of political and social intelligence" by the influx of Roman
                    Catholic southern and eastern Europeans into the region. He attributed this anomaly to
                    Indiana's comparative lack of economic opportunity and heavy industry, to its early land
                    settlement by old-stock Europeans, and to its lack of a hinterland that would feed a central
                        metropolis.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More recent historians have identified the anti-foreign attitude typified by LaFollette as a reason
                    in itself that immigrants tended to bypass Indiana-Hoosiers had a reputation as backward and

                    on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed
                    Executive Order 9066, authorizing the military to establish restricted zones and to exclude any and
                    all persons from these areas. By the end of the year the army would evacuate the entire population
                    of Japanese and Japanese Americans-approximately 120,000 people- from <placeName>

                    justified by military necessity but were prompted rather by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a
                    failure of political leadership.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    congregation established before the war. Holder spoke to the congregation on Sunday, March 8, and
                    met with the church board that afternoon. On March 9, he filed his report to the home office, which
                    published it in the April 1942 issue of <hi rend="i">World Call,</hi> the UCMS magazine. The report
                    gives an interesting snapshot of the church's desperate attempts to deal with the looming
                    Japanese American crisis. At the time of its writing, evacuation seemed certain but internment did
                    not. Rumors suggested that the people would be "assigned for resettlement in places as yet
                    undetermined." Holder wrote, "The picture of them wandering about, wanted nowhere
                    but forced to keep moving, haunted one's mind." Disciples of Christ members at

                    would later recall, "nearly forty years of concerted effort of Disciples of Christ abruptly

            </p>
            <p>Scholars and popular writers often use the term "relocation" to refer to the
                    removal of Japanese Americans from their homes in the West to the internment camps, but the WRA
                    quickly came to see its work in a different light-as literally the "relocation" of
                    people from one part of the country to other regions. Sensitive to the "hostility, doubts
                    and fears of the public at large," the agency tried to prepare host communities in advance
                    of the "controlled relocation" that it proposed for the west coast evacuees. The
                    WRA's official policy, which entailed not only relocation but also dispersal, rested on the
                    agency's belief that small numbers of <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The policy of dispersal was more than a wartime exigency. Government officials hoped that
                    assimilation would provide a permanent solution to the "Japanese problem" by
                    eliminating west coast Japanese enclaves altogether. Japanese Americans were therefore urged to take
                    advantage of relocation opportunities in many different parts of the country; once resettled, they
                    were asked not to associate with each other but rather to try to blend in with the local population.
                    This philosophy was shared at the highest levels. President Roosevelt, speaking in a November 1944
                    press conference, reported that "a good deal of progress has been made in scattering them
                    through the country, and that is going on every day … 75,000 families scattered around

                    Daniels writes in his standard history of the subject: "Both Franklin D. Roosevelt and his
                    War Relocation Authority had high hopes that, after the war, the new Japanese American communities
                    would contain the majority of the Japanese American population."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>In attempting to relocate thousands of people, the federal government looked first to the
                    Intermountain West. However, racial prejudice and hysteria there echoed the mood of the Pacific
                    Coast, and all of the region's governors (except Ralph Carr of <placeName>

                    7, 1942, the governors and their attorneys general raised every kind of protest from fear of mob
                    violence to economic and fiscal concerns. These bitter complaints were heard by Colonel Karl R.

            <p>In response to the challenge of building a more favorable attitude toward relocation and dispersal,
                    the WRA turned its efforts to developing public-private partnerships that would bring the
                    government's mission together with those of local church groups and citizen committees.
                    Among those groups, the WRA found willing partners among members of the national church missionary

            <p>The Church Federation had already formed an opinion regarding how it would respond to the Japanese
                    American crisis. At a March 11, 1943, meeting of the Federation's Inter-racial Committee-a
                    group of black and white clergy and laymen organized in 1926 to deal with matters concerning African
                    Americans and African American churches- Baumgartel brought up the plans to resettle Japanese
                    Americans in midwestern cities. Much discussion ensued, but because some members felt that <placeName>

                    </placeName> was not ready to accept the Japanese, the committee could not reach an agreement. In
                    fact, "the talk also pointed out that the members of this committee themselves were not in
                    accord about their attitudes toward the situation." The issue was therefore tabled, and
                    minutes of Church Federation records bear no evidence that the question was ever discussed again.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The Disciples of Christ, on the other hand, were fully committed and determined to conduct the work

                    practical problem of finding jobs and housing, she points to two public relations issues: reassuring
                    internees inside the camps about their prospects if they were to relocate and convincing those
                    outside the camps to support the effort. In the latter case, they were guided by a church coalition
                    "Plan for General Promotion" (a copy of which had been attached to the minutes of
                    the September 24, 1942, joint meeting), which called for "publicity in the public press
                    and, in particular, in the religious press toward this same end." On the copy of the report
                    now filed in the Disciples of Christ archive, the phrase "publicity in the public
                    press" has been crossed out-evidently on the advice of WRA representative Holland, who had
                    reasoned that "a wide publicity campaign would probably arouse the country unnecessarily.
                    It would get communities excited over a ‘Japanese invasion,’ for
                    example." To a follow-up question about publicity within the churches, however, Holland
                    responded, "You should make them fully aware of the mechanics of the project and of what is
                    involved. This is different from putting items into the local newspapers."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Protestant groups approached the public relations issue by publishing literature: bulletins
                    for the internees that reported conditions in specific eastern and midwestern cities, and pamphlets
                    for their congregations aimed at stirring up favorable sentiment toward the resettlers.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The WRA also fostered the "inside" public relations campaign. In August and
                    September 1943, the agency sent photographer Charles E. Mace to the Midwest. Beginning in <placeName>

                    were middle-class, English-speaking citizens who had grown up in American schools and neighborhoods.

                    were developing an orderly program of relocation in normal communities." Myer did not
                    neglect to point out the pragmatic arguments for resettlement: the expense of maintaining the camps,
                    their consumption of goods and materials needed elsewhere, and the nationwide manpower shortage. But
                    he also appealed to the Legion's desire to promote American ideals, something impossible to

            <p>The UCMS Committee on War Services stepped up its efforts to carry out its "inside"
                    communications task in January 1945, when it began publishing a newsletter for its scattered

                    the outside for internees who might be thinking of leaving the camps. "In this period of

                    the <hi rend="i">Disciple Herald,</hi> although it also warned against some states with
                    discriminatory laws. Admitting that housing was a major headache, the publication advised resettlers
                    to start with leads from friends, newspapers, or a committee. It also summarized the favorable
                    employment picture: domestic jobs ("usually a stepping stone to something better for those
                    with ability"), industrial jobs ("even for those with language

            <p>In Indiana, the Committee on War Services also worked to locate jobs in its role as liaison for the
                    state. In July 1943, Miss Jessie M. Trout, a Disciples missionary, along with Paul Sato and Mr. and
                    Mrs. Alfred Tsukamoto, toured rural Indiana communities under the sponsorship of the UCMS and WRA.
                    Seeking to survey the farm labor situation and gauge community sentiment toward Japanese Americans,
                    they met with more than 1,700 people, including farm groups, church groups, town officials, and
                    industrialists. The <hi rend="i">World Call</hi> reported: "Even when there was early
                    evidence of suspicion or apathy, the simple telling of the story almost invariably won
                        friends."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>One reason for Indiana's lack of attraction may have been lukewarm positive influences
                    rather than outright negative factors. As evidenced by the need for the inside publicity campaign,
                    people in the internment camps were generally reluctant to venture out into unfamiliar and
                    potentially hostile parts of the country. Even though the majority had been cleared to leave by July
                    1943, many hesitated because they feared public reaction and, having suffered economic losses, were
                    worried about jobs and housing. To counteract this uncertainty, employers from some cities, driven
                    by the shortage of home front manpower during the war, recruited workers aggressively. The Stevens
                    Hotel in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName> could also offer more jobs and a wider range of occupations. Finally, although housing

                    </placeName>, may be attributed in part to the city's well-developed network of charities

                    indicates the participation of several different Protestant denominations, as well as Jewish and

            <p>Two final reports submitted to the WRA also provide explanations for the state's lack of
                    success in placing resettlers. However, these documents offer two very different interpretations of
                    what happened in Indiana. The first theory is found in the "History of the North Central
                    Area," written from the viewpoint of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area office, which served as a headquarters for the region. This report noted the
                    Midwest's overall success in its resettlement campaign, compared with other regions of the
                    country. The writer argues that it could hardly have been the physical characteristics of the area,
                    still less the climate, that attracted Japanese Americans. Rather, it was the "excellent
                    reception given to resettlers by the people of the Middle West." Relocation officers had
                    anticipated great difficulty in convincing employers to hire the Japanese Americans. Instead, their
                    clients were eagerly sought after and easily placed, requiring minimal assistance.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a result, the North Central Area report praised the laissez-faire approach that developed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    wholesome, normal, and supportive of the resettlers' return to independence. In contrast,

                    </placeName>' acceptance of the Japanese Americans seemed highly improbable in the

                    statement that hints at endemic conservatism and caution: "Hoosiers have a very substantial
                    background. They do not make over strange faces." The first representative of the WRA to

                    supporter of resettlement. Waller recommended that the WRA's officers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> consult individuals in labor, the American Legion, government, and business before
                    "releasing Japanese Americans in Indiana." In addition, the report states that the
                    first major problem was the "anti-Japanese attitude of the Negro community towards the
                    arrival of a new minority." This prejudice apparently stemmed not from hatred of people of
                    Japanese ancestry, but rather from fear on the part of African Americans that the newcomers would
                    threaten the recent gains in employment which they had enjoyed as a result of the wartime shortage
                    of manpower. The report explains the housing difficulty as resulting from the influx of defense
                    workers and the boom town conditions that had already hit <placeName>

                    seeking to bring Japanese Americans from internment to Indiana worked against prevailing prejudices
                    in the community, in competition with contemporary job seekers, and in spite of limited recruiting
                    efforts on the part of the state's employers and universities. They combined careful
                    scrutiny and close supervision of resettlers with the willingness to counteract local attitudes and
                    to promote the cause of justice.</p>

                    turn enabled churches and committees to take action. It was a truly cooperative interdenominational
                    and interagency effort. For example, the hostels for new resettlers were sponsored in the midwestern
                    states by the American Friends Service Committee (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    churches. Membership in this network, and dedication to its ideals, may have prompted the Indiana
                    groups that assisted with the relocation program to go against the prevailing local attitude of
                    suspicion regarding outsiders and Japanese Americans in particular.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>As the relocation program came to an end, Japanese Americans living in the Midwest could either
                    return to the West Coast or stay in their new homes. A December 1945 letter from relocation officer
                    Marie Kitazumi advised resettlers who wanted to return to their former homes on the West Coast to
                    hasten their applications for financial assistance for travel or shipping of property held in WRA
                    warehouses. For those who decided to stay, however, she promised that other agencies in the area
                    would continue to provide services to resettlers. A directory later published by the WRA listed the
                    following <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> Employment Service. Kitazumi concluded her letter by writing, "I hope that
                    you, like most people who have come in this district during the past several years, are planning to
                    make your new home a permanent one. I know that you will continue to find opportunity and security

            <p>Historians and investigating commissions have chronicled the dire effects of the <hi rend="i">removal</hi> on Japanese Americans-in terms of lost homes, possessions, and livelihoods-but they
                    have only recently begun to examine the significant effects of the dispersal on both the Japanese
                    population and the nation as a whole. An emerging consensus suggests that, because of wartime
                    conditions, Japanese Americans who went east benefited from unprecedented employment opportunities
                    outside the ethnic enclave, in industrial work, white-collar work, and other professions. The
                    Midwest is clearly a key part of this emerging story, illustrated in the following passage from a

                    experiences.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, scholars studied immigration history through the use of ships' passenger
                    lists, federal statistics and, where available, documents, diaries, letters, and other memoirs.
                    During the lifetimes of contemporary immigrants, however, the ready availability of telephones, fax
                    machines, and e-mail has made letter writing and the keeping of diaries almost a lost art.
                    Fortunately, oral history provides a way to access contemporary immigrants' narratives
                    about their experience. Such primary sources represent nothing less than history in the
                    making-firsthand accounts captured at a distinct moment in the acculturation process- that may prove
                    vital to historians and other researchers later attempting to understand the larger picture of
                    American immigration and assimilation. Allesandro Portelli commends oral-history research for its
                    firsthand insights into people's interpretations of their personal and historical
                    experiences. Donald Ritchie says oral history may well be the modern substitute for the written
                    memoir. Numerous scholars address oral history's capacity to document vital information
                    about memory, culture, class, race, ethnicity, gender, and power. In brief, today's social
                    research is tomorrow's historical documentation.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>This article presents and analyzes a summary of oral-history interviews with ninety Asian Indian
                    immigrants who reside in Indiana. Conducted between 1994 and 2002 among Asian Indians from northern,
                    central, and southern Indiana, the interviews in this project provide information about
                    immigrants' daily life in the U.S., marriage customs, family life, religious traditions,
                    and methods for defining ethnic identity<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Participants present some views
                    clearly attributable to generational difference-first-generation adult immigrants shared certain
                    obvious traits when compared to second-generation individuals who were born and/or raised in
                    Indiana-but as a rule, their views of Indian and American cultural practices vary greatly from each
                    other. Taken as a whole, the interviews demonstrate significant intergroup diversity among Asian
                    Indians in Indiana. This article explores their accounts of cultural encounter, their conceptions of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>

            <p>Not only do the data presented here challenge media stereotypes, they also demonstrate the inadequacy

                    those put forth by historian Oscar Handlin or sociologist Milton M. Gordon, viewed acculturation as
                    a sequential and unidirectional process that could not be resisted or changed.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                            participants resided in a midwestern state. Ages of interviewees varied from 18 to 64 years;
                            just over 60 percent were male. Participants in this project reflect the diverse regional,
                            religious, and language makeup of the Indian subcontinent (more so than the general U.S.

                            simultaneously by a male/female research team. An open-ended questionnaire combined with a
                            semi-structured interview design facilitated the collection of richly textured narratives.
                            All interviews (from two to four hours in length) were tape recorded, transcribed, and

            <p>This study is significant for what it can tell us about Indiana, a state not normally known for its

                    linked to peoples of diverse origin.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Since the 1965 Immigration and
                    Naturalization Act, the population of Indiana, like other states, has quietly changed to reflect
                    once again the dynamism of global population movements. The oral history project summarized here
                    documents a specific, understudied, contemporary immigrant group in Indiana as an initial step
                    toward recasting Indiana history to better reflect the state's growing diversity. By 2000,
                    the children of many first-generation Asian Indians were reaching young adulthood and beginning to
                    raise families of their own. Capturing the experiences and perceptions of Indiana's Asian
                    Indian population at this new and fast-changing stage can help future historians document the
                    immigrants' arrival, their acculturation to American society, and their impact upon the
                    culture of Indiana.</p>

            <p>ASIAN INDIAN IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES</p>
            <p>The experiences of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century Asian Indians in Indiana contrast
                    starkly with those of Asian Indian "pioneer" immigrants in early twentieth-century
                    America. Sikh males from the western Indian state of Punjab, one of the earliest documented groups
                    of Asian Indian immigrants, arrived in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> between 1907 and 1914. Bringing considerable farming skills and patience for working
                    long hours under a hot sun, they found employment as laborers and foremen on the West Coast.
                    Eventually they married Mexican women-many of whom were themselves recent immigrants to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>'s independence. The students hoped to be able to vent their pro-independence
                    (and often anti-British) sentiments in the U.S. without fear of repercussion. Unfortunately, the
                    federal government proved unsympathetic to their political leanings and placed harsh restrictions
                    upon Indian Asian immigrant communities.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Immigration Act of 1917 had barred all Asian immigrants from gaining citizenship. The U.S.
                    Supreme Court's 1923 ruling that Asian Indians were Asians forced many previously
                    naturalized Asian Indian citizens to give up their citizenship. With this ruling, legal immigration

            <p>The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act raised the restrictive immigration quotas for
                    non-European nations and initiated a "third wave" of immigration composed largely
                    of Asians and Latin Americans. The act allowed legal entry for 170,000 immigrants per year from the
                    eastern hemisphere, with a limit of 20,000 from any one country, and gave preference to those with
                    needed occupational skills and to family members of permanent residents. On one hand, this change in
                    immigration policy represents an American sense of cultural pluralism emerging out of the civil
                    rights movement's challenge to racist legal codes and institutions. On the other hand,
                    lawmakers also recognized that welleducated and skilled immigrants from the developing world could
                    meet growing labor shortfalls in medicine, engineering, research science, and higher education.
                    Thus, the 1965 immigration law opened the door to a select, but significant, number of Asian Indian
                    immigrants.</p>
            <p>Modern immigrants originate from across the Indian nation rather than from a single region. Although
                    the largest numbers of immigrants come from the western state of Gujarat, significant numbers
                    continue to come from more northerly Punjab, from the eastern state of West Bengal, and from
                    southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu. They are less likely than their predecessors to
                    settle in ethnic enclaves, choosing instead to take up residence throughout urban and suburban
                    areas. Geographic dispersion stems largely from the generally high socioeconomic status of
                    immigrants arriving in the 1960s and 1970s, many of whom came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to pursue post-graduate education and/or professional opportunities in the fields of
                    medicine, engineering, and science. Most of these immigrants chose to live alongside upwardly mobile
                    colleagues in suburban areas rather than in ethnic neighborhoods.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> There are,

                    </placeName> lacked any "official" unique racial identity as they were stuck
                    somewhere between black and white. In 1975, the Association of Indians in America submitted that
                    "Indians are different in appearance; they are equally darkskinned as other non-white
                    individuals and are, therefore, subject to the same prejudices."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In
                    response to such calls for recognition, the U.S. Census Bureau began differentiating Asian subgroups
                    in 1980. The newfound distinctions created both frustration and esteem throughout the Asian Indian
                    American population.</p>
            <p>Between 1980 and 1990, the Asian Indian population in the U.S. increased 125.6 percent, totaling

            <p>ASIAN INDIANS IN INDIANA</p>
            <p>Indiana's Asian Indian population has mirrored the nation's in its rapid growth,
                    increasing from 361 persons in 1960 to nearly 17,000 in 2004. As holds true nationally, the
                    state's Asian Indian population tends to reside in or near major metropolitan areas.
                    However, Asian Indian immigrants in the Hoosier state bear two significant distinctions. Unlike

            <p>In terms of income and educational attainment, Indiana's Asian Indians resemble their
                    counterparts in other states. The median family income of Asian Indians residing in Indiana was
                    $56,630 in 1999, in a state where the $41,567 overall median income fell short
                    of the $42,100 national average. This trend holds true in states with large Asian Indian
                    populations, such as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> (the nationwide median Asian Indian income was $69,470). One explanation for
                    these higher-than-average income figures may be found in the data on immigrants'
                    educational attainment. Researchers have noted that Asian Indian immigrants as a group tend to have
                    more years of education than the U.S. population as a whole.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> This trend holds
                    true in Indiana: according to the 2000 census, 71 percent of the state's adult Asian Indian
                    residents possessed at least the equivalent of a bachelor's degree, compared to 19.4
                    percent of the general adult population.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana's Asian Indians differ from their counterparts nationwide in other ways. An
                    overwhelming majority of U.S. Asian Indian immigrants are Hindu, with only minor representation from
                    the Islamic, Sikh, and Christian faiths. Nationally, there are high concentrations of Asian Indian
                    immigrants from Gujurat and Punjab. Indiana's Asian Indian community represents all of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>'s major geographic regions, languages, and cultures. Furthermore, Hindu, Sikh,
                    Christian, and Muslim immigrants are scattered throughout Indiana's various metropolitan
                    and suburban areas. Thus, the Asian Indians who participated in this project reflect-more so than
                    the general U.S. Indian population-the diverse regional, religious, and language makeup of the
                    Indian subcontinent.</p>
            <p>THE EXPERIENCE OF CULTURAL ENCOUNTER</p>
            <p>Asian Indian immigrants' sense of self, as well as their sense of their place in the U.S.
                    and in Indiana, appears to be characterized by an overarching sense of personal and social

            <p>Whereas most Jain and many Hindu communities follow vegetarian diets, some Hindus from coastal
                    regions-such as West Bengal or Kerala-are more likely to eat chicken and fish. Followers of the Sikh
                    tradition are typically meat eaters and do not follow the same restrictions as the Hindus. Today,
                    one is likely to find vegetarian foods and Indian spices in most large American grocery stores,

                    1980s obtained nourishing vegetarian food or spices only with great difficulty. One interviewee who
                    arrived in Indiana in the late 1960s comments: "When I came to Purdue, I mean, it was very
                    difficult to cook and, because I was not a good cook. We didn't get any of the spices and
                    things of that type to make the food good. We had no cars, you know, so it used to be a friend would
                    take us to the grocery store. So it was a little bit difficult because of the food problem, you
                    know?" Other interviewees recall getting together with fellow Asian Indians to make monthly
                    trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Devon Street for food and spices. Several remember their first few months as
                    vegetarian Hindus in the U.S. for the endless amounts of salad and cheese sandwiches on white bread.</p>
            <p>As an alternative, many Asian Indian immigrants felt obligated to give up certain dietary habits that
                    they had maintained strictly while in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> out of religious or moral obligations. Says Meera: "By religion, [in my
                    family] we are Hindus. We don't eat beef so that's one thing. But we have adapted
                    to that also, so [eating beef is] fine, but not on a regular basis. If it's served once in
                    a while, I might eat it. But I am not too strict, and that's why I do that."

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> is typical of most interviewees in that they tend to eat traditional Indian food at
                    home and American food outside the home. "I make Indian food every day. We eat out
                    ‘American food,’" she says. Mehjabeen, a graduate student in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, appreciates having Indian food with her family on a regular basis while also
                    understanding that traditional Indian cooking is very time- and work-intensive. Her mother,
                    Mehjabeen reports, "always cooks Indian food, and meals take a while to make. By the time I
                    get home, she's exhausted."</p>
            <p>Vellore discusses his family's attempts to retain Asian Indian dietary traditions at home:
                    "We still, for the most part, cook Indian food. That's what we eat. We of course
                    enjoy ‘American food,’ too! But as you probably know, if you don't
                    watch out ‘American food’ tends to be more fat laden, so we try to avoid that.
                    So we still stick to the Indian cuisine as much as possible-vegetarian. When we do eat
                    non-vegetarian, we generally don't eat beef. We eat chicken and fish, but predominantly our
                    food consists of vegetables and fruit, and the Indian ingredients. It's generally low in
                    fat and well balanced." Rajesh and his family also try to adhere to a vegetarian diet.
                    Rajesh's family, however, is motivated by religious principles: "We eat rice,
                    curries, bread, and vegetables. I'm a vegetarian. Like around, I'd say, 30 to 40
                    percent of Indian population are <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-102-2-047"/> vegetarian. It's part
                    of true religion. It's kind of religious that you don't eat meat, and most of the
                    population is not supposed to eat beef."</p>
            <p>As with dietary practice, the Asian Indian religious experience in Indiana manifests great diversity.
                    The majority of interviewees were Hindu, although Jains, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Sikhs also
                    participated in the project. With a few exceptions, most interviewees identified themselves as
                    religious or spiritual persons. The ways in which they practice their religions and communicate
                    their devotion, however, are quite different.</p>
            <p>Meera suggests that there are various levels of religiosity in the Asian Indian community:
                    "There are some who are practicing every week. They get together every week. There are
                    groups of Indians who are very religious. There are groups who are kind of medium and some of whom
                    don't do anything. Probably, I would come in the medium. I go to the main festival groups,
                    some religious functions or celebrations, but not on a regular basis."</p>
            <p>Several interviewees describe religion as more of an abstract experience, and indicate that they do
                    not practice their religion with any sort of regularity or custom. Referring to themselves as
                    "cultural Hindus," they often consider the culture of the religion-as well as the
                    native geography and language-to be of greater value than the actual theistic qualities or rituals.
                    Anthropologists Helweg and Helweg note that for these immigrants Hindu values and belief systems
                    provide "an overriding unity [of] ideological principles."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                    When asked about his religious affinity, Amitava responds that he is a Hindu but does not engage in
                    daily ritual or practice. For such persons, the appeal of Hinduism is often located in its secular
                    quality, and not in a doctrinaire quality that begs for regular or frequent adherence.</p>
            <p>Interviewees are more likely to speak of their religion as a pervasive influence on their culture and
                    belief systems than to speak of specific theological beliefs. The scarcity of Hindu temples in the
                    U.S. provides one-but by no means the only-explanation of the fact that Asian Indian Hindus worship
                    in their homes.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Kavitha talks about the Hindu practice of puja, or worship.
                    "If you go to our houses, we have a little room or a little corner where there is a little
                    [religious symbol], and they have candles around, and little statues." Meera believes that

                    you have to attend [regularly]. You can pray at home."</p>
            <p>Religion can play a central role in identity development as immigrants deal with elements of cultural
                    change, and may serve as a vehicle for cultural transmission. Some scholars suggest that Asian
                    Indian immigrants with children frequently renew their religious affiliations after arriving in the
                    U.S., viewing participation in religious celebrations and traditions as a method of
                    "raising Indian consciousness among their children."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Closely linked to religion, family issues-such as socializing with the opposite sex and arranged
                    marriages-are also part of the experience of cultural encounter. Many immigrants are hopeful that
                    their sons and daughters will choose partners from within the Asian Indian community. According to
                    several interviewees, Asian Indians consider religious affiliation a serious criterion for selecting
                    a child's marriage partner. Shahnaz, a Muslim in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, expects her daughter to marry a Muslim. "It doesn't matter from
                    where, as long as he is Muslim and he can pray and follow their religion together," she
                    says. "[If not], what will they teach their children?"</p>
            <p>They also expect their children to trust their elders' advice concerning potential mate
                    selection. Mitoholi, a female student born and raised in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, spoke favorably of arranged marriage: "The way we view family in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> and here, the way American students do, it's very different. Indians, we just
                    give a lot of respect [to our parents]. That's just another reason why arranged marriages
                    happen. Daughters respect their parents; they respect their choice. They are willing to do anything
                    for their parents. If their parents want them to get married to this particular person, then they
                    will get married."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Puja, a student raised in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, says of the possibility of her parents arranging her marriage: "They know I

                    me],’ they would be more than happy to look. My mom likes fixing people up. She knows not

            <p>Even though Puja rejects the idea of an arranged marriage for herself, she respects her

                    harder for me to follow along the traditional paths because of what my friends were doing.
                    That's what it seemed like everyone was doing, you know, and I didn't want to be
                    different than anyone else."</p>

            <p>CONCEPTIONS OF INDIA</p>

                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> itself in many different ways. Each interviewee remembers and defines <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> according to personal experience. First-generation immigrants share some similar
                    experiences in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> and in the U.S. and, as a result, tend to remember <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> in similar ways. For example, they grew up in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, and many experienced firsthand what it was like to speak native languages, formally
                    practice their religion, attend Indian schools, and follow local social and dietary customs. Unable
                    to share such experiences, second-generation interviewees instead define and imagine <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> according to family traditions, religious events, and family trips to <placeName>

            <p>Despite these changes and, even after recent trips to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, most first-generation interviewees describe an <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> similar to the society of their own parents' generation. They remember, for
                    example, an <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> in which the educational system was extremely rigid and the student/teacher and
                    child/parent relationships were based on utmost respect. Often, these same persons indicated their
                    belief that the second generation has not maintained this same level of respect for authority. One
                    interviewee recalls his school days in Calcutta: "I had a very good time in school. I think
                    that the school system was rigid, with respect to the American secondary education but also more
                    pressure was placed on the students, for mathematics in general and other areas. I thought looking
                    back, knowing the basic ‘R's,’ reading, writing, and arithmetic, I
                    was better prepared there in Calcutta than my sons who get their educations here. The competition
                    was more strenuous. The schools there maintained a much higher standard."</p>
            <p>Jay, a second-generation interviewee, finds his first-generation "traditional
                    Indian" parents stricter than those of his American classmates. He attributes this
                    strictness to their imagined <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>: a place which has escaped Western influence, a society where one's family
                    always comes first, a setting in which one always defers to one's elders. Jay reports that
                    in comparing their imagined <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> to the U.S.-with its high divorce rate, gangs, alcohol and drug abuse-his parents find
                    the latter to be less than a model society. His parents, he says, often advise him,
                    "‘Oh, you know, it's not so great here. And the traditional Indian way
                    is so, so much better than the American [way].’" At times, Jay feels this

            <p>LIVING IN INDIANA</p>
            <p>Most interviewees conceptualize American society broadly in their narratives, rather than discussing
                    Indiana or the Midwest specifically. Some exceptions occur, however. Nalin, an anesthesiologist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, recalls some negative first impressions of his new home: "Some of the
                    shocking things coming to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> for the first time, coming from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> [in the 1970s], the women don't smoke in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>. They still don't-probably 99 percent don't smoke. The guys do, but
                    the women don't. It was almost like, if a woman has a cigarette in her hand, it's
                    almost like exposing herself in public, you know, more or less, that sort of strong no-no for a
                    woman to do that." Nalin liked the area he lived in and loved his work, but felt torn about
                    raising his family so far away from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>. Later these impressions were outweighed by shared family experiences. "I knew
                    that if I live here and my brother lives in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, we won't see each other as often as we see each other now. So, I asked my
                    brother if he would move to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." When Nalin's brother began a medical practice in

               </placeName>, "the best thing happened," Nalin says,
                    "because while our kids were growing up and his kids were growing up, they saw each other
                    so much, to the point that they don't even call each other cousins, you know, they were
                    like brothers and sisters to each other. You know, they are very close to each other. And
                    that's something that we feel that, like, eventually when we'll be gone, they will
                    have kind of strong family ties with each other and, you know, that that will help them a

                    Indiana, Raja says, "I liked the practice, I liked the town, especially the university

                    presented two sides to him: "The good things are the fact that I am my own boss.

                    standard of living since moving to Indiana, and acknowledges finding greater professional
                    opportunities, not everything in his career experience has been positive. "I guess the
                    discrimination would be that, if you're qualified for a certain opportunity and perhaps
                    better than [the] rest of the crowd around you, and you're still not able to receive that
                    [opportunity] …. If that is because of race, or something else, I don't
                    know," Jai mused. "Lot of time, [the discrimination is] subtle. I have run into

            <p>Kanwal, an architect in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, reports that "things have shifted and changed for the better, and so [Asian
                    Indian immigrants] can breathe a little bit easier. When I came to the city in '67, there
                    were many incidents that would be uncomfortable." Kanwal notes how, as an orthodox Sikh who
                    wore a turban, he was asked to leave a public place, which banned hats. He responded to an
                    "Apartment for Rent" advertisement, only to be told the apartment was not
                    available. "This was something that I had already witnessed to some degree in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>," Kanwal recalls, "so I wasn't quite totally unfamiliar with
                    this-that this had nothing to do with the apartment being already rented out. They were
                    uncomfortable with my ethnic background and with my headdress, and with my accent. Things are
                    improving every single day in terms of people's acceptance of other people."
                    Kanwal adds that this subtle shift in tolerance of others is responsible for his active involvement
                    in the International Center at Indiana University. "Under one roof," Kanwal says
                    of the Center, "[in] one place, [people can] share their culture with one another. And not
                    only with one another, but with the community at large-show their food habits, their dances, their

            <p>Prema, formerly a teacher in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, worked with children to counteract prejudice toward Asian Indians after she and her

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                    </placeName>," she says. Teachers in a nearby community invited Prema to visit their
                    classes where, she reports, "I gave talks on Indian issues …. I think I
                    broadened their understanding of the world and the different cultures in many ways by being there,
                    and showing and sharing with them." Prema explains how important it is for young children
                    to be exposed to cultures and ethnicities other than their own, saying: "There were
                    children who wrote me and said, I feel like visiting <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and life in Indiana all influence the interviewees' definition of identity.
                    When asked if they identified themselves as Indian, Indian American, or simply American, several
                    first-generation interviewees discuss their Indian and American identity traits. Vimal says:
                    "I am an Indian American. I have more Indian character, and I still hang on to those
                    things. Whereas [our second-generation children] are logical. They don't hang onto it. They
                    are Americans so they don't have that distinction, or prejudice if you want to call it.
                    They consider themselves American first, but you know, of Indian parents. We [of the first
                    generation] are Indian first and Americans second." Vimal's words demonstrate
                    first-generation Asian Indian immigrants' tendency to become U.S. citizens and adopt many
                    American customs, while simultaneously identifying themselves as "more Indian"
                    than their second-generation children and younger Indian acquaintances.</p>
            <p>Interviewee responses suggest that, just as earlier Irish or Italian immigrants embraced American
                    characteristics and integrated them into their lives, so too do members of Asian Indian communities
                    combine Indian and American traits in order better to assimilate into the American tapestry. Harbans
                    tells his son, who was born in the U.S.: "[L]ook, culture is like air. Once you are in
                    America, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-102-2-054"/> you are going breathe the air from, of this
                    place, you can't bring air from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> and so you are going to breathe the culture. But don't be in a hurry to
                    belong. And don't discard things Indian just because you feel inferior. Feel good about
                    yourself. Be proud of what you are, of your being, but then don't try to, necessarily, stop
                    the process of becoming, but don't be in a hurry and don't feel inferior in any
                    way. You're not."</p>
            <p>Second-generation Asian Indians inhabit a world composed of two distinct cultures: American and Asian
                    Indian. English is, for the most part, their first tongue, but they are likely to speak an Indian
                    language at the dinner table, or while visiting family at home or abroad in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>. Likewise, second-generation interviewees interact and socialize with fellow students
                    in a typically American manner, but are likely also to maintain some sort of social connection with
                    the local Indian community and participate in cultural events, religious programs, or
                    extracurricular activities.</p>
            <p>Some second-generation interviewees felt obliged to partake of religious and cultural programs and
                    events within the Asian Indian community. In reference to her father's request that she and
                    her siblings attend events sponsored by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> Association (a pan-Indian social and cultural organization) events, Thara says,
                    "I don't think we ever took any ownership for it. It was my dad's thing.
                    We went because, you know, he wanted us to go. When we were little, it was just a party, there was
                    food and all that."</p>
            <p>Young second-generation Asian Indians, particularly those with one Asian Indian and one non-Asian
                    Indian parent, recall feeling unable to appreciate many of their parents' cultural and
                    religious traditions, especially during their adolescent years. While most second-generation
                    interviewees participated only reluctantly in community events during their formative years, these
                    persons developed a closer appreciation for Asian Indian ethnic traditions as adults. Many
                    second-generation interviewees indicated a connection between a growing appreciation for their Asian
                    Indian heritage and the desire to promote such appreciation in their own young children.

                    part of them, that there are things about <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> that are familiar and comfortable for them." Thara and other second-generation
                    Asian Indians often found elements of Asian Indian heritage comforting as they established their own
                    homes and began their families.</p>

            <p>The extent to which second-generation Asian Indians weave together Asian Indian and American cultural
                    fibers varies from one person to another. A few second-generation interviewees had traveled to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> to gain a better understanding of the country, whereas others sought knowledge from the
                    classroom, the kitchen, the local <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> Association, or temple. Regardless of the source, second-generation Asian Indians are
                    choosing to learn more about their backgrounds, and making vital attempts to integrate them into
                    their American lifestyles. Further, many second-generation interviewees suggest that they hope to
                    pass down Indian values and traditions to their own children.</p>
            <p>The transmission of traditions and values resonates strongly for many Americans whose families
                    emigrated from countries such as <placeName>
                  <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>, <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
               </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName>. The transmission of traditions and values within Asian Indian families in Indiana
                    creates a equally strong bond between generations, and allows these relatively recent immigrants to
                    maintain similar ties with the language, food, religion, and traditions of their birth culture.
                    While some studies conducted with Asian Indians in large metropolitan areas have demonstrated that
                    the behaviors of second-generation youth are strongly influenced by non-Indian peers, analysis of
                    Indiana's Asian Indian narratives does not support this <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-102-2-056"/> finding.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> For example, most second-generation interviewees do not date.
                    Those who are married affirmed that they refrained from dating behaviors and co-educational
                    socializing prior to marriage. Parents tended to prefer some form of arranged marriage for their
                    children; young adults anticipated that they would, at the least, respect parental preferences
                    regarding future mate selection. First-generation interviewees restricted their children's
                    social activities to family outings or chaperoned visits with Asian Indian friends;
                    second-generation interviewees involved their children or expect to involve them in Asian Indian
                    cultural organizations and travel with their children to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> as ways of encouraging ethnic identity maintenance.</p>
            <p>CONCLUSION</p>
            <p>The story of Indiana's Asian Indian population has been one of an attempt to forge an Indian
                    ethnic identity that transcends the group's residential dispersion and embraces its
                    religious and cultural diversity. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act provided opportunities
                    for skilled Asian Indians to settle in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and, over the next forty years, they did so in record numbers, expanding
                    Indiana's Asian Indian population and adding to the state's ethnic diversity. The
                    oral history project reported here contributes to a sparse but growing literature on the family
                    lives and everyday events of Asian Indian immigrants in the U.S. It also serves to provide
                    historians with firsthand accounts of the acculturative experiences of a specific immigrant group at
                    a crucial point in the group's history in the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Asian Indians living in Indiana tend to be well-educated professionals with above-average incomes who
                    reside in suburban areas near large cities and speak English fluently. Within the home, family and
                    education are valued highly, as are traditions and beliefs related to one's religion. The
                    community defines itself more by membership and/or participation in Asian Indian cultural events
                    than by residence in any type of ethnic enclave.</p>
            <p>Indiana's diverse Asian Indian communities effectively weave their Indian traditions and
                    values into the American tapestry. Like earlier immigrants to the <placeName>

                    in the broader American experience. Most are American citizens, actively participate in local or
                    statewide activities, and send their children to public schools. At the same time, most interviewees
                    continue to honor Indian values and traditions, especially those related to family life and
                    childrearing.</p>
            <p>Currently, Indian food products are widely available and, in most metropolitan areas, there is at

                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> Association or religious center. In their continued support for the more traditional
                    aspects of Indian culture, Asian Indian families in Indiana have more in common with their
                    counterparts in <placeName>

                    finding supports the body of immigration research which suggests that Asian immigrant parents in
                    particular may resist changing traditional family values. Researchers have found that length of
                    residence in the adopted country is not positively correlated with changes in parental attitudes and
                    behaviors. Many Asian immigrants, for example, continue to maintain traditional ideas about child
                    rearing, including expectations, norms, rules, and beliefs.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This oral history project also illuminates Asian Indian immigrants' bi-cultural competence.

                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, and to their adjustment experiences. Values, traditions of social and familial
                    behavior, and religious beliefs retained by Asian Indian immigrants and transmitted to the second
                    generation have allowed members of the group to interact effectively within American society while
                    continuing to identify themselves as Asian Indians. Second-generation <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>-depart from Arcadia's more common image series pattern. John Palmer is a
                    librarian rather than a historian, and his work is far stronger on facts than interpretation. But
                    his book is most emphatically a work of history, relying primarily on its text rather than its
                    illustrations, supported by endnotes and an extensive bibliography. Palmer's coverage is
                    episodic and sometimes eccentric-there is virtually nothing here about politics, while a 1934 bank
                    robbery by the Dillinger gang receives four full pages-and he sometimes jumps from topic to topic,
                    but he is attentive to the concerns of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s many ethnic minorities. His coverage of the civil rights movement is both
                    thorough and sensitive, particularly when he discusses the west side "riot" of
                    1967.</p>

                    </placeName>, as in other Hoosier cities, the most vital organization of the German community was
                    the Turnverein, a combination gymnasium, social club, and cultural center. In addition to

                    "forgetting" their language and their heritage, becoming almost invisible in the
                    American ethnic mosaic. Only later in the twentieth century did Americans of German ancestry again
                    celebrate their heritage. Robinson's thorough account of the German community in <placeName>

            <p>What can be said about this baker's dozen of Arcadia books? They are well-printed,
                    generously if not always clearly illustrated, but mostly weak in notes, bibliography, and index.
                    None of the authors is a professional historian, although Lanette Mullins and Garry Nokes earned
                    undergraduate degrees in history. Only Gabrielle Robinson is a university-based scholar, although
                    her specialization is literature, not history. Obviously Arcadia does not intend its books for
                    historians, although historians can indeed make good use of some of them, especially <hi rend="i">German Settlers of <placeName>

                    editors should be reminded that while postcards can be an important source of historical
                    information, their original publishers and dates must be documented and their original colors ought
                    to be reproduced faithfully. Readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> should
                    approach Arcadia's books with caution, always keeping in mind that amateur historians
                    sometimes write books which professional historians-and others-ought to read.</p>

                        over private rails. Passenger trains are often shunted off to a siding to give the proprietor
                        freight the right-of-way. But this pause was different. Tonight the country's time was
                        falling back; time zone after time zone, time was turning back time. This wrought havoc with the
                        trains schedule. If we didn't stop, we'd actually arrive early at the next
                        station. We had to let the schedule catch up. I stood looking out over the Dutch door in the
                        vestibule between cars. Cornfields everywhere. All over the country, trains waited, panting,
                        stopped in their tracks. Out of time, I waited for the hour to overtake us all, slamming by us,

                    the long strange journey taken by "time" and at the strange manifestation of both
                    its pastness and its futureness-not simply figuratively but quite literally, in a persistent residue
                    and befuddled ritual, in our apparently adjustable present midst.</p>
            <p>
                    <hi rend="i">On another train, at another time. It was New Year's Eve and I was heading
                        west. The passengers on my coach roused themselves at midnight to sing "Auld Lang
                        Syne," a synchronized celebration with the hall dropping in Times Square, not far from
                        the terminus from which we had departed. There was improvised confetti, pitiful horns, splits of
                        champagne, opportunistic kissing. We chugged through the night, crossing, in the dark, some line
                        of demarcation. Once in Indiana we resumed our initial places, and waited for the year to end
                        again. There was another countdown. The singing started up on cue as the engine's
                        Doppler horn yodeled. The confetti defied gravity. The bubbles found their way back into the
                        champagne. Brand new kisses were minted out of the ones recently scrapped.</hi>
                </p>
            <p>The drama of Spring Forward lies between two notions of time: the one connected to the motion of the
                    planet, the other to the machines and schemes that regulate it in theory. It is the disconnection of
                    the first from the second that Mr. Downing stages here with great precision. He is particularly
                    adept at constructing the narrative of this conflict from the arguments of governmental hearing
                    rooms and the daily decaying "news" of newspapers. All of these embedded stories
                    boil down to the same conclusion: The more daylight saving time is studied the more confusing it
                    becomes to its students. The contemplation of time seems to infect everyone with this special
                    malaise. All seem helpless, hapless before the inevitability of this idea whose time has, well, come
                    and keeps coming.</p>
            <p>The book, of course, is itself trapped in a kind of time. Any book has an existential imperative of
                    beginning, middle, and end, and this one flows that way, too, starting at the beginning and moving
                    through its time as if on rails. It was the railroads (having unleashed a machine that, in fact,
                    traveled faster than time) that standardized time in the first place. This story is, of course,
                    covered here. A plaque affixed to the side of a building in <placeName>

                    book, but not just this book, is stuck in its own irresistible progressions of time, its
                    free-floating forwardness. Forward! Perhaps backwards. But rarely repetitious, and never
                    simultaneous. One word after the other. Alas, our time-honored timely timed madness wired, now, into
                    us.</p>

                        over private rails. Passenger trains are often shunted off to a siding to give the proprietor
                        freight the rightof-way. But this pause was different. Tonight the country's time was
                        falling back; time zone after time zone, time was turning back time. This wrought havoc with the
                        train's schedule. If we didn't stop, we'd actually arrive early at
                        the next station. We had to let the schedule catch up. I stood looking out over the Dutch door
                        in the vestibule between cars. Cornfields everywhere. All over the country, trains waited,
                        panting, stopped in their tracks. Out of time, I waited for the hour to overtake us all,

               <hi rend="i">At Home in the Hoosier Hills: Agriculture, Politics, and Religion in Southern
                        Indiana, 1810-1870</hi>, By Richard F. Nation (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 2005. Pp. xi, 274. Maps, notes, index. $35.00.)</head>
            <p>Richard E Nation argues that an intense sense of localism distinguishes early residents of the hill
                    country of southern Indiana from their neighbors elsewhere in the state. For Nation, this localism
                    forms an overriding and unifying theme of the region's religious, economic, and political
                    life. It explains the reluctance of southern Indiana residents to embrace some of the changes that
                    other Hoosiers considered marks of progress, a reluctance that in turn led some to label hill
                    country Hoosiers as backward and lazy.</p>
            <p>In religious life, residents of southern Indiana formed neighborhood congregations to which they gave
                    the power to regulate the moral life of their communities. Nation discusses German Catholics and
                    Primitive Baptists in particular; both, as he shows, remained suspicious of beliefs in human
                    perfectionism, preferring to think of humankind as innately sinful. Followers of each sect
                    distrusted reform movements, such as temperance or abolitionism, that aimed to perfect society and
                    presumed the right of outsiders to pronounce judgment on the morals of distant others.</p>
            <p>Residents of the Hoosier hills created what Nation terms a "surplus produce"
                    economy. Producing primarily for subsistence, they traded any surplus on the market but hesitated to
                    commit themselves fully to the risks of market production. Hogs and corn constituted the staples of
                    the agricultural economy. Neither required disciplined effort by the farmer-hogs could run wild in
                    the woods and corn could stay in the field <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-102-2-068"/> awaiting harvest. It
                    was largely in their failure to engage in the driven pursuit of profit, he contends, that these
                    Hoosiers earned the label of "lazy" amid the striving market culture of the early
                    nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Religion and economics, of course, intersected with politics. Like other scholars, Nation finds that
                    residents of southern Indiana supported the Democratic party rather than the market-friendly,
                    moral-perfectionist Whigs. That party loyalty endured through the Civil War, although Nation asserts
                    that they remained loyal Unionists.</p>
            <p>Nation's study is an interesting and well-written one. Little of its discussion of religion,
                    agriculture, and politics will be new to students of the antebellum and Civil War periods. The value
                    of Nation's work lies instead in its concentration on the distinctiveness of the Indiana
                    hill country. Although he occasionally notes the existence of other subregions that shared the hill
                    country's hostility to the market, abolitionists, African Americans, and Whig/Republicans,
                    more of these comparisons would be welcome. Nation does a good job of conveying the area's
                    distinctiveness in relation to other sections of Indiana but one wonders what the hill country
                    shares in common with other regions where similar values prevailed. The subtitle's dateline
                    is somewhat misleading. Although he includes a chapter on the Civil War, Nation's
                    discussion of Southern Indiana's localistic moral, economic, and political culture focuses
                    on the pre-war period. Other omissions can be traced not to the author's discretion but to
                    the press: pages 85 and 86 were missing from my copy.</p>

            <p>One of the dominant components of Lincoln studies in recent years has been the debate over the
                    sixteenth president's religion and its expression in his public life. Now Stewart Winger
                    enters the fray with this somewhat ponderous but deeply penetrating examination of Lincoln as public
                    intellectual and theologian. Hardly a beginner's book, Winger's work requires of
                    the reader considerable grounding in American intellectual history and Lincolniana. Reading it can
                    be hard work, but the labor is well invested, for Winger's contributions to the scholarly
                    discussion of Lincoln's religious thought are profound and provocative.</p>
            <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-102-2-069"/>
            <p>At the heart of the book is Winger's "attempt to properly contextualize
                    Lincoln's words" (p. 7). To do this, he seeks to place Lincoln's religion
                    in a broader intellectual and cultural framework than previous historians have employed. In their
                    interpretations of Lincoln's religion, Winger asserts, scholars have engaged in a
                    "false choice," treating Lincoln as either a conventional evangelical or a skeptic
                    in the Enlightenment tradition (p. 4). What they have missed is the contribution of romanticism to
                    the president's thought. Winger's Lincoln is, first and foremost, a romantic
                    Protestant whose religious rhetoric reflects the poetic, moral, and deeply spiritual drive of the
                    romanticism that arose from the American Renaissance.</p>
            <p>While readers may justifiably question Winger's thesis, they cannot ignore his impressive
                    grasp of Lincoln's speeches and writings. Not only do these texts constitute the core
                    sources for the author's complex case for the romantic nature of Lincoln's
                    political theology, but they also come alive in his astute assessment of their messages. Winger
                    masterfully explicates the renowned <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address and Second Inaugural, as well as some of Lincoln's most obscure public
                    presentations, such as his musings on Niagara Falls, an oration on the Subtreasury and a
                    "Second Lecture on Discoveries and Inventions." The latter offering, in fact,
                    serves as the springboard for Winger's initial dive into Lincoln's quarrels with
                    the Young America movement for its imperialistic adherence to manifest destiny and its
                    "enthusiasm for world-market capitalism" (p. 21). Winger uses Lincoln's
                    debates with Stephen Douglas and his challenges to Douglas's alter ego, George Bancroft, to
                    demonstrate the depth of moral fervor that characterized his Protestant and romantic perspective on
                    the meaning of America.</p>
            <p>Equally insightful is Winger's description of the roots of Lincoln's religion.
                    Besides the powerful influence of romanticism-which Winger sees as essentially a "religious
                    urge" (p. 220)-and the poetic spirit it instilled in Lincoln, Winger finds the Whig
                    departure from classical republicanism as expressed in its organ, the Whig <hi rend="i">Review,</hi>
                    a consistent source for the young <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> politician. Perhaps most critical to the future president's religious views,
                    though, was the Calvinistic "predestinarian Baptist household" in which he grew to
                    maturity in Indiana (p. 159). Winger's discussion of this facet of Lincoln's life
                    provides the strongest and clearest section of the book; in it, he shows that the teachings of that
                    particular Protestant tradition regarding human nature set the stage for Lincoln's role as
                    "an apt prophet for his generation" (p. 159). All these influences produced a
                    political leader who engaged in the sacralization of American politics and who proposed a national
                    religion in which the nation-as Lincoln made so clear in his Second Inaugural-is accountable to a
                    just God. As Winger states, "Lincoln would use the <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-102-2-070"/>
                    national creed to critique the national practice" (p. 179). He also reminded America that,
                    as a nation, it was "no closer to the Kingdom of God than any other. All alike remained
                    under the judgment of God" (p. 208). These latter words provide a cogent closing for a
                    path-breaking book- and a poignant message for America in the twenty-first century.</p>

                    Indiana,</hi> 1935-1942, By George T. Blakey, (<placeName>

            <p>The Federal Writers' Project (FWP) was a New Deal program formed to utilize the writing,
                    interviewing, and analytical skills of journalists, teachers, writers, and others who had lost their
                    livelihoods during the Great Depression. Writers who would go on to gain a name in American
                    literature-including Nelson Algren, Ralph Ellison, Eudora Welty, Zora Neale Hurston, Studs Terkel,
                    and Saul Bellow-were all, at one time or another, employed by the FWP.</p>
            <p>The project's most public and lasting legacy is the <hi rend="i">American Guide</hi> series:
                    a combination of "state history, encyclopedia, and travel guide" to each of the
                    forty-eight states, assembled from hours of interviews, writing, and re-writing by fieldworkers (p.
                    41). While the primary job of each state's FWP staff was to research, write, and see
                    through to publication a Guide, the project also resulted in side projects, including most notably
                    the former-slave narratives that have been published in recent decades.</p>
            <p>In this meticulously researched and highly readable book, George Blakey has created an essential
                    resource, both for readers interested in this period in Indiana and American history, and for future
                    historians. While some of the material collected by the FWP workers in Indiana appeared in the final
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana Guide</hi> (1941) as well as in other publications-including newspaper
                    columns and a collection of folklore, <hi rend="i">Hoosier Tall Stories</hi> (1937)-most of the
                    material collected by the fieldworkers has never been published or used extensively by scholars.</p>
            <p>As Blakey states in his introduction, "This massive body of information, stored in archival
                    boxes at the <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-102-2-071"/> Library of Congress, the National Archives, and

                    publications …. It is time to pay attention to them" (pp. 4, 5). In this
                    important book, Blakey expands the work, begun by Ronald Baker in his study of the folklore
                    collections of Indiana's FWR of uncovering and analyzing this rich source of material.</p>
            <p>Blakey places the <hi rend="i">Indiana Guide</hi> in its national context, which he then sets against
                    the passions and obsessions of the three writers primarily responsible for the finished project:
                    Ross Lockridge, Rebecca Pitts, and Gordon Briggs. The Indiana that emerges in the <hi rend="i">Guide,</hi> as Blakey describes it, is a self-portrait created by the convergence of these
                    three particular writers. But it is in his analysis of the rest of the self-portrait-the unfinished
                    projects, ephemeral publications, oral histories, and research inventories-that the true picture of
                    Depression Indiana emerges. Blakey refers to these manuscripts as "archival
                    windows" that "offer a view of Indiana that is far more urban, female,
                    multiracial, and multiethnic than the published works portray" (p. 211). By combining the
                    vision of Indiana in the published accounts with those in the unpublished archives, Blakey states,
                    "an Indiana of the Depression decade emerges that is more complex and less nostalgic that
                    that found in the FWP books and rticles" (p. 211). The archival collections remain, as he
                    notes, rich with interviews, observations, and lists from around the state. This is one of those
                    books that makes anyone interested in Indiana history want to take a pilgrimage into the archives
                    with the author as their guide.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>Randy Mills draws upon soldiers' letters and recent personal interviews with veterans,
                    relatives, and friends to recover the voices of Indiana veterans of the Korean conflict. He
                    contextualizes their struggle in the broader scope of the war's arc from shocking
                    mobilization to fading victory to disillusioning stalemate.</p>
            <p>Mills adroitly selects ordinary citizens' voices, devoting lengthy sections of the narrative
                    to their detailed <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-102-2-072"/> recollections and allowing veterans and their
                    families to illuminate several key aspects of recruitment and fighting conditions. We learn of the
                    many factors that motivated soldiers to enlist: poverty, desire to emulate older brothers'
                    World War II service, machismo, and adventure. We learn, too, of how soldiers' ordinary
                    struggles became extraordinary challenges in difficult terrain and climate, as Marine Corps
                    reservist David Graham suggests in his description of carrying a frozen sleeping bag. Others
                    suffered pain of a different sort, as we see from the racial slurs in the letters some soldiers sent
                    home and in the recollections of African American soldiers- juxtaposed with Army private Stanley
                    Nelson's reflection that "Korean civilians were the greatest casualties of the
                    war" (p. 101). Mills includes voices from the home front, including a letter to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> that illustrates the rampant paranoia induced by confrontation with
                    Communism.</p>
            <p>The stories of reservists, like Graham, are particularly poignant. Though promised that they could
                    quit at any time, these soldiers were denied that privilege amid national emergency. Terrified
                    parents raged at the scandalously hasty deployment of these untrained reservists in the Pusan
                    perimeter. Graham recounts a colonel promising him "all the boot camp you want"
                    after his return from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>! (p. 60).</p>
            <p>Most heartrending of all are the words of soldiers, like Donald <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who did not survive: "the squirrels and game wardens will get one more
                    year's rest," writes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "but don't make too many plans because no one knows what will happen
                    in the next year. I don't even look ahead a year anymore because with the luck I have,
                    there just isn't any need to" (p. 57).</p>
            <p>Mills constructs his battle narrative around the Hoosiers who fought in some of the most important
                    Korean battles. Stanley Nelson, Hobert Young, and Ray Cox were among the first combatants in Pusan
                    perimeter. <placeName>

                    Jacobs, Jr., were among those who survived.</p>
            <p>Some problems with editing remain. The deaths of Faith and Garrigus are introduced at the opening of
                    chapter 3, but not actually discussed until chapter 4. The call-up of Marine reservists is
                    repetitively addressed. Some photo captions are oddly placed; for instance, Samuel Muncy is
                    mentioned in text adjacent to his photo (p. 96) but the caption references Chosin, which is
                    described in the following chapter. A map would have been very useful alongside the Chosin
                    narrative. <placeName>

                    </placeName> launched a spring offensive, not an "offense" in 1951 (p. 171). While
                    Mills begins with veterans' source materials and later uses Hoosier newspapers to convey
                    the "larger context" <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-102-2-073"/> (p. xiv), he treats the <placeName>

                    Mills also does not quite explain why Indiana offers "a particularly important case
                    study" other than to note that the state lay at the "demographic heart of the
                    country" at the time (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>Still, Mills's heartfelt tribute to the ordinary soldier, replete with touching anecdotes of
                    bereaved families, reminds the reader of the realities of war for Americans, and especially for
                    Hoosiers. Mills's eye for the illuminating quotation and illustrative anecdote makes this
                    book a pleasure to read and a useful tool for the teacher. He indeed honors those who paid the
                    price.</p>

            <p>Writing a history of urban universities is a challenging task-one reason why these new studies of
                    Indiana University-Purdue University <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (IUPUI) and Indiana University Northwest (IUN) make a contribution to a growing body of
                    historical literature. Both studies begin appropriately on a defensive note. The origins, growth,
                    and development of these twentieth-century urban satellite campuses-extensions of a powerful
                    nineteenth-century rural institution-number among Indiana's best kept secrets. Urban
                    universities founded in the second half of the twentieth century have struggled to establish
                    identities of their own while still confronting the needs of disparate and often conflicting
                    constituencies: among them city and state politicians, admissions from a racially and economically
                    diverse mix of students (many of them first-generation commuters from inner city schools), research
                    and teaching faculties, neighborhood economic interests, <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-102-2-074"/> and
                    not least a central institution using its influence to retain control over satellites. IU is the
                    elephant looming in the background.</p>
            <p>The contemporary historian of the late twentieth-century metropolitan "un-iversity"
                    needs to gather up the segmented pieces and assorted fragments from a multitude of local
                    perspectives over many decades and bring them into focus as a coherent and recognizable whole. Parts
                    of an institution, assembled from extensions, do not necessarily total a comprehensive place. Ralph
                    D. Gray, professor emeritus of history, succeeds in laying this important groundwork for IUPUI.
                    Using sources drawn primarily from printed institutional documents, he surveys in detail the origins
                    of extension divisions and professional schools from 1891, to the creation of a merged IUPUI in
                    1969, through the campus's subsequent developments. He pays special attention to
                    administration at all levels (including such chancellors and major players as Mayiiard Hine, Glenn
                    Irwin, Gerald Bepko, and the Lilly Foundation), as well as to the drive for academic respectability,
                    the teaching program, campus sports, and student activities.</p>
            <p>As Gray demonstrates, mergers are dicey business. One of the most interesting sections of his
                    narrative documents the politics swirling around the merger in 1969, a process "difficult
                    to reconstruct" as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> transformed itself, according to one observer, "from a sleazy state capital
                    into a world-class city" (pp. 80,45).</p>
            <p>Gray's comprehensive history is enthusiastic and upbeat, highlighting a story of leadership
                    and achievement in each of the major schools and a broad variety of sponsored projects and programs.
                    In part, the result is a reference work, testimony to the institutional complexity meshing
                    individuals and facilities that made the merger work. The index and notes are useful navigational
                    tools in this book. Thanks to Gray's work, historians and supporters of urban higher
                    education now have a better understanding of the contours of the institutional landscape of what is,
                    fortunately, no longer a best-kept secret.</p>
            <p>By comparison to Gray's topdown institutional history, editors James Lane and Paul Kern
                    concentrate on the bottom-up social history of IUN since its move to Glenn Park in 1959. Stitching
                    together a trove of oral interviews within the narrative outline of departments and programs, the
                    editors capture the interplay of people-each with distinctive backgrounds, ambitions, opinions,
                    passions, and career paths-residing on an urban campus. Incongruity, irony, and dissident points of
                    view characterize this non-linear approach to historical narrative.</p>
            <p>Lane and Kern's publication, a volume in the <hi rend="i">Steel Shavings</hi> journal
                    series, is appropriately entitled "Educating the Calumet Region." IUN acted as a
                    vibrant stage upon which students made the transition to a <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-102-2-075"/>
                    working world, faculty pursued careers of their own, and administrators came and went-all while
                    major happenings like the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War, counterculture movements, and the decline of manufacturing played out in the
                    larger world. The editors, participant observers speaking through informants, provide often
                    irreverent and sharp commentary as they display the candid side of the higher learning process. For
                    instance, a student grouses about history professors "attacking things I grew up
                    believing," or being "outraged at the things" the Pentagon Papers
                    exposed. Reactions such as these from blue-collar students came with the territory, as did the
                    reactions of veterans and older students returning to a school they could financially afford. Unlike
                    their downstate peers, commuting urban students are not sequestered in the culture of cloistered
                    towns. And urban universities like IUN (and IUPUI) became a microcosm of society, with all its warts
                    and cross purposes as well as its strengths and creativity. This volume provides the historian of
                    education with original points of view and leads for further work. Mistaken in my view, the editors
                    decided to omit citation of their sources, thinking they would be distracting. The original
                    manuscript, with notes intact, is deposited in the Calumet Regional Archives.</p>

            <p>Whatever the public's infatuation with the Amish, these books prove that a place remains for
                    the serious and responsible study of Amish life. In a field that has focused disproportionately upon
                    the Amish in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                        <region type="county">Lancaster County</region>
                    </placeName> (from John A. Hostetler's early studies to Donald B. Kraybill's
                    recent works)-Harroff and Pratt promise to provide fresh insight based on the experiences of the
                    Amish in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The two books are quite dissimilar. <hi rend="i">Shipshewana</hi> is a version of Pratt's
                        <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-102-2-076"/> Notre Dame history dissertation. Harroff studied Amish
                    schools during three decades of teaching German language, literature, and culture at Indiana
                    University-Purdue University, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. While chapter one of his volume offers a valuable and competent history the pages that
                    follow provide almost no historical framework, explanation, or analysis. Another difference lies in
                    basic method. Harroff's rearing and religion (Church of the Brethren) seem to have put him
                    close enough to help him understand many subtleties of the Amish world-view. He conducted
                    participant-observer research by visiting and keenly watching Amish schools, meanwhile forming
                    genuine friendships to the point that the Amish sometimes called on him to substitute for a teacher.
                    Pratt did some interviewing, but she otherwise relied mainly on written sources. Even for the
                    purpose of writing history, she might well have profited from getting further into day-to-day Amish
                    life and perceptions.</p>
            <p>Another basic difference between the two works lies in their interpretive method. Harroff stayed with
                    meticulous description, while Pratt applied social science concept- smost notably ideas about
                    boundary maintenance, responses to the market economy, and Amish resistance to assimilation. Just as
                    Pratt might have benefited from a bit more of Harroff's firsthand observation, Harroff
                    might in turn have asked deeper questions had he opened himself to such a conceptual framework.</p>
            <p>Finally, Harroff proceeds, albeit implicitly, from an assumption that religion is an independent
                    variable, a prime motivator in human affairs. (Apparently he means his subtitle, <hi rend="i">Faith
                        in Education,</hi> to be a double entendre.) Pratt's assumption about religion is less
                    clear. While she sometimes attributed Amish people's behaviors to their faith, her
                    discussion often implies that even the Amish are mainly creatures of economics and sociology, with
                    their religion being more a derivative than an independent cause.</p>
            <p>Whatever its differences from Pratt's volume, Harroff's <hi rend="i">The Amish
                        Schools in Indiana</hi> has genuine strengths: meticulous observation; affective as well as
                    cognitive knowledge and communication of its subject; and clear, well-organized presentation. But it
                    also has weaknesses. Its author has delivered a most favorable description (gifted teachers, orderly
                    classrooms, effective methods, and seamless integration with Amish community, family, and values);
                    but he did not go on to reflect on the lessons that Amish education might offer to parochial and
                    publicschool school teachers and officials. Moreover, while he covered in great detail the things
                    that Amish teachers and schools do well, he said almost nothing about what they do not. One wonders,
                    for instance, how well those schools help Amish children to understand other points of view.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Shipshew ana's</hi> strengths and weaknesses are less clear-cut. Pratt <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-102-2-077"/> conducted diligent research, used secondary literature to
                    advantage, added much from primary sources, and organized and wrote competently. She delivered keen
                    insights, and readers can profit from her application of social-science concepts. At the same time,
                    students of Amish and Mennonite culture may feel some insecurity about what to accept from her. She
                    seemed not to know that Mennonites affirm, rather than swear, legal oaths (p. 69); elsewhere, she
                    implied that a poultry hatchery near Shipshewana is an Amish enterprise (p. 134), when in fact its
                    owners are Mennonite.</p>
            <p>More basically, Pratt's use of evidence undercuts what could have been her most valuable
                    purpose. While a study of this sort promises to test the broader scholarship against specific
                    evidence from a local community, Pratt has trouble keeping that community and its nearby neighbors
                    in focus. Shipshewana, in northern Indiana's LaGrange County, is a key center of Amish
                    life, and consequently of tourism. Yet when she had difficulty finding data from her chosen
                    community she took evidence from Amish elsewhere in LaGrange or in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> Counties, or more widely from Indiana, or even, on occasion, from wider scholarship
                    about the Amish in other regions altogether. Yet Amish regulations and ways differ, even rather
                    close to Shipshewana (for instance, on whether to allow work in large factories not owned by Amish).
                    How well does evidence drawn from beyond Shipshewana apply to this particular community? More
                    seriously, does her use of nonlocal evidence undermine the potential promise of testing conventional
                    wisdom against local circumstance?</p>
            <p>Like any scholar's work, these books need juxtaposition with other scholarship. Thomas J.
                    Meyers and Steven M. Nolt's Lilly Endowmentfunded research on Indiana's Old Order
                    Amish, <hi rend="i">An Amish Patchwork: Indiana's Old Orders in the Modern World</hi>
                    (2005) and their forthcoming <hi rend="i">Amish Mosaic: Shaping Cultural Identities</hi> provide a
                    good starting place. Readers of Harroff's volume would do well to look at literature that
                    features broader concepts and questions. Such broader literature may also help readers to evaluate
                    Pratt's evidence and to consider religion as a motivator in its own right. But with or
                    without such additional reading, these two volumes, with their divergent styles and methods, will
                    profit even well-versed readers.</p>

            <p>Most undergraduates in the U.S. history survey briefly encounter the Maysville Road when they study
                    Jacksonian-era battles over federal support for internal improvements. For those who want to know
                    more about how this backcountry road became the center of a national controversy, Craig Thompson
                    Friend's <hi rend="i">Along the Maysville Road</hi> takes readers back to the Revolutionary
                    era, making the sixty-five-mile route through northcentral <placeName>

                    </placeName> the organizing principle for a social history of the state during the early republic.</p>
            <p>Thompson describes his approach as a "biography of a road" and readers will
                    certainly learn about the physical and environmental changes in the thoroughfare, from its earliest
                    history as a buffalo trace to the turnpike era, when locals and tourists alike finally experienced
                    travel on a relatively smooth, paved surface. But this is not primarily a book about the
                    transportation revolution. It is a more broadly conceived social history of the towns and
                    communities that grew up along the Maysville Road from the 1770s to the 1830s. Using a diverse array
                    of sources ranging from travel accounts, newspapers, census data, manuscripts, and maps to
                    architectural and landscape evidence, Friend traces the evolution of communities along the road from
                    their origins in a period of ethnically diverse pioneering migrations, through the emergence of an
                    agricultural gentry, to what he calls the triumph of an entrepreneurial middle class. Women and
                    slaves appear periodically, but the focus of the book remains on the "men of
                    commerce" who, Friend argues, ultimately controlled "the form and direction of
                    cultural development in this early American West" (p. 4).</p>
            <p>In the period from 1800 to 1825, debt, drought, war, and revivalism reshaped the road and the
                    communities it linked. The state assembly began to pay greater attention to road construction
                    beginning in 1810; Friend argues that the decision signaled a shifting political culture in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, from a society organized around traditional communities transplanted by the eastern
                    gentry to one shaped by the triumph of middle-class commercial interests. Though political debate
                    was often contentious, the limits of turnpike investment and the symbiotic relationship between
                    agricultural and commercial interests suggest that a common class interest produced more consensus
                    than conflict among the commercial elites at the heart of Friend's story.</p>
            <p>Friend's initial assertion that "this beaten path was one of the most <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-102-2-079"/> exceptional roads of the Early American Republic, serving as the spine
                    of the most dynamic region of the American West," overreaches the evidence, which primarily
                    documents the role of Maysville Road as a local route connecting a "Village West"
                    rather than as a migration highway (p. 2). Nevertheless, scholars of the trans-Appalachian west in
                    the early republic will find much useful information in this microhistory of social change in a
                    region where revivalism, patriotism, and entrepreneurial ambition helped to define a new American
                    identity. Friend's narrative writing style will also appeal to a broader public audience
                    interested in the history of <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Confronting Race: Women and Indians on the Frontier,</hi> 1815-1915, By Glenda Riley,
                    (Albuquerque: University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>

            <p>Glenda Riley, Alexander M. Bracken professor emeritus of history at Ball State University, has
                    contributed substantially to the field of women's history throughout her remarkably
                    productive career. Historically speaking, she is largely responsible for putting midwestern women on
                    the map. In <hi rend="i">Confronting Race,</hi> Riley examines white-Indian relations and the racial
                    prejudices of nineteenth-century, trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> migrating women, many of whom had midwestern roots. She contends that, as a result of
                    proscribed gender roles, white women interacted with American Indians and demonstrated changing
                    attitudes toward them in ways that white men did not. Even so, she concludes, white women remained
                    "solidly colonialist" in their opinions about other groups (p. 2).
                    Riley's analysis is based primarily upon a range of women's private writings
                    including diaries, journals, and daybooks, along with a number of public accounts, records, and
                    cultural sources such as novels. This study speaks to the need to investigate the role of gender in
                    the legacies of white expansionism in the West.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Confronting Race</hi> is a revised version of a 1984 publication into which Riley has
                    integrated newer findings and at least one major theoretical argument to engage in the larger
                    conversation about race and colonialism. Western frontiers are identified as geographical zones
                    wherein groups of people met and where one group <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-102-2-080"/> intended to
                    subdue another. Frontiers also include "procedures" and phases that, Riley
                    contends, infused the drama of westward migration: frontier philosophy, the process of relocation
                    and imposition, and geographical place and colonialism (p. 7). She also examines their consequences.
                    The groundwork is laid in the first two chapters, which examine nineteenth-century American and
                    European discourses on the constitution of white womanhood and on the American Indian as an
                    "other." As it pertained to white women, the frontier experience involved
                    encounters with Indians and a subsequent shifting of their views from vilification to humane
                    understanding. Riley contends, however, that in their relationship with non-Indian
                    "others" (such as Mexicans, Asians, and African Americans), white women proved
                    unable to moderate their "race-based consciousness" (p. 223).</p>
            <p>On one level, this is a difficult book to review. Weaknesses in the author's style and
                    contentions periodically threaten to undermine the strength of her basic argument. Riley tends to
                    universalize her characterizations and to make assumptions about matters of the mind that she cannot
                    possibly know for certain. To cite one of many examples, she notes that "[t]eachings about
                    women's moral authority, white superiority, Manifest Destiny, and European-style
                    colonialism were so deeply entrenched, they remained always at the back of women's
                    minds" (p. 96). One expects to find such contentions followed by corroborating contemporary
                    remarks; but in this case none are offered. One also wonders how "deeply
                    entrenched" Manifest Destiny and colonialism actually were in the minds of westering white
                    women. For that matter, neither of these could be the real driving forces that
                    "propelled" them westward, as Riley claims (p. 7). Personal economics and
                    aspirations, rather than popular ideology, were the most likely immediate factors. Throughout this
                    study, Riley employs a pattern of overstatement and universalization without illustrating,
                    strengthening, or proving her contentions.</p>
            <p>Concerns aside, <hi rend="i">Confronting Race</hi> is significant for its gendered analysis of
                    westward expansion, with its implications for our understanding of white women's role in
                    the legacies of migration and frontier development. The book also offers an important link between
                    midwestern women and westward migration, one of the most important events of the nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>Occasionally there comes along a book that challenges us to reevaluate long-held assumptions about an
                    area of study. Dennis S. Nordin and Roy V. Scott's <hi rend="i">From <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                        </placeName> Farmer to Entrepreneur</hi> is such a work. In seven compact chapters, the authors
                    dissect a prodigious quantity of research and construct a bold new synthesis of the restructuring of
                    twentieth-century midwestern farming and rural life by the forces of technology, economic change,
                    and government policy. In the process the authors shatter numerous myths and misconceptions rooted
                    in Jeffersonian agrarian fundamentalism.</p>
            <p>Nordin and Scott argue persuasively that the period between 1900 and 1920, often called the
                    "golden age" of agriculture because of increasing yields and rising prices, in
                    fact witnessed severe market changes that forced a growing number of small farmers into tenancy
                    while encouraging more astute operators to move into commercial farming. Similarly, they show that
                    the agricultural depression of the 1920s resulted not so much from overproduction as from reduced
                    spoilage, a change attributable to improved transportation and refrigeration, declining consumption
                    by urban workers in response to lower wages, and declining exports brought on by high tariffs.
                    Likewise, New Deal interventionist policies- and those of both the Democratic and Republican
                    administrations that followed-encouraged less skilled farmers to remain on the farm, delaying their
                    ultimate movement into urban, industrial jobs, and making nearly all farmers increasingly dependent
                    on the federal government for financial support. Ostensibly intended to improve the lot of
                    struggling family farmers, these policies primarily benefited the most highly skilled operators who
                    increased efficiency and productivity by embracing technological innovations such as tractors,
                    hybrid seed, and chemical insecticides and fertilizers. Meanwhile, technological innovations such as
                    the radio and rural electrification, the advent of rural mail delivery, advances in public
                    education, and the improvement of country roads significantly reduced rural isolation and steadily
                    improved the quality of rural life during the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>For mechanically challenged readers, such as this reviewer, chapter five provides a particularly
                    fascinating and detailed account of how mpanies such as Case, Ford, International Harvester,
                    Allis-Chalmers, and John Deere transformed agriculture by developing larger, more powerful, and more
                    expensive tractors and implements. Such equipment not <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-102-2-082"/> only
                    affected the production of corn, wheat, and other grain crops, but also changed the cultivation of
                    fruits and vegetables by reducing dependence on migrant labor and increasing the scale of
                    production. <placeName>

                    </placeName>timed purchases also forced many marginal farmers into excessive debt and, eventually,
                    out of business.</p>
            <p>Meticulously researched and deftly written, Nordin and Scott's analysis is distinguished by
                    a dispassionate tone that neither lauds nor laments the changes they chronicle. Rather than waxing
                    nostalgic, they view the transformation of midwestern agriculture as a logical consequence of
                    technological change and a rational response to a growing nation's need for food. While the
                    authors express concern about the attendant manifestations of rural decay and urban sprawl, they
                    note that many rural families benefited in the long run from opportunities for better education and
                    alternative employment and that complaints about new neighbors "often ended with sales to
                    land developers at prices well above the prevailing level for farmland" (p. 152).</p>
            <p>I do have one factual clarification. The authors state that decentralization of livestock marketing
                    ended the International Livestock Show in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 158). More precisely, when the Union Stock Yards closed, the International
                    Livestock Exposition merged with the North American Livestock Exposition in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, to create the North American International Livestock Exposition, the
                    nation's largest purebred livestock show. But this is a minor quibble. Nordin and
                    Scott's contribution to the literature of midwestern agriculture will have a lasting
                    influence upon our understanding of the history of rural life.</p>

            <p>Although some museum professionals may question the decision to offer a single donor an exclusive
                    exhibit and publication, the variety and quality of the paintings owned by Powell and Barbara
                    Bridges prove worthwhile both as educational tools and as historical documentation of the
                    city's artistic trends. The book's three main sections include two wellresearched
                    essays as well as a catalog comprising succinct biographies of each of the forty-nine artists along
                    with fine images of the works themselves. An introduction by Susan C. Larsen deftly discusses the
                    nature of art collecting, traces the evolution of the Bridges' accumulation of artwork, and

                    of art under a single broad roof successfully institutionalized art as a civic commodity (p. 24).
                    Heavily influenced by studio instructors' preferences and by the progression of dominating
                    boards of directors, the artwork produced at the school remained primarily traditional in the early

                    </placeName>'s conservative painters and those of the emerging local modernists smoothly
                    leads into Susan Weininger's essay, "The Spirit of Change': Modernism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Weininger contends that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s modernist movement evolved fairly independently from developments in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Although an exhibit of work by the East Coast Ashcan School artists traveled to the

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> artists preferred a sanitized version of social realism. Generally, they showed more
                    interest in creating pleasing images than in adhering to theoretical principles.</p>
            <p>Greenhouses's and Weininger's contextual essays create a thorough overview, not

                    achieving success as a Midwest artist, the rebellion against the established exhibition regime, and
                    the desire to infuse with cultural ambiance a city best known for its stockyards.</p>

                    seventy-eight paintings receives respectful "breathing room" in the form of
                    exclusive page placement conducive to the diverse painting styles. Listed alphabetically by artist
                    name, the essays reveal careful research with notes conveniently placed in the side-margins.
                    Fascinating details spice up the factual writing, such as Ivan Albright's penchant for
                    signing both the tops and bottoms of his paintings to facilitate upside-down hanging.</p>
            <p>An awkward size to carry and read, the book is bound with laminated soft covers that mitigate price

            <p>In this regional perspective on what radical-turned-scholar Todd Gitlin called the "years of
                    hope and days of rage," Robbie Lieberman explores how the student New Left manifested
                    itself in "working-class institutions in rural, conservative areas of the country"
                    (p. x). Through a collection of oral histories from former activists affiliated in varying degrees
                    with Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) chapters at the University of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Power" activism not simply as a disruptive contingent of SDS-the most
                    highprofile and influential New Left group of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> era-but as a distinctive ethos, value system, and style of protest based on a genuine
                    commitment to organizing around local issues and on a penchant for complementing direct-action
                    politics with cultural rebellion. Concomitantly, by giving voice to these midwestern radicals,
                    Lieberman's intends to challenge orthodox perceptions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Power (advanced by SDS leaders such as Gitlin) as having been litde more than a
                    collection of unsophisticated, longhaired, dope-smoking anarchists whose ascendancy within SDS after
                    1965 derailed that organization and helped steer what is loosely referred to as "the
                    movement" down the path <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-102-2-085"/> toward hedonism, violence, and
                    nihilistic excess.</p>
            <p>As a matter of personal preference, this reviewer finds the technique of compiling largely undigested
                    oral histories to be somewhat problematic. Admittedly, the book grew out of a forum discussion
                    entitled "I'm on the Pavement, Thinkin' about the Government': <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, Carbondale, and the May 1970 Riot," and it retains that basic panel feel
                    throughout. Lieberman, a professor of history at SlU-Carbondale, facilitates by providing a timeline
                    of pertinent "sixties" events and an introductory historiography of the New Left,
                    including the rise and fall of SDS. Her footnotes identify key people and events of the generation
                    and offer a brief history of each campus. But students and casual readers seeking historical context
                    with which to evaluate these stories would be well served by consulting monographs by scholars such
                    as Terry Anderson, David Farber, or James Farrell beforehand. The book also falls somewhat short in
                    its aim of vindicating <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Power; many of Lieberman's local activists speak less to her organizing theme
                    than to the amorphous nature of being a part of "the movement," a process that
                    involved picking and choosing those aspects of the "sixties experience" most
                    applicable to them.</p>
            <p>These things said, Lieberman does deliver on her objective of letting the activists speak in their
                    own words. Her work faithfully follows the prevailing trend in sixties scholarship of rejecting, as
                    historian Kenneth Heinemann puts it, the traditional perception of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    to, activism. In bringing together often heartfelt and thoughtful reminiscences from these
                    grassroots rebels, Lieberman expands our knowledge of the sixties by offering what women's
                    labor historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall has called, the "partial truths": a more
                    extured and nuanced picture of less familiar events and lesser-known actors-such as the
                    "the Moo and Cackle riots" in Carbondale and the "February

                    to shape the history of the state. Wide ranging in time and topic, the essays investigate race and
                    politics in the post-Civil War era, labor organization (both farm and industry) from the antebellum
                    period to modern times, and the legal and illegal organization of women in the late nineteenth and
                    early twentieth centuries. Although the essays deal specifically with Missourians and <placeName>

                    </placeName> issues, they point to ways in which locally-based social history can enrich our
                    understanding of national trends and demonstrate how everyday people help to influence the course of
                    history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Language and Political Meaning in Revolutionary America</hi>, By John Howe, (Amherst:
                    University of <placeName>

            <p>There is little doubt of the substantial role played by vocabulary in determining the outcome of
                    public events. Whether deployed in the service of great historical struggles or of fleeting
                    political squabbles, language can produce deadlock, or it can reframe the very manner in which
                    citizens understand the questions at issue.</p>
            <p>Professor John Howe devotes considerable effort to recounting the evolution of language in late
                    colonial America, and to investigating its influence on the political struggles of the era. His book
                    does not attempt to create an overarching theory of language during the several decades of the
                    Revolutionary period, but it does provide useful insights into the interplay of language and
                    politics.</p>
            <p>Modern readers easily forget, for example, that during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
                    centuries the English language was still very much in flux. Conventions of spelling, punctuation,
                    and grammar (not to mention definitions of words) now so familiar to Englishmen and Americans alike
                    were still matters in play during the decades preceding the Revolution. Samuel Johnson's
                    1755 dictionary became the leading achievement of a fifty-year movement to prescribe standard
                    language. The respectability that such standardization brought to the English language fit nicely
                    with the ambitious goals of Great Britain's political leadership.</p>
            <p>Howe observes that the movement toward standardization, still a work in progress on the eve of the
                    Revolution, complicated the political debate that ultimately led to schism between the mother
                    country and her colonies. The conflict with the British during what Howe calls "the
                    imperial crisis" was exacerbated by the fact that the two sides possessed different
                    definitions of common terms like <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-102-2-088"/> "liberty"
                    and "the rights of Englishmen." Language might even be said to have played a role
                    during a lastditch effort to avoid war, when General Howe received a delegation from the Continental
                    Congress in the winter of 1777. This effort foundered when the parties disagreed over whether the
                    colonials should be called a group of individuals or representatives of the colonial congress.</p>
            <p>Howe also helpfully traces changes in the means of political discourse during the Revolutionary
                    decades. These middle decades of the eighteenth century witnessed an explosion of political
                    expression through the use of broadsides (frequently issued anonymously). The number of regular
                    newspapers in the colonies expanded rapidly during the fifteen years after 1775, creating an
                    alternative mode of political expression. By the time of the Constitutional Convention, newspapers
                    had become the leading means of propagating political doctrine.</p>
            <p>Howe also casts disagreements over the ratification of the Constitution in linguistic light. In
                    opposing ratification, the Anti-Federalists tended to express their views as though language were a
                    fixed commodity, taking the same approach as the prescriptive creators of the dictionaries. They
                    insisted that greater precision in language could provide a safer future for the country. Their
                    demand for a bill of rights to protect the people and the states from overreaching by the new
                    government aligned with this view of language. The Federalists, seeing both language and the
                    constitutional document as possessing the capacity to develop new meanings and purposes over time,
                    spoke to the politics of the age in language characterized by studied ambiguity.</p>
            <p>Professor Howe's book fits nicely alongside the several works over the last decade that have
                    explored colonial language and politics. This book is not aimed at the popular reader, nor even at
                    the regular student of history. This relatively slender volume contains nearly fifty pages of
                    endnotes, and its paragraphs are filled with inside references to other writers and critics. The
                    book contains useful observations and lots of source material, but most readers will find it more
                    valuable as a reference volume than as a casual read.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">No Taint of Compromise,</hi> Frederick J. Blue applies a prosopographic analysis to
                    antislavery politics in the antebellum era. Blue presents eleven portraits of antislavery political
                    leaders, ranging from well-known figures, like John Greenleaf Whittier and David Wilmot, to such
                    lesser-known activists as Alvan Stewart and Sherman M. Booth. The subjects are wellchosen and
                    diverse, representing different regional, religious, and partisan backgrounds. Of special interest
                    to readers of this journal may be Blue's chapter on George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Julian, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> congressman from Indiana who was a member of the Free Soil party and a leader of the
                    Radical Republicans from 1861-1871. <hi rend="i">No Taint of Compromise</hi> also includes two women
                    among its portraits (Jane Grey Swisshelm and Jessie <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName>), as well as a black political leader (Charles Henry Langston). Their biographies
                    challenge narrow assumptions about who participated in antebellum politics. Overall, Blue portrays
                    individuals who have been the subject of little historical attention. By eschewing Lincoln and
                    Sumner for Booth and Swisshelm, Blue guarantees that the book will make a contribution to the field.</p>
            <p>The portraits are arranged according to the subjects' roles in the evolution of antislavery
                    politics, from the initial organization of the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840, through the
                    formation of the anti-slavery-expansion Free Soil party in 1848, to the political realignment that
                    produced the Republican party in the mid-18503. Blue's purpose is to demonstrate that
                    antislavery politics did not constitute a compromised antislavery effort. Ever since William Lloyd
                    Garrison's decisive turn against politics in the mid-1830s, political antislavery has been
                    viewed suspiciously. But Garrison's bias, Blue suggests, has been adopted by historians
                    without good cause. By looking closely at the lives of antislavery political leaders, Blue hopes to
                    demonstrate that-in the words of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Julian-their antislavery politics had "no taint of compromise." At
                    some point, each of his subjects made an unswerving commitment to attack slavery through politics.</p>
            <p>Readers may question whether a persistent political commitment is equivalent to an uncompromised
                    ethical position. After all, compromise is the very stuff of politics. Blue's organization
                    of his portraits makes the tension in his argument obvious. By ordering his subjects from Liberty
                    Party members through Free Soilers to Republicans, Blue cannot help but reproduce the declension
                    narrative of antislavery politics: that antislavery <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-102-2-090"/> politicians
                    who first joined the unpopular abolitionist Liberty Party, later migrated into the merely
                    restrictionist Free Soil party in order to gain votes. His subjects may not have compromised their
                    commitments to politics, but they certainly compromised their commitments to antislavery. Blue
                    compounds this impression throughout by qualifying his subjects' politics with words such
                    as "radical," "moderate," and "conservative."
                    Because of the prosopographic form of his narrative, perhaps, Blue chooses not to pursue a more
                    complete redefinition of these terms-a redefinition that might have shown Free Soilers and pre-Civil
                    War Republicans in a less-compromised light.</p>
            <p>Prosopography also offers its advantages. <hi rend="i">No Taint of Compromise</hi> is a pleasure to
                    read. Blue brings decades of experience to the subject and the genre; he is the author of an
                    award-winning biography of the antislavery political leader Salmon P. Chase, as well as of another
                    biography of the Conscience Whig, Charles Sumner, and a history of the Free Soil Party. The brief
                    biographies he offers in <hi rend="i">No Taint of Compromise</hi> are humane, compelling, and
                    enlightening. This text should work well for an undergraduate course on the antebellum era. By
                    bringing to light the stories of his eleven intriguing political antislavery leaders, Blue has
                    enriched our understanding of that very diverse movement, and persuasively demonstrated that it
                    cannot be simply characterized.</p>

            <p>James L. Huston has written a smart book explaining why the Civil War could not be avoided. Looking
                    closely at speeches (especially in congressional debates) and at correspondence, Huston works with
                    the actual words of the southern leaders who finally calculated that the union was less valuable to
                    them than their slaves, and who, fearing that the union would someday in some way cost them their
                    slaves, then assailed it in a war that cost them those slaves.</p>
            <p>Southern slaveowners, Huston argues, always understood property differently from northerners and
                    westerners; he redundantly demonstrates from the very words of political leaders, <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-102-2-091"/> academics, ministers and other clerical leaders, and other articulate
                    members of the antebellum elite that such property always included the right to own other humans.
                    His apt title comes from the words of one among this group, Thomas L. Cooper, once president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. Thisjeffersonian could speak eloquently about liberty, but only for white
                    people, and only in a sense that ensured their right to hold human property. For Cooper, and for
                    others like him, the union's value could be calculated in terms of its support for this
                    specific sense of liberty.</p>
            <p>Huston says early that "property rights in slaves generated the sectional
                    conflict…" (p. xiv). Underneath that cause, he explains, lay the fact that
                    "the concentration of valuable property in one region thwarted any attempt at compromise
                    and undermined the genius of democratic process" (p. xiv). Yet Huston takes pains to
                    distance himself and his thesis from any claims of principled abolitionism "at the
                    North." Instead, he carefully looks at northern political speeches, ministerial
                    pronouncements, and correspondence to show that it was the perceived "unfairness"
                    of slave labor that pushed non-slaveowning farmers off of southern land and into the border states.
                    Without showing much regard for the humanness of the afflicted human property, these once-displaced
                    farmers became "paranoid" that slaveowners would cross the old compromise border
                    lines into midwestern territory, bringing with them the same system of "unfair"
                    and unfree labor (p. 66).</p>
            <p>Indeed the only complaint this reviewer makes about the book is the incongruous labeling of northern
                    attitudes as "paranoid" and slaveowner attitudes as "hysterical"
                    after many carefully arranged tables and much carefully grounded logic to show the solid economic
                    interests underlying their opposing systems. Perhaps Huston is being doubly ironic and having fun
                    with the many historians who use such terms. My own mind runs to Avery Odelle Craven's
                    concept of "emotionalism" as a cause for the breakdown of the national
                    institutions-political, religious, and civict-hat once brokered heated but nonviolent discussions of
                    the conflicts between slaveowners and free labor advocates. For all that, my fondness for the
                    "repressible conflict" concepts of Craven, James Garfield Randall, and David
                    Herbert Donald no longer seems logical after having read Huston's brilliantly wrought
                    argument. The tables and some of the side discussions of the issues alone are worth the price of
                    admission. The volume belongs in your school's library and in your own.</p>

                                    </placeName>'s article on heroes and changing times in the December 2005
                                    issue inspires me to comment on two Miami Indian leaders who are revered among the
                                    Miami people to this day, but who are little known outside of the Miami Indian
                                    community. Camillus Bundy of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                                    </placeName> spent his life and personal resources defending Miami treaty rights. He
                                    was also a key figure in starting new tribal institutions that remain basic to the
                                    Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana. Carmen Ryan followed in Bundy's
                                    footsteps, working in the 1950s to gain claims awards from the Indian Claims
                                    Commission and to once again assert federal recognition for the Indiana Miami tribe.</p>
                        <p>Bundy, who was born in 1854, achieved full status as a Miami leader when he defended
                                    the right of tax exemption on Miami treaty land in the 1890s. After the tribe was
                                    denied federal recognition over this issue in 1897, he founded the Miami reunion in
                                    1903 as a way of bringing Miami people together. In 1923 he sponsored the beginning
                                    of today's state-chartered Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana. At the same
                                    time he fought for Miami treaty rights, selling precious and rare Indian heirlooms
                                    to finance trips to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, D.C., to meet federal officials. Bundy died in 1935, leaving behind an
                                    active tribal council fully engaged in regaining tribal rights.</p>
                        <p>Bundy's leadership inspired Carmen Ryan to devote her life to the Miami
                                    tribe. Born in 1900 in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                                    </placeName>, she worked with the leaders who incorporated the tribe as the Miami
                                    Nation in 1937. In the late 1930s, she joined the League of Nations of North
                                    American Indians, which defended the rights of many midwestern and northeastern
                                    tribes. After World War II, she became a leading figure in gaining claims awards
                                    from <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-102-2-093"/> broken treaties for the Indiana tribe,
                                    traveling to the National Archives in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to research Miami treaties and documents. After Congress paid the
                                    initial claims awards in the 1970s, she uncovered the mismanagement of millions of
                                    dollars of Miami money by private banks.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to Ryan's well-documented research, there was no doubt as to the
                                    validity of the Miami treaty of June 6, 1854, and its subsequent defense by the
                                    tribal council of the Miami Nation when the tribe petitioned for federal recognition
                                    in the 1980s. She greatly assisted me in gaining access to Indiana tribal documents
                                    that supported recognition of the Indiana Miami tribe by the federal government. She
                                    died in 1985, during the federal recognition process.</p>
                        <p>In a lengthy report made in 1991, the U.S. Department of Interior recognized the
                                    validity of the 1854 Miami treaty. Unfortunately, the Seventh District of the
                                    federal court system denied federal recognition of the tribal government (and broke
                                    the 1854 treaty) on the basis of a 1992 administrative decision of the Branch of
                                    Federal Acknowledgment within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Despite this setback,
                                    the example of these two courageous Miami leaders remains to guide the Indiana Miami
                                    tribe today. The tribal government continues in Peru, Indiana, and works with a
                                    tribal membership of more than 5,000, about half of whom live in the original tribal
