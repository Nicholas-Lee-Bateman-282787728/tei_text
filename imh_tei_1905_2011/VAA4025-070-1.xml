            <p>American presidential elections magnetically attract historians. General observations are made and
                    opinions are offered regarding the supposed voting behavior of particular groups. All too often
                    these conclusions are little more than a combination of guesswork and wishful thinking.
                    Approximately three decades ago historians began to investigate group voting behavior through
                    selected precinct analysis. The intervening years have witnessed the development and expansion of
                    valuable research techniques.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Numerous local, state, and national campaigns
                    have been investigated, but the 1860 presidential race, because of its intimate connection with the
                    national crisis, continually invites more detailed examination.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The fragmentation of political parties complicates the study of the 1860 contest. Democrats split
                    into northern and southern wings, and each branch's candidates appeared on the ballot in a
                    number of states, including Indiana. The newly <list type="footnotes">

                    entrenched Democracy, but a small group perpetuated a more conservative approach to national affairs
                    through the development of the Constitutional Union party. Thus four presidential candidates,
                    Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge, Republican Abraham
                    Lincoln, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell, confronted the American—and the
                    Hoosier—voter in 1860.</p>
            <p>In southern Indiana thousands of voters went to the polling places on November 6, 1860, to cast their
                    ballots for one of these four men. National, as well as precinct, winners and losers were well known
                    within a few days, and fortunately some township voting records are extant.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The
                    groups which supported each presidential candidate in the Hoosier state, however, are not equally
                    easily identified.</p>
            <p>Much has already been written about this era of the state's history. The earliest
                    investigation of Indiana Republicanism stressed its essentially conservative nature regarding the
                    slavery issue and its continued opposition to the candidacy of William H. Seward without ever
                    attempting to examine party membership or to determine what forces led to this streak of
                    conservatism. Several years later Kenneth M. Stampp utilized the same theme and wrote of
                    "Indiana's inherently conservative citizens." He characterized the
                    Democratic loss after a generation of tight control as a "political revolution of
                    fundamental significance," directly attributable to "accommodators"

                            for quick and accurate statistics. Presidential election returns by township for the various

            <p>An investigation of the Democratic element in the new Republican party in Indiana led Mildred Stoler
                    to conclude that Democratic insurgents in northern Indiana contributed to the 1860 Republican
                    victory. Stoler used election returns but made no attempt to determine the membership of the local
                    parties or to analyze the composition of the element which switched allegiance.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Although dealing primarily with the development of the Know Nothing group, Carl Brand also considered
                    the election of 1860 and characterized the Constitutional Union movement as a continuation of the
                    party mechanism of the American party of 1856. Support for this party dropped drastically between
                    1856 and 1860, however, and Brand assigns three fourths of the 1856 Know Nothing vote to the
                    Republicans in 1860. Brand bases his conclusions primarily on statewide leadership patterns and a
                    superficial analysis of county vote totals. No consideration is given the possibility that a shift
                    in platform emphasis between the two election years might have resulted in foreign born support for
                    the economically and politically conservative stance of the 1860 Constitutional Union group. There
                    is a distinct possibility that some Know Nothings may have opposed only foreign born Roman
                    Catholics, an antipathy easily shared by foreign born Protestants.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    gubernatorial election while Stampp feels that the "swing of the German voters to
                    Republicanism" was a significant feature of the election. A more recent account perpetuated
                    this theory by erroneously stating that "<placeName>

                    Republican." Such a comment ignores heavily German <placeName>

            <p>Who then did provide the leadership and support the various parties in the election of 1860 in

                    occupations? Were they rich or poor? Do these factors influence their
                    conservatism on the political issues of the day? Statistical analysis of sample counties
                    can help replace supposition with more definite answers. The present study examines a cross section
                    of party workers in order to demonstrate the differences or similarities between the parties
                    regarding social and economic considerations. These were the men who provided the political

            <p>The present investigation studies two groups: party workers, who comprise the local leadership corps,
                    and voters. The category of party worker includes any adult male actively supporting a specific
                    political party during the campaigns of 1858 and 1860. These were men sufficiently dedicated to the
                    cause of their party to assume responsible roles such as delegates to or presiding officers of
                    township, county, or state conventions. Local party newspapers frequently offered extensive lists of
                    members active at such meetings. To determine the nativity, age, occupation, and wealth of the party
                    workers, their names were also checked in the 1860 manuscript population schedules. The results
                    provide a social and economic profile of local party leadership.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>The electorate, or potential voters, constitutes the second group to be considered. An enumeration of

                    enumerating only adult white males. Such statistics were never published, however; and the
                    researcher must engage in a tedious, time consuming, hand count of potential voters from the census
                    records. The reward, as this study illustrates, is a more accurate and stimulating quantitative
                    investigation of the social and economic factors which may have influenced a voter's

            <p>Men of rather diverse nativities, ages, occupations, and wealth actively participated in local,
                    state, and national campaigns. Yet in its totality party leadership displayed both frequent
                    similarities and significant distinctions. Of all social factors nativity has often been isolated as
                    a critical index in determining group voting behavior. Frequently southerners are automatically
                    assumed to be Democrats, while voters of New <placeName>

                    Tables I and II dispel these overgeneralizations. It is initially surprising to find that a larger
                    percentage of Republican party workers than Democratic party workers was born in the South as
                    illustrated by Table I.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> A closer examination reveals that this occurred
                    because the Democrats depended more heavily upon the foreign born for their leadership than did the

                            at the grass roots level. Therefore the designation Democrat includes men who might have
                            supported either Douglas or Breckinridge. <placeName>

                    potential for securing leadership from southern Indiana's Yankee population was slight.
                    Excluding the Hoosier born, southerners constituted fifty-four per cent of the six sample
                    counties' native born adult males.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Furthermore, numerous members of
                    this southern born group previously supported the Whig party and were naturally drawn into
                    Republican circles.</p>
            <p>This large block of southern born Republican party workers helps to explain why southern Indiana
                    Republicanism was often conservative, why there was little sympathy for abolitionism in the area,
                    and why popular sovereignty frequently received Republican support.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> It is
                    significant, however, that the slight New <placeName>

                    most clearly demonstrates that the birthplace of native born party workers cannot be an influential
                    factor in differentiating between Democrats and Republicans or in predicting voter behavior.</p>
            <p>One outstanding difference between the leadership of the two parties is clearly apparent in Table I.

                            population census, the researcher is often struck by the fact that when an aged parent was
                            living in the home of an Indiana born adult male the birthplace of that parent was quite
                            frequently a southern state. It can thus be conjectured that residents of southern Indiana
                            had even stronger ties with the South than the actual number of southern born immigrants
                            might suggest. Since the 1860 census did not ask of every household head the place of
                            parent's birth and since every household did not of necessity include the older
                            generation, such a premise cannot be measured mathematically with any degree of accuracy,
                            but it may safely be said there is a strong tendency in this direction.</item>

            <p>Among native born groups the Constitutional Unionists in Indiana depended heavily upon southerners

                    southern Whigs who refused to coalesce with what they considered a northern oriented abolitionist

            <p>Age of the party worker is the second factor considered in this analysis of group voting behavior.
                    Conservatives are often stereotyped as being older than other political groups. Table III clearly
                    indicates that party workers for the conservative Constitutional Unionists were no older than party
                    workers in the other parties, and the closeness of the average ages of the three groups suggests
                    that age was not a distinction among the parties. Thus the lack of a distinctive age pattern is
                    another indication of the similarity of southern Indiana political leadership.</p>

            <p>In comparison to the absence of significant age differences, a study of the occupations of party
                    workers does present certain contrasts among the three political parties. In keeping with
                    Indiana's rural life style during the midnine-teenth century, Table IV shows that farmers
                    dominated Democratic and Republican councils. Skilled laborers and professionals including doctors,
                    lawyers, ministers, and teachers—were almost equally divided between the two parties. A
                    greater distinction appears between the major parties regarding the percentage of businessmen and
                    common laborers adhering to the two groups.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The Republican party, true to
                    stereotyped opinion, contained a slightly larger percentage of businessmen, while the Democrats,
                    equally in keeping with their historical image, drew more support from the laboring class. The
                    occupational profile of the Constitutional Union <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi> The classification of businessman includes such occupations as
                            banker, hotel keeper, grocer, pork merchant, cloth merchant, saloon keeper, hardware
                            merchant, confectioner, barber, editor, druggist, ship builder, etc. The classification of
                            common laborer includes such unskilled occupations as drayman, clerk, hotel attendant,
                            fisherman, etc., in addition to the general occupation of laborer. The classification of
                            skilled laborer includes such occupations as gunsmith, saddler, cabinet maker, cooper,
                            shoemaker, tailor, coppersmith, leather maker, tinner, miller, butcher, blacksmith,
                            plasterer, painter, bricklayer, printer, etc.</item>

                    <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-070-1-015"/> party differs from those of its opponents. A much smaller
                    percentage of its adherents considered themselves farmers, while a larger proportion engaged in
                    mercantile and business activities. A biographical study of several of these comparatively unknown
                    party workers would probably indicate that they were businessmen with strong commercial ties to the
                    southern states who viewed continued sectional agitation as detrimental to their economic interests.
                    In all three parties the combined farmer and businessman categories equal approximately two thirds
                    the entire party worker group. It is the ratio between these two segments, however, that provides
                    contrast. Farmers dominate the Republican and Democratic organizations, while within the
                    Constitutional Union party they are only slightly more numerous than businessmen.</p>

            <p>Occupation is an economic as well as a social factor. It not only determines an individual's
                    daily routine, it can also be an index to his wealth. Significantly, a slightly higher percentage of
                    richer businessmen and a smaller portion of poorer common laborers supported the Republican party.
                    In a more definite manner Table V illustrates wealth distribution of the party worker as a fourth
                    factor in the determination of group voting behavior.</p>
            <p>All party workers were economically grouped into three categories: those who possessed less than
                    $1,000, those who held between $1,001 and $10,000, and those who
                    had over $10,001 of personal and real property combined. Table V suggests that there was
                    a higher proportion of Democratic <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-070-1-016"/> party leaders in the lower
                    economic group, while a larger percentage of Republicans were clustered on the scale's
                    wealthier end. But more importantly, the table also indicates that a majority of both
                    parties' workers were firmly located in the middle wealth level. The suspicion that richer
                    men tend to be more conservative is upheld in Table V where a far greater proportion of
                    Constitutional Unionists are enumerated among the wealthier political leaders. It thus becomes
                    increasingly difficult to differentiate between Democrats and Republicans, for in the main they were
                    quite well balanced socially and economically. The Constitutional Unionists provide the only sharp
                    contrasts among the three parties.</p>

            <p>As revealed in Table VI, men who participated in politics were generally wealthier than the average
                    residents of their own county. There were pronounced differences in the average wealth of residents
                    of the six counties. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    </placeName>, while the rich, level farmland of Rush raised its average considerably above other

                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>'s average suggests that <placeName>

                    </placeName> could not compete as a business center with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but it should also be noted that Jefferson had a much larger rural area than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName>, which would obviously lower the county average. Nevertheless, this discrepancy between
                    counties does not detract from the fact that party workers were generally wealthier than the average
                    voter. Republicans usually outdistanced their Democratic opponents. In the three counties where
                    Constitutional Unionists could be identified, <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-070-1-017"/> members of that
                    party rose significantly above the level of the county in terms of wealth and surpassed even the
                    Republicans. An exception is <placeName>

                    President James Buchanan's administration, Senator Jesse D. Bright and Congressman William
                    H. English. While seeking to lead the party faithful in the direction of John C. Breckinridge, they
                    were continually opposed by many rank and file Democrats who frequently controlled county and local
                    conventions and who chose to support instead the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    average age of forty-two years for Breckinridge supporters is almost identical to the forty-one year
                    average age of the combined Douglas and Breckinridge party workers in all six counties surveyed in

            <p>Tables I through VIII above clearly illustrate that the Republican and Democratic parties of the six
                    sample counties in southern Indiana were dominated by leaders with a midwestern and southern
                    ancestry. It may even safely be assumed that many young midwestern born individuals in this region
                    in 1860 were the progeny of southern born immigrants. Thus both major parties have a strong southern
                    orientation in their local leadership roles. The foreign born element actively working for a
                    political group still favored the Democratic party almost three to one, while the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> element, slight as it was south of the National Road, leaned heavily toward the
                    Republicans. Party workers for the Constitutional Union organization offer a more interesting
                    contrast. They tended toward the South rather than the Midwest in their direct antecedents; they
                    included no Yankee New Englanders at all; and the foreign born element is virtually as large as that
                    enjoyed by the growing Republican party. The party workers of all three groups were basically middle
                    aged. Farmers were more important to both Democrats and Republicans than to the Constitutional
                    Unionists. In the latter group businessmen were almost as important as agrarians. Common laborers
                    were more likely to be Constitutional Unionists or Democrats than Republicans. Perhaps their
                    unskilled jobs frequently depended upon a continuation of the southern trade which they feared a
                    Republican victory might endanger. The two main parties were manned by men of moderate wealth while
                    those working for the Constitutional Union organization were more likely to be wealthier than their
                    Republican or Democratic counterparts.</p>

                    southerners; and when that group was combined with the generous support of the foreign born element,
                    the entire faction was of an average age and wealth comparable to the general level of party workers
                    in all groups studied in the six county sample. In stark contrast the native born Douglas men of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh County</region>
                    </placeName> were basically of Middle Atlantic and midwestern origins. They too enjoyed the liberal
                    support of immigrant activitists, and the entire group was both much younger and much less wealthy
                    than the average party worker in the six sample counties.</p>
            <p>No matter how diligently a few individuals may work, election results are composed of more than the
                    votes of those who actively support a political party. Party workers provided the leadership, but
                    they did not account for all the ballots which the electorate dropped into the boxes on November 6,
                    1860. Investigating local party elite is thus only one step toward understanding the composition of
                    a political party's voting strength on the grass roots level. It is not illogical to ask if
                    the voting patterns of the electorate in the townships are similar to those of the party leadership.
                    Or, turning the question around, does the party leadership truly reflect the voting manpower of the
                    group which it represents ?</p>
            <p>What determines how a man votes? Frequently such social and economic considerations as
                    birthplace and wealth are thought to have subtle influences in shaping political attitudes toward
                    ideological issues. Tables I, II, and V indicate that frequently the party leadership was not
                    subject to these influences. Can the same be said of southern Indiana's electorate in
                    1860? Since no historical document identifies the precise vote of every individual in
                    each township, the researcher must utilize another device in attempting to answer this question.</p>
            <p>A mathematical tool known as coefficients of correlation helps to demonstrate a more precise
                    relationship between two measurable variables. The method used in this study is that of Charles
                    Spearman's rank-difference formula. All of the townships in the six sample counties were
                    ranked according to percentage, as in the case of Table IX, from the most Democratic, Republican,
                    and Constitutional Unionist to the least Democratic, Republican, and Constitutional Unionist as <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-070-1-021"/> of 1860. This list was then compared mathematically with a
                    similar percentage ranking of adult males born in specific geographic regions. If the percentage
                    ranking of a specific party vote and the percentage ranking of birth in a designated geographic
                    region is identical, the coefficient of correlation would be +1.00. If the order were exactly
                    reversed (that is, if the most Democratic township had the lowest percentage of southern born adult
                    males, etc.), it would be -1.00. Rarely is the result ever so clearly defined, and the usual
                    indication is that of a positive or negative tendency.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A correlation of the 1860 township election returns with the nativities of adult males in the six
                    sample counties indicates both parallels and discrepancies in the relationship between the
                    leadership and the electorate. As was true of the party leadership, there is sometimes no definite
                    relationship between birthplace and party preference. Table IX, however, suggests several
                    significant patterns. Perhaps sensing an impending threat to their native area in the event of a
                    Republican presidential victory, the southern born inhabitants of the six sample Indiana counties
                    had a high positive correlation with the Democratic party in 1860, while southern birth alone was
                    not a determining factor in generating support for either the Republican or Constitutional Union
                    organizations. Midwesterners, in many instances probably second generation southerners, also
                    achieved a similar positive proximity to the Democratic voting pattern. Migrants from the East, that

            <p>A comparison of Tables I and IX indicates that party workers were not as closely tied to party
                    affiliation by birthplace as was the average voter. Thus, while it is not safe to categorize party
                    leadership in 1860 solely on place of birth, it is not entirely inaccurate to accept the older idea
                    that southerners did tend toward the Democratic party while Yankees leaned in the direction of the
                    Republicans. Although a sizable group of southerners may have become leaders in the southern Indiana
                    Republican organization, many rank and file natives of that section still retained a positive
                    relationship with the Democratic party. Birthplace was obviously not a strong factor in determining
                    the voting pattern of the Constitutional Unionists, nor were the immigrants perceptively motivated
                    by their foreign birth in deciding how to cast their ballots in 1860.</p>
            <p>As indicated earlier in this study the role of the foreign born, particularly the midwestern German
                    element in the election of 1860, has already generated several historical investigations. Tables I
                    and VIII show that much of the leadership of that segment of southern Indiana's population
                    was still actively working within the Democratic party. Table IX does not pretend to settle the
                    question as to whether there was a mass exodus of Germans from Democratic ranks in southern Indiana
                    in 1860. It does indicate, however, that in 1860 immigrants in these six sample counties were not
                    strongly influenced by birthplace. Rather they were apparently divided into Democrats, Republicans,
                    or Constitutional Unionists upon ideological or economic issues such as slavery, the promise of
                    homestead legislation, or economic dependence upon a peaceful continuance of the southern trade
                    pattern.</p>
            <p>Table I illustrates that a few persons of foreign birth, did actively participate in the
                    Constitutional Union party movement. The slight positive correlation (+.20) between that
                    organization and the percentage of immigrants living in a township in 1860 should be interpreted
                    with caution. It does not of necessity imply that foreigners leaned toward the successor of the
                    American party. Rather it might indicate that when immigrants were more densely concentrated, their
                    presence generated a greater dislike for them among the rest of the population, which in turn
                    registered a degree of adherence toward the party which in all probability contained the diehard
                    nativist element.</p>

            <p>Table IX illustrates a degree of positive affiliation between southern and midwestern born voters and
                    the Democratic party as a whole. Is the same relationship apparent when the potential
                    voter's birthplace is correlated with the actual support received by Douglas and
                    Breckinridge in the townships of the six sample counties? Table X shows that the
                    relationship is sustained only in regard to the candidate of the southern Democratic group. Indeed,
                    the positive degree of adherence of southern and midwestern born voters toward Breckinridge is even
                    more apparent. Obviously, southern birth and probable southern ancestry become dominant factors in
                    determining how these men voted on election day. The Douglas group, on the other hand, is much less
                    influenced by this same factor as no definite pattern emerges in a comparable degree to that of the
                    Breckinridge support. A slight negative attitude is reflected in the relationship between Douglas
                    and the southern-midwestern groups, those which strongly supported his opponent, and an equally
                    slight positive tendency of migrants from the Middle Atlantic area and from abroad is visible in
                    Table X.</p>

            <p>If birthplace is not always the dominant factor in shaping political views, is wealth of any greater
                    significance in providing a clue to the voting behavior of southern Indiana's electorate in
                    1860? Table V illustrates that wealthy party workers tended to be found more frequently
                    in the Republican or Constitutional Union party camps than in the Democratic organization, but
                    equally significant was the middle wealth level of the bulk of both Democratic and Republican
                    leadership. An investigation of the average wealth of householders and the voting patterns of the
                    townships within the six county sample underscores this finding. Table XI shows that the Republican
                    party carried the wealthiest townships in the sample counties more readily than did the Democrats,
                    and in the middle wealth group of $3,001-$10,000 they carried twice as many
                    townships as did the Democrats. Only in the poorest areas did the two parties divide the townships
                    evenly.</p>

                    Constitutional Union parties. The low positive correlation reinforces the findings of Tables V and
                    VIII that wealth was perhaps at most a minor factor in determining the party affiliation of both the
                    leadership and the electorate.</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis of both the leadership and the electorate of southern Indiana in 1860 at the
                    grass roots level provides a better understanding of the composition of the political parties and
                    voter behavior. Political councils were dominated by leaders born in southern and midwestern states.
                    Foreign born men who actively participated in political affairs worked primarily within the
                    framework of the Democratic organization. Most party workers were either farmers or businessmen, and
                    the laboring element was not strongly represented. Party leadership was basically provided by
                    moderately wealthy individuals who were normally far above the average wealth of their local area.
                    Only within the Constitutional Union party could the leadership be termed substantially wealthy.</p>
            <p>Not only did the party workers of the Democratic group come from a predominantly southern-midwestern
                    background, but adult males from this same region achieved a high mathematical correlation with the
                    same party, particularly the Breckinridge faction of the Democratic group. For these men sectional
                    orientation was probably a determining factor as they went to the polls in 1860. Although
                    approximately one fourth of the Democratic leadership was foreign born and ten per cent came from
                    the Middle Atlantic states, there was no significant correlation of either group with the Democratic
                    vote in the sample counties studied.</p>
            <p>The Republican party drew its native born party workers in almost the same proportion as did the
                    Democrats from the southern-midwestern group, but in contrast to the Democratic party the adult
                    males born in those sections achieved no positive correlation with the Republican organization. For
                    that large group of southern born males who voted Republican in 1860 the motivation to support
                    Lincoln was generated on some basis other than southern birth. While the Middle Atlantic and New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> element was almost as active in the Democratic party as in the Republican, there was a
                    much higher positive relationship of the voters of <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-070-1-026"/> these two
                    groups to the Republican party than to the Democratic organization.</p>
            <p>Thus birthplace frequently influenced the political attitudes of some voters in 1860 in the sample
                    counties of southern Indiana. The mere fact of southern birth and the influence this had in shaping
                    opinions on sectional and national issues apparently generated much support for the Democratic
                    party. In the same way migrants from the East were more inclined to view issues in the same manner
                    as did residents in their native section, and immigrants from the East favored the Lincoln ticket in
                    1860. At the same time the diverse origins of many party leaders clearly indicate that some
                    individuals were not tied to strictly sectional interests which were determined solely by
                    circumstances of their birth. Voters, too, were sometimes free of a sectional-izing influence. For
                    example, almost half the local leadership group of the Constitutional Union party was southern born;
                    yet, there was no correlation of that party's voting strength with votes of southern
                    origin.</p>
            <p>Although the Republicans may have tried hard to attract the foreign born voter in 1860, they did not
                    succeed in generating a large immigrant leadership group in their local party units in the six
                    sample counties. Perhaps, however, the measure of Republican success in wooing this group should not
                    be measured by the party workers who seemingly still preferred the Democratic party, or the
                    newspaper editors who switched to the Republican column, but rather by the fact that birthplace was
                    apparently neutralized as a factor in determining how an immigrant voted. While the foreign born
                    voter showed no positive correlation with the Republican party in 1860, there was, even more
                    significantly, no positive correlation with the Democratic party in that year, although a fairly
                    high positive correlation had existed as late as 1856.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> At least in the six
                    county sample the immigrant did not react as a German toward a particular party but rather as a
                    farmer or a businessman, or, as has often been conjectured, perhaps he voted on the basis of his
                    attitude toward the institution of slavery.</p>

            <p>This study indicates that the party leadership of the three political organizations of southern
                    Indiana in 1860 had a strong southern and midwestern orientation. It is thus not surprising that the
                    political expressions of meetings which they controlled should reflect that southern background and
                    tend toward a conservative rather than a radical stance regarding abolition, states rights, and the
                    doctrine of popular sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Several decades ago Kenneth M. Stampp claimed that "No region was more vitally interested in
                    the preservation of the Union …. The inhabitants of the river counties often felt a
                    warmer friendship toward their neighbors in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> than toward their fellow citizens in Indiana who dwelt north of the National
                        Road."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Having determined the basically similar
                    southern-midwestern background of the party leadership of southern Indiana, as well as the lack of
                    outstanding-differences in age and wealth, one may more readily see why the area has often been
                    viewed as a distinctive unit. Not only did many of the southerners in the area align themselves with
                    the Democratic party in a pattern which expressed their sectional nativity, but, of even more
                    significance, the local Republican and Constitutional Union parties were led by a southern born
                    elite. Little wonder that southern Indiana in this era was seen by many as a conservative southern
                    enclave within the framework of the northern states.</p>

            <p>On the surface <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> purports to be a purely fanci ful account about the early
                    days of the automobile—its inven tion and its manufacture—set in the mythical
                    midwesterr town of Richford, Indiana. The author attempts to give romantic and dramatic appeal to
                    the story through a ful airing of the domestic problems faced by one of the Richford automobile
                    manufacturers. The industrialist's marriage to a young girl from a working class family is
                    complicated by the incessant demands of the girl's relatives for jobs, favors and social
                    advantages. This eventually leads to a divorce and the complete disruption of communications between
                    the young woman and her importunate relations. Paterson injects an apparent aura of realism into his
                    novel through the careful use of chronology and the occasional mention of nationally known men and
                    events.</p>
            <p>In fact, <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> is more realistic than fictional. Not a true novel at all, it
                    is, rather, a close reconstruction of the history of the automobile—and some of the men

                    and such things as personal motivations and conversations, each major industrial and social
                    development in the book has its factual basis. As a result, Paterson's work is a curious

               <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> begins with a brief account of the initial test run of an automobile in
                    Indiana, considered by Paterson to be the first automobile in America. The inventor of this
                    remarkable piece of machinery is "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Howe" of "Richford, Indiana." A review of Howe's
                    background and his relationship with the natural gas industry of Indiana follows. A number of
                    factors contribute to the inescapable conclusion that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Howe is Paterson's name for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName> Haynes. The account of the invention itself parallels Haynes' actual
                    experiences with the automobile. Haynes was also employed by natural gas companies for fifteen
                    years, 1886-1901, during which time, because of the extensive travel requirements of his job, he
                    undertook the studies and experimentations which led to his first car. Moreover, Haynes enjoyed
                    throughout his lifetime a national reputation as the builder of "America's First
                    Car," and Paterson gives an identical attribution to Howe.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The initial chapter in <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> is followed by an introduction to the
                    "McDonald brothers," Alan and Donald, and the machine shop on the near south side
                    of Richford which they operate. In time their shop becomes the first automobile factory in the
                    nation. Quite clearly these characters coincide with Elmer and Edgar Apperson who operated the
                    Riverside Machine Shop in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1890s. It was the Appersons to whom Haynes had turned in 1893 when he was ready
                    to construct his vehicle, and the famous Haynes "Pioneer," a gasoline powered, one
                    cylinder marvel now on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution, was built in their machine
                    shop in 1893-1894.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Paterson narrates these developments much as they took
                    place. He then describes a joint "Howe-McDonald" manufacturing effort, which is
                    followed by separate "Howe" and "McDonald" companies, and,
                    again, there is little fiction in his account. Haynes and Apperson, after their success with the
                    "Pioneer" in 1894, formed a partnership the following year and began to produce
                    automobiles. The firm was formally incorporated as the Haynes-Apperson Company in 1898, but this
                    arrangement lasted only until 1901 when Elmer Apperson withdrew to form, with his brother, a rival
                        firm.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> When the Apperson Brothers Automobile Company was organized, Haynes
                    finally left the gas industry and took up full time work in manufacturing. Initially he operated
                    under the original corporate name, but he changed it to the Haynes Automobile Company in 1905.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An additional example of the close parallels which Paterson maintains in his book is found in his
                    account of the McDonald firm, which develops a remarkable car soon in demand throughout the country.
                    Known as the McDonald "Greyhound," it is a fast, sleek, and handsome vehicle. This
                    is an obvious reference to the Apperson "Jack Rabbit," one of the most famous and
                    popular of the early automobiles.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Similarly, <list type="footnotes">

                    closely as he describes the near simultaneous failure of both of Richford's automobile
                    companies during the 1920s. In actuality the Haynes Automobile Company closed its doors in 1925; the
                    Apperson Brothers Automobile Company, acquired by eastern investors in 1924, failed in 1926.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Although the specific reasons for failure differ, both companies in the last

                    </placeName>, particularly from Henry Ford.</p>
            <p>After the character introductions and the story of the first automobile in his early chapters,
                    Paterson begins an extended account of the courtship and marriage of Alan McDonald (Elmer Apperson).
                    Upon establishing himself in his own business, this rising young industrialist, to the astonishment
                    of his associates, rejects a girl from a prominent family in Richford and rather abruptly marries a
                    salesclerk, Hattie Sawyer. Their wedding is described in chapter VI, and the balance of the book
                    concentrates on this marriage and the difficulties McDonald has with the Sawyer family. Confronted
                    with a scheming mother-in-law, a jealous sister-in-law and her oafish husband, and a lazy and
                    dishonest brother-in-law, McDonald decides, reluctantly, to terminate the marriage. He has been
                    unable to persuade Hattie, his wife, to assume her proper role as wife and homemaker; consequently,
                    after arranging for a generous financial settlement, he sues for divorce. Some years later McDonald
                    remarries, this time a girl from <placeName>

                    least, are consistent with the facts. Apperson was indeed married twice, the second time to a

            <p>On the surface, of course, Paterson's story is not a gripping one. Its fascination lies in
                    its factual basis, with perhaps the most intriguing question of all being why was it written. Was

                    Hoosiers for a wider audience? Was it an attempt to modify the familiar story, to alter
                    subtly the accepted version? As a third alternative, was it written to expose some mildly
                    scandalous personal details about <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s automobile pioneers with the names changed as a protection against
                    lawsuits? In any event, the use of fictional names for the setting and the main figures
                    does not conceal who and what the book is about. Paterson rarely strays from the facts concerning <placeName>

                    existed, that the name was a pseudonym. For one thing, the name, Robert Paterson, could not be found

                    i.e., the 1890s through 1933. Another indication of pseudonymity was the fact that the Library of

                    author, a customary feature of these cards. On the other hand, a second and unrelated novel by
                    Paterson had been published in 1936, and there were subsequent writings by the same author.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Paterson did, of course, manufacture some of his episodes and character idiosyncracies. Although
                    Haynes' career is comparatively well known,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> the author of <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> was apparently unwilling or unable to go into the complex story of
                    Haynes' true background and his activities with the gas company, the automobile company,
                    and two metallurgical companies. Paterson contented himself instead with a highly oversimplified
                    account of the inventor's life and character. He makes him a lowly bill collector for the
                    gas company in Richford, for example, rather than the field superintendent who was in charge of many
                    of the company's major projects. Paterson also makes Howe conform to the popular view of
                    the inventor, developing to an extreme degree the dreamy, impractical, amateurish nature of the man.
                    Although this is overdone and only partially applies to Haynes, it is nevertheless a useful
                    corrective to the highly adulatory, totally uncritical interpretations of Haynes which are usually
                    found.</p>
            <p>In his book Paterson credits Howe with two outstanding contributions—the invention of the
                    automobile in America and the discovery of a miraculous new alloy called
                    "Cutalite" which provided the basis, late in life, for Howe's fortune.
                    Similar credits, of course, are attributable to Haynes.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The claim that Haynes
                    invented the automobile is, of course, exaggerated. Not only did this invention, a cumulative one

                            and soon a considerable market for it appeared. In 1920 Union Carbide Corporation paid
                            Haynes and his two partners several million dollars for their Stellite business. <placeName>

                    months. Yet it is true that Haynes throughout his lifetime was widely recognized as being the
                    American inventor of the automobile.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> This in itself is an interesting switch
                    since many inventors fail to have their work recognized until after their death. Haynes, moreover,
                    enjoyed acclaim not only for his automobile of 1893-1894 but also for his metallurgical genius which
                    yielded two remarkable alloys—stainless steel and Stellite.</p>
            <p>Stellite, Paterson's "Cutalite," is a nonferrous alloy of cobalt,
                    chromium, and tungsten which possesses incredible hardness even at elevated temperatures.
                    Extraordinarily heat, wear, and corrosion resistant, Stellite resulted from a series of experiments
                    which Haynes made in search of a stainless cutlery metal. The alloy proved unsatisfactory, because
                    of its hardness and the resultant difficulty in shaping it, for cutlery purposes, but Stellite
                    became enormously significant as a tool metal (a metal to cut other metals).<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    It virtually replaced high speed steel in the machine tool industry's severe service
                    applications and, as Paterson noted, provided the basis for Haynes' wealth during the last
                    few years of his life. The automobile, by contrast (and Paterson correctly reports this, too),
                    brought Haynes fame but not fortune.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi> In part, this recognition stemmed from the fact that the Duryea Motor

                        in America. In 1908, when the city of <placeName>

                        honor of leading the "historical section" of a 2,000 car parade down <placeName>

                        cars, one for each year of the decade. It was probably this event which convinced Haynes of the
                        great national interest in his first car and led him to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution
                        in 1910. Three years later Haynes was the main attraction with an automobile caravan tour to the
                        Pacific coast, undertaken to publicize the need for improved roads in the country. This event

                        continued his search for a stainless cutlery metal. During a series of experiments in 1911-1912,
                        he made the highly significant discovery that the proper amount of chromium added to steel
                        renders the resultant alloy stainless. Haynes eventually received a patent on his discovery in
                        1919, some years after his initial application. In the interim, however, an English
                        metallurgist, Harry Brearley, applied and obtained a similar patent on his independent discovery
                        of "rustless steel." To avoid costly litigation the Haynes and Brearley

            <p>It is in explaining Haynes' background and in describing the events that led to the
                    conception of the "Pioneer" that Paterson departs markedly from reality. In the
                    novel Howe is a gas company employee required to travel many long hours by horse drawn buggy in
                    order to collect the gas bills. In reality Haynes managed the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> gas company office for nearly ten years after he had supervised the installation of the
                    system, and had directed, between 1890 and 1892, the construction of America's first long
                    distance pipelines for the transmission of natural gas.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> It was in the course
                    of this work that Haynes' extensive travel requirements caused him to give serious thought
                    to improved overland transportation methods.</p>
            <p>Paterson, then, is quite correct in saying, as he does in the opening line of the book, that
                    "the discovery of natural gas in northern Indiana—back in the late
                    eighties—was responsible for the [Haynes] invention of the automobile."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> It is only his explanation of the precise relationship between the two events
                    that needs to be modified. Undoubtedly the same thing is true in other parts of the novel. The main
                    developments, and often a great many of the details, are scrupulously factual, but the facts have
                    been embroidered in some places, considerably oversimplified and compressed in others.</p>
            <p>It is particularly interesting to note Paterson's account of the initial cooperation between
                    Howe and the McDonald brothers, followed by their separation and eventual strong rivalry as
                    automobile manufacturers in Richford. This rivalry was stoked by highly competitive advertising

                    contributions to the building of the first car. All of this follows the facts rather closely. As
                    most automobile historians know, Haynes took his idea and drawings to the Appersons, proprietors of
                    the Riverside Machine Shop. There the "Pioneer" was constructed, during the course
                    of which some modifications were made to the original plans. The Appersons and their men were paid

                    during slack times in the shop. Subsequently Haynes and Elmer Apperson formed a partnership, and the

                    First Car," the actual trademarked slogan of the Haynes company, and hard feelings over the
                    issue were generated.</p>
            <p>These things, as indicated, were quite generally known, and it is to be expected that Paterson would
                    pick them up. What is surprising is the role assigned by Paterson to his character, Art Snelling.
                    He, as did his real life counterpart, A. G. Seiberling, serves as the general manager of both
                    automobile companies, and Paterson quite explicitly credits Snelling with developing each company
                    into successful manufacturing concerns. The Howe company flounders under Howe's personal
                    direction, but it revives and prospers after Snelling is induced to leave McDonald and take over the
                    rival firm. Similarly, the McDonald company, which gets off to a disappointingly slow start, becomes
                    an industry leader under Snelling's guidance, and its prominence continues for a few years
                    after it reverts to McDonald's control.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> This viewpoint, presented in
                    a bold, exaggerated form in the novel, appears to have considerable merit when applied to the Haynes
                    and Apperson companies. Under the rather hard driving, aggressive direction of Seiberling each
                    company was relatively prosperous and successful. When they were managed by their founders, however,
                    the results were less pleasing. Both companies failed in the mid-1920s, but by then Seiberling had
                    been dismissed from the Haynes company, an act which coincided with the scrapping of his plans for a
                    small, less expensive Haynes automobile, and the Apperson company was being operated by a syndicate

            <p>That this interpretation about the crucial role played by Seiberling was Seiberling's own is
                    not remarkable, but it lends some support to the idea that Seiberling, who lived until 1952, was
                    Paterson's source for many of the facts about the two automobile companies and their
                    officers. Certainly a great deal of what appears to be "inside" information was

                    the 1950s, and it raises the question of a similar origin for both accounts.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

               <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> has many shortcomings. As a novel it is banal and unexciting and exhibits
                    few of the techniques of successful fiction. Paterson, to quote an authority on twentieth century
                    American literature, "knew nothing at all about writing novels."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> His characters are one dimensional and scarcely believable, and the author excessively
                    utilizes the annoying practice of writing in incomplete sentences. As an historical account the book
                    is unreliable in that one never knows, without the most painstaking verification, whether an event
                    described is factual or not. Thirdly, if the book was intended in any way as an expose, it obviously
                    failed because of its obscurity. It seems that only the Duryea family in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> recognized the novel as intimately involved, at least in part, with the life and career
                    of Haynes, but the purpose which the Duryeas sought to have it serve was as ludicrous as many of the
                    scenes in the book. The Duryeas cited <hi rend="i">Gas Buggy</hi> as additional evidence that the
                    original Haynes car was faulty and that it was a laughing matter when it first appeared on the
                    streets of <placeName>

                    remains rather enigmatic, as do his motives for writing the book. Was he hired to do so?
                    Did he get most of his facts and his interpretations from one source, a not disinterested
                    one? Was it Seiberling, an Apperson relative or acquaintance, or a Duryea? On
                    another level, why has the book not been associated with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its citizens before?<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Was this the result of a
                    conscious effort? The book is difficult to locate. A copy is in the Automotive History

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

                    Library of Congress has a copy; but no others have been located in libraries in Indiana or
                    elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The book deserves better than this. For all its defects it is a factually based story which offers
                    useful hypotheses and insights into the people and events discussed. Obviously written with access
                    to information not available today in the published sources or known collections of manuscript
                    material, the novel, despite its "embroidery" of various events, has value as an
                    historical reference. In its evocation of an age and a way of life now gone and in its relation to
                    the industrial history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it has considerable merit. In addition, the book contains useful references to such
                    things as the Indiana interurban system, one "surpassed by none other in the
                        world,"<hi rend="sup">39</hi> the elections of 1912 and 1916, the mood of the Midwest

                    of the most cantankerous and stubborn men in the county. One of his six children wrote of Shuck: he

            <p>Shuck wrote the next letter only five weeks after Peter penned the one above. Again there is
                    complaint about low farm prices. Actually from 1859 to the outbreak of the war in 1861 farm prices
                    had risen steadily in Indiana. Then prices fell and remained low for several months. Recovery came
                    in 1862, and prices continued to rise for the remainder of the war. Shuck mentions selling corn for
                    twenty-five cents per bushel. This is as low as the price dropped. By 1864 corn was selling for
                    ninety-five cents per bushel, the highest figure reached during the war.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>In the first paragraph of the next letter Peter mentions money received from his brother George.
                    Since Shuck and Henry Demaree also received money about the same time, Peter is undoubtedly
                    referring to an inheritance from his father's estate.</p>
            <p>The substitutes mentioned in paragraph two were men who, for a substantial sum of money, agreed to
                    take a draftee's place in military service. Four hundred dollars was not an excessive
                    amount, however, for in some sections of the North substitutes were paid more than a thousand
                        dollars.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Then, <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">40</hi> The original purpose of substitution was to allow those in critical
                            jobs to aid the war effort by remaining at home while another took their place in the
                            service, but in reality anyone who had the resources and the desire could furnish a
                            substitute without reference to the importance of his position. At the time Peter wrote this
                            letter draft boards could exempt a man the whole term for which he was drafted if the
                            draftee would provide a substitute who was not eligible for the draft. If the substitute was
                            eligible for the draft, then the draftee's name was again placed on the rolls for
                            future calls. Eugene Converse Murdock, <hi rend="i">Patriotism Limited, 1862-1865</hi>

                    without resorting to the draft. It is doubtful that the citizens of Union Township raised
                    subscriptions so much out of patriotic enthusiasm as out of the desire to avoid sending their young
                    men to a war they did not favor. Also, by raising their quota through subscription, the citizens
                    avoided the stigma of cowardice that was sometimes attached to anyone who was drafted. That some of
                    the townships had to draft is not difficult to explain. This was the third time in six months that
                    the national government had called for additional troops. <placeName>

                    Lincoln. The state, however, gave Lincoln fifty-four per cent of its vote.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>The next letter from Shuck is interesting for the observations he makes about the end of the war,
                    Lincoln's assassination, and John Wilkes Booth. The letter also demonstrates that to a
                    farmer national events were important, but so were the spring rains and the price of land.</p>
            <p>Shuck's letter exemplifies the phonetic spelling of that era. A clear distinction was not
                    made between the "e" and "i" sounds in many words. Thus Shuck
                    wrote "sence," "ef," distroyed," and
                    "distruction." Other words, while not conforming to current spelling practices,
                    are easily recognized and make for delightful reading. Some examples are: "broak,"
                    "deth," "helth," "littel,"
                    "reddy," "rool," and "wo."</p>

            <p>The last letter from Peter Demaree is in many ways the most fascinating of the six printed here. The
                    letter and the newspaper article following it picture in a few words the attitude of the average
                    Hoosier toward blacks in 1867. One historian who has studied attitudes toward blacks during the
                    Civil War wrote that of all the midwestern states Indiana was the most conservative by far. The
                    racial situation did change somewhat after the war when the Indiana Supreme Court declared null and
                    void the provisions of the Indiana Constitution which excluded blacks from entering the state and
                    when the state legislature modified the law which excluded blacks from testifying in court.
                    Nevertheless, many Indiana communities strongly discouraged blacks from settling in their midst, and
                    it continued to be unlawful for black children to <list type="footnotes">

                    charge after implicating three men named Patterson, Simmons, and Hatchell. Patterson and Hatchell

            <p rend="center">Black or White</p>
            <p>MR. EDITOR:—It is very natural for persons to look and see who will take the lead in new
                    things, and who is willing to condesend to teach the colored children in our midst. There is a
                    blooming maid of some 25 summers, living in Union township, by the name of Miss N. S….
                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], who has publicly expressed her willingness to teach the young <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-070-1-072"/> negroes of this or some other county, provided she can get the
                    dimes for her services when rendered, and says some one has this NOBLE OFFICE to fill, and expresses
                    her entire willingness to teach and associate with the loyal "Americans of African
                    descent." "She has had some experience in teaching the white children of this
                    vicinity, and no doubt she would do well teaching the MORE NOBLE RACE," and thus advance
                    the reputation of the poor white children whom she has taught in days gone by and make the hearts of
                    those poor parents rejoice to know that the minds of their children have been directed onward and
                    upward. Would not some young and dashing youth do well to call at her father's house and
                    see this fair and lovely maid, who has such a good heart, and try to pursuade her to cast her lot
                    with his and travel life's weary journey together. It might not be amiss for some young
                    gentleman of color to give her a call; he would no doubt receive a cordial welcome, and the
                    "twain might be made one flesh," and bring into existance something more grand,
                    more noble and more sublime than has ever yet graced our neighborhood.</p>

                    likely quit in disgust.</p>
            <p>The six letters printed here reveal an interesting change in the attitudes of two northern Democrats
                    during the era of the Civil War. In the first letter Shuck is nearly ecstatic as he brags that the
                    Democrats have outsmarted the Republicans in the 1856 elections. The war, however, changed that
                    attitude abruptly. No expression of triumph, no sense of bragging are seen in the letters of the
                    1860s. Both Peter and Shuck cry out against the futility of the war in 1861. By 1864 Peter exhibits
                    a feeling of political frustration and hopelessness. Instead of lauding the Democrats he laments
                    that the Republicans have probably won again in Indiana and that no one the Democrats nominate can
                    defeat Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Shuck and Peter were never stalwart supporters of the war or of Lincoln's administration. It
                    is not surprising then to find in Shuck's 1865 letter no attitude of vindictiveness. No
                    "bloody-shirt" phrases come from his pen. Instead the former Kentuckian expresses
                    fear and concern for the fate of defeated southerners. He had not agreed with their secessionist
                    stand, and he had not supported them in the conflict that followed; but he fears that their
                    punishment will be greater than their crime. And 1867 finds Peter, a Hoosier who had signed slave
                    deeds less than ten years earlier,<hi rend="sup">62</hi> in the midst of postwar difficulties
                    relating to social equality of the blacks. Such difficulties were not unusual for residents of
                    Indiana in the post-Civil War era, nor have they been completely resolved today.</p>

            <p>Jennie Starks McKee views the battles of the Civil War as "the last fragments of any
                    romanticism in mass conflict and to an extent the last of any real glorification of war"
                    (p. 1). To her this romance and glory may be seen in the acts and words of its great humanitarian
                    leaders, Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee; but similar qualities may also be found in thousands of
                    common soldiers whose struggle was not in vain. These obscure heroes display inspiration,
                    discipline, dignity, and assurance in the words they left behind. Such a man was Leander Starks,
                    both the inspiration for and the subject of this volume.</p>
            <p>Starks, an Indiana private in the Hoosier brigade commanded by John T. Wilder, spent nearly three
                    years in the army. The bulk of the book consists of 110 letters he wrote to his young wife in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and fifty-eight she sent to him. He saw little military action so there are
                    few striking or macabre accounts of warfare. Indeed, he tends to dismiss what action he did see with
                    a brief statement or two. But be not misled; the Starks letters are rich indeed. They are full of
                    anecdotes about the common soldier and glimpses of camp life. The reader is not apt to forget
                    Starks' description of trying to sleep on a wooden rail in the mud, battling a large army
                    of bedbugs with an ax, or viewing the remains of a year old battlefield.</p>
            <p>The Indiana private frequently mixes humor and vivid detail, as he does in his account of his first
                    sight of the beautiful women of East Tennesse. "Oh ye Gods what a beauty, a girl apparently
                    16 years of age standing as straight and graceful as a lamp post with her beautiful brown hair
                    hanging down over a face exquisitely daubed with dirt and grease and teeth wonderfully stained with
                    tobacco and the corners of her mouth looked as though they were used for waste gats to let the
                    tobacco juice escape" (pp. 121-22). Starks also reveals much about himself. He becomes
                    thoroughly bored by routine camp life, especially the frequent inspections. He longs for combat. He
                    is bitter about those men who remained at home instead of joining the fight. He often complains
                    about the hardships of being in the army but at <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-070-1-077"/> one point admits
                    that he really loves the wild, dashing life of a soldier.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Part I of this volume is not as outstanding as the Starks letters. The first section,
                    written by McKee, consists of brief accounts of such varied topics as the Wilder Battery, the
                    Lightning Brigade, and the cavalry of 1861. The research is spotty with too much reliance on Francis
                    T. Miller's <hi rend="i">Photographic History of the Civil War</hi> and no reference to <hi rend="i">War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and
                        Confederate Armies.</hi> The treatment is so sketchy that few will find much value in this
                    section; yet, if the reader will skim through Part I quickly, Part II, the Starks letters, will
                    bring ample reward.</p>

                    </placeName>: Purdue University Studies, 1973. Pp. xi, 251. Illustrations, notes, index.
                    $9.75.)</head>
            <p>When George Ade died in 1944, he and his huge literary production could soon have been forgotten
                    because much of his work, such as his fables, could be considered dated. But despite his breezy and
                    often slangy portrayal of a different era, interest in Ade has continued in several forms. The
                    present book is an example of that interest, and in making available for the first time a good
                    selection of his letters it fills a gap in Adeana.</p>
            <p>Ade was a voluminous letter writer, sometimes writing or dictating thirty letters a week, but through
                    modesty or a desire for privacy he kept few carbons of these letters; thus, the editor had to
                    collect them from many sources. From the thousands of extant Ade letters 182 are printed here along
                    with ample footnotes giving sufficient background material, sometimes even including an excerpt from
                    another Ade letter. As the editor says, "the primary concern has been to include letters of
                    biographical, literary, and historical interest" (p. 12).</p>
            <p>The book contains a foreword by Paul Fatout and a short autobiography of Ade. An introduction,
                    although it does not contain a full biography of Ade, describes the man and his work effectively
                    from his early days of journalistic writing during the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Renaissance through his period <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-070-1-078"/> as one of the
                    leading American dramatists to the time when he established his headquarters at his famous country
                    estate, Hazelden, near Brook, Indiana. Ade never claimed to be an entertainer or humorist but rather
                    a realist; and although he was at home anywhere and though he was a friend of actors, authors, and
                    other great men and women, he remained at heart a reserved, rather shy, small town Hoosier.</p>
            <p>The letters are arranged by date into four groups—1894-1910, 1910-1920, 1920-1930,
                    1930-1944—and are written from many places, although the majority were composed at
                    Hazelden. The recipients include particularly Ade's friends and many of the famous of his
                    era: James Whitcomb Riley, John T. McCutcheon, William Howard Taft, Will Hays, several governors of
                    Indiana, Charles G. Dawes, Grantland Rice, Franklin P. Adams, Hamlin Garland, William Allen White,
                    George M. Cohan, Theodore Roosevelt, and Claude G. Bowers. Subjects of the letters disclose the
                    serious Ade more often than the satirical, fun loving writer of fables and smash <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> hits. They cover such items as arrangements for writing or publishing, much about
                    politics (he was a Republican, later a member of the Progressive party), many aspects of his alma
                    mater (Purdue University), the filming of his fables, favorable remarks about the work of other
                    authors, how to write, Prohibition (which he disliked), and Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal
                    (which he opposed).</p>
            <p>What these letters indicate is that although Ade was a humorous satirist in much of his writing,
                    still he was modest, kind, sincere, much concerned about the civilization of his day, and more
                    serious, lonely, and complex than is generally realized. They give an excellent insight into
                    contemporary culture and problems and provide enjoyment to the student not only of Ade but of the
                    era.</p>

                    lists of schedules (p. 64), curricula offered (p. 99), and musical compositions performed (p. 34);
                    and biographical material on early trustees, superintendents, principals, and teachers. Only the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> blind school is covered in such detail; similar schools elsewhere in the country are
                    only mentioned to prove that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was first, second, or third in introducing some new program or innovation. Other <placeName>

                    </placeName> institutions are rarely mentioned, although the state lumped its institutions for the
                    dependent and delinquent under one advisory board. Even the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> shelter facility for the blind receives little attention. As a result the blind school
                    frequently appears to be developing in a vacuum. For example, the author disposes of Frederick H.
                    Wines, a key person in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> state social agencies for thirty years, as "an aggressive and efficient clerk
                    or secretary" who made organizational and financial recommendations regarding the blind
                    school to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Board of Charities. These recommendations "were generally sensible and
                    progressive" (p. 39). Despite this provincialism and despite excessive amounts of textual
                    material which would have been better placed in appendices, the volume does offer some useful data
                    and a few interesting sections such as those throughout the book on the printing of reading and
                    music materials for the blind and the role of professional music training for the blind during the
                    nineteenth century. Also informative is chapter four on Frank Hall, the developer of the braille
                    typewriter. In addition, Hendrickson points out interesting parallels in education for the sighted
                    and for the blind child in terms of changing curricula, physical education, regimentation,
                    recreation, and sex education which should interest students of the history of American education.</p>
            <p>A number of omissions seriously mar the book. The actual number of blind students involved in
                    professional music training and their activities after leaving the school are not discussed. In
                    fact, despite all the lists, the author fails to include a table with even rough approximations on a
                    year by year basis of the number of students at the school. An especially strange omission is
                    Hendrickson's failure to mention seeing eye dogs, though a fairly lengthy discussion of
                    cane training is included. It is as if no blind person ever used a seeing eye dog. Finally and most
                    damning, however, is that the book has no index and no footnotes, although a fully annotated <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-070-1-080"/> typescript is available in the Historical Room at the school and
                    may be seen with the permission of the superintendent.</p>
            <p>These problems should not deter readers vitally interested in institutions for the blind or education
                    in general from consulting the book. The provincialism, the lack of footnotes and index, and the
                    author's style, however, create problems too serious and annoying to warrant use of this
                    book by a wider audience.</p>

            <p>This volume comprises a welcome addition to the growing literature on the history of black urban
                    communities. Based in part on sociological theory, the book describes the experience of blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> before the massive inner city ghetto of the twentieth century took shape. The story is
                    grim. Deprived of political and legal rights and subjected to mob assaults by whites as well as to
                    social and economic discrimination in the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> by 1910 had won the vote and gained some constitutional victories—including
                    a fight to desegregate the schools—but remained, de facto, a separate and distinct group
                    at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale. By that date, moreover, the rise of Hazen Pingree and the
                    adoption of the direct primary eroded the political power within the Republican party which had
                    provided many blacks in the 1870s and 1880s a measure of economic security, an outlet for their
                    aspirations to leadership, and a chance, for once, to be on the winning side. And in 1900, as in
                    1840, most blacks lived in overwhelmingly Afro-American neighborhoods, though the intensity of
                    residential segregation remained below the high levels it reached in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other cities during the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The book is solidly researched. Katzman rummaged through and analyzed a broad range of sources
                    including <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-070-1-081"/> manuscript and published census returns, newspapers,
                    tax lists, city directories, novels, government records, court reports, and sociological literature.
                    The result is an illuminating and important book containing fresh insights. The elite of the
                    midnineteenth century black community, Katzman notes, came from the urban South, notably the cities
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and his evidence suggests that the "new" black middle class which
                    led the community around the turn of the century also came out of southern urban backgrounds.
                    Katzman, in addition, argues that black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> before the ghetto was not a cohesive community but a community divided by class and
                    religious distinctions and conflict.</p>
            <p>Finally, Katzman's account of black-white relationships is one of the first by an historian
                    to rest upon the systematic application of the concept of caste. Though some readers may feel that
                    the author pushes it too hard, the use of caste combined with the analysis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s shifting socioeconomic and population structure should assist in putting to
                    rest the immigrant analogue, the myth that blacks represent merely another in a series of immigrants
                    to urban America bound by the working of natural social and economic forces for assimilation into
                    metropolitan society. Ironically, however, Katzman suggests (p. 210) that if blacks had only
                    responded with the ethnocentric self defense of cooperation and communalism which allegedly
                    characterized white immigrants, things might have turned out differently. Blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> may, indeed, have been too thoroughly imbued with the American middle class traits of
                    self reliance, individualism, and independence. But separatism for blacks, that is, acquiescence in
                    caste status, scarcely seems an effective tactic to undermine the barriers of caste. After, as well
                    as before, the ghetto the problem of race (or caste) remained, and remains, essentially a white
                    creation, and its destruction requires enlightened and cooperative efforts by leaders of both races.
                    Regardless of one's view on that issue, however, this study is solidly researched, well
                    documented, ably organized, provocative, and, on the whole, a well written monograph. It deserves
                    the attention of all serious students of American history and society and broad dissemination among
                    the audience of informed and intelligent readers.</p>

            <p>The manuscript collections and their guides are impressive, the monographic materials are well known,
                    the publications of its vigorous state historical society are outstanding, the bibliographic
                    coverage of its history is extensive, and its eminent historians have always ranked high in
                    professional circles. Surprisingly, however, <placeName>

                    </placeName> has gone too long without a modern multivolumed history to match the potential of these
                    factors. That omission will soon be corrected under the imprint of the State Historical Society of <placeName>

            <p>Unfortunately the series is launched with an apparent imbalance. Whereas the successive five volumes
                    will each deal with periods ranging from twenty to twenty-five years, this one is concerned with two
                    and a half centuries. Further, since the "intensive treatment" is reserved for the
                    "later years," this is "basically a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> from 1815 to 1848, preceded by a survey of the years leading up to 1815" (p.
                    vii). Those who wish more than the "general treatment" accorded the French,
                    English, and early American periods are referred to the <hi rend="i">1925</hi> and <hi rend="i">1935</hi> studies of Louise Phelps Kellogg.</p>
            <p>In the land of the Maskoutens, or MesKousing, the War of 1812 ended the domination of the British who
                    left it much as they had found it, "essentially a vast commercial enterprise controlled by
                    Montreal traders" (p. 93). From then until midcentury John Jacob Astor and his successors
                    dominated the receding fur frontier with a "melee of experimentation, misunderstanding,
                    disappointment, rivalry, and strife" (p. 97).</p>

                    author's portrayal of the evolution of government in this period is an excellent account.
                    Her study of money and banking is particularly good. Her examination of public land, internal
                    improvements, and demographic matters are expertly presented. From the standpoint of documentation
                    the volume is an important reference work. The footnotes and the forty-seven page bibliographic
                    essay contain a wealth of information and citations on every aspect of prestatehood <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The author is well aware that state history has significance when placed in its larger contexts;
                    sometimes, however, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> is not significantly involved, and the contexts become the ends in themselves.
                    Personalities play a major role in these pages; but frequently the great detail makes the account
                    too biographical at the expense of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> story itself. There are several good maps, but the amount of geographic place name
                    detail in the text will lose the reader who is only generally familiar with the state. Finally, even
                    the casual reader will note the author's penchant for the conjectural conclusion, the
                    frequent use of such qualifiers as probably, perhaps, apparently, it may be surmised, and there may
                    have been. These factors detract, but they do not lessen the contribution which the volume makes.</p>

                    forty years ago. Though the perspective is from the point of view of the colonial participants, the
                    story comes through in the same dispassionate and balanced way. <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-070-1-084"/>
                    Leach, professor of history at Vanderbilt University, has himself written earlier, more specialized
                    studies on King Philip's War and on the northern colonial frontier from 1608 to 1763.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Arms for Empire</hi> spells out the differences between colonies and mother country in
                    meeting the continuing threat to security on the frontier—whether at the hands of
                    European rivals or Indians—and it brings out again the differences among the colonies
                    themselves. Above all it provides a full, integrated account free of romanticizing and with
                    attention to details—even the gory details—of the colonial wars.</p>
            <p>At the very outset, in the opening statement of the preface, Leach makes clear his approach to
                    military history: "The time is long past when armed conflict may be presented to serious,
                    sensitive readers as a kind of glorious adventure…. But the history of armed conflict
                    should not be ignored, for it has been a tremendously determinative part of human
                    experience" (p. xi). The colonials themselves often looked forward to their military
                    adventures with gusto, but more often they were sobered by the fire, destruction, and loss of life.
                    Retribution took the form of massacres on both sides. Quests for booty turned more often into loss
                    than gain.</p>
            <p>If one reads very long at one sitting, interest becomes dulled in repetitiousness. But this is less
                    the fault of the author's style than of the nature of the events themselves. All the
                    familiar figures of the colonial wars are subject to reexamination and reevaluation with a
                    refreshing balance and consideration. Edward Braddock, it appears, was not as bad as is usually
                    assumed, and James Wolfe and the Marquis de Montcalm were not so great. Leach relies upon printed
                    documents and secondary works, but extensive research in such sources is sufficient to form a sound
                    basis for and to establish the authority of this book. It is well done, and it will serve well its
                    purpose. One might wish for a concluding essay to draw all the strings together in an interpretative
                    analysis, but much of this comes through at appropriate places in the narrative.</p>

            <p>Professor Sheehan maintains that other scholars writing about Indian-white relations have neglected
                    to investigate "how the white American's conception of himself and his position on
                    the continent formed his perception of the Indian and directed his selection of policy toward the
                    native tribes" (p. ix). The author also argues that by bringing "together the
                    worlds of thought and actions" of the Jeffersonians he illustrates more clearly how ideas
                    and attitudes contribute to the making of an historical policy—in this case a policy
                    toward the Indians. Because "the Jeffersonian generation believed privately what it said
                    publicly" (p. 281), Sheehan uses for his study a wide range of historical sources which
                    include the writings and correspondence of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Benjamin Rush, Albert Gallatin, William Henry Harrison, Thomas L. McKenney, and a host
                    of others. He also surveys natural histories, travel accounts, and captivity narratives from which
                    the Jeffersonians derived their information about Indian society. Unlike many intellectual
                    historians who prefer to rely heavily upon published sources, Sheehan utilizes the voluminous
                    Records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to evaluate Jeffersonian Indian policy.</p>
            <p>In common with most men of the Enlightenment, Jefferson believed that the manners and mores of humans
                    were acquired environmentally. Since the unity of man was indisputable and the Indian was innately
                    the equal of white men, the environment contained the possibility of producing cultural change among
                    Indians. Jefferson believed that by altering how the Indians lived, worked, and thought, white
                    society could transform them into men who could benefit from civilized life and who could be
                    incorporated into the white community. Painstakingly, the Jeffersonians demonstrated that the
                    American Indian shared a common origin with other races of man. They denounced the Comte de Buffon
                    and his school who condemned the western hemisphere and its inhabitants to an inferior ranking in
                    the scale of civilization. But by viewing the Indian as a noble savage living in the <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-070-1-086"/> pastoral paradise of the New World, the Jeffersonians created a myth
                    which could never become reality. In judgment Sheehan writes: "Paradise never materialized,
                    and rather than becoming- civilized, the Indian seemed to disintegrate. The white man not only
                    killed the Indian, he killed the noble savage—in a sense nature itself—and
                    this was a crime for which there could be no expiation" (p. 116).</p>
            <p>Until the 1820s the Jeffersonians desired to incorporate Indians into white society east of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. Indian culture, however, did not progress; rather it
                    crumbled and decayed. Incorporation was, therefore, replaced by the removal policy in the hope that
                    by isolating the Indian far beyond the degrading and destructive influences of the frontier he could
                    be civilized through the efforts of missionaries, teachers, and vocational instructors. Frontiersmen
                    and Indians clashed with such ferocious violence that reconciliation seemed impossible and removal
                    westward, at least, would delay the utter annihilation of the Indian people. Sheehan, however,
                    acutely concludes: "If the frontiersmen adopted the direct method of murdering Indians,
                    humanitarians were only more circumspect in demanding cultural suicide of the tribes" (p.
                    277).</p>
            <p>Present day philanthropists and humanitarians are as puzzled and disturbed as were the Jeffersonians
                    by the Indians' reluctance to incorporate or assimilate into the world of the white man.
                    Neither now nor in the days of Jefferson has western man readily accepted the premise that cultures
                    different from his own contain much virtue or validity. The reviewer commends <hi rend="i">Seeds of

            <p>Until recently, prejudiced accounts by patriot writers and historians who emulate them have
                    perpetuated a distorted view of those Americans who supported Britain during <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-070-1-087"/> the War of the Revolution: the unethical, affluent tory; the
                    unscrupulous, unprincipled traitor to his country. And even more recently, scholars, by examining
                    those loyalists who migrated to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, have concentrated on the wealthy, the large merchants, the great landholders, the
                    royal officials, and the Anglican clergymen. By implication such treatment has led to a view of the
                    tories as an unrepresentative, foreign element thrown off from the main body of American society. By
                    presenting a wide range of documents, Crary makes clear that the loyalists were much more
                    representative of American society than has hitherto been thought. Generalizations about the social
                    and economic status of the loyalists are dangerous in view of the documentation she presents. They
                    came from all walks of life and from all economic and social levels. Although concentrated in some
                    regions, they were to be found everywhere.</p>
            <p>Different degrees of loyalism also make identification difficult and numerical assessment impossible.
                    Highly personal factors, some psychological and emotional, often determined men's behavior.
                    Some were overtly committed; they may have represented twenty per cent of the white families. Others
                    were covert in their loyalty while many were uncertain, vacillating, or neutral. Looking at the
                    American population as a whole, one would agree with Crary that generalizations are impossible, but
                    it might be revealing to relate the decisions of loyalists to the peculiar matrix or social,
                    economic, and political configuration in each colony at the outbreak of hostilities. For example, to
                    say that one cannot generalize about the Scotch Irish Presbyterian is true, but nonetheless one can
                    note that those in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> backcountry behaved in a markedly different way than those in the interior <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> counties.</p>
            <p>It is a tribute to Crary that these documents, notes, and narrative constitute the best work on the
                    loyalists presented to date. She has found documents which depict the tory experience mainly through
                    the lives of little known people who in some instances paid a greater price for their commitment
                    than the eighty thousand or more who were able to leave the country. And it was the experience of
                    obscure men, women, and children vividly depicted in these documents which leads one to conclude
                    that the patriots were hardly as scrupulous for individual rights as has been claimed.</p>

            <p>The Free Soil party, the history of which covers the years from 1848 to 1854 (in 1852 it was known as
                    the Free Democratic party), may well have been the most important third party in American history.
                    It provided the issues and the nucleus around which the Republican party was formed and thus played
                    an important role in the coming of the Civil War. Professor Blue's study is the first
                    history of the party as a national institution through the entire six years of its existence. The
                    book is a major contribution.</p>
            <p>Pointing out that the party never concerned itself with grass roots issues, Blue addresses himself
                    primarily to the party's leadership. This leads him into the complicated politics of
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the three states where the party was strongest. The disenchantment of the Barnburners
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> with the James K. Polk administration provided the Free Soilers with the candidate of
                    1848, Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren, as well as an established political organization that greatly strengthened the
                    movement politically. Blue concludes that the Barnburners were mainly concerned with punishing their
                    Hunker opponents and taking their revenge on Polk. The alacrity with which they abandoned the Free
                    Soilers and patched up their differences with the Hunkers in 1852, when there was a prospect of a
                    national Democratic victory, lends much credence to this interpretation.</p>
            <p>The efforts toward a coalition of Free Soilers and Democrats in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, led by Henry Wilson and Salmon P. Chase, are also given a detailed and lucid analysis.
                    Neither Wilson nor Chase comes off very well as a dedicated antislavery man using political means to
                    achieve reform goals. This juxtaposition of reformism and political opportunism and ambition is one
                    of the major themes of the book, and Blue finds as much of one as the other among Free Soil leaders.
                    Nor were the Free Soilers free from the racism that was widespread in midnineteenth century America.
                    Many of them were uncomfortable in the presence of blacks, as were blacks in their company. To a
                    considerable extent the old Liberty party of the early 1840s was absorbed into the Free Soil party;
                    but a fragment of it, the Liberty League, <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-070-1-089"/> maintained its own
                    organization, one which was not satisfied with the watered down abolitionism of the Free Soilers and
                    was always open to black membership and participation. To recognize the presence of racism among the
                    Free Soilers is not to demean them or to underestimate their commitments or their achievements.
                    Rather it is to humanize them and to recognize some of the unsavory attitudes and values of American
                    society of that era, attitudes and values shared by reformers and nonreformers alike.</p>
            <p>While Blue's study is an admirable political monograph, it might have been enriched somewhat
                    if the author had considered more fully the milieu of American society in the midnineteenth century,
                    especially that of romantic reform. And because this is largely a study of leadership, Blue might
                    have searched more deeply for the roots of the moral commitments and the ambitions of these very
                    interesting men. Where did they stand, for instance, on reforms other than antislavery?
                    How did they react to the land reform movement? How and to what extent were they
                    influenced by their religious experiences and by the changing patterns of religious
                    thought? This is not to suggest, however, that the book is flawed by any serious
                    omissions. The task that the author proposes he does exceedingly well. He has written a scholarly
                    book based on thorough research, one that cannot be overlooked by those in search of enlightenment
                    on the political side of the antislavery movement.</p>

            <p>This attractive little book covers the last year of Ulysses S. Grant's life, when he raced
                    against cancer to complete his memoirs. The author discusses the manner in which Grant wrote, and
                    the details of publication, with considerable attention to the ambitions of the people around the
                    former President. Mark Twain and Adam Badeau make familiar <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-070-1-090"/>
                    appearances, but Frederick Grant emerges as a significant factor in his father's affairs.
                    The author does not treat Grant's illness in much detail. This could have been a
                    fascinating study of how doctors treated a famous patient in the nineteenth century. As a former
                    National Park historian Pitkin is also interested in efforts to make a national shrine of the
                    cottage at Mount McGregor, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where Grant died.</p>
            <p>Despite some gaps in coverage the book captures much of Grant's personal attractiveness and
                    shows again what a potent symbol he was for many Americans. The book also suggests the need for more
                    detailed studies of many aspects of his career. The time has surely come, for instance, for a
                    genuine full length biography based on a careful reading of all sources. Detailed studies of the
                    administration, especially of party politics, would alter many stereotypes. This book is a good
                    beginning for understanding something of the man. The President awaits his historians.</p>

            <p>The Taft family has been fortunate in its choice of biographers. In the 1930s the family selected
                    Henry Pringle as the "authorized" biographer of President William Howard Taft. The
                    result, published in two volumes in 1939, remains the fullest treatment of the twenty-seventh
                    President. In 1967 the Tafts turned to James T. Patterson, historian and author of <hi rend="i">Congressional Conservatism and the New Deal</hi> (1967) and <hi rend="i">The New Deal and the
                        States</hi> (1969) to produce the biography of Senator Robert A. Taft. The result is <hi rend="i">Mr. Republican</hi>, a judicious, well written, thoroughly researched study, which,
                    despite Patterson's disclaimer, is as nearly definitive as any biography can be. In
                    addition, reflecting the profession's current interest in psychohistory, the author
                    occasionally and cautiously probes Taft's psyche.</p>
            <p>For the first time Taft's political philosophy emerges clearly. No longer may detractors
                    label him a cold reactionary, <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-070-1-091"/> an apologist for big business, or
                    a hopeless isolationist. Taft disliked big capitalists, especially those on the eastern seaboard
                    and, like his father, warmly supported a little trust-busting now and then. He upheld
                    labor's right to strike, although labor unions caused him some uneasiness. Suspicious of
                    Dig government as well as of big business, he nonetheless endorsed social security, public housing,
                    federal aid to education, a minimum wage, and a strong presidency. Indeed, after reading
                    Patterson's volume, one reviewer concluded that Taft was above all a Populist, an
                    identification that would probably distress both the Tafts and the Populists.</p>
            <p>If Taft's views on domestic policy seem clear and consistent, the same is not true of his
                    foreign policy positions. As Patterson observes, Taft could not reconcile his criticisms of Soviet
                    behavior with his stand against NATO. In denouncing Harry Truman's foreign policies in
                    Asia, Taft not only contradicted himself but also found it impossible to develop and articulate
                    persuasive alternatives. Foreign policy was simply not his forte.</p>
            <p>Patterson's <hi rend="i">Mr. Republican</hi> permits few criticisms. The book is
                    occasionally repetitious, especially in analyses of Taft's personality. Technically, it is
                    not true that the child labor amendment of 1924 "died" when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> became "the thirteenth state to reject it" (p. 100). And several
                    scholars would dispute Patterson's contention that the "bosses" in the
                    "infamous smoke-filled rooms" dictated the choice of Warren G. Harding in the
                    Republican convention of 1920 as well as his conclusion that "few conventions in American
                    history have displayed such coldblooded unconcern for quality" (p. 87).</p>
            <p>Finally, if Patterson dispels many of the unflattering myths about Taft, he also exposes some of the
                    senator's less attractive characteristics. Taft was a chronic redbaiter, arguing as early
                    as 1936 that "if Roosevelt is not a Communist today, he is bound to become one"
                    (p. 156), and nearly every election year saw him pack the red bogey in his campaign baggage. This is
                    the dislikable Taft, for redbaiting has to be the greatest red herring in American politics in the
                    twentieth century.</p>

            <p>Roderick Floud, an assistant lecturer in economic history at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, has added another volume to the fast growing group of quantitative methods
                    "cookbooks" for historians. His volume presents some attractive features.
                    Comparatively, it is inexpensive and brief. It is also relatively free of errors. Professor Floud
                    writes well and is a good explainer. He employs historical examples throughout, and his chapter six,
                    "The Analysis of Time Series," is an unusually strong treatment.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the volume contains serious drawbacks for historians seeking an introduction to
                    quantitative methods. The principal one surrounds Floud's pronouncement on ordinal data (p.
                    43): "ordinal data are rarely encountered in historical work, and it is therefore
                    unnecessary to consider examples of them at length." Later (p. 128), he retreats from this
                    stand somewhat: "It should be noted, however, that it is sometimes sensible to make use of
                    methods suitable for ordinal data, when the data are apparently of interval type, but when one has
                    some doubts about them." He ignores the frequent occurrence where the few variables that
                    are of interval level are grouped to ordinal to enable a cross classification analysis with the
                    remainder that are nominal or ordinal. His view on the infrequency of ordinal data accounts for the
                    omission of any general discussion of non-parametric statistics and, in this reviewer's
                    opinion, seriously compromises the volume's usefulness for the beginner in the field.</p>
            <p>The other shortcomings of the volume are less fundamental but also detract from its usefulness. One
                    suspects that his last chapter, "Computers and Data Processing Equipment,"
                    reflects less on Floud's knowledge of the subject than it does on the contrasts between
                    data processing environments here and abroad. Simply, by the standards of most state universities in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, his description of data processing is ten years behind the times. There is no mention,
                    for instance, of the modern social data analysis systems such as SPSS, DATA-TEXT, OSIRIS II, P-STAT,
                    etc., which have so facilitated data handling and analysis in recent years. <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-070-1-093"/> Finally, some may find several aspects of the volume's
                    organization somewhat peculiar. A discussion of samples and populations is delayed to the next to
                    last chapter. Also saved for this late chapter, titled "The Problem of Imperfect
                    Data," is a brief treatment of theory and models. Organization is a matter of individual
                    preferment, but rarely will the historian encounter problems of theory, sampling, and imperfect data
                    late in his analysis. In sum, there are better books for the beginner in this area.</p>

                    Niblack's reminiscences treat of varied facets of his life and many topics concerning
                    Indiana developments and episodes for the past several decades. His observations about items
                    covered, as his pronouncements through the years, will doubtless elicit varying degrees of approval
                    and disapproval. His earthy and unusually frank portrayal of boyhood days in rural <placeName>

                    </placeName> is useful in reconstructing rural life in the early decades of this century. His
                    considerable discussion of Indiana politics in the 1920s is helpful to those attempting to interpret
                    such politics, particularly the disgraceful swath cut therein by David C. Stephenson. One gets the
                    impression that Niblack knows more than he can document about this unsavory chapter, but as a judge
                    he would presumably agree that his evidence and assertions must be weighed against those of others
                    before a verdict is reached. <hi rend="i">The Life and Times of a Hoosier Judge</hi> may be obtained

                    the years ahead" (p. 1). From wartime beginnings in 1941 to 1973 when Indiana University

                    and facilities at this southeastern regional campus of Indiana University. "Indiana
                    University Southeast," he writes, "has not developed and is not existing in a
                    vacuum" (p. 1); thus, he endeavors to place the school not only in the context of a rapidly
                    growing Indiana University in general and a rapidly developing university extension program in
                    particular but also to describe it in terms of the general background of national and world events
                    from 1900 to 1973. Numerous appendices provide further administrative and financial details and
                    interesting statistical profiles of faculty and students. In his prologue Haffner admits that
                    objectivity is a source of worry for any writer of local or institutional history. Although he may
                    not have achieved the degree of objectivity he desired and although his pride in Indiana University
                    Southeast is readily apparent, he has pieced together a "brief, informal history"
                    which "reflects and emphasizes institutional development; relates the problems faced by
                    administrators, faculty, and students; gives some assessment of the school's effectiveness;
                    and suggests a few directions for the future" (p. 2). This history of Indiana University
