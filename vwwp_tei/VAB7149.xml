            <head>THE SANCTUARY OF MERCY.</head>
                <head type="sub">BY MRS. MONA CAIRD.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">IN</hi> studying the relation of the human to the animal races, I
                    have been greatly struck by the different spirit displayed by writers as regards
                    this question—a question profound in its importance both to man and beast, but
                    which, nevertheless, has scarcely yet risen into the realm of human speculation
                    and morality. One seldom meets with any definite and fully thought-out statement
                    on the matter: the disposition of the writer is displayed in chance utterances,
                    passing allusions, which indicate the nature of the feeling rather than
                    formulate an opinion.</p>
                <p>As yet little or no attempt has been made to civilise our relationship with the
                    teeming, eager life that swarms around us, a life infinitely more multitudinous
                    and far-spread than our own, filling the world with more pangs and joys and
                    fears and sensations in one day than its human inhabitants can produce in one
                    year. Although as yet the whole dramatic, pathetic existence of these multitudes
                    is practically unknown to us, I have found in almost all the poets—and
                    invariably in the very great ones—a tender sympathy and sense of kinship with
                    these creatures of the earth and air. Poets and seers hae shown that their
                    hearts are large enough to include in their sympathy not only the dog and
                    horse—so full of appeal in their generous fidelity to man—but the poor, hunted,
                    despised creatures, whose very existence is an affront to our noble selves,
                    whose poor little lives may be torn and tortured out of them by any savagely
                    ingenious device that our High Superiority may discover for the infliction of a
                    dreadful death upon the helpless “little brothers” whom St. Francis loved so
                    tenderly. Our poets have felt, in flashes, by the very compulsion of the poet's
                    heart, the great, beautiful truth of universal kinship, the unity of all life
                    and its profound mystery; the healing that lies in sympathy—in a large,
                    unsectarian sympathy with throbbing nerves and aching hearts, be they of man or
                    beast; a love that stops at no poor barriers of genus and species, but goes out
                    broadly and beneficently, as some<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7149-001"></pb> great wind of
                    spring that thaws the aching earth and releases the ice-bound streams, and calls
                    forth flowers and green things and all the joy of the world. In this we must see
                    the image of our hope.</p>
                <p>We are striving in this wonderful age to find a cure for human wretchedness, to
                    break down miserable barriers of class and creed, to unite the human race in
                    bonds of brotherhood, to stimulate the sympathies and calm the strife and
                    suffering of the human lot. In this revolt against injustice and cruelty, are
                    the unfortunate animals to be eternally left out in the cold? Are we to proclaim
                    peace and goodwill to all men and yet remain the savage tyrants and tormentors
                    of the beings who stand in most need of mercy, from their utter helplessness?
                    The inconsequence, the treachery, the meanness of such exclusion must strike
                    every generous heart and sound intellect merely when it is stated! Peace and
                    goodwill to all that live—surely <emph>that</emph> must be the watchword of the
                    future. <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>Be my benediction said</l>
                            <l>With my hand upon thy head,</l>
                            <l>Gentle fellow-creature!</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q> When shall we be able, as a race, to repeat in one great chorus those
                    tender words of Mrs. Browning?</p>
                <p>In our present efforts towards a nobler, juster, kinder relationship of man to
                    man we shall learn many things, discover many errors and many moral truths
                    little suspected. And of these I think the greatest and least suspected in its
                    full meaning and amplitude is that of our kinship and our duty to the creatures
                    who have to find in us their Providence.</p>
                <p>By whatever means and methods we may strive towards a better social state, let it
                    never be forgotten that, in the last resort, salvation lies in the heart of man,
                        <emph>or nowhere</emph>, and that all things which tend to harden that human
                    heart, to bind it in a frosty spell of pitiless self-seeking—be the results
                    never so much to our temporal advantage—must perforce help to destroy the
                    impulses and sympathies that make for peace and social happiness. That which
                    teaches us to torment the weak for any purpose whatever, and to inflict
                        <emph>not swift death but slow torture</emph> on any living thing, will
                    assuredly help to annul the efforts, however earnest and however wise, that may
                    be made to establish peace and justice among the suffering nations. Strange that
                    a thing so obvious should need insisting upon! It is sheer madness to ignore the
                    very source and life-spring of human weal or woe—the heart and brain of man. Yet
                        of<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7149-002"></pb> this madness the present generation is
                    guilty, since it allows learned professors, on the plea of doing good to our

                    his very manhood revolts, as it surely <emph>must</emph> revolt, at the idea of
                    this wholesale martyrdom for his sake, how can he bear to doom his fellowmen to
                    the same intolerable burden?</p>
                <p>Good heavens! of what unholy amalgam of flint and steel do the vivisectors
                    suppose human hearts to be made, that they dare to tell us they commit such
                    deeds on our behalf, tempting our baseness with promises of gain? What an insult
                    is that bait! To what low, pitiful, unmanly qualities in us does the learned
                    physiologist make his only too successful appeal! Every day, with our consent,
                    under our laws, all over the Christian and civilised world, this anguish of dumb
                    creatures is being suffered. And let it not be forgotten that vivisection is
                    practised at an ever increasing rate, as the official returns show, and that it
                    grows more ruthless and more terrible every year, as by the very law of our
                    nature it is <emph>bound</emph> to do, unless some reaction sets in, unless some
                    great national outcry is made against the practice of State-licensed cruelty.
                    For the honour of human nature, let us abolish it in justice to these helpless
                    ones: do not let us wait until we do it in sheer terror for
                        <emph>ourselves</emph>! The practice is gradually extending to human
                    subjects who are poor and helpless enough to be safely used in that capacity.
                    Are we to sit still and acquiesce till human vivisection becomes an open and
                    “respectable” industry?</p>
                <p>Surely the people of England who possess so powerful a voting influence will not
                    be so blind as to let it go on unopposed.</p>
                <p>Their own interests, if nothing else, ought to rouse them to resist. They have
                    but to question candidates for elections, and to refuse to vote for those who
                    will not oppose the practice, and the law which charters it would
                        <emph>have</emph> to be repealed. It is because these savageries are
                    committed by men who are respected and admired that they are so terribly
                    dangerous to our national morality and to our progress in all its aspects. The
                    crimes of acknowledge criminals are ominous enough, but they need scarcely be
                    considered in comparison with the chartered and applauded cruelties of men
                    (probably honestly believing themselves to be not only justified but active in
                    well-doing) who are looked up to as distinguished members of an honourable
                    profession, and who are creating a moral standard—or rather destroying one—with
                    every breath they draw.<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7149-004"></pb> Can this be called
                    exaggeration if we remember that such men as these spend their whole lives in
                    subjecting gentle unoffending creatures to the tortures of the damned? If only
                    men and women could realise <emph>but for one moment</emph> those tortures, I am
                    convinced that the practice of vivisection would be swept away in a great burst
                    of national fury before another year had passed! But alas, nothing can reveal
                    that hell on earth to the multitudes of men and women, absorbed, perforce, in
                    their business and in their own many griefs. But let it be remembered that the
                    animals in their anguish have no redress, no possibility of appeal, of
                    combination, no consolation of faith, hope, or religion, none of the exaltation
                    of voluntary sacrifice. There is nothing for them but the dark unimaginable
                    horror of dumb, hopeless, ghastly suffering.</p>
                <p>Dr. Hoggan tells us that after going through three campaigns where he saw many a
                    sad sight, he saw none sadder than when the dogs were brought up from the
                    cellars to be vivisected, the poor creatures appearing terrified, as if they
                    knew that some cruel fate awaited them. They would try to appeal for mercy by
                    begging, or licking the hands of their pitiless torturers; but always in
                        vain.<ref target="#caird-sanctuarynote15" rend="super">1</ref> Once it is recorded that
                    the students were touched by the appeals of a poor little fox terrier, and tried
                    to persuade the professor to spare it; but the learned gentleman said that he
                    would teach them to give way to no such maudlin sensibility, and he vivisected
                    the creature cruelly then and there, and also kept him to serve for further
                    experiment on the following day.<ref target="#caird-sanctuarynote16" rend="super">2</ref></p>
                <p>People often talk judicially and “moderately” about vivisection, as if it were a
                    question merely of human welfare and of medical science. Let me entreat those
                    who take that view to try to <emph>realise</emph> the fate of a creature, seized
                    and bound by strong ruthless hands, and tortured slowly, cleverly, delicately,
                    exquisitely, sometimes with the muscles of the larynx cut,<ref target="#caird-sanctuarynote17" rend="super">3</ref> so that the operator shall not be
                    disturbed by its groans and cries; sometimes under the spell of the “hellish

                    experts, with heightened sensitivenes—to perform their terrible work of
                    conveying sensation through the delicate, branching fibres to all parts of the
                    agonised body; a network that seems to form a horrible garment of anguish in
                    which the creature lies still and stark in an unimaginable martyrdom.<ref target="#caird-sanctuarynote18" rend="super">1</ref></p>
                <p>If after <emph>really</emph> understanding and conceiving all this, men and women
                    could continue to sanction vivisection, then I think we should be driven to the
                    awful conclusion that the average human being is so black and savage at heart
                    that the sooner he is swept into nothingness the better: a creature beyond
                    praying for—and not worth the effort of prayer! But the fact is—it
                        <emph>must</emph> be so—that people do not realise the martyrdom that they
                    decree or acquiesce in, the vivisectors having very cleverly and consistently
                    managed to slur over the awful facts with graceful euphemisms—to put it
                    mildly—so that vivisection is actually becoming to many another name for Science
                    herself—Science the gentle and beneficent!</p>
                <p>I firmly believe that some day it will be recognised by all that vivisection is,
                    in fact, the arch-enemy of Science, whose teaching has ever been that Nature is
                    one in essence, and that her laws are harmonious and not contradictory; but if
                    her laws are not contradictory, how can it possible be that what is morally
                    wrong should be scientifically right, that what is cruel and unjust should lead
                    us to peace and health? We have never yet found this to be the rule in any other
                    case. Why should there be an exception in this? Are there special natural laws
                    in favour of the physiologist, that he alone should be held justified in
                    pursuing legitimate ends by <emph>illegitimate means</emph>? Suppose Art were
                    also to set up a claim to follow her sublime vocation by torture: suppose
                    Religion reasserted her privilege by enforcing her teaching by fire and sword.

                        celebrated vivisector, Claude Bernard, thus describes the effects of curare:

                        REVUE DES DEUX MONDES, Feb. 15th, 1883.</note><pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7149-007"></pb> the better and the more trustworthy spirit; which will lead us straighter and
                    further along the path of progress and peace: that of the vivisector or that of
                    the poet?</p>
                <p>It is this prophetic, universl element, this moral clairvoyance, that gives that
                    large, tender, stirring quality to the work of the true poet, convincing as
                    nothing else convinces, for we feel that it comes straight from the very source
                    of Truth itself. We are bound to believe that he gives us good counsel when he
                    bids us treat the poor beasts with tenderness and pity, and extend to them the
                    sanctuary of human kindness and kinship. Let the vivisector say what he will,
                    both reason and conscience tell us that there is no alternative to this
                    conviction, except that this accursed universe is but the Devil's playground,
                    wherein we are at once his playfellows and his victims: his victims in that we
                    are doomed to suffer in so cruel a fashion the pangs of hunger, cold, anxiety,
                    strife, toil, parting, disease, degradation, madness: his playfellows in that we
                    imitate and join him in his ghastly business by inflicting in <emph>our</emph>
                    turn, and for our own ends, pain unspeakable on those helpless ones, obviously
                    our next of kin, whose weakness tempts the coward in us and inspires the fiend,
                    while it leaves us seemingly unpunished, and free to wield our power for savage
                    uses worthy of our leader!</p>
                <p>It seems strange, indeed, that the human mind can be completely seduced from a
                    truth which nevertheles it cannot fail to recognise when it is clearly placed
                    before it. Yet from such a truth the vivisectors and their party have managed to
                    seduce us! I defy any one who admits the existence of a moral law at all to deny
                    that in the long run we shall lose and not gain by committing a deliberate
                    wrong. I challenge such a person to honestly deny that the wrong and the cruelly
                    so committed will in some way and at some time have to be expiated by ourselves
                    and our descendants.</p>
                <p>In how tremendous and profound and terrible a sense the following lines from
                    Shelley are true—literally, bitterly, piercingly true, with the dreadful
                    certainty of a law of Nature mankind will some day have to learn as regards
                    this, “our meanest crime.” <q>
