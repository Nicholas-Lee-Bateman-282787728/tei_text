                         On Lincoln&apos;s birthday, the sale of a document he had signed set an
                         auction record of 3.44 million dollars. A new poll of historians joined a
                         public poll in ranking Lincoln the greatest president in American
                              history.<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                    <p>But while all of those events appeared to be celebrating Lincoln, I assert
                         that they were equally engaged in the act of claiming him. Take first the
                         exception which proves the rule. Early this year, the U.S. Postal Service
                         unveiled a set of four stamps commemorating Lincoln&apos;s birth (no matter
                         that he already appeared on fifty previous stamps, more than any other
                         person). The new stamps depict Lincoln as rail-splitter, lawyer,
                         politician, and president. Contrast these to the four new pennies
                         authorized by Congress and prepared by the U.S. Mint. The pennies appear to
                         celebrate Lincoln, but actually memorialize the places that wish to claim
                         him: <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"

                         February 2008. President George W. Bush initially accepted the invitation
                         to speak, then backed out, offering his wife Laura as his replacement.

                    <p>Almost immediately after Lincoln&apos;s death biographers took up the task of
                         writing his life. Two rhetorical devices conspired to leave

                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> behind from the beginning. First,
                         in the aftermath of the Civil War, biographers saw Lincoln as a symbol of
                         reconciliation and emphasized the fact that the <placeName><region

                         Savior of the Union, and the charitable chief, biographers found a human
                         link between North and South, silently omitting Lincoln&apos;s
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         damaging to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName>, biographers also employed the
                         rhetorical device of contrast to emphasize Lincoln&apos;s presidential
                         greatness in spite of his humble origins. As Lincoln rose in public
                         estimation over the years, his youth sunk from the &quot;extreme humility
                         of border life&quot; noted in an 1866 biography to the &quot;stagnant,

                         neighbors with an unsavory metaphor designed to touch both the eyes and

                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana </region></placeName> sat by the wayside, a
                         private group acting with state funds erected a large monument over
                         Lincoln&apos;s grave in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7014529" reg="Springfield"
                              >Springfield</settlement></placeName>. Two years later,
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717"
                                   reg="District of Columbia">Washington,
                              D.C.</settlement></placeName> entered the fray by dedicating the
                         Freedman&apos;s Monument. Contemporaneous Hoosiers complained that no one
                         had marked or maintained the grave of Lincoln&apos;s mother, but few in the
                         nineteenth century showed any inclination to act or to spend money.</p>
                    <p>Collectors soon began to horde Lincoln manuscripts, artifacts, and print
                         materials. In time, big money players entered the game and the &quot;Big
                         5&quot; plus one out-purchased all the rest. Upon the deaths of the
                         collectors in the early twentieth century, institutions scrambled to pick
                         up the prized pieces. Two collections -- those of William H. Lambert and John
                         E. Burton -- were sold at auction. The Huntington Library snatched up Judd
                         Stewart&apos;s collection and Brown University obtained that of Charles W.
                         McClellan. In perhaps <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana </region></placeName>&apos;s best
                         performance, two of the state&apos;s institutions came up big when it
                         really mattered. The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, headquartered
                         in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                                   >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName>, had long used
                         Lincoln&apos;s name and in the 1920s decided to give something back to the
                         legacy. The directors hired preacher Louis Warren to oversee a new research
                         library. Warren, whose role in promoting Lincoln statuary is described
                         later in this issue, successfully wooed Judge Daniel Fish and landed his
                         substantial collection. At the same time, the Lilly Library out-schmoozed
                         and out-solicited <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251"
                                   reg="Illinois"/></placeName> libraries to win the collection of
                         Joseph B. Oakleaf.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>
                    <p>Though seen as a grand coup in the 1930s, both collections have generally
                         suffered in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana </region></placeName>. The Lilly Library presently has
                         no Lincoln curator and has not actively sought to expand its Lincoln
                         holdings. Warren and his successors developed the <placeName><settlement

                         company decided to close first the library and finally the museum. In an
                         unscheduled part of Lincoln&apos;s bicentennial celebration, <list

                    <p>The inter-state competition that grew among collectors also developed among
                         historic preservationists. By 1909, having grown more Confederate than in
                         wartime, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                                   >Kentucky</region></placeName> wanted nothing to do with
                         Lincoln&apos;s birthplace so a national Lincoln Farm Association -- with folks
                         like Mark Twain, Ida Tarbell, and Cardinal James Gibbons on the board of
                         directors -- purchased the property. Acting in the sprit of the age, the
                         association commissioned a Greek temple to encase what the National Park
                         Service now calls a &quot;symbolic cabin&quot; (NPS jargon for
                         &quot;fake&quot;). In <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717"

                         where Lincoln&apos;s mother must have been buried, but the property
                         remained subject to confused titles and a lack of maintenance. Southern

                         society and began marking local points of interest, but the state remained
                         officially uninterested until the Klan forced its hand. After the state had
                         purged Klansmen from state offices, Hoosiers looked around for
                         something -- anything -- to help polish the state&apos;s image and the governor
                         discovered Lincoln. Following the model used nationally to save
                         Lincoln&apos;s birthplace, Governor Ed Jackson pulled together an all-star
                         fundraising team that included the Ball family of <placeName><settlement

                              the decision regarding the proper use of our large collection of
                              Lincoln artifacts, memorabilia, manuscripts, and books. At the time,
                              the museum was housed in our corporate headquarters, a site with
                              limited accessibility for the public.</p>

                              scholars, and authors.</p>

                         <head>MICHAEL WESTFALL, FRIENDS OF THE LINCOLN MUSEUM</head>

                         <p>When the announcement was made by the Lincoln Financial Foundation, the
                              Friends of the Lincoln Museum was faced with a decision -- who would we
                              back, or would we wait, let it all play out, and then support the new
                              custodian of the museum assets?</p>
                         <p>There were a variety of viewpoints on the board and, after the public
                              announcement, from the community. Within <placeName><settlement
                                        type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne">Fort
                                        Wayne</settlement></placeName> and the immediate region
                              there was a feeling of local ownership for the collection. A few
                              people wanted to attack &quot;The Lincoln,&quot; as it was locally <pb
                                   n="321" id="VAA4025-105-4-023"/> known. Suggestions, such as
                              moving the collection to a local shopping mall, or simply storing it
                              in a nearby warehouse, were brought forward. Few people understood the
                              curatorial responsibilities attached to ownership of the collection
                              and fewer still understood the origins, exact nature, and size of the
                              collection.</p>
                         <p>The position that rapidly rose to the surface was that as a supporting
                              organization, the Friends group&apos;s main purpose was to encourage
                              whatever was best for the collection. We were Friends of the Lincoln
                              Museum first, not necessarily friends of <placeName><settlement
                                        type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne">Fort
                                        Wayne</settlement></placeName> or of <placeName><region
                                        type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                        >Indiana</region></placeName>. As it would eventually turn
                              out, all three positions were fortunately possible.</p>
                         <p>It was clear from the beginning that the Allen County Public Library
                              (ACPL), if they had access to the collections management staff from
                              the museum, could easily and readily handle the two-dimensional
                              collection. Unfortunately, the Lincoln Financial Foundation had
                              already said that they were not interested in dividing the collection.
                              The ACPL could not manage the three-dimensional collection, and there
                              was no partner in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"
                                        reg="Fort Wayne">Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName> ready
                              to take on that role.</p>
                         <p>It was at this time that the Friends received a call from the Indiana
                              Department of Natural Resources that the Indiana State Museum was
                              interested in establishing a partnership with the ACPL and presenting
                              a joint proposal to the Lincoln Financial Foundation.</p>
                         <p>This was an idea that the Friends of the Lincoln Museum could endorse
                              and get behind. If successful, this proposal would keep the archival
                              collection in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"

                              it could help strengthen -- and in turn be strengthened by -- the ACPEL
                              internationally recognized genealogy collection. It would also allow
                              the three-dimensional collection to be located in
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                              the State Museum, which had the resources to care for the collection
                              and simultaneously increase the public&apos;s ability to interact with
                              it. The state of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, through the
                              Department of Natural Resources, would own the collection in its
                              entirety and develop a loan agreement with the ACPL to house the
                              archival portion of the collection.</p>
                         <p>The next three months were spent with the Friends acting as coordinator
                              (and sometimes cheerleader) in drafting what became a truly dynamic
                              and, in the end, winning proposal for Indiana to be the new custodian
                              of the Lincoln Museum collections.</p>
                         <p>The process was not without a bit of internal agony. But, there was
                              never any disagreement that threatened the coalition&apos;s existence.
                              The group worked together in crafting a dynamic proposal benefitting

                         <p>Community reaction to the news that the Lincoln Museum was to be closed
                              was swift and vociferous. Emotions expressed covered a wide <pb
                                   n="323" id="VAA4025-105-4-025"/> range, including shock,
                              disbelief, sadness, regret, anger, resentment, and indignation. Even
                              people who had rarely -- or never -- set foot in the museum lamented its
                              potential loss to the community.</p>
                         <p>There was near-universal agreement that something needed to be done,
                              that the loss of the Lincoln Museum would be a blow to
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"
                                        reg="Fort Wayne">Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName>. But
                              what to do? Here, it appeared, consensus might be elusive. A few in
                              the community thought the response should be some version of &quot;you
                              can&apos;t do this to us.&quot; They were inclined to confront the
                              company, to argue, to object, even attempt to shame or embarrass
                              corporate management into reversing their decision and keeping the
                              facility open.</p>
                         <p>Others advocated a somewhat less confrontational approach, involving the
                              development of a very ambitious master plan for a new physical home
                              and organizational structure for the Lincoln Museum. This vision
                              called for either the construction of a new building, or the
                              renovation of an existing building, to house the museum.</p>
                         <p>Still others rejected both of these ideas, seeking a more pragmatic
                              approach. They reasoned that locking horns with the LNC would be
                              futile at best and could have negative repercussions for the
                              community, in which Lincoln National maintained a significant presence
                              and was a prominent and generous corporate citizen. Furthermore, they
                              believed that the idea of developing a totally new vision and master
                              plan, possibly including a costly, time-consuming capital project, was
                              completely impractical given the announced timetable for the
                              museum&apos;s closing.</p>
                         <p>According to the pragmatic view, the community&apos;s best chance for
                              achieving a positive outcome would be to work with the company, on
                              their terms, and to make the strongest possible case for retaining the
                              collection locally. Ultimately, this line of reasoning emerged as the
                              consensus view of key community leaders. By the time the Lincoln
                              Financial Foundation announced its plan to entertain proposals from
                              institutions seeking to become the new owners of the collection, the

                              had already evolved into a statewide coalition intent on pursuing the

                              based on a thorough understanding of the nature and scope of the
                              Lincoln Museum collection. They realized that the Lincoln Museum was
                              really, at its core, a library. In fact, for many years when the
                              collection was housed in the LNC headquarters building in
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"

                              known as the Louis A. Warren Lincoln Library and Museum. The vast
                              majority of the collection is two-dimensional in nature, comprised of
                              books, manuscripts, newspapers, photographs, clipping files, and other
                              documents. </p>

                              way to derive the greatest benefit from it is to make it widely
                              available to as many people as possible, be they scholars, students,
                              Lincoln enthusiasts, or simply someone with the need or desire to
                              learn about the life and legacy of Abraham Lincoln. And the best way
                              to accomplish this goal of wide accessibility is through digitization
                              and distribution online.</p>
                         <p>For this task, the Allen County Public Library was uniquely qualified.
                              The library, which had previously established a partnership with the
                              Internet Archive to set up a regional digitization center at the main
                              library building, has the capacity to digitize millions of pages per
                              month, and to handle rare, fragile, and odd-sized materials.</p>
                         <p>Of course the collection also contains some remarkable three-dimensional
                              artifacts, items requiring the care and attention of highly skilled
                              museum professionals. The Indiana State Museum has the facilities and
                              staff to preserve, exhibit, and interpret this portion of the
                              collection, as well as to expose it to a wide and varied audience.</p>
                         <p>So the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                        >Indiana</region></placeName> coalition, in its proposal to
                              the Lincoln Financial Foundation, stressed the unique skills and
                              expertise of its two principal institutions, the Allen County Public
                              Library and the Indiana State Museum. The <placeName><region
                                        type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                        >Indiana</region></placeName> group grasped the nature of
                              the Lincoln collections and presented a detailed plan for exposing the
                              rich content of that collection to the widest possible audience of
                              potential users.</p>

                              donate the collection to an institution better equipped to showcase
                              and use it, our initial reaction was sympathy for

                              loss and for the dislocation of professional colleagues. We were

                              the certainty of fierce national competition, no single institution in
                              the state could persuade them that the collection, assembled in

                              molded. We were, however, determined to play a part in whatever effort
                              was mounted to keep the collection.</p>
                         <p>It certainly wasn&apos;t that <placeName><region type="state"

                              Lincoln collection, plus archivists and paper conservators. The State
                              Library and State Archives were an additional cache of technical
                              expertise and important historical collections. The State Museum had a
                              new building, with fine gallery and storage space, plus exhibition
                              specialists and objects conservators. In <placeName><settlement

                              Library offered a very large library system with superb research
                              capabilities, including the ability to digitalize large collections.
                              So we had many of the pieces that turned out to be congruent with what
                              the Lincoln Financial Foundation sought from the institution to which
                              they would donate the collection.</p>
                         <p>The problem was, those pieces were not in one institution, or even in
                              one city. We knew in general that any number of institutions -- in

                              Lincoln expertise. We were not sure that the simple fact that we were

                              Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana State Library, and the State
                              Archives as supporting partners, resolved to submit a proposal that
                              could make us a finalist among the more than forty institutions
                              expressing interest. Once on any final list, we could then leverage
                              the fact that both the State Museum and the Allen County Public
                              Library were new and impressive facilities. We also decided to analyze
                              and specifically address each aspect of the Lincoln Financial
                              Foundation&apos;s Request For Proposal and to exceed their key
                              expectations. Most importantly, we would demonstrate how any
                              characteristics that could be perceived as drawbacks were instead
                              advantages.</p>
                         <p>The proposal we submitted emphasized the following points: <list

                                   <item>The State Museum would mount a major Lincoln exhibition

                                   <item>We would raise money to endow the collection, thus assuring

                                        meant that the collection would maintain its identity as a

                                        Library are multidisciplinary institutions, and would bring

                              Museum&apos;s grants officer, performed exactly as intended. The
                              proposal made the Allen County Public Library/Indiana State Museum
                              Collaborative a finalist, and the site visits went quite well. The
                              very fact that neither institution had substantial Lincoln collections
                              (thus giving the Lincoln Financial Foundation Collection unique
                              prominence), coupled with the State Museum&apos;s ability to name a
                              gallery for the Lincoln Financial Foundation and the ACPs capacity to
                              rapidly digitize tens of thousands of historic documents and books
                              were all significant strengths.</p>

                    <p>Anniversaries are often a time of reflection; they offer an opportunity to
                         look at where we have been and, perhaps, to contemplate where we may be
                         going. As is so often the case, the way that we understand and tell stories
                         about our past changes over time. New scholarship, changing values, and
                         societal trends can -- and do -- influence the ways we choose to remember and
                         honor the people and events of our history. As the nation celebrates the
                         bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, this process of examining how
                         Americans study and interpret Lincoln&apos;s life is in full swing. The
                         Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, which contains a portion of the
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         for fourteen years of his youth, provides an interesting example of just
                         how these influences manifest themselves over time.</p>

                         been acquired. In 1909, the state cleared the park of dead trees, erected a
                         fence and elaborate entrance gate, and built a road from the highway to the
                         gravesite. At the highway entrance, the gateway featured life-size lions,

                         believed to be correct, and a marker was erected there on April 28,

                    <p>After identifying the cabin site, interest in the historic Lincoln property

                         to Abraham Lincoln. One man in particular who held this viewpoint was
                         Colonel Richard Lieber, director of the state Department of Conservation.
                         The state park movement was very strong in the 1920s, and Lieber hoped to
                         develop an impressive system of scenically beautiful, historically
                         significant parks. A memorial to Lincoln fit in perfectly with his plan.
                         His support was an important factor in eventually establishing the Nancy
                         Hanks Lincoln State Memorial and Lincoln State Park. In 1926, Lieber gained
                         assistance in his efforts when a group of private citizens formed the
                         Indiana Lincoln Union (ILU).3 The goal of the ILU was to &quot;propose that
                         the people of our state, in mighty unison, rear a national shrine which ...
                         will express both our deathless devotion as well as our indefinite
                         gratitude to the soul of the great departed and his Mother.&quot;<hi

                         youth was interpreted at the site. One of these was the high esteem in
                         which Lincoln was held. By the twentieth century, Lincoln&apos;s elevation
                         to the pantheon of American heroes was complete. He was the Preserver of
                         the Union, the Great Emancipator, the author and orator of the
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014060"

                         the Martyred President. In short, in the thirty years after his death, he
                         had become a larger-than-life figure; anything and any place associated
                         with his life took on a greater significance, often leading to efforts to
                         preserve and memorialize such memorabilia. That was certainly true of
                         Lincoln&apos;s <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> homesite -- in his words,

                              rend="sup">5</hi> Surely such a spot was worthy of preservation and
                         commemoration.</p>
                    <p>Lending even more significance to the boyhood home site was the fact that it
                         contained the grave of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, the mother who, so the
                         reasoning went, tragically did not live to see her son&apos;s greatness,
                         but contributed much to his eventual success. This line of thinking
                         dovetailed nicely with the &quot;cult of motherhood,&quot; a legacy of the
                         Victorian era, which placed great importance on the influence of mothers on
                         their children&apos;s lives. Lincoln&apos;s oft-quoted statement about his
                         own &quot;angel mother&quot; did much to validate this view of Nancy Hanks
                         Lincoln. Therefore, preserving her gravesite in a properly honorable
                         fashion was of utmost importance to early park planners and advocates.
                         Their sentiments guided not only the initial development of the memorial
                         site, but also its subsequent form and its interpretation of Lincoln&apos;s
                         early life.</p>
                    <p>Because those charged with the care of the site felt a great responsibility
                         to properly honor Lincoln and his mother, they turned to Frederick Law
                         Olmsted Jr. -- son of the famous designer of <placeName><settlement

                         landscape architect in his own right -- to guide them in the formulation of a
                         design for the memorial. Recognizing that Lincoln had spent a formative
                         time of life in the area, Olmsted was convinced that the commemorative
                         nature of the project should reflect the importance of the site. As a first
                         step, he set guidelines for simplifying the areas surrounding the grave and
                         cabin sites. He jointly termed these areas &quot;the Sanctuary,&quot; and

                    <p>Olmsted&apos;s conceptual plan included a primary vista -- the allee -- between
                         the gravesite and the highway, situated in a cruciform arrangement. A
                         parking plaza and large flagpole at the intersection of the highway and
                         allee anchored the two axes, and the flagpole provided a focal point for
                         the south end of the allee. This arrangement established both the strong
                         spiritual imagery and solemn atmosphere that Olmsted deemed necessary for

                         as the &quot;sainted Mother,&quot; referred to her grave as &quot;sacred

                    <p>Although not included in Olmsted&apos;s original design concept, the
                         development of what came to be known as the cabin site memorial was
                         consistent with the underlying desire to create a proper commemoration of
                         Lincoln&apos;s experiences in <placeName><region type="state"

                         After deciding that a replica of the Lincoln cabin would be inappropriate,
                         the state hired architect Thomas Hibben, an <placeName><region type="state"

                         native, to design a suitable monument to mark the spot where the cabin once
                         stood. Hibben planned a bronze casting, in the shape of the cabin&apos;s
                         sill and hearth, to be surrounded by a stone wall. The area would then be
                         formally landscaped. The goal was: <quote rend="blockquote">to mark the

                              spot. The log sill is chosen as appropriate to mark the outline of the
                              cabin; the hearth and fireplace are chosen because they have been,
                              since time immemorial, the altar of the home, the center around which
                              all life moved. The entire conception is cast in bronze in order that
                              it may be durable and that it may not in any way seem a reconstruction
                              of the original cabin. The entire purpose of the design is intended to
                              be a symbol of the hearth and home of the Lincoln family.<hi
                                   rend="sup">2</hi></quote> In May 1933, a Civilian Conservation
                         Corps crew located the historic hearthstones, excavated them, constructed
                         the stone wall, and landscaped the grounds. After numerous delays the
                         bronze casting was finally placed on the site in July 1935.</p>
                    <p>While work was underway on the cabin site memorial, J. I. Holcomb, president
                         of the ILU, suggested another major design feature for the landscape. He
                         recommended &quot;a collection of stones from the various points of Lincoln
                         interest,&quot; situated along a wooded trail as miniature shrines to
                         moments in Lincoln&apos;s life. This &quot;Trail of Twelve Stones&quot;
                         would also include stone benches and tablets that described the
                         stones&apos; origins. ILU members and others immediately began acquiring
                         stones, and by 1934 the trail was complete. A promotional piece described
                         the trail: &quot;Each shrine,&quot; it promised, &quot;will be especially
                         landscaped to emphasize its historical significance.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >13</hi></p>
                    <p>While the Trail of Twelve Stones was not part of Olmsted&apos;s plan, it
                         provided a significant physical and allegorical link between the cabin and
                         the gravesite. The connection of Lincoln&apos;s childhood home to his
                         mother&apos;s grave emphasized the theme of pilgrimage. The trail
                         symbolized the visitors&apos; journey during which they could learn about
                         and reflect upon the different stages of Lincoln&apos;s life, and also
                         represented the sad story of Lincoln&apos;s childhood: his passage from
                         innocence into maturity and on to his eventual sacrifice for the nation.<hi

                         building&apos;s location had been a subject of debate for many years, with
                         plans offered that placed it alternately at the north end of the allee,
                         near the gravesite, or at the south side of the plaza. Lieber was opposed
                         to placing it near the gravesite out of concern that it would &quot;crush
                         the very object of our veneration: that unpretentious little grave holding
                         the body and the enigma of Nancy Hanks Lincoln.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                         After consulting with Olmsted, he reported to the ILU that
                         &quot;[b]uildings in that location would disrupt the reveries or
                         contemplations of those who come to visit that little hallowed
                              spot.&quot;<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Finally, in 1938, the Department of
                         Conservation and the ILU decided to place the structure south of the plaza,
                         away from the north end gravesite.</p>
                    <p>Hibben earlier proposed a 200-square-foot structure with four square courts,
                         surrounding a 150-foot-tall tower housing a large pipe organ. The courts
                         were to be connected with cloisters decorated in frescoes and sculptures;
                         the tower would be painted with murals. The building would have restrooms,
                         and even a small restaurant, for the convenience of visitors. This proposal
                         was generally well received by the public, but some members of the
                         Department of Conservation and the ILU were uncomfortable with the design,
                         fearing that its magnificence would &quot;interfere with the spirit of the
                              place.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Olmsted, too, felt the plan was
                         wrong. Ultimately the ILU rejected the proposal.</p>
                    <p>Olmsted suggested a matched pair of structures on either side of the allee,
                         at its south end, creating a portal through which visitors could pass to
                         begin their journey to the gravesite. A semicircular wall connecting the
                         two structures would also create a &quot;court of honor&quot; between the
                         two wings. His proposal was accepted, and the ILU hired National Park
                         Service architect Richard Bishop to finalize the design and supervise the
                         construction of the memorial building.</p>
                    <p>Bishop&apos;s goal was to create a building that suggested the best design
                         and construction practices of Lincoln&apos;s day, and simultaneously
                         &quot;expressed the qualities of simplicity, strength and dignity that are
                         invariably associated with Lincoln&apos;s character.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >18</hi> In an effort to maintain this simplicity, Bishop insisted

                              There should be no false construction or design. Materials should be
                              native and largely hand worked. Design should be suggested by the best
                              practice of the days when Nancy Hanks was a young woman. Not a design
                              suggestive of the log cabins she lived in but a type of structure that
                              might have been built by one of the best builders of the period to
                              commemorate an illustrious pioneer.<hi rend="sup">20</hi></quote>
                         Construction began in 1941 and was completed in 1944. With the main
                         building open, the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Memorial, as conceived by the ILU,
                         was essentially complete. The result was a site heavily commemorative in
                         nature, a place where visitors could &quot;remember&quot; the early life of
                         a great American. Its designers and developers had believed that simply
                         being in this place, where Abraham Lincoln had grown up, was enough to
                         inspire reverence and respect for both the man and his mother. That guiding
                         principle consequently influenced the site&apos;s later development and set
                         the tone the way in which <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                    <p>Olmsted, Lieber, the ILU, and Richard Bishop agreed that the only proper way

                    <p>In 1959, with the observation of the sesquicentennial of his birth, there was
                         renewed interest in the study of Lincoln. For its part, the Indiana Lincoln
                         Sesquicentennial Commission, alongside the Indiana Lincoln Foundation,
                         proposed the construction of a museum at the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Memorial
                         Park. The foundation&apos;s stated goal was to &quot;make a National Shrine
                         of the &apos;Lincoln Land&apos; in southern <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                         >Indiana</region></placeName>.&quot; As part of the fundraising campaign,
                         school children were asked to contribute one dollar apiece to become
                         &quot;Abraham Lincoln Schoolfellow Donors.&quot; The money would then be
                         used to construct a museum &quot;perpetuat[ing] the code by which Abraham
                         Lincoln lived -- honesty, integrity, hard work, self-discipline -- as the pattern
                         of living for our youth.&quot;<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The campaign was
                         apparently unsuccessful; the museum was never built.</p>
                    <p>By the late 1950s, there was talk of transferring management of the memorial
                         to the federal government and thereby making it a national park. In 1959,
                         Senator Vance Hartke, of <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7014154" reg="Evansville"
                              >Evansville</settlement></placeName>, introduced a bill into the
                         Congress authorizing the National Park Service (NPS) to conduct a
                         feasibility study. The study neither recommended the idea nor endorsed it.
                         In the meantime, however, local <placeName><region type="state"

                         businessman William Koch, became interested in the idea and worked with
                         Congressman Winfield K. Denton proposing a national park at
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032627"

                         the state endorsed Koch and Denton&apos;s proposal and offered to donate
                         the 200 acres -- containing the cabin site, the gravesite, and the memorial
                         building -- to the NPS, the legislation passed easily. President John E
                         Kennedy signed the act officially authorizing the establishment of Lincoln
                         Boyhood National Memorial on February 19, 1962 and, on July 10, in a
                         ceremony held in front of the memorial building, the transfer was formally
                         made as <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         changed. The NPS, which emphasized education and visitor services, believed
                         that the traditionally commemorative nature of the site provided too few
                         opportunities for engagement. The park needed to be <list type="footnotes">

                         reflection. It needed to teach visitors about Lincoln&apos;s life while in
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName>, and about the effect that his
                         childhood had on his later life. To that end, the new owners enclosed the
                         cloister of the memorial building and built a new wing, which housed a
                         museum and an auditorium. Proper respect was maintained for the gravesite,
                         but the park&apos;s historical narrative was expanded beyond Nancy&apos;s
                         influence on her son&apos;s life, to include the family&apos;s experience
                         of life on the frontier. The new museum highlighted aspects of farm life
                         and the difficulty of obtaining a formal education. Exhibits also featured
                         information about the <geogName key="tgn_2458994" reg="Little Pigeon Creek"
                              >Little Pigeon Creek</geogName> community in which Abraham had grown
                         up. In 1968, the film &quot;Here I Grew Up&quot; premiered in the
                         park&apos;s auditorium. It presented the young Lincoln as a boy growing up
                         in a simple place who went on to achieve great things.</p>
                    <p>The most significant evolutionary development in interpretation at the site
                         resulted, at least in part, from a shift in how Americans had begun to view
                         their history by the late 1960s. Park visitors were less interested in mere
                         remembrance. They wanted to know about the lives of average people, and
                         about the lives of great Americans such as Lincoln, before they became
                         great. One way that this new interest manifested itself was in the
                         development of &quot;living history farms,&quot; which created, or
                         recreated, historical locations for telling history in an engaging
                         manner.</p>
                    <p>In 1966, the National Park Service began working with the Department of
                         Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution to establish a nationwide
                         system of farms representing a variety of regions and time periods. NPS
                         Director George Hartzog was an early proponent of the idea and, following a
                         visit to the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> park in 1968, selected
                         the Lincoln Boyhood Home as one such site. It was a popular idea, both with
                         Superintendent Al Banton, who began making plans, and with Congressman
                         Denton, who helped obtain the necessary appropriations. In November 1968,
                         the new edition of the <hi rend="sup">NPS Interpreters Newsletter</hi>
                         reported that a new park had been created at the Lincoln Boyhood site.
                         &quot;Previously, the emphasis was on monumental memorialization totally
                         divorced from the life Lincoln led there. Now we have a cabin and
                         outbuildings and crops and animals and a fine idea of the environment in
                         which the nation&apos;s most illustrious son grew up.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>This move toward deemphasizing the commemorative aspects of the park was
                         officially stated in the 1970 version of the park&apos;s interpretive
                         planning document. It called for the &quot;removal of the unsightly
                         retaining wall from around the...cabin site memorial&quot; because it was
                         &quot;a definite intrusion on the Living Historical Farm as park
                         development moves from the formal memorialization of the site to a more
                         educational use.&quot; Removing the wall, it was felt, would minimize any
                         intrusive aspects of the memorial. The same document also stated that the
                         Trail of Twelve Stones had been removed from the farm.<hi rend="sup"
                              >26</hi> Clearly, the farm had become the primary means of

                    <p>The development of the farm also coincided with the new, burgeoning emphasis,
                         in late 1960s and early 1970s, on environmental awareness felt throughout
                         the country, particularly within the national parks. The NPS developed
                         special environmental programs and repackaged Lincoln&apos;s
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> story as one of pioneer families
                         living off the land, in harmony with nature. The interpretive prospectus of
                         1970 stated: &quot;The main theme depicts self-sufficiency and man in his
                         environment. Everything the Lincolns used was either totally consumed or
                         recycled -- nothing was wasted. The Lincolns derived their living from the
                         land and forest around them.&quot;<hi rend="sup">27</hi></p>
                    <p>Some interpretive planners, however, disagreed with this view. They expressed
                         concerns regarding the &quot;tendency to shift the focus of interpretation
                         away from Lincoln and his boyhood at the site to a more generalized attempt
                         to portray a 19th century frontier lifestyle.&quot;<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                         They also argued that &quot;the historical record challenges the... claim
                         of the Lincoln farm&apos;s &apos;self-sufficiency.&apos;&quot;<hi
                              rend="sup">29</hi> In fact, the idyllic interpretation of pioneer life
                         was at odds with reality -- the Lincolns and other pioneers had actually
                         worked hard to &quot;tame the wilderness,&quot; and establish communities
                         economically tied to the more settled areas of the East. As quicky as
                         possible, farming replaced hunting, and manufactured goods replaced
                         homemade ones.</p>

                    <p>Despite these concerns, the living history farm soon became an extremely
                         popular feature of the park and was, for many years, the centerpiece of the
                         its interpretive efforts. The NPS hired additional seasonal employees to
                         staff it during the spring and summer, purchased more livestock, and
                         gradually increased the area under cultivation. As the years passed, park
                         administrators did little with other media, in spite of an assessment by
                         NPS interpretive planners in the 1980s calling for an update of the movie
                         and the museum exhibits. Limited funds, however, combined with the
                         continued emphasis on living history, delayed implementation of these
                         projects for many years. The park was still showing the 1968 movie, and
                         still had the 1966 museum exhibits in place, in the 1990s. The park&apos;s
                         brochure, with its almost exclusive emphasis on the farm operation, had not
                         been revised since 1972. Pioneer skills demonstrations, despite their
                         popularity, did not always have a direct relevance to the Lincoln story. In
                         short, the program was unbalanced.</p>
                    <p>A new 2001 long range interpretive plan summed up the park&apos;s problems:
                              <quote rend="blockquote">The popularity of the farm operation, both
                              with the public and with the staff, has led to an imbalance in the
                              interpretive effort. While countless hours and dollars have been put
                              into the farm, virtually nothing has been done to revise or update any
                              of the other interpretive media. The museum exhibits in the Memorial
                              Visitor Center need to be replaced; the park brochure is at least 20
                              years old and reflects a discernible bias in favor of the farm
                              operation; and the Exhibit Shelter has never been fully utilized. Even
                              in the area of personal services, the attitude has commonly been that
                              &quot;real interpretation&quot; could only be done at the farm and
                              that the Memorial Visitor Center exists primarily as a means of

                              However, it needs to be viewed as one of several interpretive tools,
                              and not the centerpiece of the program. An investment of time and
                              money needs to be made in upgrading and modernizing the other
                              non-personal components of the program -- the museum, the brochure, the
                              movie -- as well as an increased emphasis on personal interpretation at
                              the Memorial Visitor Center. Strategies also need to be devised to
                              make the program more inclusive of those components that reflect the
                              memorial nature of the park -- the characteristics of the Memorial
                              Visitor Center structure, the memorial landscape, the Cabin Site
                              Memorial, and the Trail of Twelve Stones.<hi rend="sup"
                              >31</hi></quote> This renewed commitment toward the overall
                         interpretive effort, combined with the funding benefits which user fees
                         make possible, has allowed the park to begin the process of restoring a
                         sense of balance in recent years. In late 2001 a new movie, &quot;Forging
                         Greatness,&quot; premiered. Telling the Lincoln story as comprehensively as
                         possible and using the farm as a backdrop, the film also calls attention to
                         other features of the park, such as the cabin site memorial and the Trail
                         of Twelve Stones, making them equally important to the visitors&apos;
                         experience. A new brochure presents the park as multifaceted, with the
                         farm, the interpretive media, and the commemorative features all smaller
                         parts of a larger whole. In January 2006, a complete rehabilitation of the
                         museum resulted in displays that not only told Lincoln&apos;s
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         some connection between his time here and his later life. For the first
                         time, too, ongoing efforts to preserve the site and create a park are
                         acknowledged and recognized as vital pieces of the narrative. One wall of
                         the museum contains a display entitled &quot;An <placeName><region

                    <p>The story of the evolution of interpretation at Lincoln Boyhood National
                         Memorial is indicative of the ways that many influences, sometimes even
                         seemingly contradictory influences, can affect how history is depicted.
                         Each telling is reflected through the prism of the time in which it is
                         being told. Early development of the park was reflective of the desire to
                         create a memorial to Abraham Lincoln and his mother. The development of the
                         farm was part of an attempt to make history more engaging for the visitors.
                         Is one ultimately better than the other? The truth is most likely that each
                         interpretation is a valid approach. Visitors connect to the tangible
                         resource of this site in whatever way is most meaningful for them, just as
                         they do to the intangible resource that is Abraham Lincoln. Each of us
                         seeks our own meanings. The process is ongoing.</p>

                         his hat into the political arena for the first time. Posting his circular
                         around the frontier town, Lincoln let it be known, among other things, what
                         he desired to make of his life. &quot;Every man,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is
                         said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or not, I can say
                         for one that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my
                         fellow men.&quot;<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Twelve years later, this former

                         from 1820 to 1831. Much had happened to the thirty-five-year-old Lincoln in
                         the years between. As he drolly recalled, &quot;In the fall of 1844, I went
                         into the neighborhood in that state in which I was raised, where my mother
                         and only sister are buried, and from which I had been absent about fifteen
                         years. That part of the country is, within itself, as unpoetical as any
                         spot of the earth; but still seeing it and its objects and inhabitants
                         aroused feelings in me which were certainly poetry; though <list

                    <p>It would be interesting to know what Lincoln would have said about all of
                         this memorialization. His self-deprecating side would no doubt offer

                         image on stationary and in marketing strategy, a tradition that remains
                         firmly in place today, under the auspices of the Lincoln Financial Group of

                         descendant of the insurance company). Robert had carefully managed and
                         cultivated his father&apos;s image and public memory. Never one to care
                         about public sculpture, he presumed that statuary was intended for the home
                         as a decorative art -- no doubt having been influenced in this sentiment by
                         the thousands of John Rogers&apos;s plaster-cast tabletop parlor pieces
                         popular during the Victorian era. One of these anecdotal sculptures that

                         &quot;It seems to me impossible,&quot; he wrote a friend in 1881,
                         &quot;that a bronze heroic statue can ever be a faithful likeness of the
                              subject.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                    <p>By the time the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company commissioned its own
                         heroic bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln to grace the entranceway plaza of
                         its corporate headquarters, Robert Lincoln had been dead for two years. In
                         1928 the $75,000 contract was awarded to one of America&apos;s eminent
                         sculptors of the age, Paul Manship. Manship (1885-1966) was not, by trade
                         or inclination, either a portrait sculptor or sculptor of historic moments.
                         He was primarily a sculptor of animals and mythological allegorical figures
                         from antiquity, and was best known for the golden <hi rend="i"

                         receive in the first three decades of the twentieth century was a Lincoln
                         commission. Manship could not refuse. He brought tremendous energy and
                         talent to the task, and gave the world its best image yet in the genre of

                    <p>To begin his particular journey into Lincoln lore, Manship toured the places

                    <p>There is no photographic evidence of Lincoln before 1846, when he was
                         thirty-seven. This proved to be particularly frustrating to Manship, who
                         had to engage in a backwards intellectual forensic activity. He was forced
                         to review dozens of photographs and dig deeply into Lincoln family
                         genealogy. To better acquaint himself with his subject and to draw
                         inspiration, Manship visited the grave of Lincoln&apos;s beloved mother,
                         Nancy Hanks, in the far southeastern corner of the state. Manship would
                         later claim that this was the defining moment of his quest and that
                         standing before Hanks&apos;s grave he fully understood his charge.
                         &quot;The desire,&quot; he wrote, &quot;to represent the young Lincoln as a
                         dreamer and poet rather than as the rail-splitter was uppermost in my
                              mind.&quot;<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                    <p>Then, like all prodigious sculptors, Manship entered into the spirit of his
                         subject. He pored over biography after biography of Lincoln. Conversations
                         with Warren as they toured related historical sites helped Manship to
                         fashion an appropriate image of the young Lincoln. He also conducted
                         interviews with biographers Carl Sandburg and Ida Tarbell, who keenly
                         identified with the &quot;uplift factor&quot; in Lincoln&apos;s life.
                         Collectively, the sum of information he gathered helped Manship settle on
                         his particular vision of the adolescent Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>Fortuitously for the sculptor who enjoyed creating statues of animals,
                         Manship came across a story from Lincoln&apos;s junior law partner, William
                         H. Herndon, claiming that in 1830, as the family crossed from

                         the stream and triumphantly returned with the shivering animal under my

                         read stories of Lincoln&apos;s youthful physical prowess,&quot; he said,
                         &quot;and so we have depicted Lincoln as the brawny youth that he was. The
                         axe tells the story of his rail-splitting days.&quot; At least two
                         documented accounts from Civil War soldiers concur that as president,
                         &quot;Uncle Abe&quot; entertained soldiers by picking up an axe he found in
                         their encampment and holding it horizontal by one hand for several minutes.
                         No small feat now or then.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly when the bronze was originally made, the axe was mistakenly
                         cast backwards, and Manship had to have the axe recast to fix his error.
                         Had Lincoln used the axe as it had originally been cast, he would have
                         sliced his foot open with the first swing. That Manship&apos;s model
                         reflects both the error and the subsequent repair speaks to his skills as

                         potential impact on the harmonious balance of University Square. Finally,

                         Lincoln seated in a finely detailed Victorian parlor chair, complete with
                         fringes. Draped across the back of the chair, behind the subject, and
                         flowing over the chair&apos;s arms is a shawl. Many accounts from the White
                         House and Lincoln Cottage relate how the president would often drape
                         himself in a shawl. In the sculpture, Lincoln&apos;s left foot is forward
                         while his left arm and hand rests on that thigh.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> This
                         is a Lincoln of wisdom, as his right hand is extended, fingers spread as if

                         one feels as if he stands in the president&apos;s office. Lincoln&apos;s
                         famous stovepipe hat rests behind the chair on the ground, with a pair of
                         gloves placed gracefully atop the hat.</p>

                         the story of the troublesome times he went through, it occurred to me that
                         he was getting little support, and it is at this period that I decided to
                         depict him in an attitude of assuring the public that if they will only be
                         calm and patient he will pull them through. This caused me to use the
                         gesture to aid in conveying my idea. I also made the features grave, with
                         the head bowed and serious. The shawl and the tall hat in the rear of the
                         figure helped to make a good composition.&quot;<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>

                         limestone panels, located at Lincoln Boyhood Home National Memorial,
                         chronicle in stony narrative the story of Lincoln&apos;s life and legacy.
                         What separates this memorial from others in the state and around the nation
                         is that it was originally conceived as a tribute not just to the sixteenth
                         president, but also to his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other large public civic projects underway in the early 1940s, such as
                         John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum&apos;s presidential tribute on <geogName

                         this particular project was not halted at the outbreak of World War II but
                         was instead erected and completed during wartime. As an in-house project of
                         the state, only local resources -- particularly limestone quarried in nearby
                         Bedford -- were used, thus alleviating the project delays typically faced by
                         others at the time.</p>

                    <p>The driving force behind the creation of the panels and the memorial building
                         to which they are attached was the Indiana Lincoln Union (ILU), organized
                         in 1926. The ILU sought to secure a fitting testimony to Lincoln&apos;s
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         Hanks was buried. Fund raising by the ILU permitted the purchase of
                         &quot;seventeen hundred acres near <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         encompassing the site of the Lincoln cabin there and the grave of Nancy
                         Hanks Lincoln.&quot;<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Hanks Lincoln died on October 5,
                         1818 after contracting &quot;milk sickness,&quot; a disease passed on to
                         humans through the consumption of tainted milk from cows who had ingested
                         milkweed, a plant poisonous to humans. At the time of her death, Abraham
                         Lincoln was nine. The ILU worked for fourteen years and lobbied five
                         different gubernatorial administrations to finally get the project moving,
                         and on January 12, 1940, it contracted with architect Richard E. Bishop to
                         design the memorial. The executive committee simply requested that whatever
                         was erected &quot;should be a forthright expression of honesty, simplicity,
                         and dignity, qualities we associate with Lincoln and his mother,&quot; and
                         that the design should be suggested by the best practice of the days when
                         Nancy Hanks was a young woman, not suggestive of log cabins, &quot;but of a
                         type of structure that might have been built by one of the best builders of
                         the period to commemorate an illustrious pioneer.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>On January 20, 1941, little more than a year later, Bishop&apos;s plan for
                         the initial building structure was presented to the committee, with a
                         caveat regarding its location on the property. In his report, Bishop urged
                         the ILU to maintain the existing integrity of the Lincoln Hanks burial
                         site, claiming that &quot;the grave on the little hill sheltered by a
                         beautiful grove of native trees, with a few other moss covered graves
                         nearby, provides a picture in harmony with the character of Nancy Hanks
                         Lincoln as history and legend record it. Nancy Hanks was a simple pioneer
                         woman though the revered mother of our great President. It would probably
                         be out of character and might spoil the natural dignity of her resting
                         place if any modern or formal buildings were located too near to her grave,
                         even as a well meant tribute to her memory. &quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>Bishop&apos;s idea was to make the memorial both functional and aesthetically
                         pleasing. In 1943, when work was complete, that is what the ILU received.
                         The memorial consists of three parts: the central feature is a set of
                         limestone panels. These are fronted by a cloister connecting the small Abe
                         Lincoln Hall (which includes a memorial chapel) to the larger Nancy Hanks
                         Hall, which serves as a combination public lounge and visitors&apos;
                         center. To make his ideas three-dimensional, Bishop turned to sculptor E.H.
                         Daniels who produced, at the architect&apos;s direction, a model of the
                         memorial. Daniels, a native of <placeName><region type="state"

                         considered satisfactory with the conception, with the only remaining
                         questions concerning the size and the materials for the panels (bronze vs.
                              stone).<hi rend="sup">31</hi> In the end it was agreed that the panels
                         should be large, to depict the grandeur of the subject matter as well as to
                         provide physical strength to the building. Limestone was selected, as there
                         was a quarry nearby and because the stone came from <placeName><region

                              >Indiana</region></placeName> soil. Governor Henry E Schricker
                         committed $30,000 to the project, and Daniels signed a contract for $12,000
                         per year for two years. As was customary with sculptors until the last half
                         of the twentieth century, the artist&apos;s contract covered other costs as
                         well and, in the case of Daniels, the $65 per week paid to the stone
                         cutters was subtracted from his salary.</p>
                    <p>During his work on the model for the memorial, Daniels, who had a strong
                         interest in Lincoln statuary, and had earlier completed a portrait bust of
                         Lincoln for the ILU, became personally invested in the design of the
                         panels, and he absorbed the cost of drafting the designs out of his own
                         pocket to create sketches designed to impress the executive committee. And
                         impressed they were, as was noted sculptor Lee Lawrie, retained by the ILU
                         as a consultant and to whom the committee had submitted Daniels&apos;s

                         high and bas-relief panels evoke a suggestion of ancient Egyptian
                         inspiration, while on the other hand, they figuratively reflect a myriad of
                         WPA art projects completed during the 1930s, with their slightly
                         exaggerated figures and forms. Nine quotes, from a variety of Lincoln
                         sources including state papers, speeches, and letters, are incised into the
                         stone above each panel and above the four cloister entrances. These quotes
                         are connected to different Lincoln themes: A Supreme Being; Peace; Labor;
                         Liberty; Democracy; Friendship; Law and Order; and Right and Duty. Each of
                         the quotes, set above the five panels, is relevant to the scene
                         beneath.</p>
                    <p>Standing in the Memorial Court, and facing the memorial, visitors first
                         encounter, on their left, the easternmost panel, &quot;<hi rend="i"

                         1809-1816</hi>.&quot; Here they see Lincoln as a seven-year-old boy,
                         transfixed by the words of Christopher Columbus Graham, a traveler and
                         outsider whose stories cast their spell on the impressionable child. Others
                         in the panel include Jesse LaFollette (grandfather of the future Senator
                         Robert LaFollette from <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007922"

                         Nancy Lincoln, and Sarah Lincoln (who stands working a butter churn), and
                         local schoolteacher Caleb Hazel. A log cabin serves as a reminder of that
                         element of the Lincoln lore, particularly his homes at Sinking Spring and

                    <p>The second panel, &quot;<hi rend="i">Indiana 1816-1830</hi>,&quot; depicts
                         Lincoln as a muscular and thick-limbed young man, doing what he was
                         sometimes best known for -- splitting rails. He stands in the center of the
                         panel with an axe held in his left hand, its head resting on the ground.
                         The players in this drama consist of Justice David Turner (who first
                         brought the law to Lincoln&apos;s attention) and his friend Allen Gentry
                         (who accompanied Lincoln on a trip to <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         have been apocryphal, as some say it was on this trip that Lincoln first
                         witnessed slavery.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> In the image, Thomas Lincoln holds
                         one end of a log, while Nathaniel Grigsby, Lincoln&apos;s brother-in-law,
                         holds the other. Dennis Hanks, cousin of Nancy Hanks (and someone who would
                         play a role in giving Lincoln his nickname of &quot;rail-splitter&quot;),
                         also appears in the panel, as does Lincoln&apos;s stepmother, Sarah Bush

                         figure of Lincoln kneels a freedman, seemingly offering supplication. As a
                         gesture of freedom and hope the former slave&apos;s shackles are broken.
                         Interestingly, this is one of only nine African American figures
                         represented within the plethora of Lincoln statues across the

                         allegorical figures complete the scene: Clio, the Muse of History, who
                         records Lincoln&apos;s deeds on a scroll; and Columbia, who presents
                         Lincoln with a laurel wreath in homage from the nation. The White House and
                         a cabin stand in low relief, symbolizing Lincoln&apos;s rise from humble

                         including John Stewart, Stephen Logan, and William Herndon. Lincoln shakes
                         the hand of his best friend Joshua Speed while Mary Todd Lincoln, Simon

                         of the Civil War and the sacrifices citizens made for Union victory. A

                              August 23, 1857. With little education but an active mind, Louis took
                              a special interest in the students, faculty, and administration at

                              president each Christmas. Weik&apos;s father determined to impress his
                              son with the value of education and to introduce him to the wider

                              the active correspondence Herndon maintained with notables of the day,
                              bringing people and ideas to the office for Lincoln to encounter.</p>

                         <p>Indeed, glimpses throughout Jesse Weik&apos;s early life consistently
                              suggest strong interest in the world of ideas and a particular
                              interest in well-known public figures, and his occasional brushes with
                              prominent men fit nicely alongside his very long interest in the world
                              of government and politics.</p>
                         <p>The involvement intensified while Weik was an Asbury student. He was a
                              member of the Philological Literary Society, a precursor to the modern
                              fraternity system, and one of the two rival groups at Asbury which
                              served as the school&apos;s chief extracurricular activity at the
                              time. Weik even held leadership positions there in his later college
                              days, with the society electing him its vice-president at the end of
                              his junior year. He ran for president, but was &quot;gloriously
                                   defeated.&quot;<hi rend="sup">14</hi> When Weik graduated, he
                              delivered the valedictory for his &quot;own beloved Philo
                                   Society.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi></p>
                         <p>He also was a member of the &quot;Good Templars Lodge,&quot; a
                              fraternity modeled on freemasonry and which advocated temperance.<hi

                              which he held but briefly), and he served on a committee regarding
                              literary exercises. He went to the Grand Lodge of Good Templars in
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                              staunchly supported Lincoln in 1860 that he had his sons pick him up
                              and carry him to the polls, despite a leg injury that confined him to

                         <p>This commitment to the Republican Party during a period of its
                              ascendancy worked in concert with Weik&apos;s own energy, and placed
                              him well for participating in the patronage system. Even before he
                              published with Herndon, Weik was considered a rising star in the

                              Clerk of the Indiana Supreme Court. One newspaper recounted his
                              reaction to this defeat, saying that he &quot;poured forth his
                              sentiments on the occasion in a flowery speech in German&quot; at the
                              Republican state convention.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In 1900, Weik

                         <p>These serial political ventures once resulted in a nationally-noticed
                              indictment. After serving as a postal inspector under Benjamin
                              Harrison, Weik forged the new Postmaster General&apos;s signature and
                              continued using his credentials to travel on railroads across the
                              country. Tipped off, the government sent an inspector to track him
                              down, and the inspector caught Weik in the act of offering the forged
                              pass to a conductor on the <placeName><settlement type="city"

                              inspector asked the conductor to secure Weik&apos;s credentials, Weik
                              somehow became conscious of his predicament and jumped off the moving
                              train, seriously injuring himself. The credentials then went missing
                              for a time, so the only charges initially brought were three counts of
                              impersonating an officer. A railroad section hand, however, eventually
                              found the forged documentation in a cattle guard near where Weik
                              jumped off. The District Attorney thereafter pressed the fourth, most
                              serious charge -- forging the name of Postmaster General Charles Emory
                              Smith -- and the news made the papers around the nation.<hi rend="sup"

                              sent him a page from one of Lincoln&apos;s handwritten notebooks.<hi

                              of them rummaged through boxes of Lincoln papers. Weik&apos;s delight
                              in this encounter prompted him to further research on his own,
                              interviewing individuals who had known Lincoln (including
                              Lincoln&apos;s sister-in-law Mrs. Ninian Edwards) and visiting old
                              courthouses. Weik would later tell his daughter about his assessment

                              continued his correspondence with Herndon. After Weik asked Herndon

                              replete with details about Lincoln&apos;s pre-presidential life. In
                              July 1886, Weik contributed a Lincoln article to the <hi rend="i"

                         <p>Besides corresponding with Herndon, Weik spent his time in

                              Jesse&apos;s brothers were away or off at school, so he assumed the
                              role of dutiful oldest son and worked as the store clerk, eventually
                              earning a partnership with his father. He moved into a room above the
                              store, &quot;where he could slip away now and then from behind the
                              counter to work at his writing upstairs.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>Herndon came to see Weik occasionally, starting in March 1885, and
                              occasionally lectured at DePauw. It was during this time, as Herndon
                              told Weik more stories about Lincoln, when Herndon put forth his
                              theory that Lincoln&apos;s conception was a result of his
                              mother&apos;s infidelity. In fact, Herndon still desired to write a
                              full Lincoln biography, but did not enjoy the mechanics of writing.<hi
                                   rend="sup">35</hi> Eventually he wrote to Weik asking if he would
                              be interested in writing a book about Lincoln, and they soon began
                              planning a series of articles to be published in book form.</p>
                         <p>In 1886, the two of them drew up a contract and Herndon sent Weik what
                              he called his &quot;Lincoln Records,&quot; the archive of letters,
                              interviews, and research materials he had assembled over time,
                              including testimony of some 250 informants. Herndon envisioned a
                              subjective, unconventional, nonlinear biography of Lincoln&apos;s life
                              emphasizing Lincoln&apos;s special qualities, rather than a
                              traditional narrative presentation, but Weik pictured a narrative,
                              chronological format ending when Lincoln became president,
                              &quot;leaving him a grand figure standing up against the clear deep

                              Herndon produced dozens of chapters on various topics, designed to be
                              rough drafts which Weik was to compile and edit, but Weik found them
                              almost impossible to work with.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> After this
                              month-long writing session, Herndon was worn out and considered the
                              book basically complete, so he took a train back to

                              Weik, who viewed the biography as far from finished, immediately began
                              revising it, perhaps unbeknownst to Herndon.</p>
                         <p>Weik transformed the text of the biography, attempting to maintain the
                              essence of Herndon&apos;s passages while improving the language and
                              flow. He filtered Herndon&apos;s views, making the passages more
                              upbeat and probably enhancing the biography&apos;s eventual appeal to
                              the general public. He also took liberties when summarizing the
                              contents of some of Herndon&apos;s interviews,<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                         <p>The Herndon-Weik biography faced strong competition. A recently written
                              biography by John Hay and John G. Nicolay, Lincoln&apos;s wartime
                              secretaries, was serialized in <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi> and
                              later published as their ten-volume <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln: A
                                   History</hi>.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Because Hay and Nicolay
                              focused on Lincoln&apos;s presidential years, though, Herndon did not
                              view their work as competition; after all, the Herndon-Weik book was
                              about Lincoln&apos;s personal life before the White House. Many
                              publishers disagreed, though, believing that the Nicolay-Hay biography
                              had cornered the market.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Another source of worry
                              was the costly failure of Ward Hill Lamon&apos;s 1872 biography.<hi
                                   rend="sup">45</hi> Lamon&apos;s work was based on papers he had
                              purchased from Herndon, and the public rejected it due to some controversial contents.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> These included references to
                              Lincoln&apos;s and his mother&apos;s illegitimate births, his
                              &quot;shrewd game&quot; of masquerading as a Christian, and his
                              domestic difficulties.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> The Herndon-Weik
                              biography contained similar passages likely to offend.</p>

                         <p>After suffering multiple rejections by publishers, Herndon and Weik
                              finally settled on Belford, Clarke &amp; Company of
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"

                              rate outfit with a reputation for reckless business practices and a
                              lack of concern regarding criticism.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The company
                              viewed the Herndon-Weik biography as a good opportunity to gain
                              publicity. The publishers&apos; deal was a tough one: they took all
                              revenue from the sale of the first 1,500 copies, and any profits above
                              that were to be equally divided between the publishers and Weik.</p>
                         <p>After the manuscript went to the press, Herndon and Weik discovered that
                              quite a few tasks remained, including finding people who had known
                              Lincoln and were willing to have their photographs published in the
                              book. Weik and Herndon soon became frustrated with their publisher,
                              too, who had unilaterally decided to change the title and to remove
                              long passages dealing with Lincoln&apos;s early life. When Herndon
                              received the page proofs, he suggested many corrections to the text;
                              since making corrections at that stage would have been costly, most
                              were subsequently disregarded.</p>
                         <p>During the final editing, Ridpath encouraged him to take a greater
                              ownership role in the product, rather than merely being listed as an
                              editor. The publisher agreed that the book should include a statement
                              describing Herndon and Weik&apos;s roles in its creation. Weik
                              submitted a new preface for Herndon&apos;s approval. He gave himself
                              exclusive credit for composing the biography, while Herndon received
                              credit for gathering information. Herndon was insulted and responded
                              that the new preface would ruin the book because it was supposed to be
                              from Herndon&apos;s vantage point. The eventual resolution was
                              amicable, with Herndon and Weik listed as coauthors on the title page
                              and Herndon given additional credit in the preface for his work
                              collecting material.</p>
                         <p>After what Herndon considered painstaking delay, the book was finally
                              released in July 1889 as <hi rend="i">Herndon&apos;s Lincoln: The True

                              $4.50 and $9.00, depending on the material in which it was bound. It
                              was well-received by many critics, who had feared a far more
                              disparaging account of Lincoln&apos;s life. The <hi rend="i">Illinois

                              there were negative evaluations -- <hi rend="i">Life</hi> called it
                              &quot;lacking the finish of expert work&quot; -- but they were far
                              outweighed by the positive reviews.<hi rend="sup">51</hi></p>
                         <p>Unfortunately, the relatively short press run soon made copies hard to
                              find, especially after the publisher went bankrupt. Worse, when the
                              book was eventually re-released, though it was published in its
                              original form, it was advertised as a second edition. Herndon&apos;s
                              dreamy anticipation of royalties foundered still further when Belford
                              Clark Company distributed only $110 to the authors, claiming that many
                              of the newly printed copies had been distributed to reviewers. Herndon
                              was furious; he even momentarily accused Weik of conspiring with the
                              publishers, before later apologizing. In the end, the absence of the
                              hoped-for profit levels largely reflected the fact that neither
                              Herndon nor Weik was a particularly savvy businessman.</p>
                         <p>Luckily, Horace White of the <hi rend="i">New York Evening Post</hi>,
                              who had covered Lincoln and Douglas for the <hi rend="i">Chicago
                                   Tribune</hi>, was willing to get involved. He gave Weik and
                              Herndon suggestions (such as proposing to remove a few of the more
                              controversial segments of the book), and took a substantial role in
                              managing their affairs. For the third edition, White found a more
                              reputable publisher, Charles Scribner&apos;s Sons. Herndon and Weik
                              were working on this new edition when Herndon died in 1891. In 1892,
                              Weik published the revised version of the book, titled <list

                         <p>From early in Weik&apos;s life, he displayed an interest in public
                              speaking and writing. He was elected the second essayist at
                              commencement during his junior year at Asbury, where he delivered a
                              work titled &quot;This one thing I do.&quot;<hi rend="sup">52</hi> In
                              Weik&apos;s senior year, he delivered a second speech, titled
                              &quot;Out of the Ruts.&quot;<hi rend="sup">53</hi> From his youth
                              onward, Weik likewise frequently spread his opinions in print,
                              contributing to the <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         <p>By the time of his encounters with Herndon, Weik was already reaching
                              out to papers once more, this time in other states. He submitted an
                              article to the <hi rend="i">Cincinnati Commercial Gazette</hi> while
                              he was collaborating with Herndon in July 1886, but the paper did not
                              credit his work or pay him. The half-page article detailed the
                              collection of J. W. Keyes. A <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         <p>Weik&apos;s writing frequently focused on Lincoln. Weik quoted Herndon,
                              &quot;Lincoln read less and thought more than any other man of his day
                              and generation,&quot;<hi rend="sup">56</hi> and wrote an essay titled
                              &quot;Some Traces of Lincoln&apos;s Eloquence,&quot; about the second
                              inaugural, attributing some of its tone and content to Horace White.

                              nature of these orations, observing that a Weik lecture &quot;differs
                              from all other Lincoln lectures in that it is a vivid and realistic
                              transcript of the man himself.&quot;<hi rend="sup">62</hi></p>
                         <p>As national interest in Lincoln grew and Lincoln organizations appeared
                              and expanded, Weik became a desired commodity. When the flagship

                              communities vying for a spot along the route, and the campaign for
                              commission appointments had been hotly contested. Several of
                              Weik&apos;s friends wrote the governor to recommend him, and Weik
                              eventually became the commission&apos;s secretary. The commission
                              caused quite a controversy, and as soon as it issued a final report in
                              late December 1916, the Indiana General Assembly sought to begin a
                              second study.<hi rend="sup">66</hi></p>
                         <p>Still, Weik was not finished with serious volumes. He continued to build
                              Herndon&apos;s Lincoln archive, and in 1922, published a book titled
                                   <hi rend="i">The Real Lincoln: A Portrait</hi>. Weik told people
                              that Leonard Swett, who rode the circuit with Lincoln as a fellow
                              lawyer, had prodded him to follow up the Herndon biography -- which Swett
                              and several other Lincoln contemporaries had perceived as falling
                              short. More precisely, Swett emphasized that Lincoln&apos;s greatest
                              abilities were as a lawyer, not as a statesman. He encouraged Weik to
                              reveal this part of the president&apos;s life more thoroughly. Weik
                              determined to frame the book so that Lincoln&apos;s &quot;office and
                              his home should be made to swing open and the light turned on so that
                              we may indeed view him as a man.&quot;<hi rend="sup">67</hi> He worked

                              with just enough historical matter to give it the appearance of having

                              undersold his 530-page product. To be sure, the book contained

                              featured lengthy pieces about the founding of the party and about the
                              Lincoln years, plus reports on every national convention from 1856 on.
                              Weik&apos;s introduction declared that the Republican Party had
                              forwarded &quot;a decided advance in the civilization of the

                              a slow and careful process, for he saw it as a kind of great mosaic,
                              into which each carefully researched fact would fit and add its
                              pattern. If the parts were untrue or falsely colored, the whole, he
                              felt, was betrayed.&quot;<hi rend="sup">80</hi> According to his

                              made sensitive by local jests&quot; about his long obsession over

                              spent most of his day at home, dressed like a farmer in faded blue

                              face. Early in the morning he would go to work in his garden -- some
                              hours after, in a dripping sweat, he would come indoors, down a huge
                              cup of cold cistern water, and go upstairs to his desk. There he would
                              study and write, in a small, neat, illegible hand, with few
                              corrections. At 3 in the afternoon he would go down to the telephone
                              office, where a bookkeeper he trusted kept meticulous accounts and
                              listened to customers&apos; complaints. When he walked home at
                              suppertime (we never had a carriage or a car) he brought office

                         <p>Despite his renown, Weik never earned any real money from the activity
                              that brought him both the most fame and greatest satisfaction. This
                              conclusion leads to the obvious question, &quot;how did Jesse Weik
                              keep a roof over his head for forty years?&quot; The answer is that he
                              did a little bit of a good many things -- a &quot;bread and butter
                              struggle,&quot; he once called it -- to sustain his passion for
                                   writing.<hi rend="sup">85</hi></p>
                         <p>Of course, during Weik&apos;s early years as a young adult, he could
                              frequently be found on duty in Louis Weik&apos;s fairly successful
                              grocery. It was plain enough that even as early as 1875, he intended
                              to reach for grander things. &quot;I trust there is something better
                              in store for me,&quot; Weik told his diary.<hi rend="sup">86</hi></p>
                         <p>One way of &quot;getting out&quot; was to become a lawyer. Weik inquired

                              his first trial, he represented a laborer who sued his employer for
                              payment. As it turned out, his client admitted at trial that he had
                              been paid in the form of room and board as well as cash. According to
                              Weik&apos;s diary, one of the people who hired the employer was named

                              and he established the Greencastle Telephone Company with Frank

                              system. The Greencastle Telephone Company was a member of the
                              Independent Telephone Association, which served to counter Bell&apos;s

                              meeting, the association elected Jesse Weik to its executive committee
                              and chose him to represent it at the upcoming meeting of the

                         <p>As was his wont, Weik began writing about telephone issues. When an

                              of telephones in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                              generated a wide response, the magazine asked Weik to outline the case
                              for the independents. Titled &quot;The Telephone Movement: Another
                              Point of View,&quot; the article outlined the development of the
                              telephone by several inventors, not simply by Alexander Bell.<hi

                         <p>Weik&apos;s article defended the independent telephone movement with the
                              thesis that having local control is better for customers and citizens -- 
                              not just those in cities -- and that having more operators necessarily
                              means more innovators. In his closing, Weik makes this bold
                              prediction: &quot;Perhaps someday we may be able to see as well as
                              speak to our friend at the other end of the line; and the line may be,
                              after all, not a wire, but a stratum of blue ether extending through
                              infinite space.&quot;<hi rend="sup">95</hi></p>
                         <p>Beyond the capital he accumulated in the telephone business, Weik&apos;s
                              largest asset was still in his possession when he died -- his Lincoln
                              collection, much of which came from Herndon. Even at the time of the

                    <p>For a century-and-a-half, the standard edition of the great debates between
                         Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas was in essence a collection of
                         newspaper articles that Lincoln himself had gathered, pasted into a
                         scrapbook, and sent off to a publisher. Lincoln felt the fairest transcript
                         for each participant was the version printed by the partisan newspaper
                         supporting each candidate: the <hi rend="i">Chicago Times</hi> for Douglas,
                         and the <hi rend="i">Chicago Tribune</hi> for Lincoln. More recently,
                         Harold Holzer published an edition of the debates which reversed that
                         method, providing the opposing papers&apos; accounts of each man&apos;s
                         speech. Now, two distinguished Lincoln scholars, Douglas L. Wilson and
                         Rodney O. Davis, have created a new version of these debates that remedies
                         many ills of the previous editions. The Davis-Wilson edition largely relies
                         on the original Lincoln method, except when it appears that a fusion of the
                         texts furnishes a more reliable account of what the participants actually
                         said. The result is probably the most accurate version of the debates ever
                         produced.</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">The Lincoln-Douglas Debates</hi>, Davis and Wilson have also
                         provided pithy and informative introductions to each debate, where the
                         historical context surrounding that particular moment within the election
                         contest is cogently explained. In addition, annotation and a glossary are
                         included, and since Davis and Wilson are immensely knowledgeable Lincoln
                         scholars, this annotation reflects the breadth of their expertise. Previous
                         editions were typically not annotated, leaving modern readers without <pb
                              n="392" id="VAA4025-105-4-094"/> explanations for certain nineteenth-
                         century colloquialisms or for various references to obscure subjects such
                         as the Toombs bill. To the great benefit of non-specialists, that absence
                         has now been remedied. For example, in the opening debate at
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2029529" reg="Ottawa"
                                   >Ottawa</settlement></placeName>, Douglas declared that while he
                         disagreed with Lincoln on politics, he had known Lincoln for twenty-five
                         years, and did not intend to be insulting. He then promptly launched into
                         an insulting reminiscence on Lincoln&apos;s personal life and political
                         career, including a description of Lincoln as a grocery keeper in
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2029294"
                                   reg="New Salem">New Salem</settlement></placeName>, known for his
                         skill in wrestling and &quot;pitching quoits or tossing a copper.&quot;
                         Davis and Wilson helpfully explain that in antebellum parlance, a grocery
                         keeper was a liquor salesman, and pitching quoits was a kind of ring toss
                         game. Lincoln&apos;s tendency was to lurch into the highly-specialized
                         language of an attorney, an opaque legalese which must have been lost on
                         his contemporary audience, let alone modern readers. For example, at that
                         same <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2029529" reg="Ottawa"
                                   >Ottawa</settlement></placeName> debate, Lincoln said &quot;I
                         know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but I feel that
                         I have got him. I demur to that plea. I waive all objections that it was
                         not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the
                         merits&quot;(p. 26). Thankfully, this and other instances of Lincoln&apos;s
                         recurrent legal speak are carefully defined in the accompanying
                         annotation.</p>
                    <p>In the scholarly introduction to the <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_2027931" reg="Freeport"
                              >Freeport</settlement></placeName> debate, Davis and Wilson offer
                         sagacious comments on Douglas&apos;s declaration that despite the Dred
                         Scott decision, the citizens of a territory could still prohibit slavery by
                         withholding any local regulations protecting it. The editors point out that
                         Douglas had said this several times prior to <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_2027931" reg="Freeport"
                                   >Freeport</settlement></placeName>, however, in part to help his
                         standing with <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251"
                                   reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName> Democrats. Further,
                         the South was already alienated from Douglas due to his dramatic opposition
                         to the Lecompton Constitution. Thus the significance of Douglas&apos;s
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027931"
                                   reg="Freeport">Freeport</settlement></placeName> statement,
                         subsequently pretentiously dubbed the Freeport Doctrine, has been
                         overblown.</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates That Defined America</hi>,
                         Allen Guelzo has written a superb narrative history of the debates. It will
                         be a revelation to those unfamiliar with the intricacies of
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region></placeName> politics in the antebellum period.
                         In addition, the book provides wonderful portraits of the personal
                         appearances and styles of the two protagonists: Lincoln, tremendously tall
                         and often awkward, slow at the beginning of his speeches, but growing more
                         animated as he spoke, and jabbing with his forefinger to emphasize a point;
                         Douglas, short and portly -- in Guelzo&apos;s clever hands, he looks
                         &quot;like Humpty Dumpty in a toupee&quot; -- speaking with a fiery passion
                         that witnesses said seemed to erupt from him as he restlessly stalked the
                         stage, occasionally raising his fist in excitement (p. 99). Further, Guelzo
                         portrays Douglas as a compulsive risk-taker who accepted Lincoln&apos;s <pb
                              n="393" id="VAA4025-105-4-095"/> challenge to a series of debates-even
                         though meeting Lincoln face-to-face held little advantage for Douglas -- 
                         because the competitor and gambler in him relished the prospect of the
                         cut-and-thrust of a debate waged with his political career hanging in the
                         balance.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, Guelzo correctly delineates the key aspect of the great
                         contest: specifically, that the election turned on an appeal to the Old
                         Whigs. The northern portion of <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>
                         was solidly Republican in 1858, and the southern counties solidly
                         Democratic. The contest would therefore be decided in the geographical
                         center, or what Guelzo calls the Whig belt: counties with large numbers of
                         former Whigs who disliked both slavery and abolitionism, and who tended to
                         act as swing voters.</p>
                    <p>It was to these Old Whigs that Douglas pitched his nakedly racist attack on
                         the Republican Party in general, and on Lincoln in specific, as supporters
                         of black equality and racial co-mingling; Douglas&apos;s disreputable
                         tactic unfortunately had an impact on an audience overwhelmingly racist in
                         its attitudes and assumptions regarding black Americans. To alarm the Whigs
                         further, Douglas also sought to characterize Lincoln as a dangerous radical
                         who defied the Supreme Court and incited sectional war.</p>
                    <p>Guelzo then depicts Lincoln&apos;s attempts to politically navigate in this
                         suddenly difficult environment, on one hand trying to assure the Old Whigs
                         of his stolid conservatism, while on the other hand still retaining his
                         Republican coalition. Even before the race began, some Republicans had
                         wanted to endorse Douglas because of his opposition to the infamous
                         Lecompton Constitution; Lincoln&apos;s House Divided speech reminded these
                         wavering Republicans why Douglas was unacceptable. However, Lincoln&apos;s
                         rhetoric in the speech -- coupled with Douglas&apos;s racist
                         attacks -- discomfited the voters of the Whig belt. Guelzo then goes on to
                         provide the historical context explaining Lincoln&apos;s startling
                         statement -- made at the opening of the Charleston debate -- that he did not
                         favor black equality either. Guelzo argues that the Charleston statement,
                         made after Lincoln had explicitly said in earlier speeches that black
                         Americans were entitled to the natural rights promised in the Declaration
                         of Independence, was an attempt at pandering to the racist Old Whigs, and
                         Lincoln deserves no credit for it.</p>
                    <p>Both of the books represent seminal studies of the Lincoln-Douglas debates
                         that will be standard references for many years. Each will be required
                         reading, along with Harry Jaffa&apos;s timeless study, for students of the

                    <p>William E. Bartelt spent several summers guiding tourists through
                         Lincoln&apos;s Boyhood Home in <placeName><region type="county"

                         through the various texts that provide much of the knowledge about
                         Lincoln&apos;s boyhood. In one sense, the book is a collection of primary
                         sources; but rather than following the typical format of such collections,
                         Bartelt instead renders a narrative, with the key source materials tucked
                         into chapters that introduce and expand upon them. This narrative format is
                         certainly more approachable for general readers seeking information on
                         Lincoln&apos;s years in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Much of Bartelt&apos;s material is taken from the William Herndon interviews
                         and letters. Herndon, Lincoln&apos;s <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>
                         law partner, began gathering material on Lincoln&apos;s life soon after the
                         1865 assassination. Additional material includes Lincoln&apos;s own short
                         descriptions of life in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, manuscript and land
                         records, and excerpts from records of the church Lincoln attended in his
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> youth. Not every pertinent document
                         is included, but Bartelt has made judicious choices, and his accompanying
                         narrative provides some low-level analysis. For the most part, however, the
                         documents just sit on the page, open for readers to interpret.
                         Bartelt&apos;s background information is generally useful, although his
                         approach to politics in the 1820s seems rushed. And a deeper discussion of
                         the meaning of the &quot;Articles of Faith&quot; of the Little Pigeon
                         Baptist Church, as detailed in John E Cady&apos;s 1941 article in this
                         journal, might give readers a far better sense of the particular Calvinist-
                         tinted theology that was a part of Lincoln&apos;s upbringing.</p>
                    <p>This intrinsically interesting collection, however, may have missed a larger
                         opportunity. Much recent scholarship has focused on the issues of memory,
                         and clearly any book focusing on 1865 remembrances of <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName> in the 1820s must contend with the
                         complicated subject of memory, both as an object of historical study and as
                         a barrier to historical analysis. To give one example: many of the
                                   <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_2000555" reg="Spencer"
                                   >Spencer</region></placeName> county interviews reveal similar
                         stories, perhaps because when Lincoln rose to national prominence, much
                         storytelling took place within the community. The interviews reflected
                         communal memories. Obviously, a book aimed at a general readership is not
                         going to confront the theoretical issues that intrigue university-based
                         historians, but this volume would have provided a good chance to introduce
                         the &quot;history of memory&quot; to a lay audience.</p>

                    <p>One trend in Lincoln scholarship over the last fifteen years has been an
                         increased interest in the pre-presidential Lincoln. The most obvious
                         example is the massive Lincoln Legal Papers project that collected and
                         digitized nearly 100,000 documents, which were published in 2000 in a
                         DVD-set, and are now available on the web. Scholars such as Michael
                         Burlingame, Kenneth J. Winkle, and Douglas L. Wilson have added
                         considerably to our knowledge of Lincoln before <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia"
                                   >Washington</settlement></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Like these scholars, William C. Harris is also interested in the
                         prepresidential Lincoln. While he is indebted to their work, he has a
                         different focus. Harris is interested in Lincoln&apos;s &quot;remarkable
                         political rise from obscurity to his inauguration as president&quot; (p.
                         3). Here, he is on ground that, surprisingly, is not welltrod. The last
                         books to examine Lincoln&apos;s political career in <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                              >Illinois</region></placeName> in such detail were Don E.
                         Fehrenbacher&apos;s <hi rend="i">Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the
                              1850s</hi> (1962) and Paul E Simon, <hi rend="i">Lincoln&apos;s

                                        key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region></placeName> Legislative Years</hi> (1965).
                         Two-score-and-two years later, Harris&apos;s well-written and
                         well-researched book fills a gap in Lincoln scholarship.</p>
                    <p>In looking at Lincoln&apos;s rise in politics, Harris stresses Lincoln&apos;s
                         brand of conservatism. Harris concludes that Lincoln&apos;s conservatism
                         was &quot;rooted in his background as a Henry Clay Whig, his close
                         association with border state rural people, his cautious nature, and the
                         racial and political realities he faced in central <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                              >Illinois</region></placeName>&quot; (p. 2). This conservatism was
                         evident in Lincoln&apos;s 1838 address on &quot;The Perpetuation of Our
                         Political Institutions,&quot; where he sounded a common Whig theme of
                         reverence for law and the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Early on in his political career, however, Lincoln also evidenced his <pb
                              n="396" id="VAA4025-105-4-098"/> antislavery principles. In the
                         Lincoln-Stone Protest of 1837, Lincoln and his fellow Whig said slavery
                         was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot; There, Lincoln
                         parted company with many &quot;conservative&quot; Whigs who were more than
                         willing to accommodate Southern slavery. Harris could have done a better
                         job here of explaining Lincoln&apos;s brand of antislavery
                         conservatism.</p>
                    <p>Harris devotes two chapters on the 1858 senate campaign, with one chapter
                         focusing on the political and social context of the campaign, and the other
                         on the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Lincoln sought statewide office in a state
                         where the overwhelming majority of voters believed in white supremacy.
                         Lincoln managed, however, to both share the racism of white Illinoisans and
                         to simultaneously base his opposition to slavery upon moral grounds. When
                         compared to most white Illinoisans, Lincoln&apos;s racial prejudice appears
                         mild; when compared to Douglas, Lincoln looks downright egalitarian.</p>
                    <p>Despite his loss, Lincoln&apos;s failed senate campaign established him as a
                         viable candidate for president. In the last five chapters, Harris covers
                         the 1860 campaign, Lincoln&apos;s election, and subsequent &quot;secession
                         winter.&quot; He does a good job describing how Lincoln ended up as the
                         Republican nominee at the <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         convention, and provides vivid details of the presidential election in
                         various Northern states. Harris concludes that Lincoln should not be
                         criticized for failing to support compromise efforts during the winter of
                         1860-1861. It is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that Lincoln&apos;s support
                         for concessions &quot;would have checked secession in the lower South,
                         prevented the formation of the Confederate States, or headed off an armed
                         clash between the two sides&quot; (p. 294). Harris does not defend
                         Lincoln&apos;s refusal to issue a statement reassuring Southerners after
                         his election. While such a statement would not have mollified the lower
                         South, it could have &quot;had a salutary effect&quot; on the upper and
                         border South and calmed Northerners (p. 295).</p>
                    <p>Whether intended or not, Harris&apos;s excellent study serves as a fine
                         complement to Philip Shaw Paludan&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Presidency of
                              Abraham Lincoln</hi> (1994), which also was published by the
                         University Press of Kansas. In this age of declining budgets for university
                         presses, the University Press of Kansas is to be applauded for including
                         fourteen well-chosen illustrations.</p>

                    <p>Many citizens and scholars have difficulty confronting unpleasant realities
                         in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                              >U.S.</country></placeName> history. A celebratory approach to the
                         nation&apos;s story and the &quot;great man&quot; tradition all too often
                         cast their spells, sowing confusion whenever the historical record falls
                         short of idealistic expectations. This problem is especially acute in
                         writings about Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln has become, as James McPherson
                         puts it, &quot;the deity of American civil religion.&quot; It is likewise
                         evident -- but fortunately not dominant -- in this volume.</p>
                    <p>Illustrating the problem, Allen Guelzo writes in the foreword that if Lincoln
                         &quot;was a white supremacist&quot; then his &quot;every other
                         accomplishment ... falls into discredit&quot; (p. viii). Guelzo thus
                         focuses on Lincoln&apos;s attitudes, anxious to show that Lincoln&apos;s
                         thoughts or feelings were not racist. Similarly, an essay by Phillip
                         Paludan labors awkwardly to put a favorable gloss on Lincoln&apos;s
                         advocacy of colonization to black leaders in August of 1862. To ward off
                         negative conclusions about Lincoln, Paludan also makes some sound
                         observations about human complexity and the dangers of &quot;essentializ

                    <p>Fortunately, most of this volume&apos;s contributors avoid the trap of trying
                         to make Lincoln perfect. Kenneth Winkle acknowledges that although Lincoln
                         &quot;rose above the deepest prejudices&quot; of his day, &quot;he never
                         accepted the social and political equality of African Americans.&quot; He
                         saw racial prejudices as &quot;central to American society&quot; and
                         difficult to overcome (p. 10). Winkle&apos;s essay contains an admirably
                         thorough description of slavery and race relations in pre-Civil War
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region></placeName>. Winkle also discusses
                         Lincoln&apos;s opposition to abolitionism, his support of colonization, and
                         his belief that containing slavery and giving blacks &quot;basic if not
                         equal rights&quot; would put slavery in the course of ultimate extinction
                         (p. 28).</p>
                    <p>James Leiker carries forward the analysis of Lincoln&apos;s views on civil
                         and natural rights. In his view, Lincoln was &quot;no champion of
                         &apos;civil rights&apos; in the contemporary sense,&quot; since
                         nineteenth-century Americans saw &quot;blacks, Indians, women, and others
                         regarded as inferior&quot; as unable to discharge the responsibilities of
                         citizenship. Instead, Lincoln&apos;s &quot;progressivism lay in his
                         understanding of &apos;natural rights,&apos; those that lay outside the
                         realm of the state simply by virtue of being born human&quot; (p. 75). Such
                         &quot;natural rights&quot; entailed &quot;the economic freedom of all
                         humans . . . to compete in a fair marketplace&quot; (p. 92). Leiker
                         concludes that by applying &quot;impossible standards&quot; to Lincoln, we
                         have failed to appreciate his accomplishments in extending <pb n="398"
                              id="VAA4025-105-4-100"/> &quot;work that the founding generation had
                         left undone&quot; (p. 98).</p>
                    <p>Essays by Kevin R. C. Gutzman and Michael Vorenberg deal substantively with
                         Lincoln&apos;s interest in colonization. Gutzman examines similarities in
                         the racial thought of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. He also notes
                         the importance to Lincoln of Henry Clay, a life-long colonizationist, and
                         documents how consistently Lincoln advanced the idea. Though some scholars
                         try to explain away Lincoln&apos;s statements on colonization, Gutzman
                         concludes that &quot;It seems entirely likely that Lincoln continued to
                         hold to the Jeffersonian view ... that blacks were entitled to the
                         self-government [of] the Declaration of Independence ... but that ... they
                         could exercise it only &apos;upon [their] own soil&quot; (p. 72).
                         Vorenberg, meanwhile, points out that Lincoln may have continued to be
                         attracted to ideas of gradual emancipation and colonization -- even as events
                         pushed him in a different direction. He argues for the relevance of
                         Lincoln&apos;s Whig background and shows that Lincoln&apos;s support of
                         education for African Americans was not entirely different from the
                         priority placed on education by some of today&apos;s advocates for
                         reparations.</p>

                    <p>Accounts of the secession crisis of 1861 focus mostly on what Southerners did
                         to secede (the most recent example being William W. Freehling&apos;s <hi
                              rend="i">The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant</hi> [2007])
                         rather than what Northerners did to oppose it. Our primary accounts of the
                         Northern response are limited very largely to David M. Potter&apos;s early
                              <hi rend="i">Lincoln and His Party in the Secession Crisis</hi> (1942)
                         and Kenneth M. Stampp&apos;s <hi rend="i">And the War Came: The North and
                              the Secession Crisis, 1860-61</hi> (1950). But neither of those
                         outstanding works paid more than fleeting attention to that Northern
                         response outside the limited circle of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican
                         party&apos;s leadership, and the editors of prominent newspapers. This has
                         not been a particularly fashionable way of doing political histo- <pb
                              n="399" id="VAA4025-105-4-101"/> ry in the decades since Potter and
                         Stampp. But it is the burden of Russell McClintock&apos;s equally
                         outstanding book to demonstrate that, given the structures of American
                         party politics, those were exactly the people who mattered most.</p>
                    <p>McClintock builds his narrative of the secession crisis on three fundamental
                         discoveries: first, that secession was primarily a political crisis, not an
                         economic one (as in Stampp) or a cultural or personal one (as in
                         Freehling); second, that no matter what the trends, this was a crisis in
                         which a handful of &quot;great white men&quot; really did matter; and
                         third, that the &quot;decision for war&quot; was largely Lincoln&apos;s,
                         principally because Lincoln controlled the political options of the
                         Republican party.</p>
                    <p>It is one of the ironies of the secession crisis that the party most worried
                         about disunion was the Democratic party, and not the Republicans, who
                         affected a lofty refusal to believe that secession was anything more
                         serious than the usual Southern bluster (p. 41). The South, announced
                         Horace Greeley, &quot;could no more unite upon a scheme of secession than a
                         company of lunatics could conspire to break out of bedlam&quot; (p. 47).
                         Lincoln, especially, refused to offer olive branches to lure the
                         secessionists back; even on the one occasion when he did formulate a
                         statement of policy, he had Lyman Trumbull include it as part of one of
                         Trumbull&apos;s own speeches, rather than issuing it personally (p. 51).
                         Lincoln did occasionally make placatory gestures, but never offered real
                         compromise with the secessionists, assuming that Southern unionism would
                         eventually douse the secessionists&apos; fires (p. 91).</p>
                    <p>This did not mean that some Republicans had not taken enough alarm over
                         secession to begin advocating compromise. But the Republican compromisers
                         were concentrated in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007568"

                         Weed&apos;s formidable master, William H. Seward. But neither Weed&apos;s
                         nor Seward&apos;s political skills could persuade other Republicans to balk
                         at Lincoln&apos;s stubbornness. Even when public opinion uneasily began to
                         show a &quot;massive resurgence of pro-compromise support&quot; in February
                         and March of 1861, Lincoln ignored it, and Republican politicians who might
                         have been tempted to join the tide for compromise were too anxious for
                         patronage rewards to buck Lincoln&apos;s line (p. 145). Lincoln&apos;s
                         would be the last word, especially after Congress adjourned in March (p.
                         189).</p>
                    <p>McClintock acknowledges that in the final weeks preceding the Confederate
                         assault on Sumter, even Lincoln weakened in his resistance to compromise,
                         assuring Southern unionists that he would trade <placeName><region

                         immediate irritant of militant secessionism, Fort Sumter. But the mission
                         he sent to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007712"
                                   reg="South Carolina">South Carolina</region></placeName> to sound
                         out Southern opinion convinced him that Southern unionism was too weak <pb
                              n="400" id="VAA4025-105-4-102"/> a reed to rest upon; the iron entered
                         into Lincoln&apos;s soul and, in the face of Seward&apos;s pleas, he
                         authorized the relief expedition to Sumter which made armed confrontation
                         inevitable. In the end, all the &quot;efforts to promote compromise and
                         foster conciliation&quot; by Northern Democrats and Republican moderates
                         &quot;were thwarted at every turn&quot; by the fact that Lincoln commanded
                         &quot;the Republican Party machinery&quot; (p. 239). Far from compromising,
                         Lincoln &quot;deliberately discarded&quot; any realistic plan for relieving
                         Fort Sumter in favor of one which would maneuver the Confederates into
                         firing the first shot (p. 249). His plan yielded mixed results. It did
                         trigger massive anger in the North at the rebels -- uniting all parties across
                         the Northern spectrum -- but did not in the upper South; when Lincoln followed
                         Sumter with a call-out of the state militias, <placeName><region

                         Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>McClintock sees in this a vindication of Lincoln&apos;s political skills in
                         handling the winner-take-all powers that come to victorious political
                         parties in the American system. Of course, it could just as easily be
                         read -- and surely will be, by that untiring cadre of unreconstructed
                         Lincoln-haters -- as proof of a cruel Machiavellian streak in Lincoln that
                         sacrificed blood and lives to political intransigence. In fact,
                         McClintock&apos;s meticulous recounting of the weeks and days leading up to
                         the attack on Sumter shows its greatest weakness by failing to ask just why
                         Lincoln should have thought the relief expedition was, necessarily, a
                         decision for war. Lincoln had always believed that unionism was the default
                         position of all but a handful of Southerners, and running the clock was the
                         best way of giving Southern unionism a chance to regain control and rescind
                         secession. An unarmed relief expedition would keep that clock running -- a
                         fact which the secessionists understood all too well, since the longer the
                         upper South distanced itself from secession, the more absurd the
                         secessionists&apos; cause looked. Attacking Sumter before the expedition
                         could arrive was their only hope of forcing matters to a head in the upper
                         South. What resulted, as McClintock notes, played into Lincoln&apos;s
                         hands. It remains a question, though, whether this was the play Lincoln
                         really wanted to follow.</p>

                         and winner of a Pulitzer Prize for <hi rend="i">Battle Cry of Freedom</hi>
                         (1988), and a Lincoln Prize for <hi rend="i">For Cause and Comrades</hi>
                         (1997), applies his considerable expertise and talent to a subject
                         surprisingly under-examined: the role of Abraham Lincoln as Commander in
                         Chief during the Civil War. The fact that so little is written about so
                         important an element of Lincoln&apos;s presidency is surprising, and
                         McPherson&apos;s book is a welcome closing of that gap.</p>
                    <p>As the author notes, Lincoln was ill prepared for the job. As McPherson
                         writes, &quot;Lincoln faced a steep learning curve,&quot; and was
                         &quot;painfully aware that his adversary, Jefferson Davis, was much better
                         prepared for that daunting task&quot; (p. 2). Yet Lincoln had certain
                         assets as well. He possessed &quot;a keen analytical mind,&quot; and a
                         &quot;fierce determination to master any subject to which he applied
                         himself&quot; (p. 2). Given his lack of preparation, the surprise is that
                         Lincoln was &quot;a more hands-on commander in chief than any other
                         president&quot; (p. 5). Lincoln&apos;s involvement is especially evident in
                         his control of the five primary wartime functions: policy, national
                         strategy, military strategy, operations, and tactics.</p>
                    <p>Throughout, Lincoln always focused on his one major strategic goal: to
                         preserve the Union and restore (even reinvigorate) the spirit of 1776. This
                         defense of republican and democratic government came at a time when
                         democracy seemed threatened and in retreat across the globe. Thus,
                         President Lincoln&apos;s message was not merely for an American but for an
                         international audience. He was fighting to preserve self-government.</p>
                    <p>For Lincoln, there was no time for on-the-job training. Promptly faced with
                         the crisis of Fort Sumter (the first paper placed on his desk called for an
                         immediate decision on what to do about Sumter), it was clear that his
                         decisions would be consequential from day one. And from day one, Lincoln
                         demonstrated skill and insight. &quot;He made mistakes -- but he also learned
                         from those mistakes&quot; (p. 266). The talents to grow, to learn from
                         mistakes, and to be flexible and adaptable to new situations and changing
                         circumstances were trademarks of Lincoln&apos;s leadership style. Few
                         presidents master the ability to be fluid and readily adapt to change; most
                         rigidly dig in and continue doing what they are comfortable doing, rather
                         than facing what needs to be done (e.g. Lyndon Baines Johnson and
                                   <placeName><country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viêt Nam"
                                   >Vietnam</country></placeName>). A key to Lincoln&apos;s success
                         was his ability to bring military tactics in line with his political goals
                         and strategy. He always kept his <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-105-4-104"/> eye
                         on the end he wished to achieve, but was flexible in reaching that end.</p>
                    <p>One of the persistent and vexing controversies surrounding Lincoln as
                         Commander in Chief was his willingness to go beyond the law. Historians
                         differ in their evaluations of Lincoln&apos;s wartime policies on civil
                         liberties. McPherson, to this reviewer, skates rather quickly and somewhat
                         superficially over this controversy. He seems a bit too sanguine about
                         Lincoln&apos;s legal violations, and while &quot;necessity&quot; is a
                         powerful argument in Lincoln&apos;s favor, a more thorough examination,
                         incorporating a stronger stand by McPherson one way or the other, would
                         have been useful. On this McPherson instead steps gingerly, avoiding the
                         hard decisions, which is disappointing; the way Americans deal with this
                         controversy had implications not only in Lincoln&apos;s age, but also our
                         own.</p>
                    <p>McPherson is an excellent storyteller with a great story to tell. The reader
                         comes away once again amazed with the skill and acumen of Lincoln the man
                         and the leader. This book covers a remarkable man at a remarkable turning
                         point in United States history, and James McPherson once again establishes
                         himself as one of our more insightful Lincoln scholars.</p>

                    <p>Historically, wartime has been the most dangerous time for free speech in
                         American history. That has been true in virtually every war the country
                         has fought since the Revolution, but the suppression of speech during the
                         Civil War was perhaps the most bleakly paradoxical occasion. In the
                         country&apos;s bloodiest war, a war fought to liberate one group of
                         Americans <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-105-4-105"/> from the chains of slavery,
                         the civil liberties of a different group were stomped on, shredded, and
                         snuffed out by a government led by &quot;the Great Emancipator.&quot; The
                         irony of this is not lost on Iowa State University journalism professor
                         David W. Bulla in this new study of military censorship in Civil War-era
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Bulla&apos;s work follows a recent line of scholarship examining how civil
                         liberties fared in both the North and the South from 1861 to 1865. One of
                         the more prominent authors in this area is Mark Neely. In another ironic
                         turn, both Bulla and Neely have found that the Confederate press faced far
                         less interference from either military or other government sources. The
                         military suppression that Bulla specifically addresses was more common in
                         both the South and the North than was prior restraint by either of the
                         other branches of government.</p>
                    <p>To examine the issue of press suppression by military officials in the North,
                         Bulla turns his spotlight on the experiences of journalists in one
                         midwestern state during the spring of 1863. The tormentor in this case was
                         Milo S. Hascall, a Union general in command of the District of
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>For the most part, when a Civil War general silenced a journalist, he did so
                         to protect military operations. Hascall&apos;s reasoning was a bit
                         different, according to Bulla. Hascall had little cause to worry about harm
                         to military operations from anything <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         newspapers might publish; Indiana papers were far from the front, and by
                         the time they reached the field, their news would be too old to matter.</p>
                    <p>According to Bulla, Hascall&apos;s motivation was instead partisan politics.
                         Hascall was not so much a military tyrant as he was a loyal general and
                         Republican who believed journalistic dissent could undermine the Lincoln
                         administration and therefore should be stopped. Hascall, however, was
                         clever. He was selective about which Democratic newspapers he suppressed.
                         He went after any he was sure he could intimidate, such as papers from the
                         smaller towns where Republicans held the leading political offices, and
                         where few would be few willing to step forward to defend Democratic
                         editors.</p>
                    <p>Bulla builds his case methodically by examining Hascall&apos;s censorship
                         efforts against the backdrop of theoretical and historical perspectives on
                         American press freedom, including a section in his conclusion that compares
                         censorship during the Civil War to censorship during <placeName><country

                         These chapters could have benefited from a bit of deft editing by the
                         publisher, for while they cover important ground that helps contextualize
                         Bulla&apos;s arguments, they are almost overly ambitious in scope.</p>
                    <p>Bulla&apos;s case study is an important work. It offers a specific example
                         that complements Neely&apos;s work, and, more importantly, it also offers a
                         superb example of how political dissent on the local level was dealt with
                         in the guise of military administration. Fur- <pb n="404"

                         interested in the political history of <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> and
                         in the attitudes citizens held regarding the pressing political issues of
                         their day: emancipation and Union. Bulla writes with the authority of one
                         who knows his subject well, as indeed he does. Press suppression in the
                         North during the Civil War has been Bulla&apos;s primary interest since his
                         days as a graduate student, and he is presently expanding his work to
                         consider other midwestern states. This first book puts him well on the road
                         to completing this important work on the complex issue of how a country at
                         war over slavery could justify suppression of one of the most important
                         groups in any society, the press.</p>

                    <p>Ian Michael Spurgeon has written an intriguing and thoroughly researched
                         biography of controversial nineteenth-century American politician James
                         Henry Lane. During his colorful public career, Lane was a Mexican War
                         colonel, a Democratic congressman from <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, and
                         a free state advocate and Republican senator from <placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas"
                              >Kansas</region></placeName>. Due to the unique trajectory of
                         Lane&apos;s career, Spurgeon argues here that contemporaries and historians
                         alike have, however, consistently mischaracterized Lane as volatile,
                         irrational, unprincipled, and opportunistic. Spurgeon contends instead that
                         Lane&apos;s &quot;political odyssey&quot; was rational and consistent with
                         his overall and lifelong ideological commitment to popular sovereignty,
                         white supremacy, and unionism. By effectively utilizing Lane&apos;s
                         personal correspondence and speeches as well as relevant newspaper accounts
                         concerning Lane, Spurgeon analyzes Lane&apos;s personal tragedies and
                         political exploits within the context of American sectionalism.</p>
                    <p>Spurgeon indicates that Lane&apos;s political journey parallels the
                         experiences of other Americans navigating through the politically turbulent
                         antebellum period. As an example, Spurgeon examines Lane&apos;s endorsement
                         of the 1854 <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas"

                         Act along with his ardent support of Stephen <pb n="405"
                              id="VAA4025-105-4-107"/> Douglas and the Democratic Party. Like
                         Douglas, Lane was preeminently concerned with the needs and wants of
                         northern white Americans, believing that the principle of popular
                         sovereignty expressed in the act safeguarded the rights of these citizens
                         in the territories. Lane&apos;s support of the act, Spurgeon therefore
                         argues, represents his ongoing commitment to popular sovereignty and white
                         supremacy.</p>

                         1855, and though he continued to defend the doctrine of popular
                         sovereignty, while there he slowly gravitated toward the free state
                         ideology growing in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254"
                                   reg="Kansas">Kansas</region></placeName>. Spurgeon criticizes
                         historians for interpreting Lane&apos;s opposition to the proslavery
                         territorial government as opportunistic, instead viewing Lane&apos;s shift
                         as reflective of his long-standing political ideology. According to
                         Spurgeon, Lane&apos;s commitment to local power meant that he shared with
                         Lawrence residents -- whether anti-black free state proponents or morally
                         committed abolitionists -- an abhorrence for the proslavery forces in Kansas.
                         With Lane confronting an implacable proslavery territorial government,
                         Spurgeon interprets Lane&apos;s movement toward aggressive, even violent
                         military tactics to contest such forces as the natural outcome of a
                         rational man defending popular sovereignty and the rights of all free
                         staters.</p>
                    <p>Spurgeon&apos;s chapters concerning the relationship between Abraham Lincoln
                         and Lane as well as Lane&apos;s views on slavery were particularly
                         thoughtful and interesting. Spurgeon compares the backgrounds of the two
                         men, regarding their movement toward the Republican Party as similarly
                         motivated by a desire to limit proslavery political power and
                         slavery&apos;s territorial growth. After <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas">Kansas</region></placeName> was
                         admitted to the Union as a free state in 1861, the state legislature
                         selected Lane as a Republican senator. Spurgeon concludes that Lane&apos;s
                         movement from the Democratic to the Republican Party demonstrated a natural
                         realignment since Lincoln and the Republicans, according to Lane, now
                         championed the &quot;democratic principles&quot; of self-government and
                         unionism. Yet unlike Lincoln, Lane expressed no moral opposition to slavery
                         even though he eventually supported abolition and the enrollment of black
                         troops as a way to save the Union.</p>
                    <p>While nineteenth-century newspaper editors commonly expressed partisan,
                         sensationalized rhetoric -- and Spurgeon is correct to note that
                         &quot;rumors&quot; surrounding controversial figures like Lane tended to be
                         overblown -- it nonetheless appears that many of the public criticisms leveled
                         against Lane were not entirely without merit. The reviewer is still left
                         with the impression that Lane was first and foremost a skilled, sometimes
                         volatile politician, guided less by a coherent ideological commitment to
                         &quot;democratic principles&quot; and more by emotional, even visceral, <pb
                              n="406" id="VAA4025-105-4-108"/> responses to personal interactions
                         with other leading political powers. Indeed, along with discussing
                         Lane&apos;s exceptional oratorical and politicking abilities, Spurgeon
                         credits Stephen Douglas&apos;s verbal attack upon Lane&apos;s

                         factor leading Lane to reject the Democratic Party. Notwithstanding, Ian
                         Spurgeon&apos;s narrative of James Lane is a welcome addition to the
                         nineteenth-century American political narrative.</p>

                    <p>The American Civil War is a popular and enduring subject in publishing; and
                         its approaching sesquicentennial will only make it more so. Books and
                         articles regularly appear on seemingly every possible aspect of the war.
                         Written for both academic and popular audiences, by scholars and amateurs,
                         the quality and topics can vary greatly. Something like the stock of the
                         sutlers&apos; wagons that followed Civil War armies, the subject offers
                         something for everyone. From a very focused work on a single battle, to a
                         sweeping analysis taking in the whole war and its many facets, reader -- much
                         like that soldier perusing the sutlers&apos; goods -- can find something to
                         interest them. <hi rend="i">More Than a Contest Between Armies: Essays on
                              the Civil War Era</hi>, is much like the sutlers&apos; offerings -- there
                         is something here for everyone.</p>


                    <p>Based on presentations given by many of the foremost Civil War scholars of
                         the last forty years as part of the Frank L. Klement Lectures at Marquette
                         University, editors James Marten and A. Kristen Foster have done a
                         marvelous job of assembling twelve essays presenting different aspects of
                         and perspectives on this tragic conflict. The editors&apos; excellent
                         preface places the anthology in context to the Klement series and its goal
                         to present the broad field of Civil War study -- from the battlefield to the
                         home front; from the military and political leaders of the war to the
                         battles waged to preserve the honor and glory of their causes in its
                         aftermant. The editors quote Civil War historian Frank Klement himself for
                         the title of the book. The Civil War was indeed &quot;more than a contest
                         between armies,&quot; and the essays presented <pb n="407"
                              id="VAA4025-105-4-109"/> make that clear. Some are military- related
                         works, such as John Simon&apos;s comparison between Union commanders
                         Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Halleck, and Lesley Gordon&apos;s look at
                         bravery and cowardice in the 16th <placeName><region type="state"

                         deal with the political and domestic aspects of the war. For example, what
                         was Frederick Douglass&apos;s relationship with Abraham Lincoln and did he
                         give the martyred president proper credit for what he did for African
                         Americans? Who were Henry Tuckerman, Anna Dickinson, and Silas Weir
                         Mitchell, and how did their writing influence public opinion and
                         perspectives regarding the war? Was the home front experience necessarily
                         all that different between Northern and Southern communities? While Abraham
                         Lincoln and the federal government have been criticized for violating civil
                         liberties in prosecuting the war, did Jefferson Davis and the Confederate
                         government tread any more carefully in protecting and honoring such rights?
                         How were the rights and treatment of &quot;virtuous&quot; women versus
                         prostitutes dealt with in wartime? A who&apos;s who of Civil War
                         historians, including Gary Gallagher, Ed Ayers, Catherine Clinton, David
                         Blight, Mark Neely, and more, explore these and other topics.</p>
                    <p>A brief introduction to each essay provides information on the historian and
                         subject and endnotes follow it. In between are informative, insightful, and
                         thought provoking essays. For anyone interested in the Civil War, this is a
                         must read.</p>

                    <p>James M. Gillispie&apos;s study of federal government&apos;s treatment of
                         Confederate prisoners in prisoner-of-war camps in the North aims to dispel
                         the hoary myths and misconceptions of intentional cruelty and retaliation
                         that arose from the postwar Southern Lost Cause ideology. Rejecting
                         post-war Southern accounts of sadistic treatment at the hands of vengeful
                         Northern captors as unreliable, Gillispie instead argues that wartime
                         records of the administration of prison camps and diaries of Southern
                         prisoners not only provide the best sources, but clearly demonstrate that
                         Union Army <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-105-4-110"/> administrators endeavored
                         to provide ample food, clothing, medical care, and shelter to the tens of
                         thousands of rebel prisoners in Northern prison camps. In a series of
                         &quot;mini studies&quot; (p. 5) of nine of the major prisons scattered
                         throughout the North, Gillispie shows that at each prison, army officers
                         made conscientious efforts to feed, clothe, and care for their prisoners
                         under the watchful eyes of inspectors sent by the commissary general of
                         prisoners, Colonel William Hoffman. He argues that although many prisoners
                         died while in custody, the deaths were largely due to overcrowding after
                         the breakdown of prisoner exchanges; rampant disease (such as pneumonia,
                         dysentery, smallpox, malaria, typhoid, and other maladies) which was easily
                         communicated in the crowded camps; and the lack of medical knowledge
                         necessary to diagnose and treat these diseases.</p>
                    <p>Gillispie&apos;s mini-study of Camp Morton in <placeName><settlement

                              >Indiana</region></placeName> will serve here as a representative for
                         all nine prisons under examination. Established as a volunteer rendezvous
                         camp at the beginning of the war, it became a prison camp in early 1862 in
                         order to accommodate the thousands of Confederate prisoners captured after
                         the battle of Fort Donelson. Though the prison camp was initially emptied
                         later that year by exchanges, it rapidly refilled to overcrowding again.
                         Gillispie notes that Camp Morton&apos;s commanders came in for sharp
                         criticism at times by Hoffman&apos;s medical inspectors for deficient
                         medical care (owing to an inexperienced medical staff) and for poor sewage
                         drainage from the camp. Inspectors reported that prisoners&apos; waste
                         collected in insufficiently drained ditches and created health hazards.
                         After Hoffman forced the replacement of medical staff and commanders,
                         conditions improved. However, the prison barracks buildings lacked wooden
                         floors, and became muddy in wet weather. Gillispie reviews the mortality
                         statistics for each prison, and at Camp Morton pneumonia was the chief
                         reported killer, followed by diarrhea/dysentery and malaria. Though Camp
                         Morton&apos;s death rates were worse that most of the other Northern
                         prisons, Gillispie demonstrates that camp officials -- under the watchful
                         eyes of Hoffman&apos;s inspectors -- provided ample rations, clothing, and
                         shelter, belying the postwar image of negligence and abuse promoted by Lost
                         Cause apologists.</p>
                    <p>Gillispie handles each prison separately, following the same pattern
                         (reviewing first the postwar accounts, then the secondary literature, and
                         finally any records and surviving prisoner diaries written during the war).
                         Though tediously repetitious, the argument that federal authorities took
                         great pains to provide ample food, clothing, medical care, and shelter to
                         the rebel prisoners is ultimately hammered home. Gillispie&apos;s
                         concluding chapter on &quot;the omnipresent specter of disease&quot; is
                         most effective in showing the problems of communicable <pb n="409"
                              id="VAA4025-105-4-111"/> diseases and prison camps in the nineteenth
                         century, and medical practitioners&apos; lack of understanding and
                         inability to deal with them. Gillispie&apos;s focus on wartime records and
                         Confederate prisoners&apos; wartime diaries is important; however, his
                         reliance on the published <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> and <hi
                              rend="i">Medical and Surgical History of the War of Rebellion</hi> is
                         unfortunate. The <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> represents a mere

                    <p>Ruminating in 1935 on the meaning of emancipation, the African American
                         historian and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois wrote: &quot;The slave went free;
                         stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward
                         slavery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">Abolitionists Remember</hi> Julie Roy Jeffrey examines how,
                         during the four decades following emancipation, white and black
                         abolitionists memorialized and remembered their contentious and long
                         campaign to overthrow the &quot;peculiar institution.&quot; She defines
                         &quot;abolitionist&quot; broadly, including &quot;all who embraced the
                         anti-slavery cause&quot; and focuses on the broad significance of the
                         abolition movement in late nineteenth century America, a time when the
                         freed-people &quot;moved back again toward slavery&quot; (p. 256 n.7).</p>
                    <p>Specialists will welcome Jeffrey&apos;s close reading of the autobiographical
                         texts of such well-known abolitionists as William Still, Levi Coffin,
                         Frederick Douglass, Parker Pillsbury, George Julian, Calvin Fairbank, and
                         Thomas Wentworth Higginson. In addition to uncovering and analyzing obscure
                         proceedings of abolitionists&apos; reunions in 1875, 1884, and 1893, she
                         also studies the recollections of lesser-known abolitionists, including
                         former slaves John Quincy Adams and John P. Parker, as well as John Malvin,
                         a free black southerner.</p>

                    <p>Jeffrey joins only a handful of historians who have researched publishers&apos; archives, including advertisements, publishing contracts,
                         reader&apos;s reports, reviews, and sales and royalty figures. Such
                         documentation, usually identified with &quot;the history of the
                         book,&quot; enables her to explain the marketing of books by subscription
                         and chart the degree to which various autobiographical texts entered public
                         discourse. Jeffrey also scours post-Civil War popular monthly magazines to
                         discern the changing image of abolitionists in historical memory,
                         especially what David W. Blight has termed the &quot;reconciliation&quot;
                         narrative that redefined the Civil War as a struggle for nationhood, not
                         one to destroy slavery.</p>
                    <p>Jeffrey finds, not surprisingly, that in their autobiographical writings
                         abolitionists continued their fight against racial injustice.
                         &quot;Abolitionists,&quot; she writes, &quot;challenged every important
                         point of the reconciliation narrative, trying to salvage the nobility of
                         their work for emancipation and African Americans and defending their own
                         participation in the great events of their day&quot; (p. 3). In reflecting
                         on their fight against slavery, former abolitionists explained their
                         motivations, detailed the opposition they confronted, and described slavery
                         and the world the slaveholders fashioned. &quot;Explicitly or
                         implicitly,&quot; Jeffrey writes, &quot;their narratives offered an
                         analysis of the causes of war&quot; (p. 4).</p>
                    <p>Even before the end of Reconstruction, however, white Americans generally
                         lost sympathy for the slaves and increasingly celebrated national harmony,
                         including a shared sense of white racial hegemony. Jeffrey documents this
                         in her analysis of the pro-southern, pro-slavery characterization of
                         slavery and abolition in popular magazines. If anything she understates the
                         breadth and depth of anti-black thought. Predictably, the inattention
                         readers paid to abolitionist autobiographies resulted in low sales figures
                         and, accordingly, major publishing houses stopped publishing them.</p>
                    <p>Jeffrey&apos;s most original contribution is her close analysis of the
                         transitional and often ignored 1880s. During this decade popular writers
                         reevaluated the abolitionists (debunked as fanatical agitators), the Civil
                         War (celebrated as restoring national unity), and the freedpeople
                         (ridiculed as childlike and unprepared for freedom).</p>
                    <p>With chattel slavery abolished, but with new forms of servitude and racial
                         and class proscription on the rise during and after Reconstruction, the old
                         abolitionists directed their ire at racial prejudice. The restoration of
                         southern Bourbon regimes in the 1880s and the institutionalization of Jim
                         Crow in the 1890s convinced them that their work of racial reform remained
                         unfinished. Regardless of the indifference shown his <hi rend="i">Acts of
                              the Anti-Slavery Apostles</hi> (1883), Pillsbury declared that he
                         wrote his book &quot;for History, for Humanity, and for Posterity,
                         regardless of cost and loss&quot; <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-105-4-113"/> (p.
                         201). The abolitionists&apos; contributions would be rediscovered during
                         another period of racial change -- the modern civil rights movement.</p>

                    <p>In sixty-five pages of text, James McPherson offers a Lincoln biography that
                         &quot;captures the essential events and meaning of Lincoln&apos;s
                         life&quot; (p. xi). The author devotes only seven pages to Lincoln&apos;s
                         youth and young adulthood, and by page twenty-three, the reader has arrived
                         in the early months of 1860, but McPherson has a sure feel for essential
                         information. His discussion of the Civil War years focuses on three topics:
                         Lincoln as Commander in Chief, the history and significance of the
                         Emancipation Proclamation, and Lincoln as master politician. Long-time
                         Lincoln buffs who have read a stack of biographies may not need to read
                         this volume, but they should still appreciate the skill that has created
                         such brevity. The book will appeal to students who want &quot;just the
                         facts&quot; about Lincoln, teachers who need to refresh their memory before
                         writing a lecture, and general readers intimidated by many-hundred-paged or
                         multi-volume biographies.</p>

                         Guelzo<lb/> (<placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567"

                    <p>Allen Guelzo has written a 128-page introduction to Lincoln that is &quot;a
                         biography of his ideas&quot; (p. 8). Lincoln&apos;s early days are
                         discussed under the rubric of &quot;Equality,&quot; defined as a
                         &quot;baseline of opportunity&quot; in the young republic. The young
                         man&apos;s desire for a career in both law and politics is discussed in
                         &quot;Advancement&quot;; his growing concern with questions about slavery
                         within a democracy appears in the section titled &quot;Liberty.&quot; The
                         next three chapters on Lincoln&apos;s campaign against Douglas and his
                         years as president focus on &quot;Debate,&quot; &quot;Emancipation,&quot;
                         and &quot;Reunion.&quot; In his epilogue, Guelzo agrees with the claim that
                         Lincoln was, indeed, the &quot;Great American Man,&quot; who saved the
                         Union and the ideal of liberal democracy; ensured that both political
                         equality and social mobility would be defining elements of American
                         society; and created a <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-105-4-115"/> vocabulary of
                         politics that was necessarily linked to morality and &quot;eternal
                         principles of right and wrong&quot; (p. 127). The small volume provides an
                         impressive amount of historical and intellectual context, offers an expert
                         summary of Lincoln&apos;s thought, and includes several pages of
                         suggestions for further reading.</p>

                         eighty-seven letters and speeches from 1832 through April 1865. Each text
                         is complete and has no deletions, and the collection &quot;aims to make the

                         famous texts are included: the first Lincoln-Douglas debate, the 1860
                         Cooper Union speech, the 1st and 2nd inaugural addresses, the Emancipation

                    <p>As Harold Holzer notes in his introduction, even in Lincoln&apos;s lifetime
                         there were people who chose &quot;to add the patina of exaggeration&quot;
                         to his biography. Edward Steers examines fourteen different stories of
                         Lincoln&apos;s life and death, sorting through the threads of each to
                         distinguish what is verifiable from what is fiction. Seven chapters discuss
                         aspects of Lincoln&apos;s personal life, including his relationships with
                         Ann Rutledge and Mary Todd, his religious beliefs, and his sexual
                         preference. Three chapters look at the provenance of Lincoln quotations and
                         questions about the writing of the Gettysburg Address. The final four
                         chapters examine details of Lincoln&apos;s assassination, including the
                         guilt or innocence of one convicted conspirator and the identity of the man
                         who held John Wilkes Booth&apos;s horse in the alley behind Ford&apos;s
                         Theater. Steers is meticulous but never boring, and readers will be
                         fascinated by the variety of tales told about Lincoln&apos;s life and
                         death.</p>

                    <p>In 1933, artist Charles Turzek published <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln:
                              Biography in Woodcuts</hi>, a textless volume filled with
                         Turzek&apos;s striking woodcuts depicting dozens of episodes from
                         Lincoln&apos;s life. In addition to reproducing the woodcuts, this small
                         volume adds a preface on the artist and his work, a biographical sketch of
                         Lincoln, short captions for each woodcut, and a modest selection of
                         Lincoln&apos;s speeches and letters. The main interest for most readers,
                         however, will still be Turzek&apos;s artwork.</p>

                    <p>So many scholars and amateur historians have written on the assassination of
                         Lincoln, yet the editors of this volume say that &quot;only a handful&quot;
                         used the massive collection of evidence <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-105-4-117"
                         /> now available in this volume. The documents, originally collected in
                         1865 by Colonel Henry Burnett for the prosecution of Lincoln&apos;s accused
                         killers, have been in the possession of the National Archives and Records
                         Association (NARA) for decades. NARA microfilmed the original documents in
                         the 1960s, but William Edwards and Edward Steers have undertaken the task
                         of transcribing and organizing the huge file. The editors provide an
                         informative introduction and explanatory notes, and they order the
                         collection alphabetically by letter author. Those deeply invested in the
                         topic will probably make their way through the entire book; other
                         interested readers can profit from browsing and looking up particular
                         individuals in the index. Browsers will come across treasures such as the
                         anonymous letter, dated April 15, 1865, from a New Yorker urging the
                         government to &quot;Offer a reward of one million dollars &amp; have every
                         one of those men caught &amp; hung .... I feel as bad as if was my own
                         mother or father &amp; will be one to volunteer to try &amp; shoot every
                         Southern man&quot; (p. 15). Those interested in a specific individual, such
                         as Mary Surratt, can find indexed entries on her arrest, the evidence given
                         against her, and her sentencing.</p>
