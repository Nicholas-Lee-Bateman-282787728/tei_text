                    </placeName>, Indiana, demonstrates two conflicts that have often marked America's history,
                    a racial one, between Indian and white, and a religious one, largely between Protestant and
                    Catholic. The racial conflict, which up to 1870 produced much military strife, thereafter began to
                    take on a strongly cultural dimension as the government sought forcibly to assimilate the remaining
                    Indians into white society. To the racial conflict was added immediately a religious one when the
                    government through President Ulysses S. Grant's Peace Policy of 1870 invited churchmen to
                    assist in carrying out the assimilation program. The Indian agencies and therefore the Indians
                    themselves were turned over to various mission societies who established schools with government
                    support to "civilize" the Indians. Although the Indian agencies reverted to
                    political control by 1882, the schools which had been founded were continued, some as government
                    schools, still often operated by missionaries, others as "contract" schools, both
                    Protestant and Catholic, where the government provided a per pupil subsidy for church owned schools
                    through annually renewable contracts.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Catholics initially opposed the new church-state partnership which emerged after 1870, especially
                    after they learned that they had been allotted only eight out of the eighty Indian agencies. By
                    virtue of prior mission activity, which was supposed to have served as the basis for the
                    distribution, Catholics claimed forty such agencies.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> They therefore regarded
                    the Peace Policy as a scheme by Protestants to proselytize Catholic Indians with government support.

                                    Some of them say that it is the only thing to be done! In conversation with Mr.
                                    [John H.] Oberly, who was formerly Superint. of Indian instruction, is now a civil
                                    service Commissioner, and who has the entire confidence of the President, I learnt
                                    that Mr. [Grover] <placeName>

                                    </placeName> is taking great interest in the problem of Indian education. He even
                                    wishes to extend the civil service rules to the examination of teachers in the
                                    Indian Government schools and wishes to establish a normal school for teachers.
                                    Knowing our needs and the opinion of sensible men, in a position to judge correctly,
                                    I am firmly convinced that this is the best thing we can do. It must be done well
                                    and commenced at once, if we want to succeed and monopolize it. —This is
                                    very important! I wish to have it better than <placeName>

                                    already in operation and train them to be teachers, farmers and mechanics to be
                                    employed by the Govt. on salary and also in our own schools. —I do not
                                    wish to entrust this work to others, therefore I think it best to keep it in my own
                                    hands and send Father Willard to attend to it, which he will gladly do, as he told
                                    me. He understands the business and promised to do as I direct.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    were donated to the newly planned Saint Joseph's College, and the 420 acres that lay to the

                            Blood at Saint Joseph's College next door neighbors. Bishop Joseph Dwenger, who had
                            earlier been a member of the Society of the Precious Blood, resolutely refused even after
                            repeated urgings to let the Benedictines take charge of the school even though the Society
                            of the Precious Blood had up to this point absolutely no experience in the Indian

                            1895. Discrepancies between the per pupil rate and the total subsidy can be explained by the
                            fact that the year was divided and payment was made quarterly; thus, because of dropouts
                            during the year the exact number enrolled (here listed as "average") would
                            have to be stated in fractions.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">25</hi> For example, Andrew Gietl's report for the year
                            1892–1893 states that the total cost of operating the school was
                            $12,000, $3,000 of which went for salaries and $9,000 for
                            all other expenses. Contributions from the government were $8,330, and income
                            from "other parties" was $3,670. The latter presumably
                            represented mainly the income from the farm. The farm that year produced 730 bushels of
                            wheat, 1,500 bushels of corn, 1,000 bushels of oats, 200 bushels of potatoes, 100 bushels of
                            turnips, 10 bushels of onions, 10 bushels of beans, 15 bushels of fruit, 400 bushels of
                            melons, 90 tons of hay, 10 pounds of butter per week, 40 pounds of honey, plus cabbage,
                            beets, etc. Livestock consisted of 12 horses, 60 cattle, 40 pigs, and 200 domestic fowl.
                            Acres cultivated were 300. Cost of repairs to the buildings was $300. Report of

                    labor at the school was actually performed by the Indians themselves as part of their training
                    program. Even the majority of the clothing and shoes were manufactured at the school. This was also
                    true of some of the wooden furniture, including desks and benches. The beds were made of iron and
                    equipped with springs and had mattresses filled with straw.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The cost of
                    repairs and improvements varied greatly from year to year, anywhere from $120 to
                    $1,500.</p>
            <p>A considerable expense item was transportation costs for the Indians in attendance. Receipts for all
                    official travel involved in bringing the Indians to the school and in returning them to the
                    reservation after their schooling was finished, including expenses for in-between trips for a
                    serious cause, were collected and sent to <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the government to reimburse the school. In practice, however, the government was
                    circumspect in this matter and one year disallowed over half of the travel expenses.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Added to this were unofficial travel expenses incurred in retrieving runaways or paying
                    for the return of Indians who found a means of getting home for a summer vacation but did not have
                    the wherewithal to return to school in the fall.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>The total recompense to the staff varied from $2,000 to $5,000 per year.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> About $1,300 per year was paid to seven Sisters; thus, something

                    or six additional employees (chiefly lay brothers). During the first two years Hahn complained that
                    the school was in such bad financial straits that neither he nor many of his employees were able to

                    sent home. The distribution among the tribes likewise varied from year to year. In the first year
                    the largest contingent from any single tribe was the Menominee; whereas, in the year
                    1894–1895 over half the Indians were Chippewa.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> It is easy to

            <p>It was not a simple matter to take Indian pupils off the reservations. Legal formalities had to be
                    observed. First of all, the Office of Indian Affairs in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had to grant permission to recruit.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Then permission from the

                    Indian family ties were very close. The primary argument used to persuade families to send their
                    boys to school was that education would give them more prestige and a better life than their elders
                    had. But any form of threat or coercion was strictly prohibited.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> After the
                    parents' permission had been obtained, a descriptive statement of each pupil had to be made
                    and signed by the local Indian agent and a physician stating that everything was in order. There was
                    keen competition for Indian pupils between the Catholics and the representatives of the Protestant
                    and government schools. This sometimes led to bitter charges and countercharges of illegalities, use
                    of coercion in some form, or corruption of officials.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Although a few of <placeName>

            <p>Another important part of the Indians' training was practical hygiene and acceptable social
                    manners. To teach them to wash, dress, groom, and eat with knife and fork required patience and
                        time.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Often they had never worn close fitting clothes before. It was

                    offense of offering the Indians alcoholic beverages. The ban on smoking, however, was observed
                    somewhat casually. As one man related: "A prof told them about the harmful effects of
                    smoking and drew pictures of the affected lungs on the blackboard. In consequence they threw away
                    their pipes. Of course, this put restrictions on the profs. One day an Indian boy saw the same
                    teacher smoke in his room. When he reported this, one of them said, `He smoke, no sin; we smoke,
                    sin; haw!' The pipes were retrieved."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indians also had to learn to live by the white man's clock. The following order of the
                    day speaks for itself: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Rising at 5:30 A.M. Morning prayers at 6 A.M. Then breakfast. After this the Indian boys had
                            to do the chores, viz., washing of dishes, carrying water and wood, sweeping, feeding stock,
                            and milking. At 8:30 A.M. till 11:30 regularly teaching and studying with 15 minutes recess
                            at 10 A.M. 11:30 dinner, after this chores as in the morning. At 1 till 2 P.M. general work
                            for all pupils. From 1 till 5 o'clock one half of the pupils worked (alternately)
                            in the different shops and on the farm. The other half had lessons in reading, writing,
                            drawing, etc. from 2 till 4 and 5 till 6 o'clock. Between 5 and 6 P.M. again chores
                            and after supper at 6 P.M. Then recess till 7 o'clock P.M. From 7 to 8 P.M. study

            <p>Finally, there was a happy note—athletics and recreation. There was no fancy equipment,
                    but the Indians performed remarkably well, especially in the earlier years when there were a number
                    of older lads among them. The Indian school quickly fielded a baseball team that successfully
                    challenged all the teams in the neighborhood including Saint Joseph's College.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

                            matters because the Indians were quick to resent punishment or even mere accusations and

                        <p>The Young Americans of the Indian School, went to Remington last Thursday to play the return

                            . The game had hardly begun when some of the Remington hired players began kicking at the
                            umpire's decisions. The outsiders joined in and made such a constant uproar that it
                            was impossible for the game to proceed. Mr. E. P. Honan on the part of the Indians, began to
                            expostulate with the kickers, but in a gentlemanly way, and was insulted and then attacked
                            by a tough named Harrington. In the excitement of the moment quite a number of bystanders
                            then interfered, upon one side or the other, and for a little while it looked as though a
                            general and bloody free fight would ensue. The exertions of cooler heads however soon
                            quieted the trouble, without any very serious results. The Indian boys left the grounds upon
                            the beginning of the trouble, but later were prevailed upon to return and play out the game
                            which resulted in their favor by a score of 18 for the Indians to 7 for the Remingtons.<hi rend="sup">82</hi>

                    the Indians had already mastered the ways of "civilization" by presenting
                    speeches, dialogues, and patriotic songs. But <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>the second part of the program was by far the most interesting. The performers were all
                            dressed in the full war costumes of their savage ancestors, with feathers and war paint and
                            gorgeous and many colored raiment. Their costumes were made by the young men, themselves,
                            and were faithful copies of genuine wild Indian costumes. The different items of this part
                            of the performance consisted of a Pow Wow dance; a Scalp Dance; a dance at the execution of
                            an enemy; a Council of War, with War Harangues and War Dance; a Dance over the wounded; a
                            representation, with dance, of the first Peace Meeting of the Chippewas and Sioux Indians;
                            Blessing of Meals and a Dog Head dance, and four very fine tableaux representing Indian
                            life: The Wigwam, The Council, an Execution and Penn's Treaty with the Indians.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>

            <p>Other performances, possibly not as elaborate, were held for the benefit of the neighboring college
                    students. One student recalls how one of the Indian boys would leave the ring of dancers to charge
                    into the audience and pretend that he was after a white man's scalp. Bows and arrows were
                    sold as souvenirs for a few pennies.<hi rend="sup">89</hi>

            <p>The Indian school was by no means a paradise for its intended beneficiaries. Although there were no
                    outright rebellions nor any known act of serious misbehavior, protest was often expressed simply by
                    running home. This was the one major problem at the school: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The greatest drawback of the institution arises from the great distance from the Indian
                            homeland, for there are no parents who hang with greater tenderness to their children than
                            these Indian fathers and mothers, and a forced separation appears to them to be a fearful
                            thing. Since this mutual dependence rests on purely natural instinct, it is useless to fight
                            against it with rational arguments or higher motives. If the mother wants her child
                            again—it must by all means be done. There is no alternative. Likewise if the
                            child longs for its parents again—no appeal to reason will help. He follows his

                    been as kind and understanding as humanly possible. Sometimes boys whom he least suspected of being

                    difficult. For example, to have to cut off their long, black hair was an experience the Indians
                    objected to "most strenuously … for it made them look like the white man and
                    they imagined that this was a sign that they would never be allowed to return home
                        again."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> At times the doors and shutters were locked, and
                    recreation was limited to the confines of the school's tiny interior courtyard.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> An easier method of barring escape occurred to Hahn when he decided to check
                    the issuance of clothing, especially overcoats, more carefully. If the coats had to be turned in
                    each night, the boys would not dare venture out so easily, especially in winter.<hi rend="sup">95</hi> During the second year two teachers were detailed to stay in the pupils' dormitory
                    at nights to prevent escape.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> Running away was surely a daring undertaking so
                    many miles away from home. One poor lad lost his life when he fell under the wheels of a train.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> At other times running home proved difficult for the Indian boys, and they

            <p>The superintendents were constantly pestered with petitions to return home. Either there was a death
                    or serious illness in the family, or the father became incapacitated and needed the son to help
                    support the family.<hi rend="sup">99</hi> Gietl once sent seven boys home at one time just because
                    of homesickness.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> At other times there were misunderstandings as to how many
                    years a boy was required to remain at the school. In any case, if the Indian student really wanted
                    permission to go home—for example, when he felt that he had enough schooling and was old
                    enough to take out a land claim and start a farm of his own—the school ordinarily did not
                    prevent him.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> As Hahn remarked on one occasion: "They have done well
                    regarding their behavior and learning, but think now, they could help themselves. It is too risky,

                    ministers that he was a Protestant and was being held at the Catholic Indian school against his will
                    and was forced to attend religious services.<hi rend="sup">103</hi> Another pleaded cruelty. He
                    sneaked out letters which so alarmed his parents that his father wrote Gietl and threatened him

                            though he has a subvoucher or receipt for every item expended: why there was a team needed;
                            why such expenses were required, etc. The escorts brought the children and I had to pay the
                            expenses they incurred as they were all reasonable to my judgment. Besides the Second
                            Comptroller made a mistake in subtraction as you will notice of $100

                    </placeName>'s in order to train older and better "scholars" in a five
                    year program so that they could be returned to the reservations to teach others the ways of the
                    white man, i.e., the Catholic white man. But with an annual pupil turnover of nearly fifty per cent
                    and the Indians' "irrepressible tendency" to run away, not many could
                    have completed the five years. Moreover, the average age level of the pupils declined until <placeName>

                    with the incentive of contract money the school seemingly could no longer be kept filled after the

            </byline>
            <p>In dealing with the presidential campaign of 1824 historians commonly dwell upon two political
                    themes. First they lament that the contest revolved around personalities and was not settled on the
                    basis of the candidates' stands on the specific political questions of the day, such as the
                    tariff, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Bank, the lingering effects of the Panic of 1819, debtor relief, land policy, internal
                    improvements, and slavery. After treating these classic sectional issues in detailed fashion, a
                    widely used textbook explains that one important reason why they "were not severely
                    disruptive was that the major politicians, hotly competing for the Presidency, were unwilling to
                    risk alienating any section by taking too extreme a position… . The Presidential fight
                    was therefore waged on largely personal grounds… . The maneuvering among them [the
                    contenders] was complex, the infighting savage."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Having lamented that
                    the specific political issues of the early 1820s had so little bearing on the campaign, historians
                    then go on to say that the battle for the presidency reveals far more about the general political
                    movement which characterized early nineteenth century America—democratization.
                    "The election of 1824," reiterates an important new textbook, "witnessed
                    the dying out of old established practices and the first surgings of the new democratic political
                        unrest."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The contemporary campaign literature, however, especially newspapers and promotional pamphlets,
                    suggests that attitudes and events essentially nonpolitical and revolving around questions other
                    than personality had a great impact upon the nature and outcome of the campaign. The patriotic
                    presuppositions underpinning much of the campaign oratory have received little study. More
                    specifically, it could be argued that <hi rend="i">the</hi> great patriotic event of 1824, the visit
                    of the Marquis de <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, had more connection with the presidential election of that year than did many of the
                    specific and general political questions which have so fascinated historians over the years.
                    "When General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1824–1825," says one of the few textbooks which even mentions
                    that truly national event, "the glorious past was revived as never before." But no
                    connection is made between this great patriotic event and the election which occurred in the midst
                    of it. In another chapter readers are told in typical fashion that "the election was
                    decided on the basis of personalities as well as sectional issues."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be ludicrous to argue that there was a simple cause and effect relationship between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s visit and the nature and outcome of the presidential campaign of 1824. But
                    it would surely be surprising if two of the most important American events of 1824 were as entirely
                    unrelated as history books have made them seem. Rather, it appears probable that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s visit had some real if unquantifiable bearing upon the campaign and, far
                    more importantly, that both the visit and the campaign bore testimony of a dominant American trend

                    introspective groping for self-awareness and self-realization which kept leading men back to the
                    Revolution. Both, therefore, can serve as focal points for an investigation of an important cultural
                    phenomenon which has been too little studied: the desperate desire of the American people to
                    maintain for as long as possible some physical and spiritual connection with the Revolutionary
                    generation and the psychological impact of their increasing realization that, for all their longing,
                    the age of the Revolution seemed nonetheless to be passing away.</p>

            <p>Historians have traditionally accepted the view that Americans of the 1820s, like almost all
                    Americans of almost all generations, were restless and forward looking, impatient with the past and
                    supremely optimistic about the future. In recent years, however, intellectual historians have found
                    much evidence that Americans sought security in conditions that existed (or that they imagined to
                    have existed) before technology began to alter things fundamentally. Indeed, scholars are just
                    beginning to realize the profound degree to which nostalgia existed in pre-Civil War America. One
                    very insightful intellectual historian has written that antebellum Americans were "uneasy
                    in the midst of political and technological change," that they "struggled to
                    remain agreed on the tactics and goals of man in political society," that their
                    "desire to elude personal and national peril" caused them to seek reassuring
                    symbols of unity "in the nation's first age of insecurity." The same
                    author promised, and wrote, a succeeding study in which he explored "the broader dimensions
                    of American nationalism in the nineteenth century, concentrating on this subsoil of
                        terror."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Such pioneering works dealing with American fear and nostalgia would be complemented by a book length
                    study dealing exclusively with the passing of the Revolutionary generation and the psychological
                    impact of the demise of the fathers upon sons who had deified them and found in their manmade
                    deities great sources of national unity, strength, and inspiration. There is much evidence to
                    suggest that the fear of losing the physical and spiritual ties with the Revolution assumed the
                    proportions of a national trauma, one that reveals much about American conceptions of national
                    character and purpose. This article is presented as nothing more than a footnote to that broader
                    study. Hopefully, it does suggest <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> the nation was really honoring more than one man. Looking backward from their vantage
                    point of nearly half a century, Americans were paying homage to what they regarded as a whole
                    generation of men preeminent for virtue, courage, and patriotism, a generation which had established
                    a republican model for a tyranny ridden world. Lauding the fathers of the Revolution was an old
                    patriotic tradition, of course, not something new. But it did have a special poignancy in 1824. By
                    that year a generation of men not present at the creation of the Republic was coming to the fore,
                    and there was serious apprehension lest the sons of more famous sires falter, thereby jeopardizing
                    the world's only viable experiment in self-government. Modern degeneracy was a theme for
                    which the sons had developed a telling fascination. "The rising generation," read
                    one toast at a Fourth of July celebration in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1823, "may they ever be taught to admire and to practice the virtue, piety,
                    and patriotism of those, who at the expense of so much blood, and such devotedness of character,
                    purchased for us the privileges both civil and religious which we now so richly enjoy."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> "Let the Celebration of the birth day of our liberty, ever prove to

                    Fourth of July to prove that: it would take nothing less than daily lives dedicated by deeds to the

                    1824 felt that they knew who they were and what they were about in the world. Although the "<placeName>

                    to lose the childlike innocence of the early Republic, the Revolutionary virtue symbolized by the

                    the country in 1824, the Frenchman's presence did not create that spirit. In fact,
                    patriotic nostalgia not only helped to make the visit the stupendous national success it was but

                    and the years of degeneracy. Those countless Americans who had made the Revolutionaries their models
                    found little that was reassuring as they witnessed a campaign already well underway in 1823. Many

                            Adams on the Fourth of July, 1826, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the sole surviving signer
                            of the Declaration of Independence, served many as this symbolic presence of the Revolution.

            <p>With the nation supposedly threatened by political intriguers in 1824, Americans felt the country
                    clearly needed a man at the helm as selfless as the founding fathers. Precedent as well as
                    patriotism seemed to dictate such a policy. Beginning with George <placeName>

                    tested in the crucible of the Revolution. Either in the field or in the council every President had
                    first been a Revolutionary. Lamentably, this continuous line of Revolutionaries-become-Presidents

                    been wooed by the people. There was a great risk involved in selecting a man of self-alleged
                    promise, rather than a man of proven Revolutionary worth. But in 1824 the nation would simply have
                    to take that risk.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> An Adams man who had dubbed himself "Algernon <placeName>

                    politics, saw in the signs of the times a way of ending such bickering. In defense of his electoral
                    proposal he wrote: "This is the season for paying compliments to revolutionary principles
                    and revolutionary virtues." Thus there could be no better time for honoring Revolutionary

            <p>Although nothing came of the New Yorker's electoral scheme, the nation was seeking to extend
                    the reign of Revolutionary principles in the executive mansion. The advocates of every contender
                    understood the necessity of showing that their favorites had Revolutionary principles if not
                    Revolutionary deeds to their credit. Since even William H. Crawford (1772–1834), Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> (1777–1852), and John C. Calhoun (1782–1850) had all been born
                    before the Revolution ended, they were, in a sense, men—or at least <hi rend="i">boys</hi>—of the Revolutionary era. The burden of proof was heaviest on Calhoun, the
                    youngest of the candidates. When critics cried out that the South Carolinian, who was only in his
                    forty-third year, was too young to be President, a Marylander replied in a way which revealed
                    clearly enough that his models were Revolutionary ones. "Forty-three was the age of
                    WASHINGTON when he grasped in his hands the destinies of his country, and carried them triumphantly
                    through the appalling dangers and difficulties of the revolution." Only chronology, not
                    principle, had prevented Calhoun from being a man of '76. Why more than a dozen years
                    before, as everybody knew, Calhoun had been hailed <hi rend="i">"as resembling one of the
                        old sages of the old Congress."</hi>

                    men who had acted most conspicuously in America's Revolutionary cause. Thus the contentions

                    Certainly they were more plausible than the arguments of those political alchemists who tried to

                    of '76. But there was a fundamental flaw in the pro-Adams logic which Jacksonians saw at

                    Old Hickory's part in the War for Independence had been understandably eclipsed in that

                    </placeName>" repeatedly returned to the theme of his subject's Revolution tested
                    virtue, declaring that that alone was enough to make the Tennessean President.33 What had been only
                    briefly mentioned in 1817 was in 1824 the subject of frequent reminders.</p>
            <p>The reason for Eaton's change of emphasis seems clear enough. As the Republic moved toward
                    its half century mark, the passing years took a heavy toll in Revolutionary patriots. Fewer and
                    fewer men of '76 remained; consequently, by 1824 even the meagerest claim to Revolutionary
                    service brought some measure of fame. The great honor which attached to the association was
                    indicated by the widespread attention given to the deaths of Revolutionary veterans. <hi rend="i">"Another Revolutionary Hero gone!"</hi> declared newspaper headlines whenever
                    one of these worthies passed on to his reward. Such a notice announced the death of Archibald
                    Gresham, a seventy year old Georgian, in 1823, but the name of almost any recently deceased
                    Revolutionary might have been inserted into the stylized obituary. "During the days which
                    tried men's souls, he was actively engaged in defending the rights of his fellow-citizens
                    … and was in many sore conflicts with the British and Tories. He was a republican in
                    principle, and always manifested a zealous attachment to the principles of this
                        government."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Few specifics were mentioned because they were not
                    needed; this was not a description of the Georgian's life so much as it was a conclusion of
                    patriotic logic. As many American citizens of this period reasoned: Esquire Gresham (or Mr. X)
                    fought on the American side in the Revolution; therefore, he had met the be-all and end-all test for
                    "zealous attachment" to American principles.</p>

                    </placeName>'s visit as connected rather than as disparate events. Although it cannot be
                    measured quantitatively, there was a nationalistically introspective quality to the campaign closely
                    akin to that which characterized the American sojourn of the great French hero of the American
                    Revolution. The visit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> actually led to an intensification of the retrospective, patriotic spirit which
                    pervaded America and affected the entire tone of American life in 1824. This prevailing climate of
                    opinion dictated that the campaign of 1824 be a search for a sixth President who resembled the
                    Revolutionary fathers. This the more astute promoters of all the contenders understood full well. In
                    both the great events of 1824—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s return to America and the presidential election—the quest was the
                    same: for some living symbol of the American Revolutionary tradition. Given the criterion by which
                    the candidates were being judged, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "pretensions" seemed the most tenable.</p>
            <p>The election returns provide a kind of pragmatic test for the thesis that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, symbolized a hallowed Revolutionary tradition that Americans of 1824 did not want to
                    lose. Interestingly enough, and perhaps not entirely coincidentally, the candidates finished almost
                    exactly in the order of their births. No contender received a majority, but <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose claim to Revolutionary fame seemed most plausible, received the largest share of
                    both popular and electoral ballots. Adams, who, advocates claimed, had formed his character while in
                    intimate contact with the founding fathers, finished second in the popular and electoral balloting.
                    Crawford, a four year old when independence was declared, was third in the electoral college; and <placeName>

            <p>Consideration of the patriotic spirit which pervaded the country in 1824 adds a new dimension to the
                    election of that year. The campaign of 1824 has long been scrutinized for what it reveals about the
                    growth of the democratic spirit (and, seemingly, for what it reveals about the eternal propensity of
                    ambitious politicans to revile each other). But certainly it may also be seen as a chapter in the
                    continuing story of the American quest for national self-awareness. The campaign of 1824, like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s visit, was one of those events which stirred up thinking and sent men
                    seeking American first principles. It was, like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s visit, a profound challenge to American presuppositions, for it brought to
                    the imagination the prospect of a world in which there would be no men of '76, a world in
                    which the empty promises of political maneuvering would have replaced the proven worth of
                    Revolutionary virtue as the surest way to place, power, and preferment. Many patriots feared that
                    they were living in a transitional age, an age between the virtuous fathers and their meaner sons,
                    an age which threatened to carry them inexorably into that brave new world of intrigue where even
                    the survival of mankind's republican hopes would be threatened. Is it any wonder, then,
                    that having peered into that world from the precipice of 1824, they drew back reluctant to enter? Is
                    it any wonder that Americans sought in their presidential candidates what they had found in the
                    great <placeName>

            <p>The Fletchers are associated with the beginnings of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1821. In that year, just three years after the Miami and Delaware Indians
                    surrendered their claims to the region, the Indiana General Assembly selected the site for the new
                    state capital and a legislative commission platted the town. The sale of lots began on October 8,
                    one week after Calvin and Sarah Fletcher had arrived and settled in a "rough
                    cabin" without a floor on Lot 2 on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street. The newly married Fletchers had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Urbana</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, where Calvin, originally from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, had taught school, read law with James Cooley, been admitted to practice in 1820, and
                    met his future wife.</p>
            <p>The tale derived from the Fletcher diaries and letters concerns two young common folk, without
                    education and without money, who pierced the middle western frontier, contributed to its
                    organization and development, and grew up with it. In this volume the reader lives with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, through the log cabin period to the boom years of the arrival of the
                    canals and the National Road. He watches the Fletchers help construct a social order and promote
                    immigration to the region. He joins Calvin in opening the wilderness for sale, in developing the
                    state banking system, and in pressing for the passage of a significant internal improvements
                    program. He travels Fletcher's court circuits in good and bad weather and learns of the
                    early economic system in which lawyers served as collection agencies. He sees Calvin's role
                    in the church and in the establishment of educational institutions, the colonization society, the
                    agricultural society, and the lyceum or atheneum.</p>
            <p>With both Calvin and Sarah the reader passes through the ordinary everyday activities of life in
                    pioneer Indiana. This reviewer was struck by the Fletchers' efforts to educate <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-069-1-070"/> themselves and their children, by the size of the family group (about a
                    dozen or more) living together in one house, by the extent of visitation between citizens in the
                    town and the number of travelers to the town, and by the long hours of the work day (from 4:00 or
                    5:00 a.m. to 8:00, 10:00, or 12:00 o'clock at night). Calvin's account of the
                    reaction of Indiana's banks and merchants to the Specie Circular is personal and
                    perceptive. The problems of bad weather and sickness displayed in the diaries are not new, though
                    they are overwhelming.</p>
            <p>This is a warm and intimate record of the day to day activities—and often
                    thoughts—of two young people whose aspiration was to live pleasantly, but without
                    ostentation, to raise and educate a respectable family, and to serve their community. Well edited,
                    this publication is a valuable contribution to the <placeName>

            <p>Professional historians have generally neglected the study of local history, leaving the field to
                    amateurs and county historical societies. Professor <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> has attempted to correct this historiographical deficiency for the state of Kentucky
                    with a detailed study of the county court system to 1850. The southern county court system in
                    general may be traced back to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the Kentucky court in particular directly to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The county courts, consisting of the justices of the peace of a county, performed the
                    judicial, legislative, and executive functions of county government, such as overseeing the
                    administration of estates, tax collecting, road building and maintenance, and ferry and mill
                    licensing. <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> not only explores the historical and legal background of these duties but also their
                    practical effect on the people.</p>
            <p>An analysis of the socioeconomic status of the average member of the county court revealed that he
                    was forty-nine, probably a farmer, owner of substantially more taxable property than the average
                    resident, a political leader (often a member of the state legislature), and an officer in the
                    militia. <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-069-1-071"/> Although a significant number of magistrates were
                    members of the state legislature, a study of voting behavior revealed no bloc voting on bills that
                    affected the powers and jurisdictions of the county courts or that attempted to remove errant
                    justices of the peace. <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>'s study also delineates the relationship of the county officials with the
                    governor, the higher judicial tribunals, and the towns and cities of the state.</p>
            <p>The patronage power of the county courts was highly significant and virtually absolute. The clerk,
                    constable, jailer, coroner, surveyor, sheriff, and county attorney were regularly appointed by the
                    court. The office of sheriff, the most lucrative financially and powerful politically, by law
                    evolved onto the senior magistrate. In the larger counties the office was often sold and at times
                    publicly auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p>
            <p>The system was not without fault. "Inattentiveness, cumbersomeness, disorderliness, and
                    inexpertness pervaded the local tribunals" (p. 145). The system was reformed in 1849,
                    although <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> concluded that many of the deficiencies persisted under the new arrangement.</p>
            <p>The study is well researched and competently written. In the section on the financial business of the
                    courts it would have been useful to have indicated the comparative size of county budgets for
                    various periods. One also would have hoped that <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> would have explored in greater detail the family relationships mentioned on page 67.</p>
            <p>If local history in other states can receive similar incisive treatment, then one of the major gaps
                    in American historiography will be closed.</p>

            <p>One important branch of constitutional law which has never received the scholarly or the public
                    attention it deserves is state government. This has been true despite the large <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-069-1-072"/> importance of that level of political power throughout American
                    history, a power which is significant even today when the national leviathan seems so dominant. In
                    order to inform the citizenry and to facilitate constitutional reform, the Institute of Government
                    and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois is publishing a series, <hi rend="i">Studies in
                        Illinois Constitution Making,</hi> of which this volume by Janet Cornelius is a part. Though it
                    is an unpretentious survey of the state's constitutional changes from 1818 to the present,
                    in its original multilithed form it must have been helpful to the delegates of the Illinois
                    constitutional convention of 1969–1970 as they wrote a new, long overdue frame of
                    government. Afterward, the author added an interesting chapter on the convention's work,
                    and the whole book now apppears in print.</p>
            <p>The story of constitution making in Illinois is typical. The first document which was adopted by the
                    frontier state in 1818 borrowed heavily from territorial experience and from models of older states.
                    Partly imitative and partly developmental, it entrusted power mainly to the legislature and extended
                    the voting franchise to all adult males, even aliens. But the horrid nightmare of internal
                    improvement and banking excesses of the 1830s led to change in 1848: a Jacksonian constitution with
                    extensive limitations on legislative power. During the Civil War a convention controlled by
                    Democrats (some suspected of obstructing the war for the Union) drafted a constitution that was
                    rejected by the voters. Then in 1870, during an industrializing period, another attempt succeeded.
                    This document was noteworthy for authorizing the famous Granger legislation and for venturing into
                    the novel system of cumulative voting in legislative districts. But it had familiar faults: it
                    resembled a detailed code of statutes more than a fundamental law; and it was nearly impossible to
                    amend. Over the next century several efforts to bring state government into a more realistic
                    relationship to modern social conditions failed.</p>
            <p>After World War II new leadership for reform, including Adlai Stevenson and Richard Daley, appeared.
                    The first achievement was adoption of the Gateway amendment, making it easier to alter the
                    constitution by abandoning the old rule that a ballot not voting on an issue was a negative vote.
                    Still, the process of piecemeal amendment proved to be <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-069-1-073"/> too slow,
                    and in late 1969 a convention finally met to replace the outmoded document of 1870. On the whole the
                    outcome was salutary. Highlights of improvement included a more equitable system of legislative
                    apportionment (naturally popular in Cook County after so many years of controversy with downstate),
                    a recognition of intense urban needs, and an expanded bill of rights. As for the latter, the
                    protection of rights of blacks and women and the prohibition of official
                    "eavesdropping" were especially liberal.</p>
            <p>As a serviceable introduction to constitutional revision for one state, the study is adequate; and as
                    a message illustrating what ought to be done throughout the country, it may have a positive impact.
                    In this age of crisis for urban and state government anything of the sort is welcome.</p>

            <p>This study of party formation and voting behavior focuses on a social analysis of the transition to
                    mass politics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Relying primarily on intensive investigation of aggregate voting data and census
                    returns and on the approaches and the methods of the social sciences, Formisano dissects Michigan
                    politics much in the manner that his mentor, Lee Benson, examined <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Professor Formisano's thesis is provocative. Religious and ethnocultural cleavages shaped
                    the formation of party alignments in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Democratic dominance between 1837 and 1852 represented the triumph of anti-evangelical
                    social groups who rejected the moral society promoted by native evangelical Protestants first
                    through Antimasonry and then Whiggery. In the 1850s similar differences reshaped party alignments.
                    Anti-Catholic feelings generated by the rise of the Know Nothings divided the Democrats and
                    transformed the Whigs into a new Republican majority. Hostility toward the slave South also
                    contributed to the triumph of the Republicans and their continuation as the state's
                    evangelical party.</p>
            <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-069-1-074"/>
            <p>In Michigan religious and cultural factors produced an early instance of sectionalization in the
                    North that led ultimately to the Civil War. Even attitudes toward party organization and government
                    were predominately shaped by such considerations. Whig antipartyism developed from the evangelical
                    moralism of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Protestant thought that sustained <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>'s Whigs. Whig belief in an activist government in contrast to the laissez
                    faire stance of the Democrats involved different ideas about society premised on an
                    evangelical-anti-evangelical bias.</p>
            <p>Correlations of party voting strength with the religious preferences of communities is crucial to
                    Formisano's thesis. Yet the method used to establish such connections is not entirely
                    convincing. Michigan constituencies are categorized by religious preference on the basis of the
                    number of seats in church buildings listed by denomination in the 1850 <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> census. The ratio of the total number of accomodations to each community's
                    population reveals the "religiosity" of each unit. It is reasonable to question
                    whether this use of aggregate data can accurately measure the intensity of the religious beliefs of
                    social groups.</p>
            <p>Other problems are also evident. For instance, emphasis on the disparate cultural and religious
                    orientations of Democrats and Whigs as explanations of Whig antipartyism and their consequent lack
                    of organizational ability discounts factors of competition and the prospects of electoral victory in
                    determining the formation and the maintenance of party organizations. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, close competition between the parties and considerable electoral success
                    on both sides encouraged the existence of vigorous party organizations and an absence of antiparty
                    sentiment throughout the Jacksonian era.</p>
            <p>Despite these qualifications <hi rend="i">The Birth of Mass Political Parties</hi> is an important
                    book. Formisano's identification of differing party attitudes towards government, society,
                    and party based on social group characteristics demands further investigation. As an example of the
                    possibilities inherent in a multidisciplinary approach to the study of the past, this book deserves
                    emulation.</p>

                    </placeName>: University of Wisconsin Press, 1971. Pp. xiii, 168. Exhibits, tables, appendices,
                    notes, index. $6.50.)</head>
            <p>Professor Soltow is one of the most mathematically minded and sophisticated of the new economic
                    historians, and apparently he shares many of the strengths and weaknesses of that select group. As a
                    result he has produced a book that will be read, discussed, and praised only by members of the elite
                    to which he belongs.</p>
            <p>In all respects regarding methodology and empirical testing, the author is superb. He follows the
                    canons of a good quantitative approach, clearly explaining what he is going to do and how he is
                    going to do it. He describes his problem, his method for analyzing it, the available data, and his
                    sampling procedure. In the body of the book the reader is confronted with an enormous collection of
                    correlation coefficients, Pareto curves, Gini coefficients, formulae, and tables. All of these
                    analytical displays, the knowledgeable reader will conclude, are absolutely necessary. For any but
                    the most sophisticated student of statistics, however, the impact is intimidating and overwhelming.</p>
            <p>Much more than a blow by blow account of the author's analysis of data is required. Although
                    Soltow explains his tables in detail, this is virtually all he does. The last short chapter is the
                    only one in which the reader is presented with a summary of any chapter's content, and this
                    is five paragraphs in length. In the entire book there are only thirteen pages of summary material.
                    Since little discussion exists in this work apart from specific explanations of tables and charts,
                    many readers will be left with the question, "What does it all mean?"</p>
            <p>Soltow begins with a statement of the problem: what was the nature of inequality of wealth in
                    Wisconsin in 1850 and its change in distribution over time? In particular he proposes to test the
                    assumption that the relative share of wealth of the rich increased in the last half of the
                    nineteenth century in a rigorous and systematic manner. No reader will doubt the rigor of the
                    author's approach.</p>
            <p>Soltow's first chapter contains a very terse statement of his findings. The bulk of the book
                    is devoted to an analysis <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-069-1-076"/> of the period 1850–1870;
                    only one chapter concerns wealth distributions after 1870. One chapter compares various nativity
                    groups, and the last chapter presents an analysis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Wisconsin incomes. In brief, the book is unbalanced and not exactly what might be
                    expected from the title.</p>
            <p>Ralph Hidy, in his presidential address to the American Economics Association (<hi rend="i">The
                        Journal of Economic History,</hi> March, 1972), argued that conventionally trained economic
                    historians have an obligation to become familiar with the new techniques in economic history. This
                    is inescapable. But Hidy also stressed that writers equipped with the new methods have a
                    responsibility to communicate with a wider audience than themselves, and in this task Soltow has
                    failed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Dispossessing the American Indian</hi> consists of three groups of loosely related
                    essays. In Part I Jacobs sketches the background of Indian-white contact, emphasizing the fur trade;
                    he covers various topics in Part II—Edmond Atkin's report, the destruction of
                    Fort William Henry in 1757, and the so called conspiracy of Pontiac. Part III is an overview of
                    colonialism in New <placeName>
                  <country reg="gv">Guinea</country>, <country reg="at">Australia</country>
               </placeName>, and North America, an unusual grouping to say the least.
                    Nevertheless, in this section the chapter entitled "The Price of Progress: Native Peoples
                    on the European Frontiers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>

                        <country reg="gv">Guinea</country>
                    </placeName>, and North America" is worth reading for its anthropological point of view.
                    Too often historians neglect the work of anthropologists, who study people in their environment and
                    who do not rely solely on the written record. Jacobs, in contrast, studied firsthand the aborigines
                    of <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>

                        <country reg="gv">Guinea</country>
                    </placeName> and found that they shared an experience with the Indians of North America: they
                    occupied land coveted by invading Europeans. Yet the course of events in these areas was not the
                    same. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName> and America the Europeans displaced <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-069-1-077"/> the native
                    occupants; in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="gv">Guinea</country>
                    </placeName>, despite centuries of contact, the natives retained their culture, their population,
                    and their land because, Jacobs believes, of "geography, climate, and [their] …
                    physical and cultural vitality" (p. 149).</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, despite the publisher's dustjacket claim that the book "shakes some
                    of the myths about Indians and whites on the colonial frontier," it presents little that is
                    new. Consisting as it does of works Jacobs has previously published elsewhere, the book can by no
                    means be considered revisionist history. "What We Owe the Woodland Indians," the
                    epilogue, is a thrice told tale. "White Gift Giving: French Skills in Managing the
                    Indians," although updated and reorganized, follows closely "Presents to Indians
                    along the French Frontiers in the Old Northwest, 1748–1863," a paper Jacobs
                    delivered at a session of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association meeting in April, 1948, and

            <p>Selling and giving away large chunks of the continent to land companies, railroads, educational
                    institutions, and individuals was one of the principal occupations of the national government for
                    well over a century after independence. The records of this commercial and philanthropic enterprise
                    constitute a formidable and forbidding mass of archival material, much of it uncalendared and
                    unregistered or else accessible only through random, incomplete, and thoroughly frustrating indexing
                    schemes. Now, with the publication of Volume I of <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-069-1-078"/> the <hi rend="i">Federal Land Series,</hi> a beginning has been made in the systematic indexing of a
                    large proportion of this material. Emphasis is placed upon the initial transfer of land title from
                    governmental entities to private persons (p. vii). Some of the kinds of documents to be included in
                    the series are military bounty-land warrants, records of land companies, records of sales by
                    district land offices, and governmental policy directives and laws concerning the disposition of the
                    public lands. Much of this information is preserved in the National Archives, but many of the
                    records of land companies and the private papers of important speculators and officials are
                    scattered in repositories throughout the country. It is the ambitious plan of this series to seek
                    out and catalog as many of the pertinent documents as possible, requiring only that they first be
                    microfilmed, "thus fixing the location of individual documents for all time" (p.
                    xii). Unfortunately, this restriction will exclude one large unfilmed body of correspondence, the
                    incoming letters to the General Land Office, which are reported to fill 1,700 drawers and 25,000
                    bound pages (p. xii).</p>
            <p>Much of the outgoing correspondence of the land office is on microfilm, however, and the greater part
                    of this volume is devoted to the cataloging of materials from National Archives Record Group 49,
                    "Records of the Bureau of Land Management," <hi rend="i">Miscellaneous Letters
                        Sent by the General Land Office</hi> and <hi rend="i">Letters Sent by the General Land Office to
                        Surveyors General.</hi> Other documents are taken from National Archives Record Group 56,
                    "General Records of the Department of the Treasury," and Record Group 360,
                    "Records of the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention," as well
                    as from the papers of General John Neville in the Carnegie Library of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from the Richard Clough Anderson Collection of the Illinois Historical Survey at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Parts of two compilations of land laws, one printed in Ohio in 1825 and the other in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1811, are also included. The documents from each of these sources are calendared,
                    and an abstract of their contents is formatted in serial entries. For the correspondence from the
                    General Land Office, for example, the data given for each entry includes the manuscript source (by
                    microfilm reel and letterbook page), the date, the addressee, a brief synopsis of the subject
                    matter, a list of all names mentioned, and the location of the tract involved. <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-069-1-079"/> The serial entries are then cross indexed by name, by tract, and by
                    subject.</p>
            <p>As all research tools, this one has its limitations, and users should observe one caveat. The serial
                    entries of the land office correspondence are abstracted from file copies of the outgoing letters.
                    In other words, they are copies of copies, which only compounds the possibilities for error already
                    inherent in any metamorphosis from the original document to the printed page. Under such
                    circumstances proper names unfamiliar to the copyists are especially vulnerable to mistranscription,
                    and researchers should try several variations in spelling when seeking an individual in the name
                    index. Persons interested in Harvey Heth of Corydon, for example, might wish to check the document
                    indexed under Hervey Hoth. Those seeking Indiana Territorial Judge Benjamin Parke should also see an
                    entry for Benjamin Parker. A little imagination, which writers of history are occasionally accused
                    of possessing in abundance, should overcome this difficulty, and historians and genealogists alike
                    should find this and subsequent volumes of the <hi rend="i">Federal Land Series</hi> an invaluable
                    new resource.</p>

            <p>John Boles in his study of the Great Revival has provided an extremely well documented examination of
                    an important facet of American religion and life. The first part of the book deals with the
                    antecedents and origins of the Great Revival in the South in the early 1800s. Boles continues the
                    study by examining the major thrust of the revival and concludes by offering interpretation and
                    evaluation of this religious phenomenon. The author has carefully drawn on primary sources as he
                    sets the stage for the revival. By this procedure he has broken new ground and offered a new
                    interpretation of the entire movement. He points up the theological framework of the revival and
                    emphasizes the unity of philosophical orientation <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-069-1-080"/> among the
                    different groups. The author writes as one within the southern evangelical tradition but in the true
                    spirit of sympathetic detachment.</p>
            <p>Boles is strongly critical of previous secondary studies of the revival because they do not
                    "make a sustained attempt to analyze why and how the revival developed" (p. 52).
                    In this volume he sets forth to pinpoint "the men, dogmas, and events" and to work
                    out "their probable cause-effect relationships in the chartered dimensions of time and
                    space" (p. 52). His viewpoint is clearly that of a revisionist. He questions the Turnerian
                    interpretations that have been applied to this religious awakening on the frontier. "The
                    inhabitants of Kentucky had neither a unique inclination to emotionalism nor a quenchless thirst for
                    hard liquor" (p. 45). The author is right in saying that "the climate of ideas,
                    beliefs, and hopes out of which the Great Revival … developed is more important than the
                    location or the circumstances of its actual beginning" (p. 36). Boles deserves strong
                    praise for challenging old ideas which offered only partial explanations. His suggestion that
                    revival spread from east to west and then back again is significant.</p>
            <p>Although the revival attracted considerable attention, it was initially confined to comparatively few
                    people. It had an influence of broad ramifications for the entire South (pp. 70–71), but
                    ultimately the influence centered mostly upon the churches themselves. This reviewer would question
                    that the South was quite as monolithic religiously as Boles would lead us to believe (pp.
                    196–203). Many individual Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians successfully led
                    movements for social reform and change which a study of Populism in the South clearly illustrates.</p>
            <p>Boles illustrates the theological bent of the revival best in his description of James McGready who
                    sought to be theological in his preaching but who submerged the fine distinctives of his Calvinism
                    to preserve his role as a revivalist. The Calvinism of both the Presbyterians and Baptists was
                    mitigated during this awakening, and some groups such as the Regular and General Baptists did merge
                    and adopt a modified Calvinism. The assertion that the sermons of the revival were more doctrinal
                    than they actually were may be due to the fact that the sources of the more articulate have been
                    preserved, or it may say that the pulpit is clearer on the doctrinal <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-069-1-081"/> distinctives than the pew. Unsophisticated religion tends to be
                    explicit while sophisticated religion tends to be implicit.</p>
            <p>The success of the revivals spoiled the unity of the denominations. The Baptists and Presbyterians
                    moved away from the joint revivals first or at least gave cautious support and then turned away.
                    Calvinism is clearly not the only culprit. Perfectionism, geography, and personalities all played
                    their part. Paradoxically, the effort to effect a new union of Christians under Barton W. Stone led
                    to yet another division. A brief examination of the antirevival sentiments of the non-evangelical
                    groups would have proved interesting and may explain at some points the tack that the revivals took.</p>
            <p>Boles is to be commended for a careful, thought provoking study. There are few real weaknesses in
                    this book, but the suggestion that the religious people of the South were ready and expecting a
                    revival and it came appears too simplistic. Many times in Christian history the people of the church
                    anticipated and anguished for a revival that never came. A comparative examination of the Great
                    Revival of 1787–1805 and the revivals in the <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Midcentury America: Life in the 1850s.</hi> Complied and edited by Carl Bode.
                    (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1972. Pp. xix, 236. Illustrations, secondary
                    sources. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>This is a collection of literary and graphic fragments which illustrate American thought, feeling,
                    and behavior as they were during the 1850s. Its panoramic view ranges from church to kitchen, from
                    farm to exhibition hall, from counting-house to bedroom. The book aims to convey various and
                    concrete impressions of what ordinary people were like, and it succeeds.</p>
            <p>Professor Bode's compilation gains bite and unity from his candidly stated opinion that the
                    "average white American" living in the middle of the nineteenth century was
                    "worse off physically and better off mentally" than is his present day <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-069-1-082"/> counterpart (pp. xiv, xiii). Although he realizes that Americans have
                    not changed utterly, that they maintain the old belief in progress and the old restlessness, it is
                    nonetheless clear to Bode that hs countrymen are less firmly supported by faith and family, less at
                    ease in their patriotism, and less confident of their public institutions than they were a century
                    ago. He does not disguise the decade before the Civil War as a golden age, but he does present it as
                    a relatively decent and comfortable time in which to have been an American.</p>
            <p>The first of the book's seven chapters offers a series of impressions of how Americans
                    looked and thought of their country as looking. Its breadth is exceeded by a later chapter on
                    "The Pleasures of Life," which includes selections on fine arts, games such as
                    "Hot Cockles" (which could be taken to impeach the mental well being of the
                    period), Jenny Lind, and travel, as well as discussing how people acted at beaches while wearing
                    costumes unsuited to swimming (pp. 165–206). Those pleasures which do not fit into the
                    generous confines of that chapter are taken up—very delicately—in a chapter on
                    home life. Work, education, religion, and slavery are all treated in chapters which are at least
                    broad enough for their thirty or so pages.</p>
            <p>Each chapter offers selections by familiar writers such as Walt Whitman, Adam de Gurowski, Wendell
                    Phillips, and Anon. Less famous writers are represented, too, as are popular artists, especially
                    those whose works were made widely available through lithography. Essays of a page or two introduce
                    each selection, sometimes leaving questions—about a minister's denomination, for
                    example (pp. 135–36)—to be answered at the reader's initiative. If
                    less than exhaustive, the introductions are invariably helpful, and some of those about pictures are
                    delightful. Bode's presentation of "the closest thing to pornography" (p.
                    91) that the period had to offer is particularly instructive. Such edification, of course, is only
                    to be expected from the author of <hi rend="i">The Anatomy of American Popular Culture,
                        1840–1861</hi> (1959).</p>
            <p>This book will be appreciated by those who have read Bode's earlier works, though it will
                    make only modest additions to the knowledge they have already received from him. One hopes its
                    attractive format and its very accessible style will surmount the barrier of its price to win him
                    new readers <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-069-1-083"/> among undergraduates and others who get pleasure

            <p>George Sinkler attempts to ascertain and explain the racial views of American presidents from Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> through the first Roosevelt. Although this book has merit, it has many serious
                    weaknesses. The awkward prose and the poor organization make the book difficult to read. One has to
                    question the author's failure to include Woodrow Wilson's presidency. Not only was
                    Wilson the first southerner to hold presidential office since Reconstruction, but also his
                    presidency marked the nationalization of the race question. This is seen in the Great Migration and
                    the extension of segregation practices to federal employment. In the chapter on James A. Garfield
                    and C#2 A. Arthur, Sinkler includes Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The only reason seems to be that he wishes to have a chapter of forty pages instead of
                    sixteen. But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> must be studied independently of his Republican predecessors because he represented the
                    Democrats who generally held a different racial attitude than most Republicans. In the next chapter
                    the author devotes only twelve pages to William McKinley's attitude toward blacks. Yet the
                    nineties are extremely important years in black-white relations. In examining the twenty per cent of
                    the book given to documentation, one has the impression that Sinkler spent a lot of time taking
                    notes but little time in culling them.</p>
            <p>Sinkler also fails to define race. Certainly he is to be commended on his effort to see the racial
                    issue beyond white attitudes toward black Americans. However, the sources which he used make it
                    difficult to judge the role of non-black minorities. Nineteen pages dealing with the Indian are
                    scattered throughout the book. Even much of this material is repetitious <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-069-1-084"/> since Sinkler feels he must include something on the Indian for each
                    President. Fewer pages are given to the Chinese and Japanese. The author even includes the Jews in
                    his discussion of race and occasionally mentions the southern and eastern Europeans.</p>
            <p>There is something lacking in Sinkler's analysis of presidential attitudes. His failure to
                    discuss adequately the milieu out of which the Presidents came leads him to conclude that they
                    generally treated race as a political rather than a moral question. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> is condemned for following public opinion instead of leading it. Andrew Johnson is
                    castigated because he acted, according to Sinkler, as a political animal. He adopted the role of a
                    "Moses" for blacks only to insure himself a place on the national ticket in 1864
                    and to undermine the southern aristocracy. No one doubts that the Presidents assumed white
                    superiority. How many of their contemporaries did not? But most of the Presidents believed that
                    there were necessary reasons, and not just political ones, for adopting a policy different than that
                    of Reconstruction. They were not just selling out to white southerners. Historian James M. McPherson
                    in writing on the antislavery legacy shows that the abolitionists and their descendants did not sell
                    out blacks but felt that time and education had to replace the immediatism of the reconstruction
                    period. Whether this change in attitude was only a rationalization for racism is debatable. It does
                    indicate, however, that the Presidents were not alone. Republican policy after 1877 was something
                    more than plain expediency. It reflected the times, and the men who were in the White House were
                    definitely men of their times.</p>
            <p>The book has two redeeming features. Sinkler does show that the "farewell to the bloody
                    shirt" did not mean deserting the black American. Also the two chapters on Roosevelt are
                    good. The author revises some of the harsh opinions that historians generally hold concerning
                    Roosevelt's Anglo-Saxon racism. But on reading the book one has to conclude that a much
                    better study could have been written.</p>

                    essay, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>This excellent second volume is a suitable companion to Richard Lowitt's study of the early
                    life of Senator George W. Norris. The first book brought Norris to 1912, and at that time Lowitt
                    believed that he could complete the biography with one additional volume. He now confesses that he
                    will require yet another to finish the job. Norris proved more subtle and involved than Lowitt
                    anticipated, and the author also concedes that the mountain of Norris manuscripts in the Library of
                    Congress—more than 1,000 boxes—did not yield to easy or brief treatment. In
                    addition, Lowitt has ferreted out other valuable manuscript collections; and, although he seems to
                    have bypassed the unpublished Herbert Hoover Papers, he has fully exploited the Harry Slattery
                    Papers in Duke University. The result is a thoroughly researched book.</p>
            <p>Every biographer faces the question of how he wants to develop the character of his study and the
                    times in which the subject lived. Which of these is more important to an author at a given moment in
                    history will determine the emphasis of his biography. Lowitt's first volume was a mine of
                    information about Progressivism; the second volume is essentially a study of Norris. The events and
                    crises of America's entry into the war, prosperity, and deepening depression are all
                    subsumed in Norris' response to them. As a result the reader is never lost in a thicket of
                    details or left without a clear recognition of how each part of the narrative relates to Norris.
                    Even when the same themes recur, such as the farm problem, there is no sense of repetitiveness;
                    rather the reader feels that Lowitt is deftly liming his characterization of Norris. This is one
                    biography in which the reader comes to know the subject; Norris' frugality, moderation,
                    style, and insecurities are all quite evident.</p>
            <p>Lowitt's emphasis on Norris the man, however, will disappoint some scholars who want to know
                    more about how he functioned in the mechanical and organizational structure of party government and
                    party life. Lowitt tells the reader how Norris reacted to events and what he said but rarely
                    discloses what went on behind closed doors. Lowitt's treatment may be <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-069-1-086"/> weak here, but there is also the possibility that he has told it all.
                    Norris may never really have been intricately involved in party or Senate affairs beyond the role of
                    researcher and reform publicist which Lowitt has carved out for him. But Lowitt tells enough, and
                    the reader who does not feel the strength of Norris' attachment to La Follette or
                    understand export debenture schemes or the McNary-Haugen Bill has only himself to blame.</p>
            <p>This book will be indispenable for scholars who are interested in the decades between 1913 and 1933,
                    not only because Norris was important but also because Lowitt has fitted him so carefully into the
                    context of the times. In this process Lowitt has shed light on many questions, and his insights will
                    be helpful in understanding Progressive minds and behavior, especially in the 1920s. This is
                    highlighted in Lowitt's discussion of Norris' long fight over public versus
                    private electric power.</p>
            <p>Lowitt writes extremely well, and even though this is a very long book, its short chapters, clear
                    organization, and sense of proportion make it a genuine pleasure to read. In fact, the book is so
                    well done that it can stand alone as a valuable study. One need not read the earlier book to
                    appreciate and benefit from Lowitt's scholarship. Scholars can now look forward to the
                    third and final volume of what promises to be the definitive and magisterial biography of George W.
                    Norris.</p>

            <p>The work of Caroline Robbins, Bernard Bailyn, Gordon Wood, and others has underscored the impact of
                    whiggish historical, political, and legal ideas upon the contours of the American Revolution. It is
                    now impossible to ignore the enormous reliance of colonial Americans upon concepts of rights and
                    liberties which they considered the heritage of Englishmen living in the eighteenth century. In the
                    twentieth century, almost at the door of the bicentennial quasi-celebration to honor
                    America's break from Great Britain, the Library of <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-069-1-087"/>
                    Congress gently reminds <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> citizens of those radical men and women who, in the face of an increasingly resolute
                    ministerial policy to the contrary, supported the colonial cause after 1774.</p>
            <p>To its credit and historians' benefit, the Library of Congress has rescued from obscurity
                    six pamphlets written in the mother country from 1774 to 1778, pamphlets which patriots prized for
                    the prestige and reinforcement they lent to American arguments. The writings of Jonathan Shipley,
                    Bishop of St. Asaph; Willoughby Bertie, Earl of Abingdon; and Matthew Robinson-Morris, Baron Rokeby,
                    were published by Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his friends to convince Americans of the support of "sensible"
                    Englishmen; more radical were the writings of Catherine Macaulay, whose multivolume history of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> assured her post-Revolutionary credentials as a staunch whig and friend of America, and
                    John Cartwright, whose iconoclastic essays on American independence were reprinted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in time for the Declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>Their concern for the American cause grew from an increasingly firm conviction that the fate of
                    English political virtues hung in the balance in the New World: a ministry which successfully
                    revoked charters and taxed subjects without their consent would not hesitate, they believed, to move
                    from one such heinous victory to another. These pamphlets reveal the extent to which the politically
                    discontented on both sides of the Atlantic shared a community of ideas. The litany of protests is a
                    familiar one: taxation without consent and the violation of colonial charters threatened the basis
                    of English freedom. Virtual representation, wrote Baron Rokeby, existed only in the minds of its
                    advocates. He proposed, as did Mrs. Macaulay in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and James Wilson in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which was neither represented in Parliament nor taxed by it, provided a better model
                    for a new imperial concept.</p>
            <p>Worthy of special note are the essays of John Cartwright, written in 1774, which broke from tradition
                    on two important points: first, he rejected the fiction of allegiance to the king without allegiance
                    to Parliament; second, Cartwright avowed that only those who cringed at "bold and honest
                    truths" failed to recognize that "the respective governments in America, <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-069-1-088"/> are no longer dependent colonies; they are independent
                    nations." (p. 138).</p>
            <p>It is appropriate that the Library of Congress has rescued from obscurity the "bold and
                    honest" writings of early compatriots who were little honored for their views in their own
                    country.</p>

            <p>Victorian women fascinate students of women's history because the social image of the
                    perfect lady seems in retrospect to have been completely at odds with human nature. What could have
                    happened in the society to transform the robust eighteenth century ideal of the "notable
                    housewife" into the nineteenth century's languishing, ladylike "angel in
                    the house"? The first was so clearly functional that one tends to assume that the latter
                    must have been too: but how? If this question is ever satisfactorily answered, scholars will have
                    learned something important about the relationship between sexual ideals and social structure.</p>
            <p>The essays in this volume, contributed by scholars in history, sociology, and literature, deal with a
                    variety of specific questions within the general framework of Victorian womanhood. A collection of
                    this kind is difficult to review sensibly since there is no central theme which permits the book to
                    be analyzed as a whole. It is impossible to do more than summarize the variety of ideas which are
                    advanced.</p>
            <p>Several essays suggest new lines of inquiry for women's history and contribute new
                    understanding of the Victorian middle class. M. Jeanne Peterson's study of the governess,
                    that second level status symbol of the affluent, is a cogent analysis of the contradiction inherent
                    in the notion that no lady would work for pay but that <hi rend="i">only</hi> a lady was fit to
                    teach one's children. Helen Roberts of the Fogg Museum makes ingenious use of Victorian
                    paintings to increase our understanding of the role expectations of nineteenth century wives. <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-069-1-089"/> Peter Stearns' essay on working women is promising both
                    in method and content. Late nineteenth century English reformers tried hard to develop a factual
                    basis for their social proposals, and many massive studies were the result. Stearns has gone back to
                    some of these inquiries and to some significant government studies in search of the wives of working
                    men. Though he does not hesitate to generalize boldly on scraps of evidence, his essay will repay
                    careful study. Jill Conway's article on the sexual stereotypes held by theorists of
                    evolution demonstrates once again the influence of cultural assumptions on scientific perception. S.
                    Barbara Kanner's excellent bibliography of the scholarly work dealing with English women
                    since 1815 shows clearly how much work remains to be done.</p>
            <p>There are, in addition, essays on attitudes toward menstruation, on prostitution and veneral disease,
                    and on the unconscious minds of innocent young ladies. Kate Millett writes on John Ruskin and John
                    Stuart Mill, and another essay defends William S. Gilbert against the charge of undue cruelty to
                    elderly spinsters. As is nearly always true in such collections, the quality is uneven, the style
                    often distressingly pedantic. Yet in this case the number of stimulating questions raised makes the
                    volume well worth reading.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1972. Pp. x, 237. Notes, subject index. $20.00.) The scope and purpose of
                    this extremely useful volume is well indicated by its title. As for Volume I, "Only
                    dissertations completed in formally organized departments of history and for which a doctor of
                    philosophy degree was granted are included. No dissertations from inter-disciplinary or non-history
                    departments have been knowingly listed" (p. vii). Some of the problems and limitations
                    involved in the publication of this index are forthrightly explained in the preface. An admonition
                    of the compiler to historians bears quoting: "One might wish, indeed plead, that future
                    authors follow the commonsense rule of embodying in their titles a clear indication of the subject
                    matter" (p. vii). Kuehl's comments make it painfully clear that history
                    departments which sponsor graduate dissertations in history are themselves generally sloppy in
                    preserving their own historical records. In a summary statement of doctoral degrees in history Kuehl
                    lists an aggregate of 7,695 such degrees for the period 1873–1960 and 5,884 of them for
                    the period 1961–1970 (pp. ix-x). Indiana University is listed for 113 and 139 such
                    degrees for these respective periods; Notre Dame University for 19 and 38 in like manner. Only the

                    comprehensive account of his unusual political career. Though at times very generous in praise of
                    Willkie, in many things the author is sharply critical of him. In general, Willkie is given a strong
                    rating for various important concepts, principles, and goals but a low mark for what is viewed as
                    his inept and often blundering methods in attaining them. This book perhaps raises more questions
                    than it answers, but students of Willkie need to give it their careful attention.</p>

                    Paperbound, $3.95.) Well known for his books on American politics in the nineteenth

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He traces their slow evolution from their colonial origins to roughly the middle of
                    the nineteenth century, by which time, according to Nichols, rival political parties had become well
                    established throughout the country generally. This volume affords significant insights and

                    a potpourri of sympathetically told traditions about various folk of the Appalachian Mountains and
                    their practices, views, and doings. The book can be read with much enjoyment, especially by persons
                    old enough to recall or even to have experienced some of the ways of life associated with the
                    essentially rural and agrarian society which has largely disappeared during the twentieth century.

                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $3.95.) In this study Greven uses the evidence found
                    primarily in probate records, deeds, town records, and vital records to examine the character of
                    family life in one New <placeName>

                    </placeName> town for the period 1646 to the mid-1770s. A case study in demographic, economic, and
                    familial history, <hi rend="i">Four Generations</hi> focuses on such aspects of family life as
                    birth, marriage and mortality rates, family size and structure, family relationship to the land,
                    father and son relationships, and family mobility. Examining his evidence "with care and
                    imagination," Greven makes some unexpected discoveries about colonial family life in
                    Andover. He finds, for example, the founders of the town and their children surprisingly longlived
                    and "remarkably rooted" in their surroundings, while the grandchildren and great
                    grandchildren, presumably living under better conditions and possessing fewer opportunities, were
                    both less long lived and more geographically mobile. Besides holding surprises such as these that
                    challenge some traditional views of American social history, <hi rend="i">Four Generations</hi> has
                    particular interest <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-069-1-093"/> for the historian of local history. As a
                    model for the use of local records and archives, Greven's study demonstrates to the
                    historian both the methodology for handling and the value of such evidence. In <hi rend="i">Four
                        Generations</hi> Greven has fashioned a careful and imaginative study which deserves the
                    attention of scholars interested in the establishment of a firm base in local history from which
                    broader regional and national demographic generalizations may be derived. <hi rend="i">Donald T.

                    of information about the beginnings of medical practice in colonial America with emphasis on subject
                    matter. It is a quite readable and very fascinating account. Whether read by medical doctors or
                    those whom they treat, it is likely to encourage the view that medical practice is much more an art
                    and much less a science than is commonly supposed.</p>

            <p>The above publications, all issued by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, concern events which
                    centered on Mackinac Island or the nearby Mackinac Straits area. Except for the study of the
                    Marquette mission site, the pamphlets principally discuss happenings from about 1760 through the
                    American Revolution; consideration is also given, however, to certain events up to 1895 when the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army abandoned Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island. Collectively these publications offer
                    information regarding Marquette and Roman Catholic missions; Indian dress in the area; army life
                    over a number of decades; the fur trading ventures of Alexander Henry, including his gruesome
                    account of survival during Pontiac's War; and the continuing efforts to preserve historic
                    sites and restore or reconstruct significant structures of the area. Although to some extent these
                    studies are "progress reports" rather than evaluations of finished research and
                    labors, nonetheless they are quite informative. Their value is much enhanced by numerous
                    illustrations, some of which are in color. The general historical importance of the Mackinac area,
                    especially from the 1660s through the War of 1812, was so great that the continuing efforts and
                    contributions of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission are significant for the study of
                    regional, national, and even international history as well as for their state and local importance.
                    These pamphlets are also worthy of emulation by other state parks, memorials, and historical
                sites.</p>

                    was created through 1946. (Due to jurisdictional changes in the branch archives system, the records

            <head>Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation from Americn Association for State and Local
                    History</head>
            <p>All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and <hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than May 15, 1973.</hi> Each nominator must include a supporting letter
                    which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nominator is also
                    responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements <hi rend="i">directly to the state chairman.</hi> Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.</p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation.</hi> The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of overall excellence in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."</p>
