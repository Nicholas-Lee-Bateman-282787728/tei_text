                <head>Editor&apos;s Note</head>
                <p>The Hoosier state is known for many things, but a diverse population has never been among them. In
                    its largest city, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a foreign-born population that once comprised nearly one-quarter of the
                    city&apos;s total declined steeply through the twentieth century to less than two percent by
                    1990-a date at which the city ranked second-lowest (after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7017750" reg="Memphis ">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>) among the nation&apos;s fifty largest in its proportion of foreign-born. Even in
                    the late 1800s, when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                        >Indianapolis&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName> foreign-born residents comprised a significant segment of its total population, the
                    Hoosier capital still ranked near-last in that category, ahead only of a clutch of southern cities.</p>
                <p>The reasons for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                        >Indianapolis&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName> (and, with notable local exceptions, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana&apos;s</region>
                    </placeName>) historically high native-born population are many and complex. Just as complex-and
                    even harder to assess because of their recency-are the reasons for the diversification of the
                    city&apos;s and the state&apos;s population in the last two decades. This increasing
                    diversity may help to account for a rising interest among our contributors and our readers in the
                    stories of Hoosiers from a variety of racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. The
                    state&apos;s black history remains a &quot;growth&quot; field among historians, and I
                    hope that the pages of the IMH have fairly represented at least some of that growth. In recent
                    issues, we have profiled the Japanese Americans who came here in the wake of World War II internment
                    policies and the Asian Indians whose numbers have swelled in more recent decades. In this issue,
                    Richard Moss investigates the dilem- <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-103-1-008"/> mas faced by Jewish
                    immigrants living on the south side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early 1900s. As Moss&apos;s research makes clear, concerns as to what
                    constituted a proper &quot;American&quot; emanated not only from native-born, Protestant
                    citizens, but arose just as pressingly within the ethnic population itself. Moss&apos;s work
                    makes clear the fallacy-now as a century ago- of assuming a common point of view from the fact of a
                    common religion or ethnicity.</p>
                <p>Indiana&apos;s historic homogeneity may also have been a factor contributing to the
                    state&apos;s prominent place in the national eugenics movement. As Alexandra Stern shows in her
                    overview of eugenics practice in the Hoosier state, Indiana physicians and lawmakers were singularly
                    active in the nationwide movement to breed better citizens. The history of the most startling of
                    their efforts in this campaign-the forced sterilization of selected prisoners and mental patients-is
                    more complicated than it might first appear. Stern&apos;s survey of law, practice, and attitude
                    among Indiana&apos;s eugenicists-and their opponents-will provide the scholarly framework for a
                    day-long commemoration of the centennial of the first state eugenics law, which will take place
                    April 12, 2007. Events, all free and open to the public, include a symposium, exhibition opening,
                    and historical-plaque dedication at the Indiana State Library. For more on these activities, visit
                        <hi rend="i">http://www.bioethics.iupui.edu/Eugenics/index.htm</hi>.</p>
                <p>We also touch in this issue upon one of <placeName>

                    Indiana&apos;s New Deal-era Republican representative Charles Halleck both reflect on our
                    state&apos;s legacy to the national political scene, and on the ways in which political
                    reputations are made, unmade, and remade over time.</p>
                <p>Finally, a note for those of you who traditionally look for the annual IMH index in our March issue:
                    You will find the 2006 index online, at <hi rend="i">http://www.indiana.edu/imaghist</hi>. As our
                    full run is digitized in the coming year, our print and online indexes will ultimately merge in a
                    single search engine that will allow searching by keyword, title, author, and subject. I look
                    forward to keeping you posted on our progress in this department.</p>

                    Hoosiers with bad heredity: the feebleminded, inveterate criminals, and parents whose firstborn was
                    a confirmed defective.</p>

                    and prohibiting the &quot;mentally deficient, persons with a &apos;transmissible
                    disease&apos; and habitual drunkards&quot; from marital unions.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In
                    addition, in 1907, and again in 1927, the state legislature had approved statutes authorizing the
                    sterilization of the &quot;insane, feeble-minded, or epileptic persons&quot; in custodial
                        care.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Even so, Rice wanted to ensure the exacting implementation of these
                    laws and extend sterilization outside of the walls of state institutions. A professor in the

                    the <hi rend="i">Monthly Bulletin</hi>, and the future state health commissioner, Rice was well
                    positioned to communicate his ideas about the biological and social burden of defective heredity. In

                    Why did eugenics prosper in a state characterized by a preponderance of native-born white residents
                    and a paucity of immigrants and racial minorities? What ideological framework enabled Hoosier
                    eugenicists to link the cultivation of better babies to the sterilization of defectives? Finally,
                    who was deemed unfit (and fit) according to the eugenic standards of the day and what might this

                    unconstitutional and replaced by a revamped statute in 1927, this law set the stage for the
                    sterilization of over 2,000 Hoosiers committed to mental and penal facilities. With the hindsight of
                    a century, it is instructive to evaluate the motivations behind this legislation and to assess how
                    other aspects of eugenics in <placeName>

                    history examined in this article can be consigned to an increasingly distant past, many of the
                    ethical questions raised remain as compelling today. The dilemmas associated with reproduction,
                    breeding, and decisions about which human traits are desirable or undesirable appear, if anything,
                    even more pronounced in the twenty-first century, as fertility technologies and genetic discoveries
                    expand at an unprecedented rate.</p>
                <p>This article begins with a discussion of the passage of the 1907 sterilization law, which was ruled
                    unconstitutional by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1921. I then move to an examination of the
                    activities of the Committee on Mental Defectives formed by the Board of State Charities in 1915 to
                    combat an apparent crisis of &quot;mental defectiveness <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-103-1-014"/>in <placeName>

                    Hygiene, which directed immensely popular better babies contests at the Indiana State Fair from 1920
                    to 1932. In the last section I return to the topic of sterilization, discussing the 1927 statute and
                    its implementation at the Fort Wayne State School, where reproductive surgeries were performed on
                    approximately 1,800 inmates from 1930 to 1960.</p>

                <p>In May 1909 Eddie Millard, an inmate at the Indiana State Prison, sent a statement of complaint to
                    Governor Thomas R. Marshall describing his forced sterilization two years earlier at the hands of
                    Dr. Harry C. Sharp, the medical superintendent of the Indiana Reformatory in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. According to Millard, after being convicted of petty larceny and sentenced to the
                    reformatory in 1907, he was sent to the prison hospital where Sharp interrogated him with a
                    &quot;great many questions in regard to [his] past life.&quot; Based on this evaluation,
                    Sharp told Millard that &quot;&apos;I think we will cut your cords.&quot;&apos;
                    Millard bridled at this suggestion, informing Sharp that he &quot;had not been convicted of any
                    acts . . . that warranted such an operation necessary.&quot; Despite physically resisting Sharp
                    in the operating room, Millard was sterilized &quot;against [his] will, the cords of both
                    testicles being clipped&quot; in March 1908.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The following year Millard
                    was transferred to the state prison, where he was granted writing privileges and penned his

                <p>Millard&apos;s dramatic description of his forced vasectomy offers one of the few glimpses into

                    Hurty, this bill passed by a moderate margin in the legislature and was signed into law on April 9,
                    1907, by Governor James Frank Hanly, an anti-vice crusader and hard-line
                        prohibitionist.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Intended to stop the propagation of
                    &quot;confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles and rapists&quot; the law obliged mental and
                    penal institutions to appoint two surgeons (in addition to existing medical personnel), who, along
                    with the superintendents, were empowered to sterilize inmates for whom &quot;procreation is

                    degeneracy, hyper-sexuality, and the primacy of heredity in determining personality and familial
                    traits. Starting in the late nineteenth century, influential Indianans including Hurty and
                    Congregationalist minister Oscar McCulloch, began to express alarm over what they perceived to be a
                    rapidly growing class of degenerate and diseased paupers. To understand this phenomenon they turned
                    to eugenics, which distilled complex social, economic, and environmental issues into simplistic
                    explanations of genetic inheritance. As Hurty told the Indianapolis Literary Club, &quot;all
                    social problems, which we have assiduously tried to solve by education, care, cure and relief, are
                    fast becoming recognized to be biological problems.&quot;&apos;<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>

                    as well as the eugenic marriage ban. He deemed sterilization a &quot;higher hygiene, through
                    which we can hope to better the race.&quot; Voicing an attitude widespread among American
                    eugenicists, Hurty contended that social amelioration and instruction could never cure degenerates

                    </placeName>, his colleague Sharp was busy experimenting with sterilization as a therapy for
                    troubled prisoners. At the outset Sharp was attracted to vasectomy (a procedure he helped to refine)
                    as an alternative to castration that he believed could effectively treat onanism and sexual
                        deviancy.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> With this premise in mind, Sharp began to vasectomize inmates at
                    the Indiana Reformatory in 1899, performing approximately 225 such operations <hi rend="i"
                    >before</hi> the sterilization law was passed in 1907.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Gradually Sharp moved
                    away from seeing vasectomy primarily as a therapeutic measure and began to regard it as an eugenic
                    intervention capable of improving the human race. Under the hereditarian spell and likely aware that
                    observers might interpret the unwarranted vasectomy of inmates as unsavory at best, Sharp urged the
                    legislature to pass a compulsory sterilization law. He believed this act simultaneously would save
                    the state thousands of dollars by allowing for the release of treated inmates, thereby halting the
                    transmission of &quot;mental as well as physical defects&quot; to their offspring.<hi

                    apprehensive about the statute and Sharp&apos;s vasectomies. Due in part to a handful of letters
                    like Millard&apos;s that condemned the forceful tactics employed at the Indiana Reformatory, and
                    in part to partisan one-upmanship, Marshall ordered a moratorium on sterilizations in state

                    Court rulings demonstrated that sterilization acts that could be construed as punitive rather than
                    eugenic or preventive in intent and outcome frequently did not pass muster against constitutional
                    jurisprudence. To a great extent, <placeName>

                    little of public health, an oversight apparently lost on Hurty. When a new cohort of legislators
                    ratified a revamped act in 1927, they had learned what pitfalls and problematic terminology to

                    the frontier farming associated with subsistence, horse, and manpower inputs. As in the domain of

                    on hereditarian principles to interpret the heightened visibility of those Hoosiers left behind by
                    modernization. In particular, Amos W. Butler, the BSC&apos;s secretary from 1898 to 1923, turned
                    to eugenic theories to grasp and resolve the state&apos;s accelerating rate of

                    Before long CMD researchers set off to locate mental defectives in institutions, schools, and the

                <p>The CMD&apos;s labors from 1916 to 1922 resulted in three reports and the calculation that 2.1

                    compared mental defectiveness in ten counties, the third devoted much of its space to mental surveys

                    eugenicists, that of the three types of defectives-epileptic, insane, and feebleminded-without a
                    doubt the latter posed the gravest threat. Unlike the more easily recognized and interned epileptics
                    and insane, the feebleminded were scattered &quot;everywhere, in town and city and

                    to pass, coupled with an inborn lack of inhibition and self-control, enabled them to propagate their
                    defective heredity at rates up to 2.4 times those of normal people.</p>
                <p>The CMD was one of many agencies around the country that fostered the detection of mentally disabled
                    children in the school system and instituted special education programs. Nonetheless, in retrospect,
                    the CMD&apos;s survey corpus contains some of the most disturbing examples of Hoosier eugenics.
                    The CMD dispatched field workers to the eleven counties profiled in the official reports and to at
                    least a dozen more. Many of the researchers were professional women who fancied themselves selfless
                    scientific missionaries and arrived at their destinations armed with the eugenic tools of the day:
                    cameras, pedigree charts, hereditary nomenclature, and a reliable formula for chronicling family
                    lineages in an abridged yet melodramatic form.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The hundreds of family studies
                    gathered by the CMD offer a window onto the devastating social effects and human costs of rural
                    poverty, job scarcity, and haphazard educational access. Strung together, the studies can also be
                    read as a meta-narrative of the anxieties about contamination, disorder, and out-of-control bodies
                    that so engrossed eugenicists and of how they sought to manage these dangers through technical
                    classification, deductive method, and what amounted to derisive caricature.</p>
                <p>Each study revolved around a Patient Zero from whom the sprawling defective family tree was traced,
                    frequently back four or more generations. Although these corrupted pedigrees were usually identified
                    by surname, some researchers colorfully labeled them: &quot;Lily Green Schew and her Five
                    Husbands,&quot; &quot;The Dirty Dozen,&quot; and &quot;A Bed Accommodating
                    Six.&quot; Employing the pedigree charting they had mastered at the Eugenics Record Office, most
                    field workers complemented their narratives with a genetic family tree that featured squares for
                    men, circles for women, and letters to designate undesirable traits or &quot;unit <list

                            a subjective eyeball assessment to the administration of intelligence tests. <hi rend="i"

                <p>Indeed, one of the studies&apos; most pervasive themes was that mental defectives inhabited a
                    marginal topography of edges, riverbeds, and undomesticated wild lands either unsuited for or
                    unexploited by rational agricultural cultivation. Consider, for instance, the peregrinations of
                    Hazel Hansford, who surveyed one of the counties discussed in the CMD&apos;s second report. To
                    find the &quot;Lookout Ridge Population&quot; she had to cross &quot;the roughest of
                    slippery, gullied mud roads&quot;; to reach the &quot;Ripple Creek Group&quot; traverse
                    an area with the &quot;wild, unsettled appearance of a district 20 miles from
                    civilization&quot;; and to arrive at &quot;The Three Moffit Invalids&quot; bushwhack
                    through &quot;a tangle of brush, weeds, and for- est&quot; to ramshackle homes

                <p>The CMD identified the vast majority of these borderline Hoosiers as native-born whites. This might

                <p>Notwithstanding these pronouncements in the field reports, in official documents Butler and the CMD
                    recommended that feeblemindedness be combated with long-term segregation rather than sterilization,
                    even though such sentiments stood at odds with the laments about the public expense of years, if not
                    decades, of institutionalization. The CMD never had the chance to resolve this contradiction.
                    Despite a spirited lobbying effort, the legislature and a new governor were not persuaded to renew
                    the CMD&apos;s appropriation and the committee&apos;s last meeting occurred in November
                        1924.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Nevertheless, as the CMD&apos;s work was coming to a close, a

                <p>BREEDING BETTER BABIES</p>
                <p>Following in the footsteps of her mentor Hurty, Dr. Ada E. Schweitzer, a loyal employee of the
                    Indiana State Board of Health (ISBH), put the intertwined tenets of public health and human
                    betterment into action at the Indiana State Fair. For 12 years she orchestrated one of the most
                    popular attractions on the fairgrounds: the better babies contest.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> First hired
                    by Hurty in 1906 to serve as assistant bacteriologist at the state laboratory, Schweitzer worked her
                    way up the ranks at the ISBH by carving out a niche in maternal and infant hygiene. Initially
                    focused on pediatric infectious diseases, in the 1910s Schweitzer broadened her intellectual scope,
                    becoming versed in the evolving specialty of children&apos;s health. She collaborated on several
                    projects with the United States Children&apos;s Bureau, realized a survey of infant mortality in <placeName>

                    </placeName> branch of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality.
                    When Hurty received word in 1919 that the legislature at last had approved his request to launch the
                    Division of Infant and Child Hygiene (DICH) and earmarked $10,000 in start-up funds, he immediately
                    contacted Schweitzer, who gladly consented to head up the new division.</p>
                <p>For 14 years, until she was ousted from the DICH in a political shake-up in 1933, Schweitzer
                    diligently worked to lower infant and maternal death rates and to convince Indianans of the
                    importance of scientific motherhood and child rearing. She lectured to hundreds of neighborhood and
                    civic groups, wrote voluminous articles and poems, and assessed the physical condition of babies in
                    every one of the state&apos;s 92 counties. In addition, Schweitzer organized mothers&apos;
                    classes in which she taught pregnant women the fundamentals of prenatal and baby care. In 1925,
                    16,649 women took these classes.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> The following year, the division&apos;s
                    operating funds reached $60,000, largely due to the federal Sheppard-Towner Act, passed in 1921,
                    which provided states with matching funds for infant and mental welfare.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    films to 606,364 viewers, and distributed 1,216,577 pamphlets.<hi rend="sup">70</hi></p>
                <p>Schweitzer delivered a two-pronged message of better babies through improved rearing and superior
                    breeding. Like Hurty, Schweitzer viewed public health and human betterment as overlapping endeavors
                    that strove to build up &quot;a sturdy and efficient race.&quot;<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
                    Schweitzer strongly backed the right of the state to restrict procreation and marriage, an opinion
                    she aired in person and in print. She implored Hoosiers to reproduce responsibly and with the ideals
                    of fitness in mind, maintaining that the &quot;gates of heredity&quot; irrevocably closed
                    after the baby left the womb. From that moment on the &quot;training and perfection of
                    Indiana&apos;s greatest resource-the baby&quot; rested in the hands of parents, who could
                    greatly enhance their children&apos;s health and constitution.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
                    Nevertheless, Schweitzer expected her constituents to be realistic about what they could accomplish
                    with their kith and kin. Responding to a letter from a <placeName>

                    </placeName> reformer who wanted to hold a &quot;Better Babies&quot; week in her town,
                    Schweitzer soberly advised &quot;it is certainly true we cannot make a silk purse out of a
                    sow&apos;s ear, neither can we make a citizen out of an idiot or any person who is not well
                        born.&quot;<hi rend="sup">73</hi></p>
                <p>Schweitzer&apos;s philosophy was well-suited to 1920s <placeName>

                    family depended on the same general principles.&quot;<hi rend="sup">75</hi> With its long
                    tradition of championship ribbons, the State Fair was the ideal venue for the contests.<hi
                        rend="sup">76</hi> More broadly, the underlying prejudices of the contests, which excluded
                    African American and immigrant infants and tacitly endorsed the cult of native-born white
                    superiority, resonated in a state where one-quarter to one-third of all Hoosiers belonged to the Ku
                    Klux Klan in the 1920s.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> An organization concerned to promote its version of
                    the whole-some 100% American family, the Ku Klux Klan launched morality crusades and anti-vice
                    campaigns and sometimes carried out violence against its perceived enemies, who included blacks,
                    Jews, Catholics, adulterers, bootleggers, and anyone else who threatened purity and chastity. In
                    part because of the centrality of the family to the Klan, women played an integral part in the
                    &quot;Invisible Empire,&quot; championing the virtues of motherhood and traditional notions
                    of masculinity and femininity.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Indeed, Elizabeth Tyler, who helped to
                    resurrect the Klan in the late 1910s, started her career in the social hygiene movement, by visiting
                    tenement homes in the South to teach mothers about &quot;better babies&quot; and scientific
                    child rearing.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> While there is no evidence that Schweitzer was a member of the
                    Klan, the attraction of the better babies contests to hundreds of thousands of ordinary Hoosiers,
                    especially women, cannot be understood outside the racial, social, and political context of the
                    decade.</p>
                <p>Putting the principles of scientific management to work, Schweitzer ran the crowded and popular
                    contests like an efficient assembly line. Before the event, infants were separated into groups based
                    on age (12-24 months or 24-36 months), sex, and place of residence. Those categorized as city babies
                    lived in places with 10,000 inhabitants or more, and those remaining were rural entrants. Once their

                    designated time. As the mothers entered the building they handed their enrollment form to an
                    attendant, who recorded their names. Then the baby was whisked to the next booth, where its overall
                    health history was taken by a nurse. Mental tests designed for each age group followed, as
                    psychologists observed if infants could stand, walk, speak, how they manipulated blocks and balls,
                    and responded to questions such as &quot;How does the doggie do?&quot; and &quot;Who is
                    the baby in the mirror?&quot;<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Mental tests completed, the babies were then
                    undressed and their clothes placed in a paper bag and tagged. Identically robed in shaker flannel
                    togas, each toddler was now weighed and measured. From here the baby was examined by an optometrist,
                    a pediatrician, and an otolaryngologist, then weighed and measured a second time, and lastly,

                    Scores were calculated along the way. Starting with 1000, points were subtracted for an array of
                    physical defects including unevenness of the head, scaly skin, ill deportment, delayed teething,
                    abnormal ear size or shape, or enlarged glands. Slow reactions to the mental tests or perceived lack
                    of muscular coordination lowered a child&apos;s score, as did deviations from the national
                    standards for height and weight (based on age) and weight-to-height ratio. Tabulated results from

                    anticipation, followed by a board hearing with the inmate and sometimes a relative present for the
                    official approbation. Shielding themselves against the weaknesses of the 1907 and related acts
                    overturned in state courts, the crafters of this legislation inserted sections that allowed for a
                    right to appeal the decision to the circuit court (and in the next instance, the Indiana Supreme
                    Court), clarified that this law could not be construed to permit castration or organ removal, and
                    immunized all authorities involved in legal and surgical proceedings from civil or criminal
                        liability.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Furthermore, although the law seemingly vested the
                    superintendent with the acting authority to pursue sterilization, it granted the institutional board
                    the power to order, in the face of dissent, the sterilization of any inmate found &quot;by the
                    laws of heredity&quot; to be a &quot;probably potential parent of socially inadequate
                        offspring.&quot;<hi rend="sup">94</hi> In practice, this translated into board hearings
                    where the institutional physician certified that the welfare of an inmate and &quot;of society
                    will be promoted by such sterilization.&quot;<hi rend="sup">95</hi></p>
                <p>In two subsequent amendments to the law, passed in 1931 and 1933, this authority was also conferred
                    to the domain of the county court, empowering the judge and two testifying physicians to mandate
                    sterilization at the inquests of the feebleminded and insane. Thus, the second &quot;<placeName>

                    School&apos;s psychiatrist at the time and regularly testified at board hearings, flexibility
                    characterized this dual system. Speaking before an audience of his colleagues in the American
                    Society for Mental Deficiency, Harshman admitted that &quot;perhaps this convenient arrangement
                    has the proportions of being a little too wholesale in the minds of most of you&quot; but
                    justified the policy as &quot;progressive&quot; because it enabled more defectives to be

                    up a high proportion of those sterilized. Indeed, the largest single age group (out of a 7-to-50 age

                    and 16 inmates) occurred. Indeed, operations did not markedly decline until the fiscal year
                    1957-1958, when there was a change in the administration of the state&apos;s mental health
                    department, which was given jurisdiction over most aspects of sterilization proceedings in a 1951
                        amendment.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> This pattern is in keeping with national trends, as operations
                    peaked in the late 1930s and 1940s but did not substantially subside, and in fact increased in
                    several states, in the 1950s and 1960s.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> Nevertheless, the rationale for
                    sterilizations changed from the 1930s to the 1960s, shifting from the need to impede the propagation
                    of the hereditarily defective to a greater concern with bad parenting and the dysfunction of poor or
                    welfare families.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> Whatever the reasoning, however, until the 1970s decade of
                    repeal, sterilizations across the country were performed based on eugenic statutes.</p>
                <p>While verbal consent was not technically required of inmates (since the board could overrule any
                    objections), a central component of the sterilization hearing involved an attempt to procure consent
                    or some recognition, even if minimal, that the inmate understood the procedure&apos;s
                    consequences. The Fort Wayne board minutes and a handful of county court inquests indicate that the
                    authorities believed it was imperative for the inmate to physically appear and speak before the
                    adjudicating body and for a written record, proving the proper execution of policies, to be
                    transcribed. To a great extent, the scripted interaction at the hearings amounted to an unnecessary
                    pretense. Yet given previous experience, it behooved <placeName>

                    jeopardize the institution&apos;s operations. Thus, in the few instances (8 out of 534) in which
                    inmates verbally denied consent, the board erred on the side of caution and placed these cases in
                    abeyance.</p>
                <p>The great majority (364 or 69.2 percent) of the 534 inmates verbally communicated affirmative

                    exercise riddled with problems. On one hand, some inmates were interned primarily for sexual
                    behavior considered inappropriate and only secondarily for a mental condition. In institutions
                    around the country, sterilization was regularly employed as a tool of sexual or reproductive
                    management, as young women categorized as licentious or men diagnosed as sodomites underwent
                    operations based on a mixture of therapeutic and eugenic rationales.<hi rend="sup">103</hi> For
                    example, in the early 1940s, the &quot;rather attractive&quot; but &quot;emotionally
                    unstable&quot; E. A. was committed multiple times to the Muscatatuck Colony because of her low
                    I.Q. (61), the fact she had &quot;invited men to come into her room,&quot; and because after
                    one escape she was found to be suffering from gonorrhea. The petition paperwork shows that E. A.,
                    who had 16 siblings including a sister with a child born out of wedlock, was sterilized, at age 19,
                    in August 1942 at the Indiana University Medical Center based on a Bartholomew County court
                        inquest.<hi rend="sup">104</hi> It is plausible that patients like E. A., many of whom conversed
                    lucidly in the board hearings, were plainly aware that sterilization was their sole release ticket
                    and simply assented to the operation. These individuals were probably among the small but
                    significant portion (44 or 8.1 percent) that gave conditional consent, expressing a clear
                    understanding of the parole policy, like the woman above who stated &quot;Yes, I&apos;ll
                    take anything to get home.&quot; On the other hand, for the most vulnerable inmates, including

                    a retarded adolescent to follow any suggested course of action, including sterilization. These facts
                    cast further doubt on the propriety of taking the consent of an adolescent retarded person at face

                    racial homogeneity set it apart, Hoosier eugenics moved in tandem with other states. Across the
                    country from 1900 to 1960, states passed eugenic laws, held better babies contests at county and
                    state fairs, sent researchers to crowded urban areas or remote rural hamlets to produce family
                    studies, and authorized the sterilization of the &quot;mentally defective&quot; in public
                    homes and hospitals. Like their counterparts in other regions, Hoosier eugenicists gravitated toward
                    biological theories and models to provide simple explanations of the complex and disruptive social
                    changes that accompanied modernization, urbanization, and industrialization. Especially during the
                    Progressive Era, Hoosier physicians, educators, and clergymen involved in public health or social
                    reform found an easy affinity with eugenics. Indeed, for many, embracing eugenics was part and
                    parcel of claiming professional authority during a period in which science and efficiency were the
                    watchwords of progress.</p>

                    path for white middle-class women. In the early twentieth century, many educated white women found
                    careers in the human sciences and social sciences that afforded them newfound freedom. It was
                    particularly acceptable for female professionals to dedicate themselves to fields concerned with the
                    well-being of children and the betterment of families. In <placeName>

                    Jatho and Hansford of the Committee on Mental Defectives, field workers or psychologists. These

                    Paradoxically, even as female eugenicists faced gender discrimination and a glass ceiling within
                    their profession, their own achievements usually entailed the denigration and dehumanization of a
                    long list of &quot;others,&quot; including racial minorities, immigrant mothers, poor

                    &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;unfit&quot; that female eugenicists constructed around

                <p>Although the most vitriolic aspects of American eugenics were waning by the 1930s and scientists and
                    social scientists were condemning scientific racism by the 1940s, hereditarian thinking did not
                    disappear after World War II.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> In some cases, earlier eugenic policies, like
                    sterilization laws, remained in place. At the same time, eugenic ideas were incorporated into the
                    emergent areas of family planning and population control and, to some degree, into human and
                    clinical genetics. <placeName>

                    </placeName> history is also instructive to understanding the postwar period. The fact that overt
                    racism was never central to Hoosier eugenics allowed it to transition comfortably into the
                    ubiquitous pronatalism of the &quot;baby boom&quot; years. After World War II, Rice conveyed
                    his message of proper mating and marriage in a series of sex-education pamphlets with titles such as
                    &quot;How Life Goes On and On&quot; and &quot;Those First Sex Questions&quot; that
                    included photographs of smiling white families composed of a breadwinning husband, an aproned

                <p>In March 1925, leaders of the Jewish Welfare Federation of Indianapolis (JWF) issued a report that
                    wrestled with what had for two decades been a confusing, ambiguous, and downright thorny problem:
                    articulating a prescription for Jewish life that successfully combined Jewish tradition with
                    American culture in a way that was not too closely wedded to either. &quot;We are different, and
                    we might as well recognize it, frankly,&quot; it tentatively stated. This acknowledgment of
                    community distinctiveness, however, masked a call for conformity. &quot;Though civilization is
                    becoming increasingly complex, and our differences exaggerated,&quot; it continued, &quot;we
                    must hold together. We must maintain our culture and demonstrate our best values for their
                    incorporation into American life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>

                    orthodoxy that the JWF feared made them so out of place, leaders also understood the perils of
                    unregulated Americanization. The transition to American society was too fragile a process to be
                    handed over to the vaudeville houses, nickelodeons, and other temptations that characterized the
                    American city; in order to balance what one <placeName>

                    aware Jewishness, communal and charitable institutions would have to take on the burden of
                    overseeing the transition of immigrants and their families. Beginning in 1920, the JWF did just
                    that, offering a series of carefully managed recreational and educational activities that emphasized
                    proper public behavior and self-reliance and attempted to ease the city&apos;s most recent

                    </placeName>. Fearing that the isolation they faced in the shtetls of Europe left them unable to
                    make &quot;correct&quot; choices about leisure, religion, and behavior, the Federation made
                    its South Side Communal Building the base for a tight- ly controlled program of activities designed
                    to engage participants in pursuits that would reflect positively on the Jewish community at large.
                    Athletic activities, scouting, dramatic performances, and elaborately staged dances were offered as
                    alternatives to what community leaders saw as the more rough-edged-even licentious-commercial
                    offerings in and around the immigrant neighborhood. By the 1930s, the energy that drove these
                    programs had faded with the breakup of the South Side enclave, and the Communal Building fell into
                    increasing disuse. This rise and fall-of the building and the spirit it represented-provides a
                    window into the struggles over ethnic identity and what it meant to be a successfully assimilated
                    American Jew in a relatively homogenous early twentieth-century Midwestern city.<hi rend="sup"

                    </placeName> Jews, and the men who founded the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation, the city&apos;s
                    first congregation in the mid-nineteenth century, reflected this orientation. Retailers and
                    wholesalers of clothing, tailors, and clothing store clerks were the most common occupations.
                    Indeed, as early as 1859, ten of the city&apos;s eighteen clothing stores were owned by Jews.
                    Peddlers (who were themselves often working toward owning their own shops), an optician, three
                    physicians, a clothes cleaner, and a jeweler were also represented, as well as at least one man with
                    no visible employment. Socially, they were easily absorbed into the diverse mix of Germans, Irish,
                    French, English, African Americans, and native-born whites who made up the city&apos;s
                    population. Indeed, many Jewish men took non-Jewish wives; this was not as scandalous as it would
                    have been in Europe, and after a brief controversy the women were accorded official membership in
                    the synagogue. In 1856, construction of the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation was aided by funds from
                    Christian groups. The institution&apos;s name reflected its founders&apos; fears that a
                    Hebrew-language designation would alienate its members from the larger community. By 1870, about a
                    decade before the first waves of Eastern European Jewish emigrants began arriving in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the city&apos;s Jewish population stood at around 500. Many of these individuals
                    had achieved great financial and social success: in 1882, approximately one-half of the Jews
                    employed in <placeName>

                    other half was engaged in similar fields like tailoring or peddling. By the end of the century, Jews
                    owned some of the most prosperous businesses in <placeName>

                    were involved in local government, civic organizations, and social concerns. During the first
                    decades of the twentieth century, members of this established group served on the Indianapolis
                    Common Council, the city&apos;s War Chest and Liberty Loan committee, and the Indiana General

                    Sephardic minority hailed from Yugoslavia. Settling primarily in an area lying between the 800 and
                    1200 blocks of South Meridian Street and extending westward to South Illinois Street, their numbers
                    were enough to increase the city&apos;s Jewish population from around 500 in 1870 to 5,500 in

                <p>The tension between established German Jews and their newly arrived counterparts is well-documented.
                    The poverty in which immigrant families found themselves may have been a consequence of
                    institutionalized antisemitism in the old country (sometimes exacerbated in <placeName>

                    businesses), but it nevertheless unnerved Jewish leaders, who feared that immigrants&apos;
                    living conditions, combined with their perpetuation of the Yiddish language, their Orthodox
                    eccentricities, and their cultural isolation, would inflame American prejudices. On a national
                    scale, according to Cincinnati Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, Eastern European Jews would &quot;sully
                    the good reputation of Judaism&quot; and &quot;without question lower our social
                        status.&quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>

                        and just as many problems. Early twentieth-century data did not specify religious affiliations,
                        and we must roughly estimate based on the number of residents with ties to European countries
                        from which the majority of Jews emigrated. In 1910, the census counted 2,159 residents who were

                        Austrians and 1,068 Hungarians. These figures also include other ethnicities along with Jews, of
                        course, and make no allowances for the third generation. By 1920, the introduction of the
                        &quot;mother tongue&quot; category cleared things up somewhat. In that year, the census
                        counted 2,282 residents whose language (or that of their parents), was Yiddish or Hebrew. 1,155
                        of those were foreign born. See U. S., Bureau of the Census, <hi rend="i">Thirteenth Census,

                    Jews of all backgrounds. In 1905, for example, Governor James Hanly, addressing a forum initiated by

                    should be no Jewish Americans. I have little patience with the man who comes to this country and
                    participates in its blessings ... and continues even in thought to remain a foreigner.&quot;
                    Twenty years later, Governor Ed Jackson (whose Klan affiliation was well-known) seconded this

                    </placeName>, there were barriers to social integra- tion. Clubs and other social institutions
                    remained segregated by religion, and while overt tensions were rare, social boundaries were
                    informally enforced. This enforcement encouraged Jewish leaders to fear that the public behavior of
                    immigrants would challenge the understanding that had been reached between Jews and the
                    city&apos;s Protestant majority. Social control over recent arrivals was thus a primary concern
                    of Jewish leaders. The Reform community found Orthodox immigrants too rigid and tradition-bound.
                    Those immigrants who shunned religion were equally bad, however, as they were feared to have brought
                    socialism, anarchism, trade unions, and other staples of the poor and dispossessed to a relatively
                    harmonious city. These fears were only magnified by the fact that the city&apos;s small size
                    made it a destination for &quot;removals&quot;-recent immigrants sent from eastern cities
                    into smaller communities by the Industrial Removal Office, a national Jewish charity that sought to

                <p>The economic and cultural strains that Jewish leaders saw as closely linked to new arrivals were met
                    primarily by the JWE Chartered in 1905, the Federation began as an effort to supplement the work of
                    the city which, like all townships in Indiana since the mid-nineteenth century, assumed that it
                    would care for only the most indigent, leaving the rest of the poor and needy to private agencies.
                    Like the city&apos;s Catholic Charities, which also catered to a &quot;minority&quot;
                    population, the JWF offered basic services such as monetary aid and a modest community center
                    (though its services and community center would soon far out- pace those of its Catholic
                    counterpart). Like most Jewish charities of the period, moreover, it was created and chaired by
                    prosperous German Jewish businessmen. Among its first leaders were Sol Kiser, a clothier-
                    turned-banker, and wholesaler G.A. Effroymson. Initially, the Federation dispensed charity in a
                    narrow fashion. Each week, the JWF would consider pleas for relief, which might involve money for
                    rent, food, or coal. Often, transients passing through the city would request money for lodging or
                    meals. The Federation would consider these cases individually and dispense what aid they deemed
                    appropriate. Endelman posits a discernible prejudice toward the kind of
                    &quot;self-help&quot; projects that would uplift immigrant aid seekers (such as loans for a
                    market stand or a horse and wagon for peddling), but such help was nevertheless given on a
                    case-by-case basis and did little for the immigrant community as a whole. What attention was paid to
                    moral development occurred on an individual basis. Runaways such as Victor Reisberg, who was
                    discovered in 1914 at a &quot;5 cent show,&quot; were merely sent home. Sarah Gemple was a
                    regular fixture in the Federation&apos;s minutes, complaining that her son Hyman had again left
                    home-each time, the Federation simply made an effort to find him. Little action was taken to reform
                    the boys and provide them with the kind of social life that would (in theory, at least) keep them
                    from disappearing into the city. In 1913, Rose Silverman traveled to <placeName>

                    again, but we might guess that their wedding did not lead to the ideal middle-class existence that
                    the Federation began to work for in the 1920s.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>
                <p>These incidents reflected the kind of well-meaning but ultimately misguided assistance that the
                    Federation advocated in the initial years of the twentieth century. Hoping to see new arrivals
                    adjust, assimilate, and lead the kind of respectable lives that they themselves enjoyed, established
                    German Jews nevertheless took a decidedly reactive approach to achieving this goal. Though monetary
                    assistance was essential, as was the return of children to their families (the value of forcing a
                    Silverman- Patnick wedding was perhaps more dubious), the Federation offered little to help
                    immigrants and their children, described as &quot;not accustomed to the intensity of
                    life&quot; in the American city, deal with modern American society and culture. A foster home
                    and reform school for wayward youth was disbanded in 1910, but the problems it was intended to
                    combat did not seem to disappear, even as many in the Federation thought the need had passed. Though
                    it held dances and other gatherings at its South Side Communal Building, the Federation had yet to
                    recognize explicitly the value of these amusements in helping immigrants and their second-generation
                    children adjust to the &quot;intensity&quot; of their surroundings. The Communal Building, a
                    relatively modest two-story frame structure of West Morris Street, was purchased in 1913 from a
                    German physical culture society and served as the structural center of Americanization for South
                    Side Jews, but JWF officers made only brief mention of it in their annual reports. In the initial
                    years of the century, Americanization seemed to be a matter of economics. Starting a business and
                    becoming successful was seen as an ultimate goal, and while leaders promoted initiative and
                    self-sufficiency, these habits of mind were intended to make <list type="footnotes">

                    development, proper social behavior, and middle-class cultural awareness were not seen as important
                    elements in the transition to American life.</p>
                <p>Several factors converged in the late 1910s to orient the JWF toward the use of leisure and other
                    activities as a means of Americanization. An effort to professionalize the organization led to the
                    hiring of full-time social workers, a greater division of labor within the Federation, and the
                    creation of independent committees to oversee more complex work in the community. Looking back on
                    the transition, former JWF president George W. Rabinoff claimed that the Federation had begun to
                    understand the link between charity and &quot;social attitudes&quot;-that reform of the
                    latter could lead to more efficient (and cost- effective) dispensation of the former. Indeed, such
                    reform might eventually make charity unnecessary. In pursuit of this goal, Rabinoff continued, the
                    Federation began to work toward raising &quot;the general morale&quot; of new arrivals and
                    their children. In the first days of 1920, the Executive Committee announced that &quot;we
                    recommend the inauguration of preventative work...designed to anticipate any possible
                    delinquency&quot; among neighborhood Jews. Recognizing the need for amusement that lay at the
                    root of much of this delinquency, the committee concluded that &quot;recreational facilities
                    should be provided.&quot; These statements underscored the break in the Federation&apos;s
                    policies. Before 1920, leaders had believed that a firm economic footing was the best route to
                    Americanization. By the early 1920s, however, they argued that the organization needed to take an
                    active role in the social and cultural lives of new arrivals in order to ensure that immigrants met
                    American culture on terms acceptable to Jewish leaders and their Protestant neighbors.<hi rend="sup"

                    German Jews with those of East- and South-European immigrants proved difficult, and leaders lost
                    much of their initial fervor for the building. The poorer immigrants who frequented it drove away
                    more established Jews, who felt that &quot;there has always been a stigma attached to the
                    building because of its physical asso- <list type="footnotes">

                    building, patrons realized, was not a space for the Jewish community at large, but one in which
                    members of the middle and upper classes offered services that they themselves shunned. This stigma
                    grew as Jews of all backgrounds became more prosperous and left the South Side in increasing numbers
                    to take up residence north of downtown. For East Europeans and their children, this movement began
                    in earnest in the 1920s, and by 1932, Jewish residents of the more prosperous North Side
                    neighborhoods outnumbered those of the South Side by more than two to one. Though separated by only
                    a few miles, the two neighborhoods could hardly have been more different. On the South Side, amidst
                    what Endelman describes as &quot;grime, dirt, foul air, and overcrowding,&quot; the Jewish
                    delis, kosher butchers, bakeries, and Hebrew school that served the working-class residents stood in
                    a closely packed environment (one resident remembers a friend covering the length of the 1100 block
                    of South Illinois by bounding across the buildings&apos; roofs). In contrast, the North Side
                    neighborhood, centered on 23rd and Meridian Streets and extending a few blocks in all directions,
                    was, in Endelman&apos;s words, characterized by &quot;bucolic calm, stately houses, and
                    treelined avenues.&quot; Though the movement north and the increasing middle-class orientation
                    of many East European Jews were important factors in easing the rift between newer immigrants and
                    their longer-established German counterparts, they nevertheless heightened the division between the
                    Federation and those who remained in the South Side. The turn to charity and Communal Building
                    programs further solidified the different identities of the two communities, especially as leaders
                    continued through the 1920s to create a physical hub for North Side life, finally dedicating their
                    own community center, the Kirshbaum Center, in 1926. With the new thrust of Federation work, the
                    Communal Building and its programs were left to the &quot;downtown&quot; Jews, and its
                    meeting rooms, small gymnasium, and location in the heart of the South Side Jewish enclave lent it a
                    new importance. Building further upon its more professional approach, the Federation created an
                    educational committee to oversee Americanization, recreation, and the Communal Building itself.
                    Unlike those leaders who had quickly grown disheartened by the &quot;factionalism&quot;
                    surrounding the Communal Building, the Educational Committee ran it relatively efficiently. Through
                    English-language instruction, citizenship classes, and &quot;proper entertainments,&quot;
                    the newly formed committee took &quot;charge of all efforts to improve the intellectual and
                    moral standing of the Jewish poor.&quot; With existing facilities in place and newly formed
                    committees to handle the new work, the Federation embraced the role of leisure <pb n="48"

                    them located close to the immigrant community. The Broadway Burlesque made its home on South
                    Illinois Street, in the heart of the Jewish enclave. Traveling a few blocks north toward the Circle,
                    a young Jewish man could reach the Henry Cooler Billiard Parlor in less than a mile, and the Granada
                    Theater was only slightly further to the east, on the 1000 block of Virginia Avenue. In the early
                    1920s, the Palace Theater, at 35 North Pennsylvania Street, was advertising such acts as the Follis

                <p>Any steps that East European immigrants took to curb their chil- dren&apos;s behavior came
                    cloaked in an Orthodoxy that was, in Endelman&apos;s words, &quot;unresponsive to the
                    American milieu.&quot; In a syndicated column appearing in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Jewish
                        Chronicle</hi>, Chaim Bialik wrote that &quot;the tragic rift between Jewish children and
                    parents is, no doubt, directly traceable to the different cultural worlds in which they
                    live.&quot; Records indicate that Yiddish often remained the primary language of immigrants, and
                    that they held tenaciously to a stricter brand of Jewish observance. Their children, however, wanted
                    none of this shtetl-type isolation. As the generational rift (which, of course, was unique to
                    neither the Jewish community nor the early twentieth century) grew, young people distanced
                    themselves further from the community and its guidance. As concerned as they were with
                    Americanization, Federation leaders-like the anonymous letter writer in the <hi rend="i"
                    >Chronicle</hi>-wanted to see this process occur not only in a middle-class context, but in a Jewish
                    one as well. Writing in 1919, the president of the Reform Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation decried
                    the &quot;evil&quot; loss of Jewish sensibilities among his congregation. &quot;The
                    members of a congregation in our modern complicated life,&quot; he claimed, &quot;are
                    inclined to be disinterested&quot; in Jewish customs and culture. While the typical view of the
                    well-off Reform Jews who headed up charity and reform groups was that they were no different from
                    gentiles, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaders nevertheless added a healthy dose of Jewish awareness to the standard
                    Americanization rhetoric.<hi rend="sup">10</hi></p>
                <p>Adrift in the city, JWF leaders feared, immigrants and their children would either lose their Jewish
                    identity or cling to it to the point of provincialism. What guidance these people might receive in
                    their neighborhoods often came from non-religious immigrants, who leaders feared had few qualms
                    about rejecting their Jewish identity. Of these secular immigrants, the &quot;removals&quot;
                    from New York City were the most dangerous in the eyes of the Federation, which suspected them of
                    &quot;affecting the <placeName>

                    community, long antagonistic to German leaders, presented the most insidious combination of these
                    problems. Centered in the area around Church Street, the community consisted of about sixty- <list

                    </placeName> gentiles even as they renounced their Jewish heritage. Sephardic youth, absent any
                    guidance, were indeed becoming Americans, but not in the mold that the Federation desired. While
                    Sephardic Jews and their Ashkenazic (East European) neighbors were often at odds, the Federation did
                    not distinguish between them in lamenting their choices. Both groups represented immigrants out of
                    step with refined American culture and potentially embarrassing to their more elite counterparts.
                    Faced with young people eager to negotiate American culture, and immigrant parents who were
                    unwilling or unable to help them make the &quot;correct&quot; choices (or, indeed, making
                    incorrect choices themselves), the Federation and its Educational Committee sought to offer leisure
                    activities that coincided with their vision of Americanization.<hi rend="sup">11</hi></p>
                <p>To this end, the Federation sharply restricted the content of amusements that it offered. Clearly
                    setting the boundaries of Americanization and ensuring that the process would occur on their terms,
                    the Board of Governors in 1920 voted to allow only those &quot;entertainments given by such
                    bodies as we feel should be allowed to give them and no affairs be allowed...that are not of
                    a...beneficial nature.&quot; To meet these requirements, those giving programs with JWF money
                    were forced to &quot;assume certain responsibilities&quot; and to guarantee that the
                    amusements were &quot;wholesome and novel.&quot; These provisions ensured that participants
                    would be exposed to entertainments, such as athletic carnivals and dances, that fit a middle-class
                    ideal of refinement and &quot;wholesomeness.&quot;<hi rend="sup">12</hi></p>

                <p>The Communal Building proved invaluable to the realization of these objectives. As the official site
                    ofJWF activities until 1926, it provided the Federation with a tightly policed area where directly
                    sponsored groups (and even independent groups seeking a Jewish audience) could be forced to hold
                    their functions. The fact that the Federation developed a plan to deal with all outside requests for
                    the building&apos;s use attests to their desire to control events.</p>
                <p>The Federation&apos;s rather jealous control of physical space both paralleled and made possible
                    its desire to control Jewish social and cultural life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The charges of inbreeding, isolation, and miseducation leveled at the Sephardic
                    community, for example, can perhaps be traced to the fact that Sephardic Jews preferred to remain
                    apart from JWF work. Many of them were, in fact, successful merchants and work- ers who founded and
                    operated their own synagogue and communal institutions, including a social club which initially met
                    at the Communal Building but then moved to a rented space on the 800 block of South Meridian Street.
                    The problems with Sephardic youth were no greater than those faced by the mainline Jewish and
                    gentile communities, but by choosing to create their own separate institutions, Indianapolis
                    Sephardim angered members of the JWF who desired to bring the entire Jewish community under their
                    guidance. The Federation made repeated attempts throughout the 1910s and 1920s to co-opt Sephardic
                    communal life, and in 1927, helped to purchase a two- story building at 1002 South Capitol Avenue.
                    On the other hand, the socialist Workman&apos;s Circle, a group that seemed in no great hurry to
                    learn English and, worse, espoused the kind of radical ideas that caused many sleepless nights among
                    American Jewish leaders, was welcomed by the Federation. This acceptance was most likely due in no
                    small part to the fact that the Circle conducted its meetings in the Communal Building, under the
                    watchful eyes of Federation leaders who could ensure that the group&apos;s ideas did not make it
                    out of the embryonic stage. That a relatively successful group could be derided as backward and
                    isolated, and a revolutionary group could be tolerated, even embraced, attests to the importance of
                    control to the Federation.<hi rend="sup">13</hi></p>

                <p>A key element of the Federation&apos;s program, athletic activity was featured prominently at the
                    Communal Building. According to historian Howard Chudacoff, the &quot;health craze&quot;
                    which drove Federation leaders to offer gym classes and sports to their immigrant patrons was, in
                    the eyes of reformers, &quot;vital to the perpetuation of a virile nation; unlike the street
                    corner or the pub, it was as morally purifying as it was physically imposing.&quot; Steven Reiss
                    concurs, pointing out that athletics were &quot;expected to provide a healthy
                    alternative&quot; to &quot;dissipating pastimes,&quot; and &quot;raise moral
                    standards and build character.&quot; The Federation thus saw athletics as important to the
                    propagation of middle-class Americans. Gym classes and basketball teams such as the Communal Celts
                    Juniors (which no doubt owed its name to the popularity of the original Celtics, a dominant
                    professional team of the 1910s and 20s), the Federation&apos;s 1925 report claimed,
                    &quot;supply valuable lessons in good sportsmanship.&quot; That the same document equates
                    good sportsmanship with cleanliness, &quot;self-reliance . . . wholesome manhood and good
                    citizenship&quot; underscores the value of these programs to leaders trying to instill
                    middle-class habits in immigrants and their children.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                <p>The Federation&apos;s emphasis on &quot;wholesome manhood&quot; suggests the importance
                    of gender in its conception of proper American behavior. Though gender boundaries were challenged in
                    the postwar culture at large, JWF leaders remained fundamentally conservative on this issue. Their
                    Big Brother and Big Sister programs segregated children by sex, with big brothers emphasizing
                    sobriety and restraint and attempting to make decent men out of young Jews who had run into trouble
                    with the law. Sewing classes were offered to girls and women, and in the mid-1920s girls at the
                    Communal Building were taught folk dances by a student at a local normal school. The Caroline M.
                    Kahn Memorial Log Cabin, constructed adjacent to the Community Building in 1922, housed Boy Scout
                    Troop 50, as well as other Federation-sponsored scouting organizations for boys and girls. Although
                    it often appeared reluctant to embrace groups outside of its control, the Federation <list

                    fostering middle-class Americanism, and declared that Troop 50 was an &quot;integral
                    part&quot; of its South Side work. Leaders seemed unconcerned by the Scouts&apos; Christian
                    orientation, perhaps reassured by the group&apos;s lack of religious posturing. The
                    JWF&apos;s attitude gibes well with author Jay Mechling&apos;s insight that the early Boy
                    Scouts were not identified with the &quot;aggressive&quot; fundamentalism that tends to
                    characterize them today. By giving the group space to hold meetings, moreover, JWF leaders made
                    certain that the Federation would remain active in scouting programs and cur- riculum and ensure
                    that they did not upset the desired balance between class, national, and ethnic identities.<hi

                <p>The Educational Committee also ran a game room and playground at the Communal Building. While not as
                    intimately connected to the rhetoric of sportsmanship and middle-class behavior as athletics, these
                    programs nonetheless served an important role in the Federation&apos;s eyes. Leaders criticized
                    the Sephardic community for its failure to provide supervised alternatives to the city&apos;s
                    leisure offerings. Athletics provided such an alternative for adults and older members of the second
                    generation, but the popular game room and playground served as more natural inducements to younger
                    neighborhood children. Careful to ensure proper behavior patterns as well as fun, the Federation
                    added a study room adjacent to the game room &quot;to stimulate children to get their lessons
                    first.&quot; It could be argued that an austere middle-class sensibility ran through the efforts
                    to get children to postpone pleasure by completing &quot;lessons first.&quot; The JWF,
                    however, believed that children could be steered toward both self-improvement and social betterment.
                    Through inducements to finish school assignments and work given to them by Americanization classes,
                    and by the constant supervision of Educational Committee workers whose job it was to ensure that
                    proper social development was never far removed from games and play, the Federation hoped that they
                    would entice neighborhood children to stay away from the sorts of amusements that had drawn Hyman
                    Gemple and Victor Reisberg.<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>

                <p>Athletics, games, and Scouting proved to be valuable substitutions for more rough-edged amusements.
                    However, these programs did not directly challenge the most popular and widely engaged working-class
                    amusements. Adult immigrants in particular were still in danger of consuming leisure that was
                    morally degrading and demeaning to their character. Storefront nickelodeons provided the kind of
                    entertainment that could not be duplicated in a game room, and vaudeville and other lower-class
                    theater productions were also popular. Perhaps most alarming to middle-class reformers was the
                    nationwide &quot;dance craze&quot; that drove young immigrants and working people into
                    commercial halls. In order to prevent Americanization from occurring on the crowded, overheated
                    dance floors, the Federation had to provide a cleaned-up version of such entertainment.</p>
                <p>Of the available forms of entertainment, movies presented the least pressing problem to Federation
                    leaders. Although their meeting minutes document plans for movie exhibitions and requests for a
                    projector, any mention of film screenings is absent from the minutes, the annual reports, and the
                    activities page of the Indiana Jewish Chronicle. The Educational Committee&apos;s small budget
                    (it spent $261.80 in 1919, for example) undoubtedly played a role, especially when English and
                    naturalization classes jockeyed for funds with the game room, playground, and other amusements.
                    Dances, as we shall see, were often lavish affairs, and though they were partially funded by the
                    clubs that gave them, the Educational Committee sponsored affairs of its own and assisted with
                    others. Dances and dramatic productions, then, undoubtedly occupied a large share of the
                    committee&apos;s entertainment budget. The Federation&apos;s willingness to fund these
                    amusements above others suggests that dance halls and cheap theaters were especially popular among
                    South Side Jews, and, perhaps, that the Federation saw them as particularly threatening to its
                    Americanization efforts.<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>
                <p>This opinion was shared by Stephen Wise, a noted Reform rabbi whose columns were syndicated in the
                    Indiana Jewish Chronicle. In 1922, pondering the question &quot;What is
                    Americanization?,&quot; Wise asserted that <list type="footnotes">

                    seem to acknowledge that the &quot;sewers and cesspools&quot; of working-class minstrel
                    shows and vaudeville were Americanizing in their own right. The Wild West players and variety acts

                    drawn. These shows frequently offended middle-class audiences with their unrefined language and
                    celebrations of licentious working-class pleasures. Though vaudeville theaters had by this time
                    evolved from the rough spaces of the nineteenth century, where drunken shouting, fights, and
                    projectiles were as much a part of an evening out as the shows themselves, entrepreneurs like Keith
                    and Sylvester Poli still found ways to appeal to working-class Americans. Indeed, the fact that
                    Keith&apos;s theater was compelled to remind potential customers that &quot;You May Take the
                    Ladies and Children&quot; says as much about the reputation of the vaudeville theater in general
                    as it does about the refinement of that particular chain. The language and more overt sexuality had
                    been cleaned up, but the form itself was able to adapt, and remained a target of reformers in the
                    twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>

                    officials had worked actively to sever. In many ways, however, the shows put on by these groups
                    (whether in a theater of their own, as was the case in larger cities, or in rented spaces)
                    paralleled those of American vaudeville. Ilana Bialik argues that the melodramatic, sensationalized
                    stories &quot;demanded no intellectual effort,&quot; and emphasized audience participation.
                    To Reform Jewish leaders, Yiddish theater was &quot;a cheap, vulgar, manneristic, and plagiarist
                    tradition, lacking educational and artistic values.&quot; To immigrants, however, they offered
                    &quot;a sense of security, belonging, and comfort&quot; often absent in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName>. To men and women who felt their culture under assault by Americanization groups, these
                    players offered a way to periodically reconnect with their past experiences. Perhaps not
                    surprisingly, then, the Federation did not allow Yiddish players in the Communal Building. Although
                    they left the door open for what they considered to be more respectable Yiddish productions, their
                    action suggests that, while they worked to ensure that Jewish awareness remained active in immigrant
                    families, old-country eccentricities had no more place in their vision of the American Jew than did
                    vulgar, unrefined vaudeville productions.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>
                <p>Education Committee leaders refused to allow vaudeville entertainments or Yiddish theater in the
                    controlled space of the Communal Building. They seemed to fear that the cultural power of these
                    shows was enough to undo the effects of the committee&apos;s formal Americanization work.
                    Leaders did recognize that their attitudes &quot;frequently have been misinterpreted or
                    resented&quot; and that the popularity of their programs fluctuated. The Communal Building was
                    intended to draw all classes together &quot;without patronage of one class over
                    another.&quot; Successful Reform Jews and other agents of Americanization enjoyed the most
                    patronage, however, and actions such as barring Yiddish theater contributed to the ill-feelings of
                    poorer immigrants. Though their voices have not been as fully preserved as those of the
                    Federation&apos;s leaders, we can gain a sense of the feelings of working-class and immigrant
                    Jews through official records, which stress both the popularity (or lack thereof) of certain
                    programs and the &quot;factionalism&quot; that was exacerbated by leaders&apos; efforts.

                <p>The Federation thus walked something of a tightrope in its effort to introduce South Side Jews to
                    more refined theatrical amusements. While leaders took care not to offend the pride of their
                    immigrant clientele, they obviously remained dedicated to eradicating less respectable leisure
                    pursuits. Substituting comedy for the melodrama and farce of commercial theaters, the Educational
                    Committee produced plays that had little in common with the Yiddish melodramas of Joseph Lateiner or
                    the farces of the American vaudeville stage. In 1924, for example, the Communal Building hosted a
                    production of &quot;The Trysting Place,&quot; a clever one-act farce by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> native (and Pulitzer Prize-winner) Booth Tarkington. At the same time, however, leaders
                    seemed to recog- nize that such mainstream culture needed to be tempered with other types of
                    entertainment. Minstrel shows, which remained very popular, were put on by JWF organizations such as
                    the Pals Club in the Communal Building, where they could be sanitized and regulated.<hi rend="sup"
                        >21</hi></p>
                <p>As subversive as vaudeville shows seemed to reformers such as JWF leaders, their corruptive powers
                    paled in comparison to those of the city&apos;s commercial dance halls, where youngsters could
                    elude parental control and engage in decidedly non-middle class behavior. Because such spaces
                    generally welcomed people from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds, they created an atmosphere in
                    which young people could negotiate Americanization amongst themselves, without regard for par-
                    ticular ethnic traditions or guidelines. Federation leaders expressed a marked fear of these
                    establishments, and, not coincidentally, dances at the Communal Building were frequent and
                        well-advertised.<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>
                <p>Much to the satisfaction of the Federation, these dances proved to be some of the most popular
                    leisure activities offered. In an address to the Educational Committee in 1920, the Executive
                    Committee praised the success of Communal Building dances, while at the same time shedding light on
                    the leisure-time preferences of neighborhood residents: <list type="footnotes">

                    licentiousness at local dance halls, the Educational Committee found itself in the awkward position

                    contribute to (or, at least, not detract from) its larger mission of uplifting the moral standards
                    of Jewish workers and introducing them to proper standards of American life. &quot;We recognize
                    the necessity for allowing Sunday night dances,&quot; the Committee somewhat resignedly declared

                        forms of entertainment. We prefer to offer our facilities where we know the dances will be
                        conducted under the proper auspices.</quote> In order to ensure &quot;the proper
                    auspices,&quot; the Indianapolis chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women (perhaps driven
                    by their concern for wayward girls) supervised dances in the Communal Building. As the program for
                    the Federation&apos;s 1926 &quot;Chummy Dance&quot; suggests, there was little time for
                    activities that were not structured by the organizers, and the highlight of the evening was a
                    foxtrot competition.<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                <p>The specter of well-to-do matrons hovering at the edges of the dance floor undoubtedly made the
                    performance of risque steps difficult, if not impossible. The Federation nevertheless sought to meet
                    the commercial halls on their own turf by emphasizing the fun of their dances and their connection
                    to youth culture. Young people&apos;s clubs such as the &quot;Pals&quot; often put on
                    dances, and the Federation clumsily proclaimed, &quot;when the Pals Club gives a dance . . . you
                    know that&apos;s &apos;red hot.&apos;&quot; The point of Federation dances, of
                    course, was that they were not &quot;red hot,&quot; but in order to entice South Siders into
                    the Communal Building, sponsors needed to create a feeling of frivolity and disregard for the rules
                    of proper decorum, even as they sought to reinforce these rules. The fact <list type="footnotes">

                    Federation did not have to compete directly with dance halls. While the fear was that young people
                    were drawn to &quot;more dangerous forms of entertainment,&quot; it appears that the unique
                    charms of the commercial dance hall had less influence than the simple desire to socialize with
                    peers, whatever the setting. Nevertheless, proclaiming dances to be &quot;red hot&quot;

                    Building with frills not found in other spaces. Dances were extravagantly accessorized-the 1925
                    &quot;Barn Dance&quot; saw the hall decorated with straw and other adornments
                    &quot;beautifully illuminated with bright colored lights suspended from the ceiling&quot;
                    and with &quot;lighting effects for the different dances.&quot; In addition to undertaking
                    these tasks, the Federation advertised them prominently in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Jewish

                    the character and direction of Jewish ethnicity. While the primary goal was to integrate immigrants
                    and their offspring into American society, leaders did not call for a complete aban- donment of
                    Jewishness. They did, however, seek to encourage an ethnic and religious identity in line with their
                    own sensibilities. This identity would, they hoped, be but one aspect of American Jews&apos;
                    character and affiliation. Indeed, a sense of ethnic affiliation would ideally bolster
                    one&apos;s identity as a responsible American-in an interview with the <hi rend="i">Indiana

                <p>The Federation decried the lack of Jewish education among children in the city, claiming that in
                    1922, only some 600 Jewish children (out of a total of 2500) were receiving any kind of Jewish
                    education. These figures led to a redoubling of efforts to effectively administer a Talmud Torah
                    school and other centers. While their hostility to Orthodoxy and old-country religious practices was
                    clear, JWF leaders nevertheless felt the necessity of some modicum of religio-cultural instruction
                    in the community.<hi rend="sup">28</hi></p>
                <p>That the Federation oversaw the Talmud Torah is another indication that the administration of Jewish
                    culture and religion was to proceed on the terms of affluent leaders. The <placeName>

                    education classes that benefited &quot;200 children in whose hearts we are planting the love of
                    Judaism.&quot; The thought of the NCJW, a group of affluent Reform Jews, educating children in
                    Judaism would have alarmed Orthodox immigrants. Reform women did not espouse the kind of religion
                    and culture that newer arrivals were used to; as a contemporary observer remarked, &quot;the
                    various viewpoints regarding Jewish Education are so extreme that each group refused to give
                    consideration to the other groups and insists on its procedure as the only proper and authentic
                        one.&quot;<hi rend="sup">29</hi></p>
                <p>By the 1930s, however, the convergence of several factors convinced the Federation to de-emphasize
                    its various Americanization programs. The first half of the 1930s saw a reorientation of the
                    group&apos;s work toward the needs of the growing North Side community. By 1934, the
                    reorientation was complete and the effort to Americanize through leisure was symbolically finished.
                    The Depression had greatly sapped both the organization&apos;s treasury and the resolve of its

                    to exclaim, &quot;never in his recollection, have the Jews faced such a serious
                    crisis.&quot; JWF efforts and funding turned toward the resettlement of German Jews, and other
                    programs found themselves unable to compete for rapidly diminishing resources. Remarking upon the
                    fate of such Americanization programs as leisure activities, Federation president G. A. Efroymson
                    observed, &quot;there is a feeling that as little as possible should be spent for this
                    work.&quot; Though he considered this decision &quot;erroneous,&quot;
                    Effroymson&apos;s words, published in the JWF&apos;s 1934 annual report, heralded the
                    decline of cultural work among immigrants and the second generation. Though the Depression was five
                    years along and the northward movement of South Side residents had been proceeding in an organic
                    fashion, the 1934 comments marked the strongest and clearest articulation of the diminishing
                    enthusiasm for the Communal Building programs. Indeed, the report carries a tone of resignation, as
                    though Effroymson had conceded the end of the Federation&apos;s efforts in this area.<hi

                <p>With no appreciable amount of Jewish immigration to sustain the old neighborhood, the need for
                    services in the South Side enclave was rapidly diminishing. By 1940, only 14 percent of Jewish
                    families in <placeName>

                    inability to sell their homes during the Depression. The area now housed people from a variety of
                    ethnic backgrounds, and the Communal Building served mostly African American patrons. As Rabinoff
                    predicted in 1925, the newer immigrants and their children, whenever possible, moved to the more
                    prosperous North Side. Recreational programs continued to be offered at the Kirshbaum Center, but

                    gests that little residential discrimination against Jews existed in the city. Americanization
                    efforts such as English classes undoubtedly aided many in the transition to their new home, but the
                    value of attempting to engineer middle-class habits can be questioned. The high attendance at
                    Federation dances, for example, probably tells us more about Jewish youths&apos; desire for a
                    good time than it does about their receptiveness to the Federation&apos;s underlying cultural
                    message. Even as they were promoting athletic and social events, JWF leaders privately admitted that
                    the immigrant neighborhood at which their efforts were aimed was steadily breaking up as its
                    residents joined the middle class. Obviously, the virtues of hard work and self-reliance that
                    underscored JWF activities were being practiced by South Side residents, and the process of economic
                    advancement was doing more to foster a middle-class American identity than were Barn Dances and
                    comic plays. JWF leaders may have assumed that the prevalence of the Klan in Indiana and the overall

                    Communal Building seem to have been as much about control over the image and direction of the
                    expanding community as they were about benefiting immigrants.<hi rend="sup">32</hi></p>
                <p>By steering Eastern European and Sephardic Jewish immigrants away from the city&apos;s seedier
                    commercial amusements and into the Communal Building, the JWF attempted to assert control over the
                    entire Jewish community and to ensure that, in mind and habits at least, &quot;American
                    Jews&quot; would be thoroughly middle-class, respectable citizens. In 1925, the Federation
                    insisted that &quot;we must maintain <hi rend="i">our</hi> culture&quot; (my emphasis),
                    begging the question of whose culture was to be maintained. Rabinoff&apos;s complaint, three
                    years later, that immigrants and their children demonstrated a &quot;lack of
                    conformity&quot; suggests clearly that it was the culture of Eastern European and Sephardic Jews
                    that was to be reformed. Leaders believed the cultural isolation that characterized these groups was
                    detrimental in several ways. The religious practices and everyday behavior of the immigrants were
                    tainted by Orthodoxy, and their inability to understand American culture gave their children the
                    opportunity to experience the city without the guidance of responsible adults. Either case could

                    over immigrants and their children in order to facilitate their rapid, unobtrusive integration into
                    American life. Leisure and religion played important roles in the lives of the newer immigrants, and
                    they were logical areas of attention for the Federation. Fearing that entrance into a lower stratum
                    of American society would reflect as poorly on the larger community as would the retention of old
                    country habits, the JWF maintained spaces in which newcomers would be introduced to American culture

                    stood in position to do something about it in 1947. Yet, once in office, the Republicans and
                    Southern Democrats, supposedly so dead set against the New Deal, made very few proposals and offered
                    hardly any legislation to alter New Deal reforms in any significant way. Aside from changing labor
                    laws, they made no effort to overturn the legislative achievements of the 1930s that lasted longer

                    pump&quot; and restore prosperity as intended. Those laws that regulated the banking system and
                    supervised the stock exchanges (passed in 1934) were welcomed by the public and met with mixed

                    its subsequent bipartisan support- in favor of an account of a Republican-led assault upon the New

                    reformism is frequently painted as a war by business interests against labor unions, which had made

                    according to this version, opposed and reversed by conservatives like Halleck, who used popular

                    version of 1940s politics derived from Halleck&apos;s papers reveals a dramatically different
                    picture.</p>

                    </placeName>, to implement the new federal programs put into place by the president and Congress. By
                    the time Republicans retook control of Congress in 1947, most of Roosevelt&apos;s appointees had
                    long ago moved on to other tasks, frequently as much to FDR&apos;s and Truman&apos;s great
                    relief as to that of their political opponents. With Harold Ickes, Tommy Corcoran, Rexford Tugwell,
                    and other convenient targets of the Republicans out of public employ, the Republicans&apos;
                    battle against New Deal excesses had for its focus only &quot;the reds&quot; who supposedly
                    still populated the ranks of the federal bureaucracy.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                <p>To be sure, Congressman Halleck objected not only to irritating officials and costly bureaucracy, but
                    also to New Deal programs that violated his conception of economic orthodoxy. Yet despite his
                    reservations, he went along with and ultimately accepted most of them. He opposed programs intended
                    to inflate prices and deflate the value of the currency, and he criticized (though did little about)
                    programs that interfered with the free-market system. He challenged federal efforts, such as
                    TVA&apos;s electricity program, that dictated prices or put the government into direct
                    competition with private business. He also consistently protested the size and cost of the
                    bureaucracy necessary to implement federal programs. Halleck and other Republicans had fixed ideas
                    about fiscal policies and appropriate functions for the federal government, but those ideas had been
                    tempered by the blows of the Depression, and by 1947 they accommodated a large and expensive federal
                    government. These legislators did not love expensive government, but they accepted it. The
                    Republicans of 1947 oversaw federal programs that touched the daily lives of citizens because, by
                    and large, they had agreed to such programs as they were first implemented. The political career of
                    Charles Halleck serves to demonstrate Republican accommodation to federal involve- <list

                    Congressional Republicans and the president made the same compromise: a balanced budget had to be
                    sacrificed temporarily to achieve more urgent ends. Despite running large budget deficits, the
                    administration and congressional Democrats still extolled the convention of the balanced budget, and
                    for years promised one in the near future. Halleck&apos;s orthodox economic thinking, which he
                    had absorbed as an economics student at Indiana University, guided him to oppose most taxes and all
                    spending bills intended to put money into circulation rather than to procure some specified public
                    good. The &quot;fast talking&quot; freshman congressman&apos;s relatively narrow view of
                    the &quot;public good&quot; excluded, for example, $350,000 in federal expenditures for the

                    proposal, the Frazier-Lemke Bill of 1936, called on the Treasury to refinance eight billion dollars
                    worth of farm mortgages, unabashedly inflating the currency and thus raising the prices of farm
                    products. Halleck and five Democratic Indiana congressmen opposed the bill, even though they

                <p>Perplexing debates about the dangers of monetary inflation and deflation sharply divided the American
                    public. The inability of politicians, publicists, and economists to agree on the best fiscal and
                    monetary courses to follow undoubtedly inflamed passions and probably prolonged the Depression. Nine
                    years into the crisis, the Republican National Committee (RNC) still echoed the classic economic
                    belief that inflation was the worst calamity that could happen to an economy and was to be avoided
                    at all costs.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The RNC called for a balanced budget, lower taxes (especially
                    corporate taxes), and a reformed Social Securities Act that would not drain so much money ($47
                    billion over 40 years, by Republican estimates) out of the economy. Halleck endorsed the Republican
                    program and joined the chorus demanding lower taxes, less government spending, and &quot;an end
                    to federal waste, corruption, and extravagance.&quot;</p>
                <p>The one aspect of the RNC document on which Halleck remained silent was its proposed restoration of
                    the gold standard as it had existed prior to 1933. The restoration was a proposal of Alf Landon, the
                    Republican candidate for the presidency in 1936, and it continued to be mooted afterward among
                    segments of Republicans, although it stood no serious chance of enactment, even after the party
                    regained Congress.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> When the currency failed to collapse in 1933, as many
                    skeptics had forecasted that it would, orthodox thinking about the currency toppled instead. Once
                    the received wisdom of conventional economic thinking was shown to be flawed, unorthodox economic
                    policies could be seriously discussed and even implemented. A revolution in thinking was a necessary
                    precondition to passing legislation such as the Social Security Act, which previously would have
                    been rejected as too expensive, and it accounts as well for the Republicans&apos; ultimate
                    capitulation on the gold standard.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>

                <p>Still, eastern and midwestern Republicans like Halleck were loathe to abandon the discipline of the
                    market as the best prescription for what ailed America. From a distance in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName>, Halleck had watched the formation of the first New Deal, as Congress passed numerous
                    important pieces of legislation precisely intended to interpose the federal government massively
                    into the market, doing its best to upset the market system. House Republicans had split their votes
                    almost evenly (55-53) on the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933, which suspended market
                    competition to keep up wages and prices.</p>
                <p>Soon after arriving in the House, Halleck began attacking the NIRA and the AAA. In April 1935 he
                    lamented that ten to thirteen million Americans remained unemployed, despite administration promises
                    that NIRA would create five million new jobs. Halleck charged that only competitive private
                    enterprise could lead the country to recovery, adding, in what would become a familiar refrain, that
                    &quot;social experimentation&quot; had hindered government efforts to produce a recovery.
                    While President Roosevelt and most of his advisors heaved a quiet sigh of relief when the Supreme
                    Court declared the NIRA unconstitutional, Halleck publicly celebrated with Robert McCormick,
                    publisher of the Chicago Tribune, and former <placeName>

                <p>Like most of his farmer constituents, Halleck criticized the AAA, which sought to raise farm prices
                    by having the Agriculture Department pay farmers to curtail production.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> In
                    1936 the Supreme Court found the act&apos;s mandated system of payment unconstitutional, yet the
                    program survived when amended by Congress. Halleck and many other Republicans then voted for the
                    amended AAA, whether they fully agreed with it or not. &quot;While I may not be entirely sold on
                    the value of the triple-A program,&quot; Halleck wrote his father, &quot;it does seem to
                    have convinced a great many of the farmers that it may be temporarily a good thing for
                        them.&quot;<hi rend="sup">21</hi></p>
                <p>The AAA proved to be a program that even supporters found hard to champion. The act had suffered

                    reduced immediately by slaughtering millions of baby pigs and plowing under cotton, corn, and wheat
                    already standing in the fields. These catastrophic measures induced revulsion not only in skeptics,
                    but in many people who agreed with the policy in principle. The obvious waste provided an
                    inexhaustible supply of ammunition for the program&apos;s opponents. At a 1936 Halleck campaign

                <p>Not surprisingly, Republicans were more likely to support those government programs that delivered
                    security without interfering in the free market. In August 1935 Halleck and a majority of
                    Republicans voted for the Social Security Act, which promised federal relief to the unemployed and
                    orphaned, and pensions for the disabled and elderly. Like other Republicans, Halleck was bothered by
                    the act&apos;s provisions for funding the old-age pensions through a one-percent payroll surtax
                    starting in 1936 (increasing gradually to three percent), with disbursements not starting until
                    1942. Halleck and others called instead for a pay-as-you-go system that would fund the pensions from
                    general taxes, avoiding the six-year drain on the economy.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Despite their

                    because it delivered tangible benefits to constituents in an apparently evenhanded way. Like their
                    Democratic counterparts, they were becoming used to massively expensive programs that before the
                    Depression would have been rejected as too expensive for &quot;sound government.&quot; The
                    Social Security Act proved exemplary of New Deal legislation that helped average Americans, and
                    received wide and deep popular and political support. The program remained untouched when
                    Republicans gained the majority after the Second World War.</p>
                <p>While Republicans in general, and Halleck in particular, went along with the growing trend toward
                    federal regulation of banking, securities markets, and farm prices, and the provision of pensions
                    for the infirm, orphaned, and elderly, they balked at the explosive growth in the number of
                    employees hired to implement these services. Halleck denounced the &quot;bloated public
                    payroll&quot; during his first session in Congress, and throughout his political career he
                    constantly fretted about the cost and inefficiency of the vast federal work force. His frustrations
                    grew into an obsession during the Second World War, when the size of the work force ballooned. As a
                    member of the House Civil Service Commission, Congressman Halleck-along with most other
                    Republicans-took particular umbrage at the number of political appointments to New Deal positions.
                    Such patronage opportunities, he objected, gave Democrats an unfair political advantage at
                    taxpayers&apos; expense. He also railed against <placeName>

                    Hatch Act of 1939 had been passed-with Halleck&apos;s support-to curb the worst abuses at the

                <p>Political fissures within the nation and between Roosevelt, on one hand, and Republicans and
                    conservative Democrats, on the other, grew wider as New Deal recovery programs failed to reignite
                    the economy in 1934 and 1935. With one eye toward populist demagogue Huey Long and the growing radio
                    audience of Father Charles Coughlin, Roosevelt charged that businessmen had failed to make the
                    National Recovery Administration work as it should. Thus, Roosevelt proposed legislation less
                    friendly to business. Some legislation, such as the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which
                    proposed to eliminate utility holding companies, was forcefully hostile. Other laws, such as the
                    Wagner Act which threw the federal government&apos;s weight behind union organizing drives, were
                    at best indifferent to business interests.<hi rend="sup">25</hi></p>
                <p>The popularity of Long&apos;s &quot;share-the-wealth&quot; campaign prodded Roosevelt to
                    propose a series of progressive changes in the tax codes. While most Republicans voted in favor of
                    the Revenue Act of 1934, which raised income, inheritance, and corporate tax rates in order to help
                    pay for the expensive programs already in place, they forcefully denounced the 1935 Revenue Act as a
                    &quot;soak-the-rich&quot; tax bill. They argued that the bill was aimed even more pointedly
                    at corporations and the wealthy. These proposals, which did little either to raise revenue or to
                    reduce the federal deficit, outraged Halleck and conservatives of both parties. Halleck warned
                    Hoosiers that Roosevelt was embracing socialism and Long&apos;s irresponsible demagoguery.

                    make it more palatable to conservative Democrats. Halleck, unpersuaded, voted against the tax bill.
                    When Republicans once again ran the House, they rewrote the tax code to lower the rates most steeply
                    stacked against the wealthy, but left in place hefty death duties and heavy taxes upon those in the
                    highest brackets. After all, the federal debt still had to be paid off.<hi rend="sup">26</hi></p>

                <p>As Roosevelt tilted against business, he leaned toward organized labor. One influential group of
                    advisors had strenuously promoted the argument that the Depression was the result of maldistribution
                    of income and the resultant &quot;underconsumption.&quot; Stuart Chase, John Maynard Keynes,
                    and others argued that if American workers had insufficient income to buy the goods they produced,
                    the obvious solution was to raise their income. If business would not raise wages voluntarily, then
                    unions should convince them to do so. Section 7a of the NIRA had mandated that businesses must
                    follow minimum wage and maximum hour codes established by industry, and that all employees who
                    wished to must be allowed to join independent unions. When the NIRA was declared unconstitutional by
                    the Supreme Court in 1935, Roosevelt sought to preserve labor&apos;s gains as a means to boost
                    consumption and employment. Thus, the president endorsed the Wagner-Connery Act, which directed that
                    businesses allow workers to unionize if they chose to. The Wagner Act created the National Labor
                    Relations Board, a body to oversee union-certification elections and to receive and address
                    workers&apos; complaints about unfair labor practices. It also outlawed company unions and
                    coercive measures by management to keep unions out of their businesses. The bill was designed not
                    only to counter unfair practices by corporations, but to foster union membership as a means of
                    increasing wages and boosting consumption.<hi rend="sup">27</hi></p>
                <p>Despite their unabashedly pro-business stance, Republicans generally supported the Wagner bill and
                    voted for it (17-8) in the Senate. Most Republicans maintained good relations with American
                    Federation of Labor (AFL) President William Green, and favored the newly acquired rights and powers
                    of workers and labor unions. When the Wagner Act came up for a vote in the House, Halleck, while
                    proclaiming his belief in the right of working men and women to unionize, voted against it because
                    he considered it unconstitutional.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> When the Supreme Court pronounced the
                    constitutionality of the act in 1937, Halleck joined the pro-union chorus. During the 1938
                    congressional election campaign, Republican Program Chairman Harry Hogan wrote to all Republican
                    candidates, &quot;I think any Republican congressman who <list type="footnotes">

                    to unionize is not just overlooking ordinary justice in human affairs, and if he is not concerned
                    about justice involved, at least he ought to recognize the political trends and drift of public

                    Halleck joined in wooing labor votes in 1938 by repeatedly proclaiming the importance of labor
                    unions and the need for the government to protect their rights. In a speech pitched to workers,
                    Halleck called AFL President Green &quot;a worthy successor to Samuel Gompers,&quot; and his
                    campaign gave out literature proclaiming Republican friendliness toward labor and unions, and
                    support for laws mandating minimum wages and banning child labor.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In 1940

                    should be amended to remove unjust and irritating provisions.&quot;<hi rend="sup">31</hi> That
                    proposal remained a Republican priority in 1947, when Congress took up amending the Wagner Act as
                    its first item of business.</p>
                <p>If Republicans jumped on the pro-AFL bandwagon, they were less enthusiastic about the Committee for
                    Industrial Organization (CIO), formed by John L. Lewis in 1935 (which in 1938 became the Congress of
                    Industrial Organizations). The CIO forcefully pushed the unionization of unskilled labor in heavy
                    industries not used to bargaining with low-paid factory laborers, and used strikes as its primary
                    tool to motivate both workers and management. The size and violence of CIO-organized strikes shocked
                    many Americans and deeply troubled most Republicans. The Akron strikes of February and March 1936
                    provided a taste of what was to come. Thousands of workers walked out of the city&apos;s rubber
                    plants, touching off violence between strikers on one side and replace- ment workers, company
                    security personnel, and police on the other. Sit-down strikes against General Motors between

                    such as the United Auto Workers added to the levels of violence in 1937. Halleck lamented that the
                    strikes discouraged investment in business and that &quot;government sanctioned&quot;
                    factory take-overs prolonged the slump. Addressing a labor gathering in <placeName>

                    of the voter support that FDR and the Democrats had gained since 1930. Republicans nearly doubled
                    their seats in the House (to 164) in that year&apos;s elections, and in the Senate they gained
                    by nearly fifty percent (to 23 seats.) The shift in <placeName>

                    Democrats and northern Republicans to push his Eurocentric foreign policy in the face of stubborn
                    resistance by his populist former supporters from the West and Midwest, many of whom were
                    isolationists.</p>
                <p>Halleck endorsed the GOP platform of 1938, which called for revised funding for Social Security,
                    lower federal spending, revision of the Wagner Act to address complaints of business, and repeal or
                    revision of taxes introduced by Roosevelt in 1935. Most New Deal reforms were not even debated,
                    because Halleck and the GOP fully supported them. Halleck voted for Social Security, bank-deposit
                    insurance (FDIC), and federal guarantees of railroad retirement funds. He favored legislation that
                    evened the playing field between labor and corporations, but opposed tilting the field in favor of
                    labor. Otherwise, he wanted the market, not federal bureaucrats, to shape the economy. Thus, Halleck
                    and the GOP opposed acts designed to keep the NRA, the AAA, and the TVA alive. But mostly the GOP
                    assailed what Chairman Hamilton called &quot;utopian visions from so-called experts and

                    Halleck-supported the war effort, but bridled at its cost and at the attendant expansion of federal
                    authority and employment. In an article published in December 1941, Halleck asserted that
                    war-related production already claimed twenty-three percent of factory capacity in the U.S., and
                    that that figure would climb to fifty-one percent in 1942.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> With federal

                    gave the government priority in purchasing materials. The thrown-together bureaucracy that

                <p>While the war raged, Halleck could do little to satisfy the objections of petitioners other than haul
                    bureaucrats before his committee for extended tongue lashings. Like many who appealed to his
                    committee, he built up a reservoir of resentment against those whom he saw as arrogant and
                    irresponsible bureaucrats. This frustration would play out after the war in the form of merciless
                    harassment of federal employees in a hunt for communist scapegoats.</p>
                <p>The government had assumed a thankless, and probably impossible, task when it undertook to establish
                    price ceilings bureaucratically-perhaps one reason that the Office of Price Administration (OPA) had
                    three chiefs in less than two years. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith, asked by OPA head Leon
                    Henderson to take charge of the price-setting office in mid-year, did not think this herculean job
                    beyond his capabilities. Galbraith outlasted Henderson, but did not survive past May 1943, when he
                    was forced out, to the delight of Charles Halleck.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Abrasive and sarcastic,
                    Galbraith typified the New Dealer so detested by Halleck and the Republicans. As

                    near-parity in the House, and handing the GOP control of a majority of state legislatures. The

                    lost eighteen House seats in 1944, while adding only one Senate seat. Plenty of Americans remained
                    angry about government management of the wartime economy, but many more were pleased to have good
                    paychecks made fatter by overtime work. Many voters likewise approved of the wartime expansion of
                    unions and of the protection and benefits they extended to workers. Thanks to the peculiarities of
                    state residency laws, the displacement of several million potential voters in the military and

                <p>Halleck, hoping to overcome the odds, had campaigned for &quot;a rededication of our national
                    government to the fundamental principles of true-blue Americanism,&quot; promising &quot;to
                    smash tired and decadent New Dealism&quot; and to install &quot;down-to-earth
                    Americanism&quot; in its place. Halleck assumed that large numbers of workers forced into
                    CIO-dominated unions resented communist influence within the unions and anti-Republican tirades in
                    CIO literature. He received a small number of letters voicing such complaints, but if he concluded
                    from them a general worker alienation from the CIO and, hence, the Democrats, he was wrong. While
                    Halleck retained his seat, the Democrats carried <placeName>

                <p>President Roosevelt&apos;s health was already failing during the 1944 campaign, and he ventured
                    little into public afterwards. He died on April 12, 1945, and Vice President Harry Truman took the
                    reins of power. When the war ended four months later, any sense of wartime partisan solidarity ended
                    with it. Halleck and others unleashed a barrage of caustic criticism against the way the federal
                    government had handled and continued to manage the nation&apos;s economy. In a speech in St.
                    Louis, Halleck demanded that &quot;business must be freed from the incessant and demoralizing
                    meddling of socialist bureaucrats.&quot; In <placeName>

                    served to only accelerate a trend which already existed in the New Deal administration before the

                <p>In 1946, reacting to waves of postwar strikes and a sharp spike in inflation after the abolition of
                    many price controls, aided by widespread Democratic abstention from the polls, American voters
                    elected the first Republican-controlled Congress since 1930. Halleck&apos;s position as chairman
                    of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee had served him well in a year when he handed out
                    party funds for reelections, and many congressmen owed him a debt of gratitude. Party money,
                    conviviality, and a well-deserved reputation for hard work and tenacity earned him election as House
                    Majority Leader, giving him enormous power in shaping the legislative agenda. With 246 seats, the
                    Republicans had a clear advantage over the 188 Democrats, and could count on the support of numerous
                    southern Democrats to favor proposals to restore some states&apos; rights. But rather than gut
                    the New Deal, the Republican Congress initiated a limited program of reform designed to redress
                    their principal objections of the last fifteen years. Announcing their intentions for the upcoming
                    Eightieth Congress they promised to lower taxes, cut expenses, curb presidential power, promote
                    housing construction, end shortages in consumer goods, return powers to the states, and reform labor
                        laws.<hi rend="sup">50</hi></p>
                <p>In his maiden speech as Majority Leader, Halleck called for less government interference in business
                    decisions, more government intervention in labor disputes, and no communists in the government. In
                    speech after speech Halleck railed against budget deficits, high taxes, foreign
                    &quot;give-aways,&quot; and communists in the bureaucracy. He rarely attacked specific
                    government programs, instead targeting &quot;New Deal bureaucrats&quot; and vowing to uproot
                    &quot;reds and fellow travelers&quot; from government payrolls. &quot;We got the
                    government out of the red,&quot; Halleck pro- claimed, &quot;and now we&apos;re getting
                    the reds out of the government.&quot;<hi rend="sup">51</hi></p>

                <p>A wave of monstrous postwar strikes led by the CIO against most of America&apos;s biggest
                    corporations (including General Motors, U. S. Steel, and General Electric) only encouraged the
                    Republican Congress to take on the Wagner Act. On the first day of the new session in 1947, Halleck
                    and Fred Hartley (R.-NJ) submitted a bill to the House Education and Labor Committee to amend the
                    Wagner Act. The bill, as ultimately enacted, is still known as the Taft-Hartley Act (Robert Taft
                    shepherded a version through the Senate) and although amended several times, it remains, along with
                    the Wagner Act, the foundation of federal law governing unions and strikes. Its main provisions
                    called for federal supervision of union-certification votes, a separate judicial board to hear
                    appeals of NLRB decisions, bans of secondary boycotts and closed shops, the right for the president
                    to call for a sixty-day &quot;cooling-off period&quot; between the breakdown of negotiations
                    and strikes, and certification that union officers are not communists. Even President Truman had
                    called for reform of the Wagner Act as part of an effort to cut the number of strikes, which he
                    feared would derail the postwar recovery. When the bill passed by a clearly veto-proof 320 votes in
                    the House (to 79 &quot;nays&quot;) and a 54-to-17 vote in the Senate, Truman declared
                    himself unhappy with its &quot;anti-labor&quot; final product, and vetoed the bill. Truman
                    was able to have his cake and eat it too: he could claim to stand with union labor by vetoing a bill
                    he wanted to pass, with full assurance that his veto would be overwhelmed. Truman eventually invoked
                    the act 147 times to avoid strikes.<hi rend="sup">52</hi></p>
                <p>The Eightieth Congress did manage to lower taxes in the face of presidential vetoes (some of which
                    were overridden), to cut federal expenses (a little), to end most price controls, to submit a
                    twenty-second amendment to the constitution limiting presidents to two terms (ratified in 1951), and
                    to put former president Herbert Hoover in charge of a commission to suggest ways to increase
                    efficiency in the federal bureaucracy. It even passed balanced budgets for fiscal 1947 and 1948
                    (each year left a slight surplus). The Congress also instituted numerous committee investigations
                    designed to purge the federal government of alleged communists. None of these acts in any way eroded
                    the power of <list type="footnotes">

                    expansion. New Deal-era reforms left intact by the Supreme Court remained untouched, while further
                    reforms-such as Roosevelt&apos;s proposed &quot;Economic Bill of Rights,&quot; an
                    extension of the TVA program to other major river basins, or Truman&apos;s proposals for
                    universal health care-had never progressed far in the past under Democrats and stood no chance of
                    real consideration under Republican congressional control.<hi rend="sup">53</hi></p>
                <p>Yet key New Deal reforms remained safe from Republican gutting because most Americans, including most
                    Republicans, supported them. During the Roosevelt presidency Halleck had criticized actual New Deal
                    legislation only infrequently, preferring instead to disparage the anonymous bureaucracy that it had
                    spawned, and he continued to do so once the Republicans won control of Congress. After his
                    party&apos;s 1946 victory, he told an Ohio audience that the American people had
                    &quot;effectively proclaimed to the New Dealers, and all others of their ilk, that they have had
                    enough of waste and extravagance, enough coddling of communists and political favoritism, enough of
                    strikes and class warfare, and enough of bungling and confusion, debts and taxes.&quot; He
                    announced that the Republicans proposed to cut federal employees from a wartime high of 3.6 million
                    to 2.3 million, and then they would cut more: &quot;Communists, fellow travelers and all who
                    prefer the communistic system, or any other form of absolutism, must be-and will be-removed from the
                    positions they obtained through the New Deal.&quot; To accomplish their goal of purging
                    communists, Halleck and House Republicans, joined by most Demcrats, gave unflinching support to the
                    House Committee on Un-American Activities which soon turned its attention from the federal
                    bureaucracy to Hollywood. Congress also enacted a variety of laws intended to identify and oust
                    communists from the federal bureaucracy.<hi rend="sup">54</hi></p>
                <p>Congress enjoyed the overall cooperation and support of the Truman administration. In November 1946,
                    Truman signed Executive Order 9806, creating the President&apos;s Temporary Commission on
                    Employee Loyalty; his Executive Order 9835, signed in 1947, created a permanent Loyalty Review Board
                    within the Civil Service Commission. Ultimately, 212 federal employees were dismissed for running

                <p>Ironically, Halleck&apos;s crusade against communists and fellow travelers was the culmination of
                    earlier battles between Congressional Republicans and New Deal advisors, the vast majority of whom
                    had left their federal posts. Rexford Tugwell, soundly hated by most congressional conservatives,
                    had left the government at the end of 1936. Although he returned to serve as governor of Puerto Rico
                    during the war, he remained far removed from the <placeName>

                    surrounding the Utility Holding Companies Act and the court-packing plan, had both returned to
                    private law practice by 1942. Once president, Truman was not inclined to staff his White House and
                    federal departments with the same kind of colorful characters favored by Roosevelt. Harry Hopkins
                    resigned soon after Truman took the helm, and Harold Ickes quit as Secretary of Interior in February
                    1946. John Kenneth Galbraith, who had proudly raised Congressional hackles during his <placeName>

                    Wallace was forced out as Secretary of Commerce in fall 1946 after a bitter disagreement with Truman

                <p>Even though many of the conflicts between congressmen and Roosevelt&apos;s staff had thus
                    resolved themselves before the Republicans took control of the Eightieth Congress, the New
                    Deal&apos;s legacy remained strong, providing postwar Republicans with a continued source of
                    irritation. As he sought to summarize the accomplishments of the Eightieth Congress, Halleck

                    billion. They had overridden a presidential veto to cut taxes by $4.8 billion, and trimmed $7
                    billion from Truman&apos;s &quot;padded budgets.&quot; By 1947 the funding mechanism for
                    Social Security was moot, so Republicans left it alone and increased payments by five dollars per

                    credit controls, which limited installment buying. Far from dismantling federal programs for rural
                    electrification, flood control, road building, and the like, Halleck boasted in the 1948 election

                    Martin&apos;s move left Halleck without any official position until 1953 when, with the
                    Republicans once more in charge, he again became Majority Leader-but this time for only two years.
                    Democrats retook the House in 1955, and held it until 1995, eight years after Halleck&apos;s
                    death. Until Halleck voluntarily left Congress in 1968, he continued to rail against big, expensive
                    government and high taxes, while approving public works like airports, flood control projects, and

                    unmolested by the Eightieth Congress. Nevertheless, after the war Republicans like Halleck refused
                    to entertain Keynesian-inspired policies to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and lavish
                    government spending. Halleck wanted to cut both taxes and government spending, which Keynesians
                    warned would invite a new depression. Neither group achieved all of their goals, but a new
                    depression never came. By the time Republicans once again captured both houses of Congress, in 1994,
                    confidence in Keynesian ideas had waned among Democrats and nearly evaporated among Republicans.<hi

                    Even after a Depression and a World War, however, Halleck continued to believe that the government
                    did some things, like setting prices and allocating goods, very badly; once a particular emergency
                    had passed, he encouraged the government to abandon such functions as quickly as possible. But many
                    other programs that had been adopted by the government during the 1930s, such as Social Security,
                    the FDIC, federal mortgage insurance, and the SEC, were praised and embraced by Halleck and other
                    Republicans, who probably would not have accepted them without the massive shock of the Depression.
                    As for sprawling government bureaucracies that ate up huge appropriations, Congressman Halleck could

                    quickly they had become socialized to the immersive experience!</p>
                <p>Even before the museum opened to the public, some critics had already disparaged it, media displays

                    technological elements are clearly demarcated from the historical. The glitziest productions appear
                    outside of the exhibition galleries in the theaters, and those technological features that do appear
                    within the galleries remain physically separated from other exhibit items. For example, a wonderful
                    digital map which traces Civil War troop movements and battles at a pace of one week per second to
                    illustrate &quot;The Civil War in Four Minutes&quot; sits high on the wall, clearly
                    separated from the soldiers&apos; uniforms below. Similarly, visitors leave the flow of <hi

                    Tim Russert reports the issues of the campaign of 1860 by presenting brief, clever, and visually
                    engaging cam- paign ads to illustrate those complex issues much more effectively than written text.
                    For our part, the only time we felt as if we were at Disneyland was while in line for the
                    &quot;Ghosts of the Library&quot; show, where, after standing for several minutes in dim
                    light with dozens of strangers, we were startled by the blare of televisions advertising the

                    that earliest of &quot;immersive&quot; technologies, the late nineteenth-century cyclorama.

                    or under whose arms one must strain to catch a glimpse of the departing president-elect.</p>
                <p>From first step to last, the exhibition galleries present an engulfing combination of multi-sensory
                    stimuli. Bright colors carry the eye from one display to the next. Cheerful lighting illuminates the
                    goods for sale in Lincoln&apos;s New Salem store, while variations of dimness enshroud Willie on
                    his deathbed and Abraham in his casket. Music, laughing, snoring, rain drops, and shouting voices
                    fill one&apos;s ears, while a blast of heat greets visitors in the White House kitchen and a
                    cold chill slithers through the open window into which a mourning mother Mary stares. Visitors may
                    finger the cold steel of slave shackles as well as the deepening lines of age and stress in copies
                    of castings of Lincoln&apos;s face made in 1861 and 1865. In the &quot;Hall of
                    Whispers&quot; visitors find mocking political cartoons in warped picture frames, accented by
                    slanted light and whispering voices of criticism. The experience brings to mind Lincoln&apos;s
                    reply when asked why he read aloud: &quot;When I read aloud two senses catch the idea: first, I
                    see what I read; second, I hear it, and therefore I can remember it better.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                <p>The multi-sensory exhibits also evoke great pathos. Eavesdropping on Abe and Mary in
                    Willie&apos;s bedroom one cannot help but empathize with the first couple over the impending
                    loss of their second child. Gazing at Lincoln&apos;s casket lying in state in the cavernous,
                    ninety-five- percent-scale recreation of the House Chamber of the Old State Capitol in Springfield,
                    we were so swept away by the torch-lit atmosphere and somber strains of &quot;The Battle Hymn of
                    the Republic&quot; that my wife responded to our four-year-old&apos;s excited description of

                    gallery, and the first loud crack heard (and felt) in the Union Theater production depicts
                    Abe&apos;s early horse-kick. Beginning in his own lifetime with campaign literature suggesting
                    that any boy could become president, Lincoln&apos;s boyhood has served as a foil for his
                    presidential greatness. Yet in this museum one finds neither the &quot;putrid pool&quot; of
                    William Herndon&apos;s early biography, nor the chest-pounding pride of some early
                    twentieth-century Hoosiers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> If the ALPLM makes any interpretation of

                    death is merely mentioned, and Abe tells no jokes because there are no neighbors to listen. The
                    scholarship of the past thirty years, which has turned to Lincoln&apos;s boyhood in search of
                    the roots of his &quot;inner world&quot; psyche, his &quot;romantic cultural
                    politics,&quot; and his public and private virtues, remains unengaged.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>
                <p>As a historian, I note that some observers have identified anachronisms, from the modernizing of the

                    on the history-museum world in general. Six months after opening, the ALPLM welcomed its 400,000th
                    visitor, and the 1,000,000th passed through the doors in January 2007. Our visit in October 2006
                    allowed us to attend the 10,000th showing of the &quot;Ghosts of the Library&quot;
                    production. Springfield businesses have reported a rise in revenues and local planners are working
                    to turn the museum&apos;s success to the service of a thorough downtown revitalization. Contrary

                <p>Finally, as a father, I left the museum extremely pleased. Our four-year-old liked
                    &quot;everything,&quot; and the oldest asked if we could live there and sleep in the log
                    house. One month later, I mentioned to them my work on this review; their eyes immediately lit up as
                    detailed memories poured out to engulf us once more in the museum&apos;s world. I mentioned the
                    slave auction diorama and the oldest described the family&apos;s pain, the purchaser&apos;s
                    face, the steel shackles on the wall, the photograph of a whipped slave&apos;s lacerated back.
                    As I listened to her recollections I thought about Abe, reading aloud and &quot;remembering
                    better.&quot;</p>

                <p>Historians exploring organized labor&apos;s decline during recent decades have increasingly
                    turned their attention to politics. Few, however, have observed the axiom that &quot;all
                    politics is local&quot;; most have focused more on national politics and organizations. Samuel
                    W. White&apos;s <hi rend="i">Fragile Alliances</hi> reflects the growing interest in labor and
                    politics at a local level. White explores the &quot;fragile alliances&quot; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014154" reg="Evansville">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> unions made with politicians in the years between the end of World War I and the 1955
                    merger of the AFL and CIO, as well as the equally fragile alliances that lay at the heart of both
                    organized labor and the Democratic Party. He provides useful insights into the successes and
                    failures unions experienced in their engagement with electoral politics, and important suggestions
                    about the reasons that labor failed, even at the height of its strength, to fundamentally reshape
                    the nation&apos;s politics.</p>
                <p>The bulk of <hi rend="i">Fragile Alliances</hi> is devoted to a chronological survey of
                    labor&apos;s engagement with local politics. While the full details are too complex to summarize
                    here, the general course of labor&apos;s political fortunes is fairly straightforward-and
                    frequently at odds with the trajectory plotted by those studying labor politics at the national
                    level.</p>
                <p>Labor entered the postwar period strong and politically engaged. After the war, changing public
                    opinion, the disastrous 1919 coal strike, political mistakes, Americanism&apos;s appeal to many
                    working people (in such guises as forced Americanization, the American Plan, and the Ku Klux Klan),
                    and the lure of consumerism combined to bring dramatic changes. By the end of the 1920s, labor was
                    politically weak and divided.</p>
                <p>The 1930s saw an upsurge in organizing and the return of labor <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-103-1-108"/>
                    issues to politics. But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014154" reg="Evansville">Evansville&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName> story bears limited resemblance to the bright tales of victory that so often appear in
                    the histories of this period. While local unions enjoyed substantial organizing success, they might
                    have achieved much more but for a combination of determined employer resistance and bitter
                    infighting between the AFL and CIO. Labor factionalism, combined with political fracture lines
                    dividing the groups that elsewhere solidly supported the New Deal, prevented the Democratic Party
                    from building a strong, durable coalition. Even at the height of the New Deal, the local party was a
                    fragile alliance, as was organized labor.</p>
                <p>This state of affairs continued during and after World War II. Jurisdictional battles pitted unions
                    against one another, as did the issue of communism. Employer resistance continued unabated. And the
                    Democratic Party experienced significant defections, including the shift of many workers to the
                    Republican Party. By 1955, local unions had wasted any opportunities presented by the post-war
                    period with years of squabbling, purges of many dedicated union activists, the destruction of an
                    effective and influential left-led United Electrical Workers local, and sporadic raiding of one
                    another&apos;s membership. White argues convincingly that labor&apos;s political
                    &quot;space&quot; was substantially narrower than it had been in 1919. The divisive effects
                    of Americanism, anticommunism, race, consumerism, and employer opposition, combined with the
                    fragility of the labor-Democratic coalition, had eliminated alter- native labor visions from local
                    politics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Fragile Alliances</hi> has much to recommend it. While the attention to detailed
                    election results at times seems excessive, it yields a rare, close-up look at working class voting
                    patterns. White&apos;s discussions of AFL unions in the 1930s and the Klan&apos;s appeal to
                    workers focus attention on questions too frequently ignored. Welcome, too, is the attention to
                    employers, whose unusually successful opposition to the New Deal labor regime had a major effect on
                    the city&apos;s unions.</p>
                <p>Most significantly, White&apos;s history of labor and politics in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014154" reg="Evansville">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> reminds us that the generalizations historians make about this topic simply may not
                    have held true in many places. If all politics is indeed local, we need to understand much more
                    about how workers and unions engaged in politics at this level if we are to adequately explain
                    labor&apos;s bleak political fortunes.</p>

                    </placeName>; here, she returns to uncover possible family connections to this event, to find out
                    what &quot;really&quot; happened, and to understand how this horrific event continues to
                    haunt the city. <hi rend="i">Our Town</hi> emerges out of a growing interest in engaging these
                    murderous events in the nation&apos;s past through a kind of symbolic archaeology, digging out
                    such toxic stories so that communities can &quot;come to terms&quot; with them, settle
                    accounts, make amends, and exorcise a variety of demons. In addition to a burgeoning body of
                    scholarly and popular literature and a range of highly publicized museum exhibitions, many of the
                    communities scarred by these events struggle with diverse forms of memorial expression: cleaning
                    gravesites, requesting pardons for those unjustly convicted by kangaroo courts, creating interracial
                    rituals of reconciliation, and building physical memorials.</p>
                <p>Carr&apos;s story is part family history-her grandfather belonged to the Klu Klux Klan, and she
                    thinks she sees him in the infamous Lawrence Beitler photograph of the lynching-part investigative
                    reporting as she tries to reconstruct what actually happened, and part psychoanalysis of the
                    lynching&apos;s poisonous legacy. Carr writes of <placeName>

                    </placeName> that &quot;it became the town that never repudiated, investigated, or fully
                    acknowledged the events of August 7, 1930. So the lynching never took its place in history, never
                    receded into the past. It remained alive in the <placeName>

                <p>Despite some compelling stories, however, the book never becomes a coherent whole. Carr&apos;s
                    grandfather&apos;s Klan membership is certainly not enough to link him to the lynching. Nor does
                    Carr engage satisfactorily, in my view, with historian James H. Madison&apos;s observation that

                <p>Carr understands her family story as a &quot;model for the larger American family with its
                    repressed history of racial traumas: not just slavery but something as recent and as shared as Jim
                    Crow&quot; (p. 27). Fair enough. But can a city, like an individual, be &quot;trau-
                    matized&quot;? Can a city have a &quot;psyche&quot;? Carr uses too easily the popular
                    term &quot;collective memory.&quot; I much prefer James E. Young&apos;s sense of
                    &quot;collected&quot; memories of a society (or a city) as the &quot;aggregate
                    collection of its members&apos; many, often competing memories&quot; (<hi rend="i">The
                        Texture of Memory: Holocaust Memorials and Meaning</hi>, p. xi). Carr&apos;s search reveals
                    plural and clashing memories of this searing event. The lynching registered differently for many
                    whites than it did for many blacks-a &quot;justifiable punishment versus a day that would live
                    in infamy&quot; (p. 103). This grim reality subverts the widespread and overly simplified idea
                    that the work of memory is by definition &quot;healing.&quot; Remembrance can tear a
                    community apart as well as help it come together.</p>

                <p>Charles Peters, founder of the liberal magazine <hi rend="i">The Washington Monthly</hi>, thinks
                    something magical happened to American politics in 1940. The Republican party&apos;s nomination
                    of native Hoosier Wendell Willkie for president, he argues, allowed the American people &quot;to
                    rise a notch or two above the usual limits of human nature&quot; (p. 5). Without
                    Willkie&apos;s support for Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s destroyers-for-bases deal and his tacit
                    approval of the peacetime draft, Peters believes that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> would have been, at best, even less prepared than it was for the Second World War. At
                    worst, the victory of an isolationist Republican would have led to a <pb n="105"
                        id="VAA4025-103-1-111"/>nightmare, perhaps resembling the homegrown fascism described in Philip
                    Roth&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Plot Against <placeName>
                            <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                        </placeName></hi> (2004). Unfortunately, Peters&apos;s book is an unsatisfying synthesis of
                    potted history and reform tract, and it paints a misleading portrait of Willkie.</p>
                <p>The book seeks to portray the 1940 campaign as a turning point, primarily because no interventionists
                    succeeded in challenging Roosevelt and secondarily because Willkie refrained from excessively
                    exploiting isolationism. That &quot;triumph over partisanship&quot; (p. 4) inspires Peters,
                    who believes that by understanding how Willkie and Roosevelt found common ground on serious issues,
                    Americans today can become more generous politically. In keeping with that mission, Peters
                    romanticizes Willkie&apos;s campaign, writing at one point that the wealthy Willkie was
                    &quot;Mr. Smith bound for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013962" reg="Washington">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>&quot; (p. 51). His account of Willkie&apos;s GOP nomination win (a victory
                    surprising not only because it was Willkie&apos;s first campaign but also because he had been a
                    life-long Democrat) is competent, but his treatment of the actual campaign- the crux of the
                    book-lacks drama. Peters stumbles on details, implying, for example, that Willkie spent only a few
                    thousand dollars on his campaign. (In reality, according to Steve Neal in his 1984 Willkie biography
                        <hi rend="i">Dark Horse</hi>, the campaign spent at least $16 million.) Peters also crams too
                    many extraneous details and digressions about his own boyhood into the book, causing it to lose
                    momentum.</p>
                <p>Willkie was less statesmanlike and more interesting than Peters portrays him. A womanizing,
                    hard-drinking industrialist and lawyer, Willkie was also a recognizably modern politician whose
                    success resulted not from skill at retail politics or the support of political bosses but from the
                    unlikely combination of native talent, an accident of history (the timing of <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7000084" reg="Deutschland">Germany&apos;s</country>
                    </placeName> invasion of <placeName>

                    </placeName>), and media bias. (Neal points out that without the support of Henry Luce, there would
                    have been no Willkie candidacy. Peters barely acknowledges this fact.) A political amateur, Willkie
                    decided after winning the nomination that he had nothing to learn from the professionals.
                    Consequently, he proceeded to alienate and insult virtually the entire Republican party machinery,
                    even as he endeared himself to much of the electorate and the media, a tactic that predictably
                    scuttled his bid for the GOP&apos;s nomination in 1944. Willkie usually charted an independent
                    course, but he could nevertheless compromise his principles for political gain: late in the 1940
                    campaign, for instance, he charged that a vote for Roosevelt was a vote for war, a statement he
                    laughingly recanted a few months after the election. Willkie, then, was less a savior of American
                    democracy than a supremely gifted but completely untrained candidate-although he was more right than
                    wrong on the only issue that mattered.</p>
                <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-103-1-112"/>
                <p>Peters&apos; s choice to all but ignore the latter stages of Willkie&apos;s public life,
                    particularly his role in helping to banish isolationism from American political discourse, is
                    perplexing. Willkie contributed no original ideas to the debate over <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country>
                    </placeName> foreign policy, but his massively bestselling <hi rend="i">One World</hi> (1943) was an
                    effective sales pitch for world government and greater post-war <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country>
                    </placeName> involvement in international affairs. More understandable is Peters&apos;s
                    reluctance to confront the tension between his thesis and his ideals. Unarguably, it was right for
                    the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to have fought the Axis Powers, and so Peters applauds Willkie for giving cover to
                    FDR&apos;s preparations for war. But for some-one like Peters, who believes that the people
                    should determine government policy through democratic institutions, there can be no more troubling
                    outcome than denying citizens the option of staying out of a world-shattering conflict. If there was
                    a real chance that voters would have chosen an isolationist in 1940, then Peters must explain why he
                    celebrates the fact that voters were barred from making such a grievous error. A book tackling that
                    topic would be a probing exploration of the conflict between democracy and truth. Too bad it remains
                    unwritten.</p>

                <p>Just as Edward R. Murrow was the best-known radio journalist of World War II, so was Hoosier native
                    Ernie Pyle the best-known print journalist. But far more documentaries have been made about Murrow
                    than about Pyle. Certainly Murrow&apos;s bosses at CBS vigorously promoted their man, and his
                    career continued into the age of video, while Pyle was never comfortable posing for promotional
                    pictures. Only a few moving films of Pyle are known to exist, and only a single film exists in which
                    Pyle speaks (an excerpt of which opens this documentary). But it&apos;s also difficult to make a
                    video about Pyle because he was a writer and a storyteller. One of his Scripps-Howard bosses
                    referred to his Mark Twain-like quality. Without pictures, documentarists face a challenge in
                    bringing a writer to life. Gould&apos;s documentary is only the third to focus on Pyle. While an
                    Arts &amp; Entertainment video pro- <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-103-1-113"/>duced five years ago
                        (<hi rend="i">Ernie Pyle: The Voice of G.I. Joe</hi>) does a better job of conveying
                    Pyle&apos;s role in World War II, Gould&apos;s work gives us a broader understanding of
                    Pyle&apos;s life and the meaning of his work.</p>
                <p>Gould solves the video challenge in several ways. In addition to the better-known snapshots and
                    promotional pictures of Pyle, he uses relevant contemporary video. He has also employed a group of
                    about twenty reenactors with tents, jeeps, and a machine gun and filmed them operating in northern <placeName>

                <p>The central theme in the video has to be stated in words by experts, because it&apos;s impossible
                    to present it visually. Historians Madison and Tobin both emphasize Pyle&apos;s importance in
                    presenting ordinary Americans and their lives to other Americans, whether in the peacetime 1930s or
                    in World War II. As John Steinbeck wrote, &quot;[T]he war of the homesick, weary, funny,
                    violent, common men who wash their socks in their helmets, complain about the food, whistle at the
                    Arab girls, or any girls for that matter, and bring themselves through as dirty a business as the
                    world has ever seen and do it with humor and dignity and courage ... is Ernie Pyle&apos;s
                    war&quot; (&quot;A Tribute to Ernie Pyle,&quot; <hi rend="i">Sears Peoples Book
                    Club</hi>, 1:6 [1944], p. 10).</p>
                <p>Viewers will respond to this documentary in different ways. Some will find evidence of Pyle as the
                    heroic, iconic voice of the World War II GI. Others will see a man of great complexity, who in spite
                    of the trials of his own self-doubt and his wife&apos;s manic depression, still managed to
                    produce often superb prose.</p>
                <p>This documentary will be especially valuable for a modern public that knows very little about Pyle.
                    With a good study guide, public schools can use the video as the center of a study of the Hoosier
                    hero. Public television stations will undoubtedly use the documentary at fundraising time. The
                    public in general will find this the most accessible summary of Pyle and his life.</p>
                <p>The reviewer feels obligated to point out one factual error. While the School of Journalism at
                    Indiana University proudly claims that Pyle studied journalism at IU, he could not have majored in
                    journalism, since that major was not approved until the early 1930s, a decade after Pyle left
                    school. Pyle&apos;s IU transcript shows that he was, in fact, majoring in economics.</p>

                    his band on stage, doing what they must do night after night: put on a great show. In this
                    cracker-jack memoir, <hi rend="i">Come Hither to Go Yonder</hi>, Bob Black takes us rambling in the
                    1970s with just such a master, Bill Monroe, the Father of Bluegrass.</p>
                <p>Few artists invent (or help to invent) a genre and then spend the rest of their lives performing and
                    promulgating it, internationally, at the top of their form-one thinks of jazzman Louis Armstrong, of
                    gospel&apos;s Thomas A. Dorsey, and, certainly, of mandolin maestro Bill Monroe, who said simply
                    that his music had &quot;a high pitch&quot; (p. 11).</p>
                <p>Banjoist Black became a Blue Grass Boy in September 1974 after a brief audition on his second day in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Black had cut his hair and gone into Monroe&apos;s Sixteenth Avenue South office
                    to play bluegrass for the man who started it all, and, four tunes later, Monroe said:
                    &quot;Okay. We&apos;re leaving tonight at 3 A.M. to play a festival in <placeName>

                <p>The young man who had learned on an inexpensive Kay banjo (to which he affixed &quot;homemade

                    washers&quot;) was then thrust into what he calls &quot;the unusual and creative lifestyle
                    of the traveling musician&quot; (pp. 21, 30-31). Though the famous walk through these pages (Bob

                <p>&quot;I like to drive of a night,&quot; Monroe often said, and Black frequently found himself
                    behind the wheel in the wee hours. Once he jerked the over-laden station wagon to dodge what turned
                    out to be only &quot;a blacktop patch,&quot; and he was quickly replaced-&quot;When you
                    start seeing mules standing in the road,&quot; said consummate bluegrass fiddler and fellow Blue
                    Grass Boy Kenny Baker, &quot;it&apos;s time to switch drivers&quot; (p. 32).</p>
                <p>Fiddler Baker comes across as nearly as powerful a figure as Monroe himself. &quot;He gave me
                    advice on how to get along in Bill&apos;s band, such as where to stash things on the bus, when
                    to wear casual offstage attire (&apos;no dungarees!&apos;), and how to be discreet about
                    consuming alcoholic beverages on the road (&apos;don&apos;t let the Chief find
                    out!&apos;)&quot; (p. 95). One nice passage treats Black&apos;s and Baker&apos;s
                    touring <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-103-1-115"/> together in 1985 when neither is any longer with
                    Monroe.</p>
                <p>In the end, though, this is a paean to Bill Monroe&apos;s music and his unshakeable, unmistakable
                    style. &quot;His rhythm had a forward lean,&quot; writes Black. &quot;Each note fell at
                    the front edge of the beat, giving the feeling that the music was gaining in speed from moment to
                    moment, even though the tempo never really changed&quot; (p. 77). With Black we see, and almost
                    hear, Monroe spinning new tunes as the band rolls through the American night, naming them for places
                    where he thought of them: &quot;Racin&apos; through Payson,&quot; &quot;Tombstone

                <p>The stunning revival of freight railroads in North America after 1980 included structural changes in
                    the industry. One of these was that trunk railroads divested themselves of secondary lines that
                    served mostly local traffic. Where there remained enough local traffic to sustain a railroad, and
                        <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-103-1-116"/> where local entrepreneurs could be persuaded to take a
                    gamble, these routes were &quot;spun off&quot; as independent short lines. If they were
                    large enough, they were called &quot;regional railroads.&quot;</p>
                <p>This book is the story of one of those spin-offs, the Indiana Rail Road, formerly the <placeName>

                    found solutions during the decade, Hoback saw an opportunity to be a part of a revitalizing
                    industry. He found financial backers and acquired the <placeName>

                    solid traffic base in coal. With good management and enough credit to make the necessary physical
                    improvements, its traffic base began to grow. Today, as the conduit for coal to Indianapolis Power

                <p>In this engaging study of Abraham Lincoln and the principal men of his cabinet, Doris Kearns Goodwin
                    argues that Lincoln&apos;s &quot;political genius&quot;-particularly his
                    &quot;extraordinary array of personal qualities&quot; (p. xvii)-enabled him to harness the
                    talents of a disparate group of men, including his political rivals, to provide the country with
                    effective leadership during the Civil War. Whatever Lincoln&apos;s doubts and frustrations or
                    his increasing fatalistic sense that &quot;events have controlled me&quot; (<hi rend="i"
                        >Collected Works</hi> 7:282), Goodwin emphasizes Lincoln&apos;s political wisdom,
                    confidence, and sympathetic understanding of human behavior. He capably managed the conservative and
                    radical wings of his party; he befriended rivals and acted magnanimously toward those who opposed
                    him; and he was able to &quot;gather the best men of the country around him&quot; and
                    &quot;impress upon them his own purpose, perception, and resolution at every juncture.&quot;</p>
                <p>This is not simply a biography of Lincoln. He shares the book with 1860 presidential election rivals
                    and cabinet members William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates and, to a lesser extent,
                    with their political colleagues and families: Gideon Welles, Montgomery Blair, Edwin M. Stanton,
                    Mary Todd Lincoln, Frances Seward, Kate Chase Sprague, and Francis and Frank Blair. Collective
                    biography allows Goodwin to present a &quot;clearer and more dimensional picture&quot; of
                    Lincoln&apos;s life (p. xv). Although Lincoln&apos;s upbringing was <pb n="112"
                        id="VAA4025-103-1-118"/> more humble and rough-hewn than his political rivals&apos;, all
                    represented a generation of &quot;ambitious young men in the North&quot; who pursued success
                    in nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName> (p. xv). Following their life courses sep- arately in the first part of the book, we
                    see each man&apos;s different circumstances and temperament, the decisions each made, and the
                    consequences of those decisions. Lincoln&apos;s character and experiences served him well.
                    Lincoln learned in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> to be a &quot;shrewd grassroots politician&quot; (p. 89); his
                    &quot;sympathy,&quot; according to private secretary John G. Nicolay, enabled him
                    &quot;to forecast with uncanny accuracy what his opponents were likely to do&quot; (p. 104);
                    he gained devoted friends, even in defeat, as in his noble behavior toward Lyman Trumbull and Norman
                    Judd at the time of his unsuccessful 1855 bid for the U.S. Senate (pp. 130, 172); and he was a
                    &quot;master of timing&quot; in the 1860 presidential campaign and throughout his presidency
                    (p. 212).</p>
                <p>The second part of the book is a more straightforward narrative of the Lincoln administration. Much
                    of the story is familiar: Seward&apos;s transformation from dismissive rival to admiring friend,
                    Gen. George B. McClellan&apos;s frustrating reluctance to engage in battle, political reactions
                    to the administration&apos;s decisions, the war&apos;s strain on the nation,
                    Chase&apos;s political machinations, and Lincoln&apos;s firm commitment to Union victory.
                    Goodwin tells the story well. She explains that, &quot;by widening the lens to include
                    Lincoln&apos;s colleagues and their families,&quot; the study could &quot;benefit from a
                    treasure trove of primary sources that have not generally been used in Lincoln biographies&quot;
                    (p. xviii). Her skillful use of the correspondence and journals of the people surrounding
                    Lincoln-and her presentation of their thoughts, actions, and relationships with each other
                    generally-add considerable depth to her interpretation of Lincoln and his colleagues. We see their
                    human qualities: Stanton&apos;s early personal tragedies, Chase&apos;s desire for the
                    presidency and Lincoln&apos;s forbearance regarding it, or Seward&apos;s tearful reaction
                    when, on seeing the War Department&apos;s flag at half-mast as he recovered from his wounds, he
                    deduced that Lincoln was dead. Such stories turn insightful analysis into a compelling and even
                    moving tale.</p>

                <p>The first modern treatment of Basil Wilson Duke, famous as the author of <hi rend="i">A History of
                        Morgan&apos;s Cavalry</hi> (1867), this work presents answers to many long-held questions.
                    In focusing on Duke, John Hunt Morgan&apos;s brother-in-law, close friend, and second-in-command
                    of his cavalry, Gary R. Matthews provides a reevaluation of Duke&apos;s war role, his
                    contributions to Morgan&apos;s career, and his post-war memory.</p>
                <p>Matthews contends that it is &quot;impossible to separate Duke&apos;s Civil War career from
                    that of John Hunt Morgan without distorting the significance of his military

                    a story of Duke&apos;s military exploits. As a result, more than half of the work details the
                    personal and official activities of Duke during the war; the remaining chapters consider both his
                    pre-and post-war experiences.</p>
                <p>The book could be considered a unit history of the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry C.S.A. and Morgan&apos;s
                    subsequently larger commands. The author convincingly &quot;demonstrates that Morgan was in
                    charge but that Duke perfectly complemented him by developing his irregular hit-and-run raiding
                    style and tactic of fighting dismounted.&quot; Matthews discovered that it was Duke who
                    &quot;wrote a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="i">Tactics for Mounted Riflemen</hi>&quot; and
                    Duke who &quot;handled discipline ... [while allowing] Morgan to become a folk hero of the

                <p>Racism and its persistence in American culture have been recurring themes in American literature,
                    film, and television. In recent years, journalists and historians have written extensively of racial
                    conflict and tension in every period of American history. Recent works such as David
                    Blight&apos;s masterful <hi rend="i">Race and Reunion</hi> (2001) and Scott Malcomson&apos;s
                        <hi rend="i">One Drop of Blood</hi> (2000), to name two, have contributed to a reexamination of
                    the origins and development of racism as a major element in our national story.</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Sundown Towns</hi> is an important contribution to this examination of the problem of
                    racism as well as to the explanation of its persistence in present-day <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Author James Loewen, author of award-winning <hi rend="i">Lies My Teacher Told Me</hi>
                    (1996), a critical examination of American history texts, and the more recent <hi rend="i">Lies

                        </placeName></hi> (1999), a look at history as distorted by public monuments and historic
                    markers, has produced a monumental study of the &quot;hidden history&quot; of racism.</p>
                <p>A sundown town, as defined by Loewen, is &quot;any organized jurisdiction that . . kept African
                    Americans or other groups from living in it and was thus &apos;all-white&apos; on
                    purpose&quot; (p. 4). In great detail, the author marshals census data, primary sources, and a
                    myriad of state and local contacts in order to document the existence of these deliberately
                    &quot;whites only&quot; communities. In discussing the significance of these places, Loewen
                    maintains that outside of the traditional slave holding South, &quot;probably a majority of all
                    incorporated places&quot; (p. 4) excluded African Americans. Loewen further states that local
                    historians wary of potential adverse publicity deliberately hid mention of these policies.
                    Professional historians and sociologists, the author asserts, simply did not know about the practice
                    until recently. He contrasts that omission with the extensively researched history of lynching.</p>
                <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-103-1-121"/>
                <p>Loewen posits a &quot;nadir&quot; period between 1890 and 1940, when racial exclusion became
                    standard policy throughout the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The techniques for carrying out the policy ranged from threats to outright violence.
                    More subtle, but perhaps more effective, were restrictive covenants, racial steering, and redlining
                    by realtors and financial institutions. This practice extended to New Deal planned communities such
                    as the Greenbelt towns and were policy under the FHA. By the 1950s most communities, including the
                    new Levittowns, had successfully excluded blacks from their jurisdictions.</p>
                <p>Loewen&apos;s most telling argument is that the effects of racial exclusion are still with us.
                    The sundown towns, he maintains, are now sundown suburbs. The resultant racial segregation
                    &quot;exacerbates all other forms of racial discrimination,&quot; (p. 17) such as lack of
                    employment and educational opportunities, as well as the social networking necessary for
                    advancement. Thus racial inequality is still a function of where &quot;one can live.&quot;
                    Loewen has challenged historians and the public to examine the record of community life and to
                    reflect upon the historical sources of contemporary racism.</p>

                    Great Depression), and Ella Howard (a history of the Bowery in the twentieth century) are in

                <p>In contrast to works by myself (<hi rend="i">Down and Out, On the Road: The Homeless in American
                        History</hi> [20021) and Todd DePastino (<hi rend="i">Citizen Hobo: How a Century of

                        </placeName></hi> [2003]), Frank T. Higbie&apos;s study of hobo workers focuses on a
                    specific locale and time frame. His concern is to understand the nature, causes, and consequences of
                    the migration of seasonal laborers who, prior to 1930, played an important role in harvesting wheat,
                    vegetables, and other crops, and in the mining and timber industries. As the author explains, the
                    increasing mechanization of this type of work led to a steady decline in the need for migratory
                    labor, beginning in the 1920s. The author avoids the romanticization of homeless men on the road
                    that too often diverted the attention of middle-class readers in the early twentieth century. These
                    men, who often traveled illegally on freight trains to get to and from their seasonal jobs, were
                    viewed with suspicion, especially in rural areas. Progressive era social investigators, even when
                    they had some understanding of the economic causes of homelessness, often reinforced traditional
                    stereotypes of hobos as lazy, irresponsible, alcoholic, and potentially dangerous. At the same time,
                    however, this element of the working class was much needed, especially at harvest time in the
                    midwestern wheat belt. &quot;Indispensable outcasts&quot; is indeed a good way to describe
                    them.</p>
                <p>Higbie&apos;s analysis goes beyond that of other historical studies of the homeless in its
                    thoroughly examination of the economic role played by such workers in an industrializing society, as
                    he traces their relationship to the farming and logging communities that needed them and, most
                    importantly, demonstrates their class consciousness as it developed through their work experiences
                    and their relationships with other laborers. Higbie&apos;s assessment of hobos&apos; lives
                    &quot;on the road&quot; reinforces to a considerable degree what both I and DePastino have
                    previously discussed, but he gives little attention to the lifestyle and interaction of workers in
                    the skid rows, areas of major cities where hobos, tramps, and the down- and-out in general
                    congregated in the late fall and winter. This omission is unfortunate, because the interaction of
                    hobos in the &quot;main stems&quot; (as they called skid rows) offers much evidence of the
                    temporary communalism that Higbie considers an important part of the hobo life during the warmer
                    months of the year. Nonetheless, <hi rend="i">Indispensable Outcasts</hi> makes an important
                    contribution to social and labor history by identifying and discussing hobos as a legitimate part of
                    the working class. In broadening our understanding of what it meant to be a worker during the high
                    period of industrialization <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-103-1-123"/> in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, this work helps us better to understand the social basis of the appeal of radical
                    groups such as the I.W.W. at that time.</p>
                <p>Though focusing on a single historical incident, Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen&apos;s study of
                    the Bonus Army has something in common with Higbie&apos;s volume. Both deal significantly with
                    the relationship between the homeless and the non-homeless. The Bonus Army, a group of 45,000
                    unemployed World War I veterans, marched (or rode in boxcars) to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia">Washington ,
                        D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the late spring of 1932 to pressure Congress into paying a bonus promised to them
                    for wartime service. Once in the nation&apos;s capitol, the veterans constructed a huge
                    shantytown on the banks of the <geogName type="river" key="tgn_1128790" reg="Potomac"
                    >Potomac</geogName> and began regular protest marches in an attempt to influence Congress to fund
                    the bonus. As the number of veterans, and their families, grew, and as the shantytown expanded to
                    the size of a small city, Hoover administration officials grew increasingly uneasy about their
                    continuing presence in the nation&apos;s capital. Finally, on July 28, going beyond the specific
                    orders of the President to remove the Bonus Expeditionary Force (as the group called itself) from
                    its &quot;Hooverville,&quot; troops under the command of General Douglas MacArthur drove the
                    veterans and their families from the city at bayonet point-sometimes using tear gas- then set fire
                    to their makeshift abodes.</p>
                <p>These events, and the political fallout they caused for Hoover (whose actions contributed to his
                    disastrous defeat in November), have been described before, but never so colorfully or in such
                    detail as they are by Dickson and Allen. Their book is particularly valuable, however, because it
                    goes beyond these well-known aspects of the story to explore the larger social meaning of the Bonus
                    Army and the long-term political ramifications of the brutal suppression of their protest, which
                    later helped spur legislators to enact the G.I. Bill in 1944. Compared to others who have written on
                    the Bonus Army, the authors devote much more time to the organization of the BEF and their march on
                    Washington, demonstrating that this group of homeless, unemployed men was far from the disorganized
                    mob of radicals and ne&apos;er-do-wells that MacArthur and other conservatives described.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting sections of <hi rend="i">The Bonus Army</hi> focuses on race relations
                    among the veterans. Dickson and Allen demonstrate that both blacks and whites participated in all
                    aspects of the Bonus Army on a basis of rough equality and without much tension. While such
                    interaction among hobos and tramps on the road was common, however, it was not true of urban skid
                    rows, where African Americans were usually excluded. Despite being located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia">Washington,
                        D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>a rigidly segregated city at the time, the huge &quot;encampment&quot; of
                    veterans was never segregated along racial lines. One wishes the authors had spent more <pb n="118"
                        id="VAA4025-103-1-124"/> time on the relationship between the BEF and the local communities that
                    aided them as they traveled. The sympathetic treatment the men received in most cases reflected a
                    generally favorable attitude toward the homeless during the Depression that went well beyond the
                    specific issue of the bonus. Nevertheless, the volume by Dickson and Allen, exceptionally well
                    researched for a popular study, is by far the most wide-ranging history of the Bonus Army to date.</p>
                <p>The interaction of the domiciled majority in the U.S. with the homeless unemployed has always been
                    complex and ambiguous-sometimes hostile and sometimes sympathetic, depending on the class
