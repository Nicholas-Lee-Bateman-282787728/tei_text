                    three weeks in June, Willkie gathered enough reliable promises of delegate votes to make him one of
                    the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination before the first roll call of the
                    states. The Willkie weapon of victory was fashioned in the weeks immediately preceding the
                    convention balloting as fragments of many delegations coalesced to form the wave which crested at <placeName>

            <p>The two leading Republican presidential contenders in the spring of 1940 were Senator Robert A. Taft,
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and Thomas E. Dewey, district attorney of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">New York County</region>
                    </placeName>. Taft had served in the Senate for less than two years. Dewey, narrowly defeated for
                    the governorship of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1938, had never held an elective office on the state or national level. That these
                    two comparative newcomers to politics were the pick of the candidate crop was testimony to the
                    severity of the shrinking pains suffered by the Republican party during the 1930's.</p>
            <p>Dewey and Taft had conducted sharply contrasting campaigns. From January, when Dewey issued his first
                    campaign statement on foreign policy, until June, when he delivered a convention-eve radio address
                    over a national network, the dynamic New Yorker had been on the prowl across the land. Taft, on the
                    other hand, had been a weekend warrior, pleading that he could not in good conscience desert his
                    desk while the Senate was in session. Dewey had swept through five spring primaries without a
                    check.∗ Taft relied for his convention strength on a network of understandings he had
                    reached with professional politicians scattered throughout the South and Middle West.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Under the unwritten rules governing Republican presidential campaigning, which appeared in 1940 to
                    have been drawn for a noncontact sport, Dewey and Taft had not met head-on in a single primary.

                    </placeName>, where he was unopposed. Republican voters had not had an opportunity to choose between
                    Dewey and Taft in a presidential preference primary. As a consequence, each of the front runners had
                    in his train a number of camp followers whose loyalty, at best, was only first-ballot deep.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Dewey, the acknowledged leader in pledged delegates, was particularly
                    vulnerable to raids because few of his followers were attached to his cause by strong bonds of
                    either personal or political loyalty. And far more than any specific candidate, the minority
                    Republicans were desperately searching for one who could bring the party back to the White House
                    after an absence of eight years.</p>
            <p>If the world had been at peace, the probability is that either Dewey or Taft would have been the 1940
                    Republican presidential candidate. But events in Europe in the spring of 1940 influenced the course

                    </placeName> tottered, the inexperience of Dewey and the isolationism of Taft persuaded many voters
                    to cast about for a new candidate. Dewey was the principal loser. The Gallup Poll of April 23, 1940,
                    recorded the high water mark of Dewey's popularity. As the Nazi tanks streamed across <placeName>

                    </placeName> was more genuine and spontaneous than in other portions of the nation. If a sectional
                    fuse had not been lit and carefully tended, there would probably have been no national explosion for
                    Willkie. The Willkie movement, however, became national in scope as the shock waves spread west from
                    the impact area. Although the nutrients present in the political soil of the Middle West provided
                    more natural nourishment for the isolationism of Senator Taft than the internationalism of Willkie,
                    the latter's managers began to harvest a crop of convention votes during the days
                    immediately preceding the balloting. By the time the convention assembled, Willkie had infiltrated
                    several of the delegations from the Middle West previously shared by Dewey and Taft or held in the
                    name of a favorite son.</p>

                    regarded Taft as lusterless and Dewey as an upstart. Because neither of the two leading candidates

                    convention. When the Willkie men made their move late in the spring, the field was open to them. The

                    to a campaign contribution in the diastrous Landon campaign, Queeny wisely enlisted the aid of a
                    number of rising young professionals who were eager to challenge Old Guard domination of the regular

            <p>Elsewhere in the Middle West, Willkie's lieutenants were able to establish preconvention
                    beachheads in the pivotal states of Indiana, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Support from Indiana was considered vital to Willkie's success because of the
                    American political shibboleth that a national candidate must have the confidence of his home state.
                    But Willkie's prospects in Indiana were apparently less bright than in <placeName>

                    of veteran politicians, including former Republican National Chairman Will Hays, former Senator
                    James E. Watson, former Governor James P. Goodrich, labor leader William L. Hutcheson, and Homer
                    Capehart, a successful businessman who would go to the Senate several years later. As a political
                    reporter close to the delegation put it, these men were "not likely to be influenced by the
                    fact that Willkie was born in Indiana, attended I.[ndiana] U.[niversity] and has strong ties in the
                    state." "If a considerable number of them decide to vote for Willkie it will be
                    because they believe he is the man of the hour."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>Not only were a majority of the Indiana delegation not yet decided to vote for their state's
                    native son but some of them were openly hostile. Former Senator James E. Watson, for example, was
                    said to have compared Willkie to a reformed prostitute who wanted to lead the choir immediately
                    after joining the church.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Two Indiana congressmen, Forest Harness and George
                    W. Gillie, were among those active in the stop-Willkie movement, which culminated in a meeting
                    attended by more than forty members of Congress.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> There were even two Indiana

                    Democratic Senator Frederick Van Nuys. On the other hand, Willkie could count on the support of

                    Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast area and offered an attractive alternative for those delegates who
                    had been unenthusiastic about both Dewey and Taft.</p>
            <p>The pocket delegations of the South proved to be least susceptible to temptation. The Willkie drive
                    made little impression on the states of the deep South. Only in three states of the Upper
                            South—<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>—were there any Willkie converts in the immediate preconvention period.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Taft and Dewey continued to lead Willkie by wide margins south of the
                    Mason-Dixon line as the time for balloting arrived. Southern Republicans may have been more attached
                    to the basic philosophy of traditional Republicanism than their northern brethren. Certainly the
                    southern delegations were more tightly controlled by the organization leaders, and individual
                    southern delegates were less able to vote their personal convictions than were their colleagues from
                    other sections.</p>
            <p>The salient fact which emerges, however, from the above review is that Wendell Willkie had passed
                    well beyond the dark horse stage when the formal balloting began and, in terms of convention votes,
                    was one of the serious contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. More than many of its
                    predecessors, the Republican national convention of 1940 was truly a nominating body in the sense
                    that its choice was not predetermined.</p>
            <p>There was no controlling force operating on the uncommitted delegations to give them direction and
                    purpose before the rise of Willkie to national political prominence during late May and early June
                    of 1940. If the uncommitted delegations had been confronted with the choice of voting for Dewey or
                    Taft, after the favorite sons had dropped out, the selection, in many instances, would have been one
                    of political necessity rather than conscience. The sudden and dramatic appearance of Wendell Willkie
                    as a new attraction in Republican politics did not, therefore, compel most delegates to sever
                    themselves from long cherished and deeply-felt political principles before they voted for him.</p>

            <p>The more closely one examines the balance of political power on the eve of the national convention,
                    the fewer are the surprises in the voting behavior of the delegates during the six roll calls (see
                    Table I) required before Wendell Willkie obtained a clear majority. The distinctive pattern of
                    sectional sentiment which so strikingly manifested itself during the period between the naming of
                    the last of the delegates and the opening of the convention held true to form throughout the
                    balloting and formed the mold of the Willkie victory. For this reason, the direction of the voting
                    can best be charted through a regional analysis.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                    ballot onward and his losses, with rare exceptions, were Willkie's gains. By the third roll
                    call, Willkie had moved briskly out in front in the East. On the penultimate fifth ballot, the
                    Hoosier spread-eagled the field in the East, receiving five times as many votes from these twelve
                    states as Dewey and Taft combined. Taft failed to win the nomination because of his disastrous
                    showing in the East, where his maximum share of the vote was 10 per cent on the fifth ballot. On the
                    fifth ballot, by contrast, Willkie had more than 68 per cent of the vote from the East. The
                    inexorable trend toward Willkie in the East can be traced in state after state.</p>

                    ballot. Of these, only eight went to Willkie. But the Willkie managers knew that the Simpson
                    delegates from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    </placeName> would come to their candidate on an early ballot. The third ballot became the important
                    turning point for Willkie in <placeName>

                    </placeName> when Walter Mack, Jr., challenged the accuracy of the count reported by the chairman. A
                    poll of the delegation brought to light ten more Willkie votes, for a total of twenty-seven. Mack
                    later revealed that the chairman, a Dewey manager, had been reporting the vote of the state
                    arbitrarily without polling the delegates.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> The flow of <placeName>

                    </placeName> delegates to Willkie continued on the fourth ballot (thirty-five) and became a
                    hemorrhage on the fifth ballot (seventy-five), when Dewey released his delegates.</p>
            <p>The same pattern was followed in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. The disgruntled adherents of former Governor Harold Hoffman, still smarting over their
                    defeat in the gubernatorial primary by the Dewey organization, led the exodus to Willkie which began
                    on the first ballot. They were joined on the third ballot by the chairman of the delegation, who had
                    been the Dewey manager in the state. By the fifth ballot only a handful of Dewey diehards from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hudson County</region>
                    </placeName> held out.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                    </placeName> was in the vanguard of the trend toward Willkie, despite Dewey's triumph in
                    the primary. The inability of Dewey to hold even the delegates pledged to him was a hard blow to his
                    prestige and may have influenced the decisions of a number of uncommitted delegations to turn to
                    Willkie.</p>
            <p>Willkie, for example, fell heir to most of the favorite-son votes from the East. The six <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> states, which had hoarded their votes in favorite-son caches, served as a vital
                    reservoir of Willkie strength by providing nourishing additions to his totals on each of several
                    ballots. Sixteen solid votes from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> on the first ballot gave Willkie a nucleus for regional expansion. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in a shift later characterized by Willkie as an "important break"
                    coming at a "psychological moment," abandoned its favorite son, Representative
                    Joseph Martin, after two roll calls.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> New <list type="footnotes">

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> became a Willkie bastion on the third ballot when the Indianan received sixty-six of
                    the region's eighty-eight votes. Even in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, Willkie made inroads on the favorite-son holdings of Governor Arthur James, who
                    apparently took his presidential candidacy seriously. Despite all of the pressure brought by the
                    leaders of the state organization to hold the delegation on the second ballot.</p>
            <p>In the East, Willkie easily vanquished Dewey, his principal regional rival. But it was Senator Taft
                    who climbed past the fading Dewey to regional leadership in the Middle West. In spite of the
                    noticeable inroads made by Willkie on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Senator's estimated preconvention strength, he trailed Taft in the Middle West
                    throughout the balloting. But Taft's comparatively modest advantage over Willkie in the
                    Middle West did not compensate for his crushing deficit in the East.</p>

                    </placeName>'s steadfast support for her Junior Senator endowed Taft with a continuing
                    regional advantage over Willkie. Taft was also the principal beneficiary when the Dewey vote from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> began to disintegrate after the first ballot. As the contest narrowed to a choice
                    between Willkie and Taft, North and <placeName>

                    the Indiana delegation moved by bits and pieces toward Willkie as the balloting continued. National
                    Committeeman William G. Irwin and Representative Charles Halleck were joined in the Willkie column
                    by onetime Republican National Chairman Will Hays and Homer Capehart. Even former Senator James E.

            </p>
            <p>Further west in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states, however, Willkie lagged behind Taft on
                    all ballots. In fact, Taft was pulling away from Willkie in the West on the fifth ballot, when
                    Willkie was only one roll call away from the nomination. Willkie made little impression on the
                    larger western delegations from <placeName>

                    </placeName> divided her votes among as many as ten candidates; <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> voted unanimously for Taft on the next to last fifth ballot. The only well-known
                    regional leader to enlist with Willkie was Governor Ralph Carr, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName>, and he brought only a minority of his delegation with him. But Willkie picked up
                    enough scattered votes from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="region">New Mexico</region>,

                    possible forty votes from these splinter delegations.</p>
            <p>In the South as well, Taft maintained a substantial lead over Willkie throughout the balloting. When
                    the Dewey vote from the South broke up after the fourth ballot, most of it went to Taft. Only the
                    states of the Upper South made a contribution to the Willkie victory. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where genuine Willkie sentiment existed before the convention, provided him with his
                    largest bloc of southern votes with eleven on the fifth ballot. A band of Willkie delegates was
                    formed in the <placeName>

                    been recognized as an influential behind-the-scenes organizer for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> GOP, but his responsibilities as head of two Chattanooga manufacturing concerns had
                    limited his political role until his enthusiasm for Willkie drove him to participate more
                        actively.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> More representative of the South as a whole, however, were the
                    delegations from <placeName>

            <p>The voting pattern in the Middle West, West, and South shows clearly that Willkie did not blitz the
                    1940 Republican national convention. His landslide in the East barely carried him through to a
                    narrow national victory. Until the final ballot, Willkie was a minority candidate west of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The lines of the Taft supporters in the Middle West, West, and South held firm until
                    after Willkie's mass of eastern votes had nudged him across the line to victory on the
                    touch-and-go sixth ballot.</p>
            <p>The contemporary belief that Willkie was carried to victory on a tidal wave of sound from the
                    galleries has survived despite the evidence that Taft's delegates in the Middle West, West,
                    and South stuck with him and were not stampeded. The first marked pro-Willkie demonstrations among
                    the spectators began during the first night session of June 24.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> When the
                    presidential balloting began three days later, the alliterative appeal of "We Want
                    Willkie" had become almost deafening. The millions of people listening intently over their
                    radios to the proceedings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> received the indelible impression that the convention hall was controlled by Willkie
                    supporters. The actual effect on the delegates themselves is difficult to assess accurately. The
                    relentless chant may have swayed some who were undecided and uncommitted. An editorial writer for
                    William Allen White's Emporia <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> attributed the Kansans'
                    change of front to the waves of pro-Willkie mail flowing from the folks back home.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> But other delegates were openly annoyed by the nerve-jangling uproar. One political
                    reporter commented: "It was highly interesting to observe the animated resentment on the
                    faces of many of the delegates, some of whom, glaring angrily at the cheering spectators, were
                    booing back at the Willkie partisans."<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Some delegates, resting in
                    their hotel rooms after the pandemonium of the convention floor, were irked when they were disturbed
                    by the delivery of fresh batches of pro-Willkie telegrams. Other thrifty delegates complained when
                    they totaled the tips dispensed into the hands of waiting bellboys for delivery of the pro-Willkie
                        messages.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> The organized cheering for Willkie may even have backfired to
                    the extent that it drove supporters of other major candidates to work harder. The Taft leaders, for
                    example, were incensed when they became convinced that Samuel Pryor, Jr., chairman of the committee

            <p>But the most well-preserved and widely circulated of the myths clustering around the nomination of

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> lacking an organization which could translate his demonstrated popularity with the
                    people into the hard currency of convention votes. On the contrary, before the trial by ballot began
                    a thoroughly professional corps of Willkie managers drawn from across the nation was mapping plans
                    for convention strategy. Such youthful governors as Raymond Baldwin, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, had aligned themselves with Willkie. From among the national committeemen he could
                    rely on Samuel Pryor, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, Walter Hallanan, of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. A sprinkling of Republican congressmen were found among Willkie's convention
                    backers: Clifford Hope, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, Charles Halleck, of Indiana, Frank Horton, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In addition, while the 1940 convention was not bossed in the traditional sense of the word, there
                    were a number of state leaders willing and able to provide Willkie with vital transfusions of votes
                    at critical junctures. Standouts among this group were Mayor Rolland Marvin, of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Syracuse</settlement>, <region type="county">New York

                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, Senator Styles Bridges, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>, and Frank Harris, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Willkie also benefited from the enthusiasm he had kindled in a number of previously
                    inarticulate Republican businessmen, such as Edgar M. Queeny, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, and Paul J. Kreusi, of <placeName>

                    votes at national conventions.</p>
            <p>Finally, Willkie owed much to the favorite sons who played a key role in the convention. After
                    Dewey's bid for a first-ballot nomination had fallen short, the Willkie and Taft managers
                    worked feverishly to fill their ranks not only with Dewey's former followers but also from
                    among the 346 delegates who had sat on the fence during the first round <list type="footnotes">

                    on the part of favorite sons, or their delegates, were decisive in tipping the scales in his favor.
                    The bulk of the support originally pledged to Arthur Vandenberg, Joseph Martin, Styles Bridges,
                    Arthur Capper, Charles McNary, Arthur James, and Frank Gannett found its way to Willkie. Only the
                    handful of delegates grouped around Hanford MacNider and Harlan Bushfield elected to transfer their
                    allegiance to Taft.</p>
            <p>Willkie was undeniably a political amateur in 1940; but he gave exceptional promise of being a
                    winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party,
                    queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership to entrust its political
                    fortunes to a man without political experience. In most of the previous instances, the nomination
                    had gone to a military man. In 1940 it went to a businessman. Willkie was nominated not as the
                    result of a political miracle but by hard work and skillful management.</p>

            <p>Albert J. Beveridge was a successful lawyer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a senator from Indiana for two terms (1899–1911), one of the
                    standard-bearers for the Bull Moose party in 1912, and later a biographer of distinction. Starting
                    from a poor, rural background, he achieved success through high intelligence, oratorical and
                    political skill, and strenuous effort. Beveridge began his political career as a regular Republican
                    then, about 1905, joined forces with the insurgent or Progressive Republicans and became one of the
                    leaders of that group. His political career has been, and is being, dealt with by others.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> These pages are concerned with the basic social philosophy which lay behind
                    his actions through 1912. Beveridge's ideas about reform place him in that stream of
                    Progressive thought which emphasized the importance of the national government in bringing about
                    change. Herbert Croly and Walter Lipmann provided the philosophic basis for this group. Theodore
                    Roosevelt, with strong support from Albert Beveridge, was its most potent political spokesman.</p>
            <p>In various ways Beveridge extolled the power of the national government. In domestic affairs he urged
                    the use of national power for everything from putting down the Pullman strike to limiting child
                    labor. In foreign affairs he urged an expansion of American power and political control in the
                    Caribbean and Far East. The characterization of Beveridge as a nationalist is beyond dispute. To say
                    that he was a nationalist, however, is not enough. His nationalism was one manifestation of a more
                    comprehensive social philosophy which rested on his ideas of race, order, and power.</p>
            <p>Along with many other men of the late nineteenth century,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Beveridge believed

                    <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-058-2-028"/> human society was a deep racial or blood instinct. Each race,
                    he thought, had a collective soul which harbored a drive in a certain direction. This drive had to
                    be followed. "The key to my speech was racial," he wrote in 1900. "I
                    consider conventional ethics and conventional morals man-made and therefore finite as of absolutely
                    no moment compared to the higher and enduring ethic of our race."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Beveridge used the term "our race" he generally meant the Anglo-Saxon race.
                    The Anglo-Saxons had produced the great explorers of Elizabethan days whose "blood within
                    them commanded them" to seek out far lands. "Their racial tendency is as
                    resistless as the currents of the sea …. " "God has not been preparing
                    the English-speaking and Teutonic peoples for a thousand years for nothing but vain and idle
                    self-contemplation and self-admiration. No! He has made us the master organizers of the
                    world…. "<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Beveridge viewed the Anglo-Saxons as congenitally
                    a self-governing race. Therefore beyond any man-made law there was "institutional law with
                    its roots springing from the very soul of our race."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Americans and Canadians partook directly of this racial heritage. Close behind them were the Germans.
                    The natives of southern and eastern Europe were not of the best type, although Beveridge had
                    considerable regard for the Slavs. The lowest rung on the racial ladder was occupied by Asiatics. An
                    Oriental, he thought, was not capable of refinement and education. The Chinese had deep character
                    faults, the most important of which was too much regard for self and family and not enough for the
                        community.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> He insisted that the Filipinos, like children, were incapable of
                    running their own affairs. They needed the guiding hand of traditionally self-governing Anglo-Saxons
                    to lead them to the light.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Sometimes Beveridge's racism seemed to demand a rigid separation of the races. When he was
                    defending colonial status for the Philippines, he said, "The prospect of Puerto Rican,
                    Filipino and Hawaiian Senators and Congressmen, which is the ultimate conclusion of the argument of
                    the Constitution extending over these possessions is not a spectacle to be viewed

                        <region>New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>, he emphasized the easy amalgamation of Spanish and American blood and gave racial
                    mixing high credit for producing America's greatness.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second of Beveridge's basic beliefs was the importance of order in society. He defined
                    liberty as that which is "realized only by him who obeys those common rules of action
                    called laws by which alone liberty lives."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Civilization meant
                    "liberty and law, … commerce and communication, … social order and
                    the Gospel of our Lord…. "<hi rend="sup">12</hi> He praised the Puritans because
                    order was to them "as necessary as honesty; law as essential as liberty; government as
                    important as resistance to wrong."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> He praised the Jews and the
                    Germans as people who had learned the value of social cohesion rather than conflict.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Richelieu, Edmund Burke, and George Washington were great not because of their wisdom
                    or vision but because all three had brought order out of chaos.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Beveridge
                    regarded the French Revolution not as a triumph of democracy but as a catastrophe because it had led
                    to violence.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The need for order was another reason <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Beveridge's attitude toward order was most strikingly illustrated in his reaction to czarist
                    Russia. On his journey through Manchuria in 1901, he saw Russian methods of colonization. He was
                    favorably impressed by the Russians' swift, brutal justice, and praised them for killing
                    three thousand robbers in six weeks. Since the Russians were bringing order out of chaos, their
                    methods were justified.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the book, <hi rend="i">The Russian Advance,</hi>
                    which he wrote about this journey, Beveridge devoted one chapter to comparing three Russians. He had
                    high praise for Sergei Witte, finance minister, who was trying to reorganize czarist finance on
                    European lines. He approved also of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a close advisor to the czar and an
                    archreactionary. Beveridge also visited a third Russian whom he denounced as an unrealistic dreamer
                    who, if he had any effect at all upon the world, would have a bad effect. This man was a nobleman
                    living the life of a peasant, Count Leo Tolstoy.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Closely related to Beveridge's regard for order was his awe of power, almost without regard
                    for who wielded it or for what ends. This was another reason for his high regard for Pobedonostsev.

            <p>These were the basic tenets of Beveridge's social philosophy: a firm belief in a blood
                    consciousness which led each race to an inevitable destiny, a respect for power, pure and simple,
                    and a desire for order in all social functions. All else was merely particularization of these basic
                    beliefs.</p>
            <p>Beveridge's nationalism was based on his desire for order and efficiency and his respect for
                    power. His views were most clearly expounded in his speech on Governor John P. Altgeld's
                    action in the Pullman strike of 1894. President Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> had sent in troops to quell violence, and Altgeld had protested that the troops were
                    not needed and that in fact the President had no right to send troops until the governor of a state
                    requested such aid. Although Beveridge was a Republican, his speech, given at the height of the
                    presidential campaign of 1896, supported the Democratic President.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Beveridge
                    denounced Altgeld for supporting the proposition "that the general government cannot
                    suppress red riot, extinguish the fires of arson and protect property from destruction and life from
                    frenzy blinded mobs without the consent of the governor of the state." The Hoosier Senator
                    called Altgeld's position "the principle of national decay."</p>
            <p>Beveridge maintained that the federal government represented a single people divided into states
                    merely for administrative convenience and that the president represented that single people. Every
                    locality had a responsibility to the nation and must not be allowed to disrupt national affairs with
                    local disturbances. The president should use his power to preserve order, for "hesitation
                    of power is the food upon which mobs grow formidable and fierce. The danger that threatens our
                    future is local demagogues—not federal despots…. "<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In this speech Beveridge clearly stated his belief in order, power, and nationalism; and by
                    calling the Pullman strike a local disturbance and equating it with "red riot" he
                    showed a certain lack of comprehension of the economic developments going on around him.</p>
            <p>As a nationalist, Beveridge praised all those in the past who had increased the power of the federal
                    government. Thomas Jefferson's purchase of <placeName>

                    branch of the federal government had extensive power. A particular locality might not know what

                        would.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Beveridge derided the doctrine of states' rights as merely
                    a device behind which evildoers hid for their own selfish ends. Since the federal government
                    represented all of the people at once, and the states represented all the people divided into
                    forty-six pieces, there was no danger of federal tyranny. The nation could not harm the states, for
                    that would be self-harm.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A logical outgrowth of Beveridge's praise for centralized power was his approval of
                    concentration both in labor and industry.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> He regarded huge business
                    organizations as a natural outgrowth of industrialization. Just as the reaper consolidated the
                    functions of many individuals, the corporation consolidated the functions of numerous small shops.
                    The huge corporation, like the reaper, brought gains in efficiency and therefore lowered unit cost.
                    Moreover, Beveridge thought that these corporations could not be effectively dissolved. He
                    recognized that corporations occasionally abused their power, but he thought that these scattered
                    abuses could be curbed with little difficulty. The only agent which could, in his <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>For similar reasons, Beveridge acknowledged the necessity for labor to organize. He did not argue
                    that labor had to organize in order to do battle with capital. Class conflict was not for him a
                    pressing concern. He simply acknowledged that the new industrial system led naturally to labor
                    organizations. These were useful, he thought, as schools for self-government, mutual improvement,
                    and self-respect. How different these purposes were from those envisioned by Samuel Gompers, who saw
                    labor as an army.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Power, order, and efficiency, then, were qualities which Beveridge thought important in society. He
                    did not, however, envision a static society. How did he think society developed? What caused change
                    in history? Beveridge's answer was destiny—great irresistible forces drove human
                    society onward, and men had to conform to them. One aspect of destiny was the blood-instinct, the
                    racial genius which has already been touched upon. There were other forces too. One of these was
                    simply an ineluctable process of social maturation. Beveridge had a clearly anthropomorphic view of
                    society. Societies started as children, grew into youths, matured, and then declined into senility.
                    Social organisms, like life itself, obeyed the laws of growth. In this conception of society as an
                    organism he joined the Social Darwinists, who treated classes within a society and societies as a
                    whole simply as enlarged single organisms.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> In this type of organic society,
                    with natural laws of growth, Beveridge felt that the task of a political leader was simply to set
                    his nation on the path it ought naturally to follow. A mature nation should be expected <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Beveridge considered other factors important in historical change. Economic development was one, but
                    only one among many. Geography also was an important factor. Geography drove Russia east and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> west. Beveridge accurately predicted in 1903 that the two would soon clash.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In the same way, economic development and geography were forcing the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into the Pacific and the Caribbean.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Another force pushing this
                    nation to expand was the duty to civilize the barbaric nations of the world. Beveridge believed that
                    the civilized nations, having achieved social order, were not only justified in exporting order but
                    would betray their duty if they did not.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like Theodore Roosevelt, Beveridge believed that one of the ways in which these divine drives could
                    be fulfilled was by war. "We hearken not to rhymers on universal peace, for we know that
                    with the sword the world has ever out of error carved its good estate…. I subscribe to
                    the doctrine of war. It is the divine instrument of progress. Every lasting victory of human freedom
                    was won upon the field."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Beveridge agreed with Robert La Follette that most changes within a society ought to be planned
                    and worked out by experts. This point of view was partly an outgrowth of Beveridge's
                    respect for centralized and efficient power, for he pictured a commission of experts handing down
                    decisions which legislators and businessmen would be expected to follow. Partly too this view was a
                    result of Beveridge's confidence in destiny, for the experts would not determine policy

                    dispute. Beveridge praised the scientific method as employed in other countries: <placeName>

            <p>One of the major questions which all reformers have to face is that of the speed of change. Should
                    changes grow gradually out of past customs and institutions, or should these customs and
                    institutions be overturned to make room for new ones? Most people have, if not a consistent
                    philosophy, some sort of feeling for one approach or the other. In his first speech as a senator,
                    the speech urging the <placeName>

                    </placeName> to keep the Philippines, Beveridge argued for a great departure in American policy and
                    insisted that the nation should not be bound by the past. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should grasp destiny and ride it wherever it might go. He insisted that the founding
                    fathers had intended the nation to be imperialistic, but he made no attempt to disguise the fact
                    that he was urging a considerable departure. "The end of it all," he wrote in
                    1898, "is that here we are. This situation is upon us. We cannot step out of it as of an
                    old pair of shoes, and the thing for us to do is bear ourselves in the noble way that characterizes
                    the lordly blood of our imperial race."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge insisted, still speaking of America's overseas expansion, that the
                    nation's hands must not be tied by the past. New situations demanded new answers.
                    Circumstances often required the exercise of powers not specified in the Constitution. That document
                    was not made to freeze our institutions as they were in 1787. "The march of nationality is
                    not to be withstood; and so the salvation of the constitution is in its capacity for
                        growth."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> "It has long been clear to <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Beveridge remained fairly true to his idea of a destined development demanding new solutions which
                    nevertheless retained links with the past. Over the years, however, he changed his emphasis,
                    concentrating more and more on the links which each innovation had with the past. There may well be
                    a political explanation for this. As he became more identified with the insurgent wing of the
                    Republican party, he may have emphasized the conservative nature of his views in order to avoid
                    being tarred with a radical brush. As early as 1902 he was calling himself a conservative, but his
                    definition of that term was a loose one indeed. Conservatism simply meant change without
                        violence.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1906 Beveridge was clearly emphasizing the conservative nature of the reforms he had supported. He
                    said that regulation of business must be worked out gradually as the situation developed. He
                    insisted that laws such as the Hepburn Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act were simply natural
                    products of a changing situation, not new social experiments.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conflict between conservatives and nonconservatives is closely related to a conflict over the
                    importance of ideas to society. Conservatives think that innovations should grow naturally out of
                    the past. They accuse nonconservatives of relying too heavily on ideas as generators of change.
                    Beveridge said that "public policies are wise only as they express a people's
                    development. This is why most of the plans of reformers fail, why most of the theories of dreamers
                    are idle. They are born of some individual's thought…. "<hi rend="sup">44</hi> In spite of the fact that he himself later became a recognized scholar and biographer,
                    his contempt for theorizers and bookish men was complete in these years. About the only books he
                    said were of any importance were the Bible, Shakespeare's works, and the writings of Bobby
                    Burns—of all people. Going to <list type="footnotes">

                    could, because college would instill habits of hard work and order which would be useful later on.
                    "The fourth quality in character," he wrote, "the lowest on the list is
                    Intellect." Brains were abundant, he insisted; successful men could hire brains.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Beveridge thought that books were merely secondhand experience. Firsthand
                    experience and action were much more important. In 1898 he wrote: "As to Gladstone himself,
                    I cannot agree with you as to his greatness. He did not ‘do things.’ He
                    talked…. Give me the men who <hi rend="i">‘do
                        things.’</hi>"<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a sense the denigration of intellect, which Beveridge himself would probably have repudiated in
                    later years, stands in contradiction to his belief that problems should be solved by experts. He
                    probably regarded experts, however, not as theorizers or men of intellect but as technicians dealing
                    with specific down-to-earth problems.</p>
            <p>Beveridge's respect for men who <hi rend="i">"‘do
                        things’"</hi> led him at first to equate achievement with moral excellence,
                    and wealth with achievement. Before he became senator, and during the first years of his senatorial
                    career, he extolled wealth as synonomous with excellence. In a statement supporting Benjamin
                    Harrison and the Republican party in 1892, Beveridge said, "Every step toward plenty and
                    comfort is a step toward civilization. Every step toward want and misery and endless toil is a step
                    toward barbarism."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> In his speeches for the 1892, 1894, and 1896
                    campaigns, he consistently equated prosperity and wealth with virtue. In arguing for imperialism, he
                    insisted that commerce was a method by which the savages could be civilized. Throughout his book,
                        <hi rend="i">The Young Man and the World,</hi> he equated financial success with excellence. He
                    extolled the career of Thomas R. Scott, president of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>About 1906, statements began to appear in Beveridge's speeches and writings damning
                    commercial standards. Perhaps he became disillusioned with material standards, but no evidence has
                    been discovered of any soul searching on the subject nor even any evidence that Beveridge was aware
                    of contradicting himself. As early as 1906 he hoped that "financial interests"
                    would no longer be our national ideal.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> By 1910 he insisted that "the
                    curse of our present day is greed. We measure everything by dollars. We worship wealth."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> His keynote speech at the Bull Moose convention in 1912 was interlaced with
                    standard Progressive rhetoric against wealth.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps this shift in emphasis also has a political explanation. In the rising tide of Progressive
                    sentiment in the country, Beveridge may have seen a means for fulfillment of his own personal
                    ambitions. The Indiana Senator aimed at nothing less than the peak of political power. Perhaps most
                    politicians aim for the presidency, but Beveridge seemed to think that destiny would be shirking her
                    duty if she did not place him in the White House. His political rise had been rapid, but his egotism
                    grew even more rapidly. As a freshman senator he wanted a subcommittee chairmanship. He made a major
                    policy address almost as soon as he had taken his seat. This speech irritated his Senate colleagues,
                    but received enough national attention to fire his already heated ambition.</p>
            <p>By 1900 he was perhaps envisioning himself as a successor to William McKinley in 1904. He wrote, with
                    more optimism than good judgment, that "things are simply perfect here. I am in the inner
                    inside circle…" Then he spoke jubilantly of the formation of several Beveridge
                    for President clubs.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> After having been in public office for only <list type="footnotes">

                        <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post,</hi> that his Philippine speech had received great support
                    in the South, and that he, Beveridge, might be the man to bring some southern strength to the
                    Republican party.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> He wrote of this southern support to one of his friends and
                    said that he would be very glad if he could "inspire [respect] in that finest and most
                    unadulterated of the Anglo-Saxon race."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps Beveridge's self-esteem should not be too harshly criticized, for it was not hidden
                    by hypocritical modesty. It was like the simple egotism of a child who has no doubt that he is the
                    precise center of the universe. "I have done some mighty big things over simply incredible
                    obstacles, and I think before you get through these ought to be recognized," he wrote to
                    his friend, David Graham Phillips, in 1908.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what extent was Beveridge a Progressive in the sense of consistently favoring national control of
                    big business, social welfare legislation, and more direct popular influence on legislation? His
                    record was not so much one of slow growth toward Progressivism as of sudden conversion. In the
                    1890's Beveridge's speeches were standard Republican oratory. He waved the bloody
                    shirt with the best, praised prosperity and McKinley, wanted a high protective tariff, and damned
                    the Democrats. In the early years of the new century he extolled everything American, and as late as
                    1904 he entitled a speech "All is Well with the Republic" which was a hymn to
                    everything as it was.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> These sentiments stand in sharp contrast to those of
                    Robert La Follette, who from 1892 on saw impending doom unless basic changes were made in the
                    nation.</p>
            <p>Soon after the 1904 election, Beveridge had changed his views. By 1906 he could say that the
                    Republican party "must not stop." We must turn to these new social and economic
                    questions which have to do with the daily lives and happiness <list type="footnotes">

                    David Graham Phillips about Roosevelt's endorsement of radicalism in the inheritance
                        tax.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> In 1908, using language much like that of La Follette, he wrote to
                    the President: "I dislike legislation which gives people the impression that something very
                    much worthwhile has been done, when as a matter of fact very little has been done."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> In 1910 and 1911 Beveridge was arguing for more direct popular influence in
                    government and insisting that business and special interests must get out of government and let the
                    people rule.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1912 Beveridge was in the forefront of Progressivism. He was convinced that he had failed to be
                    re-elected in 1910 not because he had been too progressive but because the Republican party had not
                    been progressive enough.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> He felt that the only way to recoup his losses was to
                    continue as a vigorous Progressive, at least for the time being.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> He supported
                    Roosevelt in 1912 and delivered the keynote speech at the Bull Moose convention which endorsed woman
                    suffrage, initiative and referendum, and a host of social welfare and business control measures.</p>
            <p>All this is not to say that Beveridge was a complete hypocrite. Opportunism in some degree is a
                    necessity in politics. Moreover, his ambition drove him to assume whatever political posture he
                    thought could win elections, and he seems to have believed in whatever posture he assumed. More than
                    this, however, his basic social attitudes, like those of Theodore Roosevelt, were adaptable to the
                    needs of reform in the first years of the twentieth century. Before 1904 Beveridge had not shown any
                    great awareness of social ills, but he had shown enthusiasm for centralized, efficient power. <list type="footnotes">

                    Progressive thought considered centralized power the most useful tool for social reform. It was here
                    that Beveridge found his political home.</p>
            <p>Here then was a man who worshiped power, felt a mystical sense of racial and national destiny,
                    gloried in war and material success, and favored centralization of government. A quarter of a
                    century later similar ideas made themselves felt in <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> under Fascism. Does this mean that Beveridge was a Fascist, just a few decades ahead of
                    his time. Certainly there were facets of his thought similar to the ideas of Benito Mussolini and
                    Adolf Hitler, but there was one feature of his thinking which must forever rescue him from charges
                    of Fascism. This was his quiet, unquestioning faith in the Anglo-American democratic process. No
                    matter what his ambition or what his conception of destiny, he was dipped so deeply in
                    representative democracy that, even in defeat, he never considered abandoning it. At another time,
                    in another place, Beveridge's high regard for power and order might have led him in another
                    direction. During the first decade of the twentieth century in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, it led him to Progressivism. Beveridge was not following reform, however, so much as
                    power.</p>

                    </placeName> were confused and frustrated by the increasing sectional bitterness that threatened to
                    divide the nation. After Fort Sumter, however, people who had not understood the threat of secession
                    or who could not believe that a civil war was close at hand had reacted to the outbreak of the war
                    with enthusiasm, patriotism, and determination to save the Union.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Men

            <p>During the year 1861 forces released by war became noticeable. Following the Bull Run disaster (July,

                    </placeName>, but there was also strong partisan reaction to peace meetings held in adjacent
                    communities; and war hysteria and intolerance influenced some people. Rising demand for army wagons
                    brought prosperity to the village. Factories worked at full capacity, while increased demand for
                    foodstuffs raised the income of farmers. Inflation increased the hardship of the poor and of the
                    soldiers' families. Gambling, drinking, and other forms of vice were more in evidence than
                    formerly. The numbers of men volunteering for new regiments being formed in northern Indiana
                    remained steady. Casualties on the battle fronts had touched few from the village; one
                    man—Robert Boyd—had died from disease in western <placeName>

                    had been sobered by developments during 1861, and there was little "flag waving"
                    patriotism. As the year 1862 opened, however, there was a feeling of optimism among the citizens

            <p>The next day citizens gathered at the town hall to decide how they could help their sick and wounded
                    men, and finally after much discussion definite plans were made. It was agreed that someone from the
                    village should be sent at once to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he could ascertain what home folks could do for the men and while there arrange

                    </placeName> casualties sent home for burial. Two committees were formed: one to raise money for
                    medicines and supplies, and another to make arrangements to receive the bodies of the dead and to
                    make preparations for their burial in the village cemetery. Two hundred dollars were subscribed by
                    citizens, and George Milburn was chosen to visit the men at <placeName>

            <p>Milburn was a resourceful and energetic man, and he completed the task assigned by his fellow
                    townsmen. While away from the village, he kept home folks informed by letters, which were published

                    when the adopted Hoosier wrote his letter. Repeated frictions had arisen between <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and the central government because the Georgians thought the <placeName>

                    </placeName> ceded her western lands, the boundaries of the state were set, and the Indians were to
                    relinquish title to their lands in the state. Difficulties with the Creeks had not been entirely
                    resolved when the Cherokee problem became acute. In 1829 the boundaries of <placeName>

                    </placeName> were extended to include the Cherokee who had set up their own
                    "independent" state. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> asserted its authority to handle relations with the tribe, but in December, 1830, the <placeName>

                    and securing a license from the state. A decision of the Supreme Court against the Cherokee chief
                    was followed by the arrest of a number of missionaries and gold diggers in the area in March, 1831.
                    Release on a technicality was followed by re-arrest in July, 1831, and quick conviction by the jury

                        <salute>Sir,</salute>
                        <p>I have, in common with thousands of my fellow citizens, looked forward to the present
                                    state of things, in our widely extended Republick, as being fraught with the most
                                    dangerous consequences to the liberty of our people, the greatest guarrantee [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] whereof is the Union of the States. The ordinance of the
                                    Nullifiers of South-Carolina, leaves it no longer a matter of doubt or speculation
                                    as to the course she is ultimately to take, upon the all absorbing question of the
                                        <hi rend="i">Tariff.</hi> Under such an exciting occasion, it is necessary that
                                    the friends of Union, and mutual concession, should remove every obstacle to a
                                    successful [yet bloodless) [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] resistence [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of the destructive principle of Nullification. It cannot have escaped
                                    your notice, that, the uncompromising Opposition to the present administration,
                                    attempt, in their efforts to clog the wheels of the government, to identify <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                                    </placeName> with South-Carolina—differing only as to the facts, and not
                                    in principle. This being true, and the occasion having passed away, when it was
                                    esteemed by a certain party<hi rend="sup">4</hi> necessary to keep up an incitement
                                    in relation to the Indian question, may I not, as an american citizen, feeling a
                                    deep interest in the perpetuity of our institutions, ask your Excellency, whether a
                                    pardon extended to the missionaries would not remove a difficulty, which in the
                                    estimation of many will be a clog upon the course of the executive in resisting the
                                    efforts of S. Carolina to abolish the Tariff laws? That the president entertains

                                    down by him, in his Indian policy cannot be doubted, and therefore this single act
                                    of clemency, will, as it seems to me, in no wise prejudice your state upon the
                                    "main question."— I do not speak upon this subject,
                                    without sympathizing with the South, and desiring a modification of those laws,
                                    which operate oppressively upon her citizens. I am a native of South-Carolina, and
                                    that state contains the bones of my mother—and my feelings are averse to
                                    treading her soil with arms in my hands— Nothing but duty would compel me
                                    to such a course—and I gladly afford my humble efforts, in every mode
                                    that I am led to believe will conduce to the restoration of harmony.— The

                                    his friends force him to incur the fearful responsibility on either side? Is the
                                    Union of no more value than to be put to hazard on such slight grounds? May I

                                    feelings—one who desires an equal participation in the blessings of

                                    consider well, whether an act of clemency towards the misguided persons whose
                                    imprison[m]ent by your state authorities, has caused so much excitement, would not
                                    be a measure productive of much good, and avoiding at the same time an alternative

            <p>Louis Jolliet received minor orders in the Society of Jesus in 1662 at the age of seventeen as a
                    protégé of Bishop Laval. He became a trader to the Indians, but continued to
                    serve the church as organist of the Cathedral of Notre Dame at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quebec</settlement>
                    </placeName> while also serving his government as an explorer and hydrographer. When Intendant Talon
                    and Governor Frontenac wished to expedite the plans of Louis XIV's minister Colbert for an
                    expanded colonial empire, they selected Jolliet to secure authoritative information of the country
                    beyond the Great Lakes, from which vague and contradictory rumors had come to Lalemont, Menard,
                    Allouez, Dablon, and Marquette of a River of the West, of the chimerical Northwest Passage, and of a
                    River of the South. Jolliet combined reliability and loyalty with the necessary technical skills and
                    experience with wilderness life. His early Jesuit training and friendships in that aggressive order
                    made his leadership acceptable to the church, while his lay position ensured the government
                    paramount control of the expedition.</p>
            <p>The expedition descended the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> in 1673 until it was certain the
                    waters flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, where Spanish hospitality was uncertain. Marquette returned
                    to the St. Xavier mission on Green Bay, while Jolliet spent the winter expanding his journals and
                    maps at the trading post at Sault Ste. Marie. His original documents and his companions were lost in
                    the <geogName>Ottawa River</geogName> rapids near Montreal as he returned in the spring of 1674. The
                    copies he had left at Sault Ste. Marie were destroyed when the post was burned after his departure
                    for Montreal. Jolliet gave an oral report to Frontenac and prepared a map and report from memory,
                    but historians have relied on the journal, supposedly Marquette's, which Dablon constructed
                    from Marquette's report to his superior and from Jolliet's reconstructed account.
                    The loss of Jolliet's original journal has resulted in conflicting views on the relative
                    importance of the leadership of Marquette and Jolliet, the possible dominance of Jesuit influence
                    and plans for the future development of the western lands, and the rivalry between that religious
                    order and the colonial authorities.</p>
            <p>Jolliet later explored the English penetration of the James Bay area, established a small Indian
                    trading empire based at his Anticosta Island grant from the government, and began to explore and map
                    the southern coast of Labrador. He was commissioned royal hydrographer of the colony, and he taught
                    classes in map making. As he returned to his Anticosta post in the spring of 1700 his ship was lost
                    in the St. Lawrence.</p>
            <p>The author has constructed a rapidly moving tale from the authenticated facts of Jolliet's
                    life. She has made excellent use of the sources, but obviously prefers the Jesuit emphasis of Dablon
                    and Delanglez to the research conclusions of Steck. Miss Eifert has no <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-058-2-072"/> good words for La Salle, who "didn't even know how to
                    follow a compass" (p. 65), and only slight praise for Governor Frontenac. There is
                    occasional recourse to those all-inclusive words of the historical novelist:
                    "probably," "may have," and "must have," with
                    which gaps between fragments of historical evidence are bridged; but the teacher who uses this book
                    as a proper device in junior or senior high school for the development of historical understanding
                    can congratulate Miss Eifert on using these words sparingly and wisely. He can also congratulate her
                    on the fact that the personality of Louis Jolliet emerges with such attractive qualities. Miss
                    Eifert reanimates the intimacies of the Jolliet family, and the result is a pleasing book which
                    should be a useful addition to the public or school library.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Jonathan Hale Farm</hi> is a delightful and informative volume to read. Opening
                    chapters tell of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    </placeName> and of early years in this area. The main emphasis, however, concerns the life and
                    labors of the Jonathan Hale family and their neighbors in the <geogName>Cuyahoga Valley</geogName>
                    south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

                    </placeName> in 1810 until his death in 1854. Contemporary source material is used to describe
                    difficulties and perils encountered by the Hales and others in making the slow and laborious trip
                    from <placeName>

                        Valley</geogName>, their slow and then more rapid improvement of living conditions, the impact
                    of improved transportation, the evolution from barter to an economy based mainly on money, the
                    beginnings of culture, and the almost endless toil and labor required of early settlers.</p>
            <p>The Hales and other pioneers "developed" the <geogName>Cuyahoga Valley</geogName>
                    from its "underdeveloped" status into an area with a productive economy in a
                    remarkably short period of time. If we had a number of similar histories of additional families who
                    settled in the pioneer Midwest, our knowledge and understanding of pioneer life and what pioneering
                    involved would be significantly increased. Such studies would help test and evaluate ideas and
                    generalizations regarding early economic development, the genesis of culture, rural versus urban
                    influences, the impact of the frontier on the life of the pioneers, the relationship between
                    improvement in transportation facilities and general economic progress, and so on. <hi rend="i">The
                        Jonathan Hale Farm,</hi> for instance, suggests that economic development came from both private
                    and governmental efforts, that the frontier in various subtle ways made the Hales something more
                    than merely transplanted Yankees, and that development of transportation facilities was basic to
                    economic progress, with its resulting cultural life.</p>
            <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-058-2-073"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Jonathan Hale Farm</hi> supports the view that succeeding generations owe much to
                    their pioneer heritage. Moreover, it clearly indicates that the Hales and their neighbors were
                    generally extremely eager to escape the "privations" and
                    "hardships" of pioneer life. The death of the first Mrs. Hale in 1829, many years
                    in advance of her husband's demise, vividly illustrates that pioneer life was even more
                    harsh and costly to women than to men. There is tragedy in the fact that the first Mrs. Hale lived
                    only a few years in the new brick house, completed in the twenties. Fortunately, the Jonathan Hale
                    Farm is now the Jonathan Hale Homestead, restored by the Western Reserve Historical Society and
                    recognized by Congress as a national historical site. Supported by a bequest from a
                    great-granddaughter of Jonathan Hale, Miss Clara Belle Ritchie, the homestead is now operated as a
                    museum to illustrate life in the <geogName>Cuyahoga Valley</geogName> in pioneer days. Such museums
                    are essential as an important means of explaining and interpreting the continuing debt of
                    midwesterners to their pioneer heritage.</p>

            <p>Lincoln has been examined in as many different ways as any human being who ever lived. His life and
                    all known facts surrounding it have been scrutinized. He has been the subject and, in some
                    instances, the victim of analysis and hypothesis. This volume has the merit of setting itself a
                    modest goal, and the author has the discipline to devote himself to the achievement of that goal.
                    Occasionally, as is true in so many works about Lincoln, the mystery of his greatness proves
                    overwhelming. The writer is tempted beyond resistance to write about the intriguing unknowns of
                    Lincoln in ways far afield from particular and announced aims. When Frank does this (and he has
                    resisted the temptation better than most), his writing takes on the aspect of a wry smile. It is as
                    though he were telling us that he is aware that he is leaving the path that he has set out for
                    himself because he cannot restrain his pen.</p>
            <p>A great man happened to be a lawyer. In what ways did his profession affect his life? In what ways
                    did it affect his thought and his decisions?</p>
            <p>There is first described the legal practice in which Lincoln participated. From the nature of his
                    practice, from the nature of the cases he handled, from the techniques which he used in handling the
                    cases, the author extrapolates certain generalities about the mind of the practitioner. Having
                    studied the practice and studied the mental set of the practitioner, the author moves boldly into
                    Lincoln's public life both before and during his presidency. Matters of common knowledge
                    among Lincoln lovers are examined from the peculiar point of view of the lawyer studying the lawyer.
                    The Lincoln-Douglas debates, the Emancipation Proclamation, and many other speeches and papers of
                    Lincoln are treated as cases prepared by a lawyer and shaped by his experience during twenty-five
                    years at the bar.</p>
            <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-058-2-074"/>
            <p>Many very interesting similarities between Lincoln handling a case and Lincoln handling a country are
                    pointed out. Lincoln's appeal to a jury or a judge becomes Lincoln's appeal to a
                    cabinet member or the country. For those having close acquaintance with the problems and techniques
                    of lawyers, this volume presents a unique series of analyses by way of analogy. The author tries to
                    show that Lincoln, who began his practice of law without formal training and with very little
                    training of any kind, grew in stature to become a man highly skilled in legal techniques and that he
                    embarked upon the affairs of the presidency with equally negligible preparation, but grew in skill
                    as a statesman in the same way he had grown in the skills of his profession.</p>
            <p>The appeal of the book is by its very nature limited, but even those without legal training or
                    special interest in law will find that the assembled facts and the reasoning presented add much to
                    their understanding of Lincoln.</p>

                    A. Graebner. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 1961. Pp. xii, 156. Readings, index. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>This volume consists of five essays presented originally in 1960 at a Civil War conference at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. The common theme is slavery's impact on American politics. Although
                    the five authors agree that slavery was at the heart of the sectional conflict and that emotionalism
                    was partly responsible for the crisis of 1860, they differ significantly in explaining how and why
                    the crisis came.</p>
            <p>Three focus attention on events that transpired in 1860. Robert W. Johannsen argues powerfully that
                    the breakup of the Democratic party at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which resulted from uncompromisable differences over the territorial question, sealed
                    the fate of the Union. Don E. Fehrenbacher and William E. Baringer turn to the Republican camp to
                    disclose the crisis. According to Fehrenbacher the choice of candidate and platform at the Wigwam in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was unacceptable to southerners because it portended the doom of their society. Thus
                    they left the Union "to hold back a future that appeared to have no place for
                    them" (p. 60). Baringer attributes the crisis to fiery campaign statements of Republican
                    editors and politicians; their words generated such anger and fear in the South that after
                    Lincoln's election—which in fact constituted nothing revolutionary in the
                    political and constitutional system—moderates failed to placate the southern mind, and
                    secessionist leaders, exploiting Republican threats, led their states out of the Union.</p>
            <p>Norman A. Graebner surveys the antislavery movement in American politics from 1840–1860
                    and advances a twofold explanation of the crisis of 1860. Southern secessionists pursued objectives
                    that could not be achieved within the political system, while northern antislavery leaders pursued
                    objectives that could not be achieved under the Constitution. The second half of this interpretation
                    challenges Fehrenbacher's argument, which cannot be easily discounted. Graebner himself
                    insists <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-058-2-075"/> that Republicans could not abandon their antislavery
                    program without destroying their political machine (p. 31). Why, in time, they could not have
                    implemented such a program is not adequately explained. Indeed, for antislavery leaders perhaps
                    Lincoln's election was a momentous step toward achieving in the political arena, under the
                    Constitution, the objectives they sought.</p>
            <p>Avery Craven stresses the disruptive pressures of inflammatory antislavery pronouncements and of
                    Republican determination to establish "<hi rend="i">the Modern World</hi> of Nationalism,
                    the Industrial Revolution, and Freedom" (p. 134). His stylistic, well-balanced essay
                    reflects mature thought, considered judgment, and compassionate understanding.</p>
            <p>The selective bibliography includes many of the best works on Civil War causation. In the future
                    similar bibliographies should contain this volume.</p>

            <p>The history of publishing and the publishing trade in the American Middle West offers a large and
                    heretofore little explored area for scholars interested in American cultural studies. With the
                    exception of scattered articles as well as space devoted to publishing in the Middle West in Ralph
                    L. Rusk's <hi rend="i">The Literature of the Middle Western Frontier</hi> (1925), W. H.
                    Venable's <hi rend="i">Beginnings of Literary Culture in the <geogName>Ohio
                        Valley</geogName>
               </hi> (1891), and R. Carlyle Buley's <hi rend="i">Old Northwest</hi>
                    (1950), however, almost nothing of a reliable nature has been written on this large area. Walter
                    Sutton's new book must stand as a "first" as an authoritative attempt to
                    review in thorough manner the history and function of the book trade centering in an important
                    middle western city during the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Professor Sutton's intention in writing his book may be seen in the Preface. Recognizing
                    there the need to tell the story of the careers of book publishers and sellers and of the impact of
                    their work upon the people who read their printed material, he sets about the "task of
                    rescuing these figures from obscurity and of retracing their activities … " (p.
                    vii). His retracing carries the reader through the development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "regional publishing industry from its pioneer beginnings, through
                    its periods of greatest importance, into its decline in the years following the Civil War"
                    (p. viii). In achieving that avowed task, the book chronicles, specifically, the forces leading to
                    and the development of the pioneer publishing industry, tells the story of the major publishing
                    houses, such as the houses of James, of Derby, and of Clarke, and, finally, describes the shift of
                    the book industry away from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the late nineteenth century and the reasons for that shift. Throughout, the
                    recounting is well supported in footnotes referring the reader to the available records of the
                    period: <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-058-2-076"/> newspaper files, editions of books actually printed
                    during the era, and historical, biographical, and statistical documents.</p>
            <p>One of the most important features of the work is a directory of publishers, booksellers and
                    auctioneers, bookbinders, music publishers and dealers, type founders, stereotypers, paper
                    manufacturers and dealers, wood and copperplate and steel-plate engravers, and lithographers, all in
                    an alphabetical listing which occurs at the back of the book. Such a directory will be of real value
                    as a handy guide to students and scholars of the publishing industry in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Because the purpose of Professor Button's work is so extensive and since his intention is to
                    deal essentially with the "book-trade," it has undoubtedly been necessary for him
                    to pass lightly over such important publications as the literary and religious periodicals of the
                    time. It would seem, nonetheless, that such a study as this ought to have had space dedicated,
                    particularly in the chapter entitled "Early Publications," to such important
                    periodicals as Flint's <hi rend="i">Western Review</hi> and Clarke's <hi rend="i">Western Messenger,</hi> that organ of the Unitarians which brought to the Middle West in the
                    late 1830's some of the most "transcendental" thinking of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> as well as poems by Emerson, Keats, and the minor poet Jones Very. Professor Sutton has
                    little more than mentioned the <hi rend="i">Western Review;</hi> and, if he has done the same for
                    the <hi rend="i">Western Messenger,</hi> this reader is not aware of the fact. Another limitation
                    occurs, also, in the inadequate index to the book. Of twenty names chosen at random, fourteen were
                    indexed.</p>
            <p>If we grant this minor limitation, as well as the practical omission of important literary and
                    religious periodicals from the study, we have left in <hi rend="i">The Western Book Trade</hi> an
                    accurate coverage of material, a vivid description of the growth and decline of an industry, an
                    excellent listing of publishers and their associates, and, best of all, an objective and intelligent
                    first achievement in an important area which has gone almost untouched by scholars.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1869, as Heinrich Schliemann saw it, was a commercially thriving town of forty
                    thousand, well-built, with streets as much as 120 feet wide, and "crossed by twelve
                    railroads." But he found it no cultural center. "The culture of the people is
                    merely superficial, and <hi rend="i">nobody</hi> understands me" (p. 36). The blue laws
                    were a nuisance; no good wine or beer were to be found. "Here in Indiana classical
                    education does not exist at all" (p. 26). But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not quite the nadir, even in Indiana. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> he found "an exceedingly tedious place, for if there is very little to occupy

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName>" (p. 20). His comments on the general assembly strike a familiar note:
                    "The representatives behave much like school-boys, all chewing and continually spitting;
                    many holding their legs continually on their desks before them and all putting the laws in the most
                    summary and wreckless <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-058-2-077"/> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] way….
                    I am glad to have got an insight into the doings of these people's legislative assemblies
                    which present Democracy in all its roughness and nudity, with all its party spirit…. I
                    often saw them throwing paper-balls at each other and even at the speaker." (pp.
                    18–19).</p>
            <p>But Dr. Schliemann was not in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for cultural purposes. He had come to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in March of 1869 to acquire American citizenship, which he thought would be helpful in
                    his archaeological dealings with the Greek and Turkish governments. He went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to get, as quickly and quietly as possible, a divorce from a Russian wife from whom he
                    had been separated for years. Indiana, he had discovered, had the most notoriously lax divorce laws
                    in the country. The three months he spent in the city were exactly the time required to establish
                    residence and get his decree.</p>
            <p>The present slim and handsome volume gives the fullest account to date of this little-known episode
                    in the life of the father of modern archaeology. Mr. Lilly has written two brief narrative chapters
                    on the life of Schliemann before and after his stay in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the heart of the book consists of excerpts from his diary from March 26 to July
                    18, 1869, and of selections from the ninety-seven letters he wrote to various correspondents from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or, later, to people in that city. These letters in four languages (translated in the
                    present volume) to correspondents in eight countries give a vivid impression of the range of
                    interests of this eccentric genius. In addition to the observations on American life, we find the
                    preliminary correspondence that led to his selecting his second, Greek, wife from photographs sent
                    him from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName>, correspondence relative to arrangements for the expedition that was to discover <placeName>

                    gambling at cards, a paper read before the Convention of American Philologians, schemes for reaching
                    the North Pole, and letters pertaining to a great many business transactions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lilly's little book gives us some welcome additions to the portrait of Heinrich
                    Schliemann, as well as penetrating and amusing views of ourselves (or our ancestors) through the
                    eyes of an intelligent foreign visitor. The research in the Schliemann Archives in the Gennadius

            <p>A war's impact on local communities far from actual combat is a proper subject for study.
                    Cavnes has made a real contribution to the series, <hi rend="i">Indiana in World War II.</hi> He has
                    not attempted to describe every <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-058-2-078"/> phase of Hoosier community life
                    in the war years but has selected a dozen topics such as boom towns, education, public health, care
                    for servicemen, housing, and race relations, since these are related to the war and its effects on
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>Most Hoosiers were poorly prepared to cope with the new situations as they arose. Sometimes they were
                    slow even to recognize a problem, as is well illustrated by the questions of housing, sanitation,
                    entertainment of Negro servicemen, and the appearance of teenage prostitutes. In other cases, while
                    aware of the problem, community leaders revealed ineptness, fear, or downright unwillingness to act,
                    as in the conduct of some recreational centers, organized vice in some cities, and employment of
                    Negro workers in the larger communities.</p>
            <p>The author is to be commended for his willingness to reveal Hoosier shortcomings as well as their
                    successes. It appears that in too many cases there was a desire to wait out the war; in a few cases
                    there was great reluctance to accept needed help from the outside; at times there were indications
                    of a desire to use war as an excuse for retrogression, as in the attitude of many toward child labor
                    legislation.</p>
            <p>Not all activities in Indiana during the war reflected unwillingness to act decisively. Some cities
                    and towns made remarkable progress in their handling of difficult situations. Teachers and school
                    administrators adjusted quickly and efficiently. Perhaps the greatest change in the field of
                    education was that in the colleges and universities. Young men and women in uniform, in virtually
                    all of the schools, were trained under programs set up by the armed forces; in most cases there was
                    a radical revision of curricula and a reduction in the time required for completion of studies.</p>
            <p>Much space is devoted to state and local care of the aged, the mentally ill, and inmates of
                    correctional institutions. Reluctantly, the reviewer finds that this part of the volume, though well
                    done, is related to the war in but one important respect: the distressing shortage of qualified
                    personnel arising out of the demands for men in the armed forces and in industry. The aged posed a
                    problem before the war. They became more numerous during the war, but war did not greatly affect the
                    problem of an aging population. Nor did war affect mental illness (among civilians) to any great
                    degree. War did influence the crime rate, as is well brought out in the excellent discussion of
                    juvenile delinquency. But, except as noted in regard to personnel, the Hoosier community at war was
                    little different from the same community in peacetime as far as penal institutions, the aged, and
                    the mentally ill were concerned.</p>
            <p>Some very important wartime activities are not described. Sacrifices on the part of rationing boards,
                    support of bond drives by Indiana cities, hardships imposed on manufacturers not engaged in
                    producing war materials—these are omitted. But the strong points of this book far
                    outweigh its short-comings. It is exceedingly well documented. Almost without exception, the sources
                    are primary; copious references are made to newspapers, correspondence, and official reports.</p>
            <p>As an historical record and as a blueprint for those Hoosiers who might wish to avoid making certain
                    mistakes in some future conflict, this book merits careful study.</p>

                    concise historical sketches of Mennonite and Amish congregations in Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The initial settlements in Indiana began in the northeastern portion of the state in
                    the 1830's and 1840's. Most of the Mennonites and Amish who came to Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, though a few arrived directly from Europe. The number of Mennonite and Amish settlers
                    in Indiana grew slowly, with a total of perhaps 750 members in 1860. Their Indiana total appears to
                    have been about 17,500 as of 1960. The totals for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> have always been much less than for Indiana. Indiana Amish and Mennonites have lived
                    mainly in the northeastern part of the state, especially in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange</region>
                    </placeName> counties.</p>
            <p>Family and congregational ties have generally been strong among Mennonites and Amish. On the other
                    hand, they have cooperated to give aid to schools, missionary and service projects, historical work
                    and publication ventures, relief efforts within and without their communion, youth work, and in
                    other ways. In fact, their efforts in such areas have been considerable in view of their limited
                    number. Such persons have often been conscientious objectors in time of war—from Civil
                    War days through World Wars I and II—but their service to their fellow men even amid
                    derision and persecution is perhaps less well understood.</p>
            <p>The reviewer found certain difficulties in reading this volume. First, it is hard to determine and
                    follow the main threads or developments within Mennonite-Amish elements—details obscure
                    the essential and general developments. Second, relationships between various Amish and Mennonite
                    groups are hard to follow, making it difficult to picture and understand these elements as a whole.</p>
            <p>Professor Wenger's volume is based on long-time research and intimate knowledge of Mennonite
                    and Amish origins. He gives his major emphasis to persons and groups associated with the "Indiana-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Mennonite Conference." Although the sources used are not usually precisely
                    pinpointed, they are substantial, and Wenger has apparently <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-058-2-080"/>
                    attempted to be accurate. He makes clear, however, that part of his information is approximate or
                    even "conjectural" (see p. 437). His history is obviously written in part to make
                    Mennonites and Amish more aware of as well as proud of their history and heritage.</p>

            <p>Professor Quarles, of Morgan State College, is one of those scholars in the field of Negro
                    historiography who is doing much to strengthen its foundations against perhaps understandable
                    tendencies toward self-serving formulations. The present writer, for example, has an interesting
                    pamphlet by a Negro slave defending slavery, but no plans for discussing it in print. Who would wish
                    to print it? Professor Quarles is alert to the need for objectivity and follows commendable
                    historical criteria. He identifies no person as a Negro on circumstantial evidence; only those
                    explicitly termed Negroes are so regarded. He does not seek materials necessarily displaying Negroes
                    in admirable situations. He has no occasion to note Negroes in ignominious circumstances, possibly
                    because their circumstances in the colonies <hi rend="i">were</hi> ignominious; but he freely
                    records their activities as predators, to be sure, largely under command of white Loyalists or
                    rebels.</p>
            <p>Indeed, one of this work's major themes is that Negroes served as freely with revolutionists
                    as with Loyalists. Their condition being what it was, their goal was less colonial victory than
                    whatever would augment their chances for freedom. They named themselves <hi rend="i">Liberty,
                        Freedom,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Free.</hi> But though Crispus Attucks was immortalized by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Massacre, and Negroes served at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Concord, their subsequent revolutionary careers were more complex than they were
                    during these two events.</p>
            <p>Patriots early adopted a policy of excluding Negroes from military ranks, especially in the South,
                    where their effect on slave morale was feared. Hence, Negroes responded to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s Royalist governor, Lord Dunmore, who sought to regiment them against their
                    masters. They served at Great Bridge, where Dunmore was defeated. Increasingly, revolutionary
                    leaders faced the fact that they needed the help of Negroes. Many Negroes served in northern forces:
                    an entire regiment at the Battle of <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>, though this is the one such unit identified. Hundreds of Negroes from Santo Domingo
                    participated in the unsuccessful siege of Savannah in 1779. Negroes were widely used as laborers, as
                    servants, as spies, informers, and notably as seamen and pilots. An interesting tale is their use in
                    connection with the system of substitutes for military service. A somewhat even less inspiring use
                    was made of Negroes as a supplement to land bounties for enlisted men. Negroes themselves were, in
                    the North, manumitted in exchange for military service, and the record of their cheerfulness and
                    desire to prove their title to regard is consistent. They served in all similar <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-058-2-081"/> capacities with the British, especially in the South with its large
                    Negro population. Professor Quarles holds firmly to the record, but permits himself a touch of irony
                    in citing British General Alexander Leslie as thinking the Negroes might perform "a last
                    service" in their often fatal sicknesses: "About 700 Negroes are come down
                        <geogName>the River</geogName> in the Small Pox. I shall distribute them about the Rebell
                    Plantations" (p. 142).</p>
            <p>The negotiations respecting Negroes following Yorktown casts an odd light on the libertarian
                    sentiments ordinarily associated with the event, though by and large Negroes gained by the
                    Revolution. The dispersal of Negroes to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state">East Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, the Caribbean countries, and Africa makes an interesting cosmopolitan tale. Professor
                    Quarles's thorough research and judicious handling of details adds much to previous
                    accounts of the subject. A critical bibliography would have been appreciated.</p>

            <p>Both <hi rend="i">The Twilight of Federalism</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Antifederalists</hi> challenge
                    widely held interpretations of key developments in the early national period of American history. As
                    the authors of these studies construct the history of the period, the Antifederalists in the late
                    1780's and the Federalists in the 1820's were fighting rear guard actions in
                    defense of what each conceived to be a benign political and social order. If Professor Main is
                    correct in assessing the Antifederalist platform as essentially democratic, it was this dynamic
                    element in the lost cause of 1788 that persisted through to victory over the champions of an ordered
                    society, organic in conception—the Federalists as Professor Livermore portrays them.
                    Strong arguments for the traditional aristocratic-democratic polarity of the period are presented.</p>
            <p>Livermore begins with the question: What became of the Federalists after the War of 1812? Were they
                    simply absorbed into the latter-day Jeffersonian party of the Bank, the navy, and protectionism?
                    Were they simply cast into oblivion only to reform under the National Republican and Whig banners?
                    Neither view is sustained. The Federalists, this study shows, continued to be a potent force in
                    American politics from 1815 to 1830, their quest for power a primary cause of the breakup of the
                    Republican party during Adams's administration and their support a major source of
                    Jacksonian strength.</p>
            <p>What may appear to be an orthodox political history is in reality a remarkably able synthesis of
                    social and political history. Leaning heavily upon his construction of the Federalist <hi rend="i">weltanschauung</hi>—their <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-058-2-082"/> deep suspicion of the
                    people's ability to rule themselves, their nostalgic longing to return to an organic social
                    order, and their death instinct—Professor Livermore pictures the struggle between
                    Federalists and Jeffersonians in terms pregnant with meaning for our own troubled society. The
                    underlying cause of Federalist failure, he believes, was a revolution in social thought which took
                    place between 1775 and 1825, the deep penetration of the Jeffersonian creed of individualism and an
                    atomistic society which ultimately replaced the concept of an ordered society which the Federalists
                    had tried to build on colonial foundations.</p>
            <p>Because of their talents, wealth, and prestige, however, the Federalists of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> and the middle states continued to appeal to large blocs of voters. The Federalists
                    were too disorganized to offer battle in national elections, but their very unwillingness to
                    disappear on the level of state politics confronted the feuding factions of the Democratic party
                    with Hobson's choice: to embrace Federalist support after the Hartford Convention was
                    repeatedly shown to be disastrous; yet not to encourage their support was to leave rivals free to
                    win in combination with them. The result was that in the deceitful maneuvering of the election of
                    1824 Federalists were courted vigorously by Crawford as well as Calhoun, by Jackson as well as
                    Adams. That Van Buren and company were able to lure more Federalists into Old Hickory's
                    camp by 1828 than Adams' managers reveals both the meaninglessness of shibboleths and the
                    manipulative skills of the Jacksonians, skills lacked by both Adams men and the Federalists
                    themselves in astonishing degree. As in the 1790's, so in the 1820's, the
                    Federalists found themselves at the mercy of others because of their contempt for the finer arts of
                    political organizing. Jacksonians held out appointments, and scores of Federalist leaders grasped at
                    the fruits which both <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> and Adams, despite appearances to the contrary, failed to deliver. The war on the Bank
                    laid foundations for a new two-party system, but a surprising number of Federalists found the
                    Jacksonian household welcome shelter.</p>
            <p>Professor Main's long-awaited study of the Confederation period also reveals that the price
                    of poor coordination is defeat. The Antifederalists failed because of the superior <hi rend="i">élan</hi> and organization of their opponents. With their failure in 1788, Main
                    concludes, the true federalism established under the Articles and the state governments of the
                    Revolutionary era was overthrown. The Antifederalists were outwitted and outmaneuvered, leaders
                    truly representative of the mass of Antifederalists were not elected to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention or to the state conventions, and the result was, in the author's
                    view, a defeat for democracy. By and large, the victorious Federalists were, as Beard insisted, men
                    of opulence, large property holders in contrast to the great majority of Antifederalists. It is also
                    highly significant, Professor Main points out, that Federalist spokesmen by contrast were men of
                    superior education. With all the refinements and research in depth that mark this study in
                    comparison with Beard's primitive analysis, Professor Main reaches conclusions not markedly
                    different on large issues. The division on adoption of the Constitution was not, however, between
                    personalty and realty interests, but between sections having access to navigation and outside
                    commerce and those that were <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-058-2-083"/> isolated and, to a great degree,
                    self-sufficient agrarian areas. Thus Orin G. Libby and Beard are, in this study, shown to be closer
                    to the truth about the overthrow of the Articles than such revisionists as Robert Brown and Forrest
                    McDonald.</p>
            <p>This is certain to be an explosive book, not only for its substantial agreement with the Beardian
                    diagnosis, but also because the author believes Progressive historians to have been right in
                    regarding class conflict as an essential feature of the history of the period. It becomes
                    increasingly apparent that consensus, if it is ever to be found, will rest largely upon some more
                    satisfactory definition of "class" than the economic orientation gives us. May the
                    insights of social history such as those used by Livermore not be of use in this arena also?</p>
            <p>That Professor Main is correct in maintaining that the Antifederalists were far more friendly to
                    popular checks upon government than the Federalists and that more poor men belonged on the
                    losers' side than on the winners' side may be granted without conceding that the
                    contending forces were classes in any sense acceptable to contemporary thought. Whether
                    Main's socio-geographic alignments will be accepted by experts in what is now an historical

               <hi rend="i">Cavalier and Yankee: The Old South and American National Character.</hi> By William
                    R. Taylor. (<placeName>

            <p>By the time of the Civil War, says Professor Taylor, Americans had come to look upon themselves as
                    constituting two distinct civilizations with different historical and racial origins. The
                    author's purpose is to discover "what social problems produced the need for this
                    kind of historical rationalization, … what kind of men and women contributed to its
                    growth and dissemination—what sort of mentality, in other words, created this legendary
                    past and this fictional sociology, and what sort of needs it satisfied" (p. 16). Taylor
                    undertook this study because of his conviction that the belief in separate cultures was an important
                    cause of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The author points out that Americans of the ante bellum period were intensely introspective, obsessed
                    with identifying and examining their national character. As this character—or rather,
                    characters—emerged, it proved to have disturbing flaws. The North did not like the image
                    it projected: the Yankee sharper, the product of a "grasping, soulless world of
                    business." So the North turned to the southern planter in an effort to find those desirable
                    qualities that the Yankee lacked. It also created a "Transcendent Yankee," who,
                    while superficially conforming to the unpleasant stereotype, turned out to be a noble, selfless,
                    nonmaterialistic being.</p>
            <p>There were many other tensions that elicited literary solutions. For example, both northerners and
                    southerners were concerned about <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-058-2-084"/> the danger to the family posed
                    by the feminist movement and by the extreme social mobility of the times. A major problem in the
                    older southern states was economic decline caused by soil exhaustion and competition from rich new
                    lands to the west. The plantation legend was used in an effort to resolve both problems. Woman,
                    enthroned as mistress of the plantation, became chief guardian of familial integrity. She was given
                    extensive authority and put on a pedestal by her worshiping Cavalier husband—substitutes
                    for the blandishments of feminism. At the same time the planter and his run-down plantation were
                    given a function that transcended mere economic success.</p>
            <p>These examples show how, in Taylor's view, ante bellum novelists tried to examine, resolve,
                    or sublimate the problems besetting American society. He draws his material from the lives and works
                    of William Wirt, James Fenimore Cooper, James K. Paulding, Sarah Hale, Beverly Tucker, William
                    Gilmore Simms, John Pendleton Kennedy, and others.</p>
            <p>The danger in attempting a difficult study of this kind is diffuseness, and this book is diffuse.
                    Each of the individual sketches is interesting and valuable. But taken all together they are too
                    long and contain far too many irrelevancies. Taylor's thesis is hard to follow, and so the
                    total effect of the book is weaker than it might have been. The summary "Epilogue"
                    is helpful, but cannot entirely repair the damage.</p>
            <p>Another defect of the book springs from Taylor's handling of the historical reality out of
                    which this fictional sociology grew. He sometimes makes disturbing assertions about ante bellum
                    America, especially about the South. For instance: "Those novels which give expression to
                    the racial theories of the Old South, the reiterated appeals to an English ancestry (even by those
                    without one) and the Cavalier ethos of war and honor best embody the aspirations and the sense of
                    destiny of Southern society as a whole" (p. 203). Here Taylor himself seems to have fallen
                    under the spell of the legend-makers. Such ideas more likely embodied the aspirations of only a
                    small segment of southern society, mainly the upper middle class, and only a part of that. Most
                    southern whites were small farmers who owned no slaves: tough, hard-bitten countrymen with the
                    earthy mores and ambitions of a section that was largely semifrontier. These men, the majority, had
                    no such inflated aspirations; they would have found the idea supremely funny.</p>
            <p>Other assumptions can be questioned. Was the South really the most expansionist part of the country?
                    Were the nonslaveholding whites, along with women and slaves, really in a subordinate position in
                    the South? And is it true that the division between North and South was psychological, not
                    geographical? Finally, to say that the Confederate government "was not essentially
                    different, even in its constitutional details, from the federal republic from which it had just
                    seceded" (p. 336) is to miss the point of forty years of controversy about the meaning of
                    the Constitution. In short, the persuasiveness of the connection Taylor tries to establish between
                    ante bellum fiction and ante bellum society is diminished because of the unsoundness of his
                    assumptions about the latter.</p>

                    interpretations of ante bellum history, and an attempt to prove too much too precisely.</p>

            <p>It is certainly true that diaries form some of our most colorful if not always our most accurate
                    sources of history. Given an intelligent, observant, and active participator in a certain period,
                    and his diary will be extremely useful to the historian. Add to these qualities the feelings,
                    recorded with utmost candor, of a mid-nineteenth-century country boy thrown into strange, often
                    terrifying circumstances, coupled with sometimes lighthearted sometimes grave jottings on love,
                    nature, pranks, and politics, and the general reader has an excellent account of a young <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> soldier in the western campaign of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1861, Owen J. Hopkins enlisted as a private in an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> infantry regiment at the age of seventeen. During the next three and a half years he
                    matured rapidly, traveled with his regiment to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> and back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, and rose to the grade of lieutenant. Thus he saw much of the Vicksburg campaign, a
                    period of both intense action and "killing inactivity," guard duty in a
                    "rebel" state, and administrative work in a regimental office. These experiences
                    are all related in a clear, vigorous manner which reflects admirably the spirit of the moment:
                    disgust with mud or red tape, helplessness at hunger or unforeseen trouble, hilarity at a victory in
                    his own or another sector of the war. Of all the various moods captured in the diary, however, two
                    stand paramount. The first, the strong feeling for his beloved Julia back in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, no doubt greatly influenced the second—his constant, serious patriotism
                    despite ribbings and hardship.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bond must have felt a thrill when he first discovered that in early attempts at sophistication
                    the diarist, his wife's father, acquired some mastery of French, for the editor is a

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His full Introduction, well-placed commentary, and numerous and useful footnotes show
                    the care and research which have gone into his task. This volume is no doubt a labor of love. Unlike
                    so many other books of this type, however, it is both a valuable and interesting contribution to the
                    literature of Yankee army life.</p>

                    of material now appearing on this period. Though limited to the activities of one state, and almost
                    comically proud of its localism, the volume's appeal is not to the inhabitants of <placeName>

                    </placeName> alone. The book is popularly written and, although reasonably well documented, is
                    obviously intended to present side lights and high points of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> citizens' participation in the war. The word "citizens" and
                    not "soldiers" must be employed, for the volume not only includes several civilian
                    exploits but also the adventures of Emma Edmonds, who, enlisting under male guise, must have shared
                    many of the same emotions as the somewhat better known Calamity Jane.</p>
            <p>The author, the book jacket informs us, is an experienced biographer, and this approach to history is
                    strikingly apparent in his sympathetic treatment of the people who appear in his tales. That he is

                    conflict. The concluding sentence of the last adventure best sounds the pitch of local patriotism in
                    which the book was written. "With Jefferson Davis safe in the custody of <placeName>

                    </placeName> State University, presents an orderly and interesting summary of pertinent historical
                    scholarship. Its abundant documentation will prove satisfying to the casual reader and should also
                    fulfill the author's hope of providing new insights and new inspiration for further
                    scholarly work to the serious student of American religious history.</p>
            <p>Weisenburger's present effort stands as a companion volume to his Ordeal of Faith: The
                    Crisis of Church-Going America, 1865–1900 (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, 1959). In contrast to the trials and tribulations detailed in the earlier volume, the
                    present work sets forth the positive contributions of the church to American life in the same
                    period—from the close of the Civil War to the dawn of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The author has chosen to avoid generalities and to present his case through specific illustrations
                    from the lives of hundreds of men and women, many of whom loomed as giants in the last generation of
                    the nineteenth century. Thus he begins with a penetrating analysis of brilliant and sophisticated
                    Henry Adams, from whose life religion had largely disappeared, but who confessed, nevertheless, the
                    belief that without the church the standards of the country would be those of <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-058-2-087"/> "tradesmen and Apaches." In contrast to Adams was
                    John M. Harlan, supreme court justice for thirty-four years, who was said to retire at night
                    "with one hand on the Constitution and the other on the Bible, safe and happy in perfect
                    faith in justice and righteousness" (p. 31).</p>
            <p>In twelve chapters limited to 212 pages Weisenburger has dealt with the great preachers of the
                    era—Beecher, Phillips Brooks, Moody, etc.—the faith expressed by the churches,
                    and its relevance in the lives of men. He has made the latter examination under such headings as
                    "Individual Integrity and Conscientiousness," "Decency in Civic and
                    Political Life," "Family and Sex Relationships," "Temperance and
                    Control," and "Efforts to Extend the Circle of Fellowship." The story of
                    the impetus furnished by the churches for social movements such as woman suffrage, prison reform,
                    Negro rights, and world peace is not undertaken here. One could wish that Professor Weisenburger
                    would extend his penetrating analysis to these fields, thereby expanding to a trilogy his treatment
                    of the church in this era of challenge. Certainly in the present volume he has succeeded admirably
                    in delineating the meaning of the church for people in a period of rapid urbanization when faith was
                    tested by the evolutionary hypothesis and the new biblical criticism.</p>

                        </placeName> History of American Civilization</hi> devotes a volume to each of the major
                    religious faiths of America. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis and Nathan Glazer wrote on Catholicism and
                    Judaism respectively, and now Winthrop S. Hudson, professor of the history of Christianity in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Colgate Divinity School, examines the past and contemporary role of Protestantism in
                    American life. He finds that the shaping Protestantism received in the Colonial period enabled it to
                    fashion a Protestant America in the course of the nineteenth century. In post-Protestant America, as
                    he calls the years since 1914, the influence of Protestantism visibly declined, partly because of
                    Catholic and Jewish competition but chiefly because of internal weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Throughout the volume Professor Hudson associates Protestant strength or weakness with denominational
                    structure and change—this with an insight and clarity that is truly illuminating. As
                    elaborated by the Independent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> divines the concept of denominationalism denied that the true Church of Christ could be
                    identified with any single ecclesiastical system. As this theory gained general acceptance it
                    justified religious diversity and religious freedom without impairing essential unity, which assumed
                    a Calvinist expression in the Colonial period and increasingly a Methodist orientation in the early
                    decades of the nineteenth century. This unified Protestantism, making extensive use of voluntary
                    societies, overcame irreligion and incipient barbarism <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-058-2-088"/> on the
                    expanding frontier and sought to reach the unchurched masses in the growing cities by
                    YMCA's, institutional churches, and other religio-social agencies.</p>
            <p>In this Protestant America that took shape the stress was on conversions, not on the passage of
                    "wholesome laws" to usher in a Christian society. More inexcusable, laissez-faire
                    philosophy was invested with divine sanction. But these shortcomings, in time partially overcome,
                    proved less damaging than the "theological erosion" which in post-Protestant
                    America severed the identity between the major old-line denominations (Congregational-Christian,
                    Presbyterian, Episcopal, Methodist, American Baptist, Disciples of Christ, etc.) and the symbols and
                    creeds of historic Protestantism. These denominations became community churches (in degree but
                    scarcely in kind different from "the world"), and their federational agent, the
                    National Council of Churches, preferred an ecumenical to a Protestant witness. Having lost their
                    identity, the old-line denominations have gained far fewer recruits than Adventist, Holiness, and
                    Fundamentalist denominations which with their uneasy allies in other churches, notably Lutheran and
                    Southern Baptist, constitute about half the numerical strength of present-day Protestantism. Hudson
                    thinks that a "neo-Fundamentalist" version of theological conservatism may in time
                    serve to revitalize and reunify American Protestantism.</p>
            <p>Professor Hudson's <hi rend="i">American Protestantism</hi> is a fine piece of historical
                    writing. True it is that he glorifies the past and depreciates the present, sees events in black or
                    white, and by minimizing the social gospel loses the enrichment that movement might bring to his
                    interpretation. But his handling of denominational realignments as affected by social and
                    theological currents is incisive and masterly.</p>

            <p>Professor Beers carefully analyzes the efforts of Robert Lansing to end rivalry between the <placeName>

                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> over Chinese questions. As counselor of the State Department, Lansing advised Secretary
                    of State Bryan and President Wilson concerning <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>'s seizure of German interests in <placeName>

                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. After accepting appointment as secretary of state in June, 1915, Lansing strove for a
                    settlement with <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>. With particular care Professor Beers discusses the Lansing-Ishii notes,
                    Lansing's negotiations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>

            <p>Of first importance in this book are the differing views on Far Eastern policy held by Wilson and
                    Lansing. Believing the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> morally obligated to help <placeName>

                    </placeName> attain a better way of life, the President hoped that American missionaries and
                    businessmen could spread Christianity and democratic ideas in that country. Wilson <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-058-2-089"/> recognized <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>'s potential value as a market and as an ally, but these mundane objectives
                    were not uppermost in his mind: he sincerely believed that uplifting the Chinese people was the
                    principal reason for American interest in their affairs. When he became aware that Japanese
                    aspirations threatened <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> with domination, he tended to assume inflexible attitudes toward those aspirations. He
                    thought that <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> in statements supporting the Open Door had pledged not to encroach upon Chinese
                    sovereignty. Lansing rarely disagreed openly with Wilson in regard to Far Eastern matters, but the
                    Secretary did not believe that <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> had renounced desire to extend her power and influence in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. While the Secretary sent <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> protests based on broad constructions of the Open Door, he thought it unwise for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to found her policy on such interpretations of that doctrine. He did not object
                    altogether to the President's moralistic approach to Sino-Japanese problems, but he was
                    convinced that the chief American objectives in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> should have been protection of American lives and business interests. Fearing that
                    excessively stern protests could cause <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> to embark upon more ambitious plans to dominate <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> or to cause her to desert her alliances, Lansing early came to believe that a bargain
                    partially satisfying Japanese demands was desirable. Occasionally Lansing's views gained
                    limited acceptance, but usually the Secretary found himself checked by the President or by
                    international factors beyond American control. Beers concludes that during the Wilson administration
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> missed opportunities to settle differences with <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> and that a settlement could have made possible "substantial American
                    accomplishments in East Asia" (p. 184).</p>
            <p>On occasion one may wish that Professor Beers had included more background material about some of the
                    problems which confronted Lansing, but this carefully written book is nevertheless a highly detailed
                    study. Based largely upon archival and manuscript material, this volume is an important addition to
                    the historiography of American diplomacy.</p>

            <p>Professor Winther's fat volume lists 9,244 periodical, magazine, and journal articles
                    printed between 1811 and 1957. All are classified by subject under alphabetized headings and
                    subheadings for ease of use. Thus a student seeking information on Indian agents has only to turn to
                    the section on "Indians" and the subsection on "Indian Agents"
                    to find twelve articles on his subject, ranging from an 1864 "Report of Commissioner of
                    Indian Affairs" in the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi> to a learned article on
                    "William Ewing, Agricultural Agent to the Indians" in a 1957 copy of <hi rend="i">Agricultural History.</hi> To assure even greater usefulness, a symbol indicates the nature of
                    each entry as journal or diary, official document, reminiscence, or article. An author index at the
                    end of the volume allows users to trace the publications of any writer quickly and accurately.</p>
            <p>Most of the periodicals used by Professor Winther in compiling his listings are professional

                    articles printed between 1811 and 1938. A comparison of these two editions reveals a sobering fact.
                    The 1942 edition contained 240 pages of text and listed 3,501 items; the 1961 edition runs to 564
                    pages and itemizes 9,244 articles. This means that in the nineteen years between 1938 and 1957
                    historians have produced no less than 5,743 articles on the trans-<placeName>

                    scholarship continues to accelerate at this rate, Professor Winther's next edition will
                    resemble the unabridged dictionary.</p>
            <p>The value of such bibliographical guides as this increases in direct proportion to the multiplication
                    of historical studies. No student of the West should think of launching any project without

            <p>The twelve essays in this book are the result of a conference held under the auspices of the Lilly
                    Foundation in 1959 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The aim of the conference was to explore possibilities for research in certain areas
                    of American cultural history which, it seemed to the participants, had received less attention than
                        <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-058-2-091"/> others and in which substantial new research remained to be
                    done. This volume is not intended to be a complete survey of the fields of cultural history and
                    their strengths and weaknesses in offering opportunity for research, nor even a compendium of
                    suggestions for the student of American life. It is, as the editor, Professor McDermott says,
                    "simply a statement of work to be done" (p. v). Limited to twelve areas, because
                    in a two-day conference it was felt that more could not be adequately discussed, the participants
                    dug rather deeply into those fields in which, as their essays amply show, enough work remains to
                    satisfy the most energetic researcher.</p>
            <p>The essays fall into three general groups. The first topic, immigration, is by no means exhausted as
                    a field for investigation, as Professors Cappon, McDermott, Blegen, and Peckham show. Lester Cappon
                    points out the possibilities which lie in a reassessment of the colonial period in relation to a
                    study of the components of early American culture and their influences. John McDermott, limiting his
                    remarks to a single group of settlers, the French in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>,
                    finds much still to be done with this group alone, not to mention similar nationality groups in the
                    same area. Theodore Blegen shows the still untapped potential of the study of areas, periods,
                    elements, and problems arising from old-world cultural transferences to the New World. Howard
                    Peckham discusses opportunities in the history of Indian-white relationships, still relatively
                    untouched from the point of view of the cultural historian, and of the promise of ethnohistory as a
                    scholarly field.</p>
            <p>The second group deals with research in four general areas of cultural history, each analyzed by a
                    specialist in the field. John T. Flanagan, speaking of unresolved issues in the study of midwestern
                    regional culture, suggests the need for texts, for studies of mining, lumbering, commerce, and
                    farming, and for the study of topics such as the character type in midwestern literature and the
                    role of the immigrant in the regional novel. Studies of the book trade, of publishers and publishing
                    houses, of printers and printing, of the economics of authorship—these are a few of the
                    areas, according to David Kaser, waiting for the researcher into the impact of the printed word on
                    American culture. Joseph Ewen, after a survey of things to be done on American science and
                    scientists, lists nearly forty scientists who worked on the American frontier and of whom little or
                    nothing is known! Despite the number of books written on American travel, Thomas Clark finds that,
                    by using travel literature as a base, the researcher may still usefully study such things as
                    population movements, orientation of foreign elements to American conditions, economic history, and
                    political relationships.</p>
            <p>Four additional essays, dealing with popular culture, education, folklore, the visual arts, and
                    American recreation, round out the collection. Professor Richard Dorson suggests the advantages of
                    folklore study for the cultural historian and indicates the tremendous amount of fresh sources of
                    folklore materials to be found in games, occupational stories, newspaper files, travel books, and so
                    on, David Mead, writing of individuals and institutions involved in promotion of popular culture,
                    shows how much the historian may yet do with the history of libraries, <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-058-2-092"/> museums, self-improvement associations, workingmen's projects,
                    oratory, pamphlets, lecture series, and even common school textbooks. Edgar Richardson, writing of
                    the relationships between the visual arts and cultural history, notes that among other deficiencies,
                    there exist no adequate studies of American caricature and cartooning, of collectors and collecting,
                    or even of American sculpture. Philip Jordan finds much the same situation in regard to American
                    sports and recreation; music, theater, organized group sports, and such favorite American pastimes
                    as gambling and card playing have as yet received little attention from the historical researcher.</p>
            <p>Besides being packed full of ideas and information, the collection succeeds admirably in doing what
                    it set out to do, that is, to offer suggestions for profitable research in certain selected areas of
                    American cultural history. One should judge, in fact, that there must be a thousand suggestions here
                    that any alert and enterprising scholar might pursue, and about half that many usable thesis topics
                    for the imaginative graduate student. As an indication of the great potential offered by this kind
                    of discussion of American historical research, the conference was clearly a success; we could use
                    many more of them.</p>

            <p>Now in its twenty-ninth year of operation, the <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority has
                    become an American institution. For many, however, federal development of water power resources
                    continues to be a controversial question. As one peruses magazines and newspapers he still finds
                    articles attacking the TVA or defending it. Within the past decade a number of important works have
                    appeared which chronicle the early years of the <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority.
                    Among these works are Roscoe Martin's <hi rend="i">TVA, The First Twenty Years,</hi> Judson
                    King's <hi rend="i">The Conservation Fight: From Theodore Roosevelt to the
                            <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority,</hi> and David Cushman Coyle's <hi rend="i">Conservation.</hi> Each of these contains a brief discussion of the Muscle Shoals
                    controversy, but Preston Hubbard's book furnishes the first detailed description of this
                    important landmark in American history. The volume is an outgrowth of a doctoral dissertation
                    submitted in 1955 to the history faculty of Vanderbilt University. It constitutes the most
                    comprehensive treatment of the struggle which eventually resulted in the establishment of the
                        <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority.</p>
            <p>History has its congruities. Demobilization following each of our major wars has been fraught with
                    the question of how to dispose of war materiel and government properties which have come into being
                    during hostilities. Following World War I the problem arose of what to do with the nitrate plant at
                    Muscle Shoals, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, which had been built for the production of explosives. Certainly part of the
                    controversy involved the issue of whether the production of cheap fertilizer should be the most
                    important objective of peacetime development of <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-058-2-093"/> Tennessee River
                    resources or whether the energy of the river should be utilized primarily for generation of electric
                    power. Yet the most important issue concerned the question of who was to control and develop the
                    available resources—the federal government or private enterprise. Contenders for private
                    development who wished to operate the plant at Muscle Shoals were Henry Ford, the American Cyanamid
                    Company, and a combine of power companies.</p>
            <p>Hubbard's account is a fascinating review of the activities of Ford and the American
                    Cyanamid interests in relation to Muscle Shoals and their efforts to circumvent the regulatory
                    aspects of the Federal Water Power Act. The protagonist of federal ownership, operation, and control
                    of water power resources is Senator George W. Norris, Republican liberal of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>. He is depicted as the leading advocate of federal development of the
                        <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. Norris proposed development of the <geogName>Tennessee
                        River</geogName> basin by the federal government both for the provision of electricity to the
                    people of the valley and for experimentation in the most inexpensive methods of producing
                    fertilizer. The position of proponents of the Norris plan was strengthened by the economic
                    depression of 1929, and Norris' program was assured of success with the election of
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.</p>
            <p>Hubbard's book constitutes a well-organized discussion of TVA history and reflects a good
                    deal of attention to scholarship and style. The reader interested in the author's sources
                    is spared the inconvenience of turning to the back of the book since footnotes appear at the bottom
                    of each page. An extensive bibliography is provided and bespeaks thorough research in primary
                    material. The list of secondary publications, however, is by no means exhaustive nor does it include
                    a single book published since 1950, although a number of significant works on TVA and related
                    history have been published in the last decade. Thus, one does not find the works of David
                    Lilienthal, Roscoe Martin, or the last publications of Judson King and Gifford Pinchot, to mention
                    but a few.</p>
            <p>Surely one of the handicaps which future generations will encounter in assessing conservation and TVA
                    history will be its one-sidedness. It is apparent that to a very large extent sources available to
                    the historian of the conservation fight are expressions of advocates of public ownership, operation,
                    and regulation. One finds relatively few publications defending private ownership and control in the
                    bibliographies of the early and more recent accounts. In TVA literature of the last ten years one is
                    hard put to discover a single volume which is pro-private ownership of the nation's water
                    power resources or, indeed, a volume on the history of the power controversy which is a defense of
                    private power interests. No doubt some will take this dearth as proof positive of the Tightness of
                    the public power cause and the wrongness of the private power interests. Yet such a circumstance is
                    not always the proper basis for such a judgment.</p>
            <p>Preston Hubbard came by his interest in the TVA honestly, for he was born in Winfield, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>

                    having acquired the necessary professional qualifications. He is currently serving as professor of

                    history. Professor Hubbard is to be commended for the writing of such a contribution and Vanderbilt

                    $3.75 per volume.) These two volumes provide supplementary readings for basic courses in
                    American history. "The collection as a whole undertakes to present the newer viewpoints in
                    American history. All too frequently the textbook is based on approaches that have to be
                    substantially modified if not altogether discarded. The selections in this book, on the other hand,
                    date almost entirely from 1945—for the greater part, indeed, from 1950. They constitute
                    in this way an anthology of American historical writing since World War II. They indicate the newer
                    directions of American historical thought" (Vol. I, p. v). For the purposes indicated this
                    collection is extremely useful, and it merits careful consideration by teachers of introductory
                    courses in American history. It is, however, important to remember that much which is said to be new
                    is not really new, while much that is new is not actually better than previous writings. Moreover,
                    important as it is for students to be aware of changing viewpoints and interpretations in both
                    recent and previous scholarship, it is at least equally important for teachers and students alike to
                    know and understand the basic facts about important topics and questions in American history. In
                    historical study at least, effective evaluation of viewpoints, new or old, requires much knowledge
                    and considerable understanding of how facts are weighed, how facts differ from opinions, why
                    "final" and unqualified answers are seldom available to numerous questions. The
                    selections in these volumes are drawn from recent books, the proceedings of various organizations,
                    from historical and other journals, etc. They are complete rather than abridged selections. Both the
                        <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Mississippi Valley Historical
                        Review</hi> are among the historical magazines quoted, but the number of selections from these
                    outstanding journals is less than that taken from regional, state, and specialized journals.
                    Included among the latter are the <hi rend="i">William and Mary Quarterly, the Journal of Economic

                    volume includes eleven essays in honor of Theodore C. Blegen by ten different authors. Collectively
                    they offer considerable comment regarding the history of immigration in America, the image emigrants

                    which accompanied immigration, problems concerning immigration history, and the like—all
                    with something more than a normal Scandinavian accent or emphasis. In the closing essay, Dean Blegen

                    current status of publications concerning immigration to this country and related topics. Even so,
                    it must be used with care, for the essays are sprinkled with opinions which the unwary reader may be
                    inclined to accept as fact. For instance, in contrasting <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> and southern elements in the Middle West, Philip D. Jordan writes: "The Yankee
                    was aggressive and hard working, and the Uplander [southerner] was passive and shiftless"
                    (p. 75). Indiana's pioneers were mainly these "passive and shiftless"
                    southerners who cleared an amazing amount of land with simple tools and probably accomplished more
                    physical labor than any succeeding generation of Hoosiers, Yankees or otherwise. In fact, these same
                    "passive and shiftless" southerners pretty well established civilization in

                    is the product of the Conference on the Research Function of the University Bureaus and Institutes
                    for Government-Related Research, held at <placeName>

                    </placeName>], August 17–28, 1959." The conference, and thus the papers
                    constituting this volume, reviewed the origin and historical development of university bureaus and
                    institutes concerned with governmental research, discussed various areas of research in which
                    bureaus and institutes have been involved, considered problems concerning research programs, and
                    methods used, etc. University research bureaus and institutes are mainly a product of the period
                    since World War I. Their beginnings appear to have been closely associated with both the emerging
                    university extension movement and the political ferment associated with the Progressive era.
                    According to Amin Alimard's historical sketch of university bureaus involved in
                    governmental research, "The beginning of the University Bureau movement may be set as 1909.
                    This was the year the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> established a Municipal Reference Bureau in its extension division" (p. 3).
                    University research bureaus and institutes devote much of their emphasis to research concerning
                    state and local politics and government. Research in these areas is much needed, but universities
                    generally will have to eschew partisan politics and political expediency more than some have to date
                    if they hope to achieve worthwhile results based on research which is honest, nonpartisan, and of
                    maximum usefulness.</p>

                    extensive and helpful annotated list of midwestern travel accounts for the years,
                    1634–1850. An introductory chapter discusses travel literature and includes a general
                    bibliography concerning such literature. Hubach indicates that travel narratives took various forms,
                    were written for various reasons, and had varying degrees of reliability. By organizing his listings
                    principally on a chronological basis, he gives desirable emphasis to accounts written by Frenchmen,
                    the earliest European visitors to the area. The bulk of the accounts listed, however, were written
                    during the period following the American Revolution, especially during the initial half of the
                    nineteenth century. Hubach offers useful information about the items included in his detailed
                    bibliography. He indicates when they were published or where they are preserved, and he often
                    mentions related information. The <placeName>

                    Although obviously not entirely current in their scholarship, these books offer useful information

            <p>The staff of the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission has prepared a list of Indiana Civil War
                    regiments and companies by counties. This list recently appeared in the October and December, 1961,
                    issues of the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin,</hi> which is published by the Indiana

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The compilation is especially useful in locating the counties from which particular
                    regiments were recruited and the county or counties from which the member companies were
                    constituted. The list offers abundant evidence of the fact that during the Civil War men from the
                    same or neighboring counties were almost certain to fight in the same companies rather than in
                    different ones. Anyone wishing the names of members of a particular company or desiring basic
                    information about the war service of particular persons, however, will need to consult the
                    indispensable record known as <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General of the State of

                        list</hi> of nearly one hundred books published by Indiana authors preceding 1890. The listing
                    is the result of composite research since, as indicated in the Preface (p. vii), about a <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-058-2-099"/> dozen persons contributed to the research which resulted in this
                    collection. According to Brunvand, there are about fifteen hundred separate sayings in this
                    compilation, about one-third of which are comparisons, slightly more than one-third proverbial
                    phrases, and the remainder proverbs and sententious remarks (pp. xii-xiii). "The largest
                    group of proverbs and proverbial phrases relating to one literary source are Biblical sayings,
                    either allusions to names or places in the Bible, or quotations and misquotations from the
                    Bible" (p. xiii). Various of the items listed probably developed from experience in and
                    observation of pioneer life in Indiana or elsewhere. At least, such listings as
                    "He'll be in ‘fore long, a drippin’ like a ash-hopper
                    an' es wet es a swamp" (p. 4); "A man ‘as tight as the bark on
                    a beech tree’" (p. 7); "Jack of all trades and master of none"
                    (p. 78); and "She's as sweet as maple sugar" (p. 92) quite likely would
                    have been much better understood by most Hoosier pioneers, even by those who were illiterate, than
                    by most Ph.D.'s of this generation.</p>

                    of them have no such office), comments on its constitutional and legislative origins in Indiana, but
                    gives most of his attention to the increased role and importance of the lieutenant governor in
                    Indiana government and politics since 1933. According to Mr. Hofferbert, "The present
                    lieutenant governor, Richard O. Ristine, is only the second person to fill the office whose party
                    identification was at variance with the governor's" (p. 4).</p>

                    editions. This volume—it might be called a <hi rend="i">Hoosier Political
                    Almanac</hi>—despite its Republican sponsorship gives approximately equal space to the
                    Democrats. The value of its sketches and compilations is increased by the fact that this material is
                    offered, at least in the main, in a factual and nonpartisan manner. Such a publication, if
                    continued, can become a useful source of information about Hoosier politics and government. It is
                    hoped that the 1962 edition will include copies of state political platforms, while some information
                    should also be given about minor parties.</p>

                    Charles E. Tuttle Co., 1962. Pp.140. Numerous illustrations. $10.00.) Professor Kervick,
                    head of the Department of Architecture at Notre Dame University, includes numerous brief sketches
                    about American architects associated with Roman Catholicism. In addition, several dozen plates
                    illustrating their work indicate the beauty and variety of the buildings these architects have
                    designed. Both sketches and illustrations show that impressive buildings of a secular nature as well
                    as those of a religious nature have often been designed by Roman Catholic architects. A number of
                    the architects named were from the Midwest, while various of the plates show buildings in the area,
                    especially those located in <placeName>

                    revised edition includes a new chapter on the Lower Counties on the <placeName>

                    century. The detailed table of contents—see pages xi-xlvi—is extremenly
                    useful, especially in view of the detail included in this volume, which centers its attention on the <placeName>

                    Bay areas, in which emphasis is respectively on the fisheries and fur trade. The final chapter,
                    which offers Gipson's summary view of "The British Colonial System in
                    1750," is an essay of much significance to persons interested in conclusions reached by
                    Gipson. This chapter, because of its appearance in the revised edition of the third volume, has
                    elements of hindsight from subsequent volumes, hence to some extent it is a summary essay to the
                    multivolume work as a whole.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical Society, explains in his Introduction: "No attempt has been made to
                    bring this work up to date in the light of later research. Minor errors have been corrected; the
                    maps have been simplified; and new illustrations have been added." Therefore, apparently in
                    substance this new volume is a reprint rather than a revised edition. Not knowing what corrections
                    and changes have been made is disturbing for scholars eager to know what Folwell wrote and thought.
                    Folwell's history has, of course, been superceded by succeeding ones in some respects and
                    on some important points; all students of <placeName>

                    because of the author's use of documentary material but also because of his use of material
                    gleaned from his own personal experiences or from other participants in the events described.

                    guide for the restoration. Anyone at all familiar with the early history of the Midwest is, of
                    course, aware that there was a fort of importance at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michilimackinac</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the French and English periods. Such a person, however, is probably troubled by
                    questions such as which of several spellings of the fort's name is accurate, where the fort
                    was located, and how many forts there were of the same or a similar name. The initial fort was
                    located at St. Ignace on the southern tip of the Upper Peninsula. The one here <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-058-2-102"/> under study was located at the present <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mackinac City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a later one was built on Mackinac Island. The research and field work upon which
                    this volume is based were mainly completed during the summer of 1959. Since then work has continued,
                    and a subsequent publication will doubtless add additional information to our knowledge of Fort
                    Michilimackinac at <placeName>

                    of the importance of Fort Michilimackinac during the eighteenth century, the restoration project and
                    the increased knowledge being derived therefrom are of interest and value to students of Midwest

                    History Department at Indiana University since 1957, has written a number of well-known books
                    concerning American folklore, especially that of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> and the Middle West. During 1956–1957 he was a Fulbright professor in
                    American Studies at the University of Tokyo. The present volume is in part a result of his contacts
                    with Japanese folklorists during that year. For a historian to evaluate folklore is always a bit
                    risky, and especially so when the author is both a colleague and fellow editor. Hence, Professor
                    Dorson can speak for himself through his Introduction: "The present book is intended to
                    bring a representative selection of Japanese folk legends to Western readers." And:
