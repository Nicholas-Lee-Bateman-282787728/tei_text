                                          And we don't know what to say;
                                          The Kid we have loved and cuddled
                                          Stepped out for the Flag to-day.
                                          We thought him a child, a baby
                                          With never a care at all,
                                          But his country called him man-size
                                          And the Kid has heard the call.
                                   
                                   
                                          He paused to watch the recruiting,
                                          Where, fired by the fife and drum,
                                          He bowed his head to Old Glory
                                          And thought that it whispered:
                                                 "Come!"
                                          The Kid, not being a slacker,
                                          Stood forth with patriot-joy
                                          To add his name to the roster
                                          And God, we're proud of the
                                                 boy!
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          The Kid has gone to the Colors
                                          It seems but a little while
                                          Since he drilled a schoolboy army
                                          In a truly martial style.
                                          But now he's a man, a soldier,
                                          And we lend him listening ear,
                                          For his heart is a heart all loyal,
                                          Unscourged by the curse of fear.
                                          His dad, when he told him, shuddered,
                                          His mother--God bless her!--cried;
                                          Yet, blest with a mother-nature,
                                          She wept with a mother-pride.
                                          But he whose old shoulders straightened
                                          Was Granddad-for memory ran
                                          To years when he, too, a youngster,
                                          Was changed by the Flag to a man!

                                   [To the dwellers in Sunset Bay--The Home for Aged Women.]
                                   
                                          I CAME to-day to a quiet port--
                                          To the Port of Sunset Bay--
                                          Where tides run calm and the evening mists
                                          Are tinted a silver gray;
                                          Where all the ships are memory ships
                                          That bear only dreams and smiles
                                          To the dear old dears whose compass steers
                                          To Youth's far distant isles.
                                          For smiles and dreams and dreams and smiles
                                          Are treasures to them, you see,
                                          That give glad glow to the long ago
                                          And hallow the used-to-be.
                                   
                                   
                                          And where is this Sunset Bay, you ask?
                                          It's back from a city street
                                          Where dear old dears in their gray-haired years
                                          Have found a calm retreat.
                                          
                                          A place where Yesterdays reign supreme,
                                          And To-day--ah, well, To-day
                                          Is only a strand of Time-washed sand
                                          On which their fancies play.
                                          They frolic with old companions gone,
                                          With minstrels who come to sing
                                          The songs they sang when the whole world rang
                                          With life and love and--Spring!
                                   
                                   
                                          In rocking-chair ships they sail away
                                          And needles and thimbles fly
                                          In speeding the flight of visions bright
                                          To the glad-sad days gone by.
                                          And oh how the glad outshines the sad--
                                          The laughter outlaughs the sighs,
                                          Till the window gleams with sunset beams
                                          That jewel their tear-damp eyes.
                                          Then sleep as sweet as a baby's sleep
                                          Comes out of the sunset's gold
                                          And proves that here each dear old dear
                                          Is only a child grown old.

                                          But the fastest and the gladdest is the Babytown

                                          It's funny how the tourists, too, are willing
                                                 that she should,
                                          Because it takes a lot of fares to make the service
                                                 good.

                                   THE KEEPER OF LOCKERBIE GATE
                                   [When James Whitcomb Riley and a group of his little friends
                                          posed for the "movies," an interesting
                                          factor in the event was a small Italian boy who
                                          volunteered as gate-opener for those who entered Mr.
                                          Riley's yard.]
                                   
                                          HE was just a wee wandering
                                                 alien,
                                          With all of his cares in retreat,
                                          That paused at the gate of The Poet,
                                          Fame's dweller in Lockerbie
                                                 Street.
                                          The urchin sought place of seclusion
                                          Behind the iron barrier strong,
                                          Then waited, unknowing, to witness
                                          Art's tribute to Childhood and
                                                 Song.
                                   
                                   
                                          He saw children--Sunday-clothed children--
                                          With faces expectantly bright
                                          Troop in through the gate he held open,
                                          And oh how it gladdened his sight!
                                          No shadow of envy oppressed him,
                                          Instead he felt measures of joy
                                          Creep into his heart as The Poet
                                          Gave greeting to each girl and boy.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Though he had not heard of Doc Sifers
                                          Or worshiped a 'Lizabeth Ann,
                                          The boy at the gate knew The Poet
                                          Had once loved a Raggedy Man.
                                          For, though the child's raiment was humble
                                          And not up to juvenile style,
                                          The man paused to gladden the urchin
                                          By paying his toll with a smile.
                                   
                                   
                                          The "movie" man, too, caught the
                                                 spirit
                                          Of Italy's friend-winning son
                                          And felt that, while not of the picture,
                                          He'd happily shared in the
                                                 fun.
                                          His presence had brightened the faces
                                          Of all who passed in at the gate,
                                          And "movies" without a glad
                                                 climax

                                                 street,
                                          Some one you loved now lies slumbering
                                                 there;
                                          Some one who loved you in comradeship sweet
                                          Rests at the foot of Eternity's

                                          Voices kept calling him out of The Past,
                                          Voices all fondly familiar to him;
                                          Then came the one--he must answer at last--
                                          Dear Old Aunt Mary was calling her Jim!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   MOTHER IS DOING HER BIT
                                   
                                          MOTHER can't join the army
                                                 and Mother can't go to sea,
                                          But Mother can do her bit, you bet--whatever her bit
                                                 may be.
                                          She's up in the morning early, she's
                                                 late to her bed at night,
                                          Yet she sings a song the whole day long that shows her
                                                 full of fight.
                                          It's "Columbia, Gem of the
                                                 Ocean" that echoes through kitchen and
                                                 hall
                                          A melody sweet, yet as sturdy as though 'twere
                                                 a bugle call.
                                   
                                   
                                          We hear it first in the morning, when Mother, at dawn
                                                 of day,
                                          Rouses her sleeping household singing her
                                                 re-veille.
                                          
                                          Then off she goes to the garden, a soldier that rakes
                                                 and hoes,
                                          And "Columbia, Gem of the Ocean" is
                                                 sung to each seed she sows.
                                          The song and the toil and Mother seem bound by a common
                                                 tie--
                                          A pledge that they'll keep Old Glory forever
                                                 waving high!
                                   
                                   
                                          She starts the children off to school, a flag upon each
                                                 breast,
                                          A symbol sweet, she tells them, of the land they love
                                                 the best.
                                          Then Mother gets her housework done and hurries off to
                                                 town,
                                          There to do a woman's part in Red Cross cap
                                                 and gown.
                                          And all along the table where the bandage makers
                                                 sit
                                          They hear her hum "Columbia" and see
                                                 her do her bit.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Mother can't join the army and Mother
                                                 can't go to sea,
                                          But Mother will do her bit, you bet--whatever her bit
                                                 may be.
                                          She doesn't go 'round complaining
                                                 because she isn't a man,
                                          Instead she sows and sings and hoes and does the best
                                                 she can.
                                          For Columbia, too, was a woman, as pictured in story

                                          Down through th' water-world
                                          Lookin' fer a fish.
                                   
                                   
                                          Six little hearts there are,

                                          No thoughts of work or woe,
                                          No great war to fight--

                                          Somehow, it seems to me
                                          Young'uns allus know

                                          Well, no, I hadn't thought
                                          How it might be me
                                          Allus sneakin' 'round to where
                                          Boys would likely be!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE OTHER SIDE OF JUNE
                                   
                                          THE JUNE of Junes has come, my wife,
                                                 and down its fragrant way
                                          There drifts the last faint perfume of our
                                                 daughter's wedding day.
                                          The bridal bower is now a stage with all the players
                                                 flown,
                                          And we, the memory-audience, are left to dream
                                                 alone.
                                          The vows, the smiles, the Lohengrin--it ended all too
                                                 soon
                                          And left us, two old exiles, on The Other Side of
                                                 June.
                                   
                                   
                                          We've watched her proudly, you and I, come
                                                 marching down the years;
                                          Each new Prince Charming we have met with mingled hopes
                                                 and fears.
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          We knew this day some day must come, when on
                                                 Love's hallowed shrine
                                          We'd lay our hearts' full
                                                 sacrifice--this girl of yours and mine.
                                          Time's tribute thus is paid, my dear; to-day
                                                 we saw her wed
                                          And where the old Junes used to be her new June reigns
                                                 instead.
                                   
                                   
                                          It's just our own old story, dear, reflected
                                                 down the years;
                                          Once we, too, left an aftermath of parent-void and
                                                 tears.
                                          We pondered not June's other side, but bowed
                                                 to Love alone,
                                          And for that sweet idolatry to-day we must atone.
                                          So come, let's love anew, my wife, cast all of

                                   THE VOICES MILITANT
                                   
                                          I STOOD within a bivouac where the
                                                 Silent Legion sleeps,
                                          Where the owl, that wide-eyed sentry, his nightly vigil
                                                 keeps;
                                          Where tents of mounded grasses top the
                                                 soldier's cot of clay
                                          And mighty hosts are waiting for the one Great
                                                 Reveille.
                                          I bowed with head uncovered, thus my reverence to
                                                 show,
                                          When voices, strong and militant, came to me from
                                                 below:
                                          "Tell the boys to go on! Go on! Go on!
                                          Till the last reserve of the foe is gone;
                                          Then peace will come and a new day dawn--
                                          Tell the boys to go on! Go
                                                 on!"
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          All suddenly the vision changed in these blurred eyes
                                                 of mine;
                                          I stood with troops at Valley Forge and on the
                                                 Brandywine.
                                          At Bunker Hill and Bennington men battled side by
                                                 side
                                          That in this king-encumbered land true freemen might
                                                 abide.
                                          And now far down the lapse of years their voices seem
                                                 to come
                                          With sharp command that we again fall in with fife and
                                                 drum:
                                          "Tell the boys to go on! Go on! Go on!
                                          Till the last reserve of the foe is gone;
                                          Then peace will come and a new day dawn--
                                          Tell the boys to go on! Go
                                                 on!"
                                   
                                   
                                          Then other hosts of other wars marched by with sturdy
                                                 tread,
                                          Brave men of Buena Vista with the flag high over
                                                 head.
                                          
                                          And some were men of Gettysburg and some of
                                                 Cuba's hill,
                                          For where a Yankee foot has trod Old Glory flutters
                                                 still.
                                          To us they've left a heritage--this Silent
                                                 Legion dear--
                                          A song of flag-fidelity that all the world must
                                                 hear:
                                          "Tell the boys to go on! Go on! Go on!
                                          Till the last reserve of the foe is gone;
                                          Then peace will come and a new day dawn--
                                          Tell the boys to go on! Go
                                                 on!"
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE ROBIN TAKES THE STAND
                                   
                                          GOOD morning, Judge! I'm
                                                 guilty,
                                          So, well, I'll just confess;
                                          I don't know what the charge is--
                                          Plain vagrancy, I guess.
                                          But listen, Judge, have mercy!
                                          I meant to do no harm;
                                          I truly thought 'twas Springtime
                                          And not this false alarm.
                                   
                                   
                                          I flew up here one morning
                                          And with glad eyes I saw
                                          The women wearing bonnets
                                          Of flimsy lace and straw.
                                          I thought it must be Springtime,
                                          For some wore lowcuts, too;
                                          And, Judge, I'm just a robin--
                                          What could a poor bird do?
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          I thought them true to season,
                                          I took their word for it--
                                          Thought winter's snows had vanished
                                          And this is what I git!
                                          The men were reading baseball,
                                          The kids at marbles played,
                                          And each green onion eater
                                          His garden patch had made.
                                          So, Judge, I ask for mercy,
                                          But if I'm jailed and fined
                                          There is another fellow
                                          I don't want left behind.
                                          Lock up that weather prophet,
                                          Then magnify his woe
                                          By making him eat jonquils
                                          With garnishments of snow.
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE PAWPAW PARTY
                                   
                                          SAYS I to Me, le's take a
                                                 hike,
                                          I know where somethin's at we like.
                                          Says Me to I, all right, I'm game--
                                          Our tastes both run about th' same.
                                   
                                   
                                          So I and Me we kep' right still
                                          An' hit th' trail fer
                                                 Millersville,
                                          Then cut along Stought Fletcher's fence
                                          To where th' Fall crick hills commence.
                                   
                                   
                                          And, there it was! Well, what ye s'pose?
                                          If you don't like 'em hold your
                                                 nose.
                                          But Me and I--here's what we found--
                                          A pawpaw bush 'at touched th'
                                                 ground.
                                   
                                   
                                          Yes, sir, 'twas loaded to th' top
                                          Till, seemed to us, th' limbs would drop.
                                          So I an' Me we started in
                                          To help th' tree git light ag'in.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Ole Me an' I we e't an'
                                                 e't
                                          Till we can't eat no more you'd
                                                 bet,
                                          'Cause in our stummick we could feel
                                          We'd more 'an e't a
                                                 reg'lar meal.
                                   
                                   
                                          But I an' Me we couldn't quit,
                                          Th' more we e't th' more
                                                 we'd git,
                                          Then somethin' said to I an' Me
                                          We couldn't eat th' whole blamed
                                                 tree.
                                   
                                   
                                          An' then--an' then--an'
                                                 then--gee whiz!
                                          Our stummick got th' rheumatiz,
                                          An' then--an' then--then Me
                                                 an' I
                                          We wondered why we couldn't die!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   SOMEBODY'S PAL
                                   
                                          WHEN first I looked down in his
                                                 honest old eyes
                                          I knew I had more than mere friendship to prize.
                                   
                                   
                                          For, dog that he was, he was quick to reveal
                                          A faith in his blood and a pride in his steel.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then, deep in my soul, I felt longings to be
                                          Not master, but pal to one worthy as he.
                                   
                                   
                                          I hungered to stroke his fine head and declare
                                          Our friendship as warm as the shag of his hair.
                                   
                                   
                                          I wanted to take his big paws in my hands
                                          And stroke them with love that a dog understands.
                                   
                                   
                                          How proudly we'd walk down the street, he and
                                                 I,
                                          True comrades, the envy of each passerby.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Each wag of his tail I'd interpret to be
                                          Some word of affection intended for me.
                                   
                                   
                                          I pictured us, too, in a home-joy complete--
                                          My chair, a good book, and Old Pal at my feet.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then--then came a voice in a summoning call--
                                          He was Somebody Else's--not my pal at all!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   KNUCKLEDOWN

                                          Of the hale-hearted lyrics they sing.

                                          Yale's "Boola"

                                          But, ah! there's a comradely chorus
                                          That breaks from a song to a cheer;
                                          It bids foes beware,

                                                 most of us;

                                          The sky runs blue and the wind blows fine.
                                          To-day we'll sail to the far'most
                                                 end
                                          Of the wonderful Sea of Just Pretend.
                                   
                                   
                                          It's a sea of dreams, a sea of joy
                                          With just enough storms to please a boy;
                                          For storms bring thrills--and thrills, you know,
                                          A boy must have if he wants to grow.
                                   
                                   
                                          Our ships, of course, are of crude design,
                                          With handkerchief sails and topstring line;
                                          The anchor's a stone, the rudder a lid
                                          From a box of cigars Dad thought he hid.
                                   
                                   
                                          So come, lift anchor! Let's sail away
                                          To the glad good port of Sweet-tooth Bay,
                                          Where nobody cares what sweets you take
                                          And the more you eat the more they make.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          We'll land at Laughter and dock at Noise
                                          Where music is made from yells of boys.
                                          At Ouch there's salt and an apple tree
                                          With green ones on it and both are free.
                                   
                                   
                                          We'll see Film City and learn for true
                                          If they jump from cliffs as they say they do.
                                          At Isle Ignoramus the fun will be rare
                                          With neither a teacher nor principal there.
                                   
                                   
                                          It's a wonderful voyage to Just Pretend,
                                          But, like all journeys, must have an end,
                                          And so, at sunset, with full delight
                                          We'll seek the haven of Mother's
                                                 Goodnight.
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                   LONG BOY
                                   
                                          HE was just a long, lean country gink
                                          From 'way out west, where the hoptoads
                                                 wink;
                                          He was six feet two in his stockin' feet,
                                          An' kept gittin' thinner th'
                                                 more he'd eat.
                                          But he was as brave as he was thin,
                                          When th' war broke out he got right in;
                                          Unhitched his plow, put th' mule away,
                                          Then th' old folks heard him say:

                                          One pair of socks was his only load
                                          When he struck fer town by th' old dirt
                                                 road.
                                          He went right down to th' public square
                                          An' fell in line with th' soldiers
                                                 there.
                                          Th' sergeant put him in uniform,
                                          His gal knit mitts fer to keep him warm;
                                          They drilled him hard, they drilled him long,
                                          Then he sang his farewell song:

                                          LIFE is made of little journeys,
                                          Little journeys up and down;
                                          Sometimes where a sunbeam lingers,
                                          Ofttimes where dark shadows frown.
                                          But, of all the paths I wander,
                                          None holds more delightful sway
                                          Than the one that leads me homeward
                                          On the glad Thanksgiving day.
                                          Earth seems swung in sweeter balance
                                          Under heaven's smiling dome,
                                          When I'm headed toward the depot;
                                          Toward the depot--going home.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then my luggage seems a partner
                                          In a joy I can't explain
                                          As we hurry through the city,
                                          Double-quicking to the train.
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          Every friend I meet, I pity,
                                          When I know his pilgrim way
                                          Lies not where my own is leading--
                                          To a real Thanksgiving day!
                                          Then I want to share my blessings;
                                          Milk, and honey--in the comb--
                                          When I'm headed toward the depot;
                                          Toward the depot--going home.
                                   
                                   
                                          Could I lead God's lonely children
                                          On a pilgrimage divine
                                          I would once in every twelve-month,
                                          Guide them to a mother-shrine.
                                          On the day we call Thanksgiving
                                          Each would do the same as I--
                                          Take his luggage and, with gladness,
                                          Bid all wonted haunts good-by.
                                          Other paths would be forgotten
                                          By the vagrant souls that roam,
                                          As they headed toward the depot;
                                          Toward the depot--going home.
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE WAYSIDE WELL
                                   
                                          AN old-fashioned well by the
                                                 roadside,
                                          A freedom-blest boy by the well;
                                          These two-and a midsummer noontide--
                                          What daydreams such visions impel!
                                   
                                   
                                          The bucket, curb-dented, shot downward,
                                          Borne safely by windlass and chain;
                                          Then up, with a cargo of coolness,
                                          It came to soothe body and brain.
                                   
                                   
                                          The boy--oh, I watched him with envy!
                                          As fondly he tilted the pail,
                                          Then dipped his lip over the border
                                          And drank of earth's mellowest
                                                 ale.
                                   
                                   
                                          At first his attack was all vigor,
                                          Then slowly he slackened the pace
                                          Till, there on the water's bright mirror,
                                          I caught the glad glow of his face.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          He sipped--sipped with placid enjoyment--
                                          Unmindful of covetous eyes,
                                          And, when I at last gave him greeting,
                                          He glanced up in quiet surprise.
                                   
                                   
                                          He yielded no handclasp, no welcome,
                                          Yet in his calm smile I could see
                                          A heart well intent upon sharing
                                          Earth's sweetest decanter with
                                                 me.
                                   
                                   
                                          I drank--and my drinking was eager--
                                          Each drop was an eloquent joy,
                                          Which made my soul say: "Of God's
                                                 blessings

                                                 and cactus on the long ride, Buffalo Bill;
                                          Crossed to find eternal slumber in the Dugout on the
                                                 Hill.
                                          But you've left behind an army that is sighing

                                          You have been a king, Bill Cody, in a monarchy of
                                                 hearts,

                                                 darts.
                                   
                                   
                                          Ah, the legions you've commanded--more than
                                                 you have ever guessed--
                                          Legions that in hayloft fancy marched with you across
                                                 the west;
                                          
                                          Soldiers that have known the serfdom of a school desk,
                                                 when, in fact,
                                          They were scouting through the canyons where the mad
                                                 Apache tracked.
                                          They were groveling in grammar--so the trusting teacher
                                                 thought--
                                          When, in truth, they stood triumphant where the
                                                 redskins had been fought.
                                   
                                   
                                           But you've crossed the sand and cactus on the
                                                 long ride, Buffalo Bill.
                                          And your broad-brimmed hat and trappings lie unheralded
                                                 and still.
                                          Yet, from Maine to California, there's a young
                                                 and sturdy race
                                          That would like to don your trappings and ride forth to
                                                 take your place.
                                          So rest on--rest on, Youth's idol, in your
                                                 Dugout on the Hill

                                   WHEN THE LEAVES ARE THREESCORE AND TEN
                                   
                                          WHEN Autumn's
                                                 color-caravan
                                          Invades the forest heights
                                          And makes the lowland glorious
                                          With manifold delights,
                                          Then all my fears of length'ning years
                                          Like foes uncherished flee,
                                          As birch and beech reach out to teach
                                          The infinite to me.
                                   
                                   
                                          I have belief that God reveals
                                          The magic of His hand
                                          Through nature's sweet concordant voice--
                                          A voice we understand.
                                          And so I think the autumn leaves
                                          That gladden hill and glen
                                          But typify that they, as I,
                                          Have their threescore and ten.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          In spring, the birthtime of the year,
                                          The leaves are born anew,
                                          Their infant glory magnified
                                          By sun and rain and dew.
                                          Gay summer brings maturity,
                                          Life--full-grown, virile, strong--
                                          When every breeze that sways the trees
                                          Reverberates a song.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then comes the Autumn, bringing Age,
                                          When leaves, like men, grow old;
                                          But men turn gray--not so the leaves!--
                                          Theirs is a garb of gold!
                                          They dance upon the laughing winds
                                          With spirit wild and free;
                                          They have no fear when death is near--
                                          A faith I joy to see.
                                   
                                   
                                          And so I think the falling leaves,
                                          The leaves threescore and ten,
                                          Fear not to die because the Spring
                                          Will give them life again.
                                          
                                          No bough will bear the same old leaf,
                                          But from the same old tree
                                          New leaves will grow--then fade--then go,
                                          And that's-Eternity!

                                   A WINTER MOONRISE
                                   
                                          THE wind forgets to rasp a
                                                 rabbit's cheek,
                                          The snow, far driven, meekly hides away
                                          Beneath the straw-pens where the cattle seek
                                          The welcome dark that ends a
                                                 Winter's day.
                                   
                                   
                                          Hush follows hush along the water's trail,
                                          Save where the creek breaks out of bondage
                                                 chill
                                          To breathe, as living things must breathe, or fail
                                          And fall the Storm King's slave
                                                 against its will.
                                   
                                   
                                          Night crowds the shadows deeper, deeper down
                                          Until its pall makes ghost-films of the
                                                 snow;
                                          Wraith-fancies heightened by the lights of town
                                          That flood a distant cloud with spectral
                                                 glow.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          But, look! There marches up across the sky
                                          A nightborn guidon of the Master's
                                                 Moods;
                                          It is the Moon, whose penetrating eye
                                          Leads God, the Lonely, to His
                                                 solitudes.
                                   
                                   
                                          For He grows weary, weary of the strife
                                          And all the prayers we selfishly
                                                 intone;
                                          He longs for freedom from the beggar, Life,
                                          To walk the Winter vastnesses--alone!
                                   
                                   
                                          They give Him sweep of vision, range of scheme;
                                          They let Him think of other than our
                                                 ills.
                                          He finds a glory in the frozen stream
                                          And sets His throne upon the snow-capped
                                                 hills.
                                   
                                   
                                          Thus, while He wanders free from human pleas,
                                          The Winter moonbeams cause our God to
                                                 see
                                          The sweetness of His power to make the trees
                                          The Summer-triumph of His wizardry.
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE GOOD SHIP"SYCAMORE"
                                   
                                          I'LL bet you when our
                                                 neighbor boy grows up to be a man
                                          He'll run off to the ocean just as early as he
                                                 can,

                                                 th' airy seas.
                                          Th' "Sycamore," you
                                                 understand, it ain't no reg'lar
                                                 ship,
                                          But just a tree he climbs up when he wants to take a
                                                 trip.
                                   
                                   
                                          Yep, just a worn, old sycamore that stands there by the
                                                 road,
                                          A good-fer-nothin' thing except as little
                                                 Bud's abode.
                                          An', funny thing about Bud, too, is that he
                                                 seems to be
                                          Th' only one that ever sails th'

                                          He climbs up there among th' boughs, then
                                                 hollers to his Pa
                                          To look for him a-Christmas coming back from
                                                 Panama.
                                   
                                   
                                          He talks of ocean jogafy in such a knowin'
                                                 way
                                          That he can tell you every port from Bath to Baffin
                                                 Bay.
                                          He calls that great big limb up there th'
                                                 mainmast on the ship
                                          That's bein' rocked by winds
                                                 an' waves an' liable to dip.
                                          But, like a reg'lar mariner, he climbs aloft
                                                 an' stands
                                          Among th' wind-rocked riggin'
                                                 singin' out his bold commands.
                                   
                                   
                                          He 'tends th' leaves are all his crew
                                                 an' orders them around
                                          Just like a reg'lar skipper when his bark is
                                                 ocean bound. 
                                          
                                          
                                          
                                          An' sometimes Bud plays pirate, too,
                                                 a-sittin' up that tree,
                                          Which same was how he come to make a prisoner of
                                                 me.
                                          He bound me to th'
                                                 "Sycamore" with Memory's
                                                 chain, an' then
                                          Went sailin' with me down the Bay of
                                                 Boyhood's Years again.

                                          My mother says you called me up

                                          Now listen, Sandy--listen close--
                                          I'll whisper in your ear;
                                          I don't want nothin' much for me,
                                          But some one else this year.
                                   
                                   
                                          Near by us is a little boy

                                          They ain't no Sandy Claus.

                                          But it's no use, I guess,
                                          For when he speaks of you his folks
                                          Say: "Hush 'at
                                                 foolishness!"
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          So listen, Sandy--listen good!--

                                   THE ADVANCE AGENT
                                   
                                          CHILDREN, bend low with your
                                                 whisper-it ear,
                                          I've curious news that I want you to hear;
                                          Something I heard--and I saw it as well--
                                          Which makes it a story I'm anxious to
                                                 tell.
                                          In a window downtown stands a grizzled old man,
                                          He must have been born when this old world began.
                                          He looks just like Santa Claus--boots, coat and
                                                 hat--
                                          Perhaps he's his brother or something like
                                                 that.
                                          And yet he declares he's not Santa at all,
                                          But simply his agent here making a call.
                                   
                                   
                                          Advance agent! Yes, that's his business,
                                                 because
                                          His samples were made by your friend, Santa Claus.
                                          
                                          They bear Toytown's label, which proves beyond
                                                 doubt
                                          That Santa intends you to pick your toys out.
                                          And so, in the window, his agent appears
                                          To bear back to Santa the stories he hears.
                                          No word speaks the agent, but there, thro' the
                                                 glass,
                                          He catches the smiles of the children that pass.
                                          He hears what they say, too, so please have a care
                                          And utter no word you'll be sorry for
                                                 there.
                                   
                                   
                                          It's funny, I think, just to stand in the
                                                 street
                                          And watch the old man with the toys at his feet.
                                          It tickles him, too, when he sees some child pause
                                          And lovingly call him the real Santa Claus.
                                          Why, I have heard grownups declare that they knew
                                          The man in the window was Santa-for-true.
                                          And say, there are times I'm inclined to
                                                 surmise
                                          That maybe it is the old saint in disguise.
                                          'Twould give him a frolic--the wily old
                                                 elf--
                                          To not send his agent, but come here himself!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE TACKLE
                                   
                                          NOW Sonny comes home in the evening,
                                          Yes, Sonny's our neighbor next
                                                 door;
                                          Now Sonny comes home in the evening
                                          All battered, disheveled and sore.
                                   
                                   
                                          His moods are as varied as April's
                                          And range from deep bitter to sweet--
                                          The last is his symbol of triumph,
                                          The other his sign of defeat.
                                   
                                   
                                          He brings home a mystical language
                                          His mother thinks rambling and wild,
                                          Which makes her steal over to our house
                                          To ask what is troubling her child.
                                   
                                   
                                          He tells her that he is the
                                                 "tackle,"
                                          That he, the "star guy"
                                                 of his team,
                                          Stood all of his foes on their
                                                 "think-tanks"
                                          And "went through their line like
                                                 a dream!"
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Ah, Mother, good Mother, don't worry!
                                          His language is queer, that is true,
                                          But some day he'll play on Life's
                                                 gridiron
                                          And bring home real laurels to you.
                                   
                                   
                                          To-day's game out there in the common
                                          Is only to prove that defeat
                                          Serves best as a spur for To-morrow
                                          And makes winning then doubly sweet.
                                   
                                   
                                          As "tackle" he'll have to be
                                                 "tackled"
                                          And face all his "downs"
                                                 with a grin.
                                          It's football!--it's Life he is
                                                 playing--
                                          And half-hearted
                                                 "tackling" won't
                                                 win!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE EXPLORERS
                                   
                                          SAID one: "Le's

                                          And, caught by the thrill of adventure,
                                          The others piped out a
                                                 "Le's do !"
                                   
                                   
                                          Then, out of the dust-colored highway,
                                          They turned, in their vagabond glee,
                                          To picture the woods a great jungle
                                          And play that the creek was a sea.
                                   
                                   
                                          Their make-believe world of adventure
                                          They said was from Granny's
                                                 abode
                                          To where the creek turned at the haw tree,
                                          Then back to old Madison road.
                                   
                                   
                                          With trousers upturned, the explorers
                                          Plunged off in the "wild,
                                                 ragin' sea"
                                          To wade to the "wilderness"
                                                 yonder--
                                          It looked like woods pasture to me.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Their boy-fancies yielded queer visions--
                                          Each tree was a giant unborn
                                          That some day would break its long silence
                                          And hold all earth's creatures to
                                                 scorn.

                                          Instead of diminutives frail;
                                          The sunfish that scooted to safety
                                          They called "Old man
                                                 Joney's big whale."
                                   
                                   
                                          Then, up from the shimmering waters,
                                          They mounted a stump on the shore
                                          And from it proclaimed--like Columbus--
                                          "This whole world is ours
                                                 evermore!"
                                   
                                   
                                          I sighed when, at last, the explorers
                                          Had left me alone--for, in truth,
                                          My own dreams had gone make-believing

                                          You can use his tools or tops,
                                          Play his drum or fife--

                                          But his soul is one
                                          Tuned, somehow, to harmonize
                                          With his neighbor's fun.

                                          That scared the baby saplings and thrilled the elm and
                                                 ash.
                                          "Pray, why all this?" the elm
                                                 inquired. "What are you leaving
                                                 for?"
                                          "My country calls," the oak replied,

                                          Then, while its neighbors harkened, the oak, with
                                                 sturdy heart,
                                          Told how it had enlisted to do its humble part.

                                          I'll face the foeman's frenzy with a
                                                 zeal to do or die,
                                          As did the good old merchantmen in years now long gone

                                          The great oak's loyal ardor sent a thrill
                                                 through all the trees,
                                          And soon a call to mobilize was hurried down the
                                                 breeze.
                                          One volunteered to be a bridge, one would a barracks
                                                 be--
                                          No slacker bolted from the line of this brave
                                                 company!
                                          The beeches, elms and cottonwoods marched off beside
                                                 the oaks;
                                          The hickories said for cannon wheels they'd
                                                 proudly serve as spokes.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          Soon all the trees but one had gone to muster at the
                                                 mill--
                                          The one was just a sapling left to guard a lonely
                                                 hill.
                                          Yet, while it mourned its lowly state and thought
                                                 existence hard,
                                          A schoolboy gladly claimed it for a flagstaff in his
                                                 yard.
                                          Which points a wartime moral each of us should keep in
                                                 view--
                                          That, though we're great or humble, there is
                                                 something all can do!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   CAP'N CAL
                                   
                                          CAL, he's just a little
                                                 feller,
                                          'Bout as big as--well,
                                                 le's see--
                                          'Bout as big as any young'un
                                          Eight years old would likely be.
                                          Still, he's mighty big in
                                                 feelin's
                                          Jedged by language he employs
                                          Since he's gone an' j'ined
                                                 th' Army
                                          With his brave Angoly boys.
                                   
                                   
                                          Yep, the kid he's from Angoly,
                                          Pa an' ma both dead an'
                                                 gone,
                                          Gran'ma's all he's got, I
                                                 reckon,
                                          An' she'll soon be
                                                 passin' on.
                                          Just a kind o' 'round-town
                                                 young'un
                                          Cal wuz, till he heard it said
                                          War had called Angoly's soldiers--
                                          Then a new thought struck his head!
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          War wuz just th' thing he wanted,
                                          So th' doggone little scamp
                                          Fell in line behind th' soldiers,
                                          Marched hisself right out to camp.
                                          Soldiers tried to drive him homeward,
                                          Not that young'un--No, sirree!
                                          'Bout th' time they thought
                                                 they'd lost him
                                          He'd turn up at revel-lee!
                                   
                                   
                                          Well, th' boys just had to 'dopt
                                                 him,
                                          Like a kind of battle-son;
                                          Sit around off-hours an' teach him
                                          As his mother would have done.
                                          Cap'n Cal th' boys all call him,
                                          An' you'll have to say
                                                 it's cute
                                          When his little face, uplifted,
                                          Adds a smile to each salute.
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   LETTERS HOME
                                   
                                          SOLDIER he was--and a good one,
                                                 too--
                                          Though you may wonder just how I knew
                                          That his was a heart well steeled to test
                                          The enemy's bravest, truest, best.
                                          'Twas this that made me know his worth
                                          As one of the sturdy sons of earth:
                                   
                                   
                                          He was tired to-day when drill was done,
                                          For he had been up before the sun,
                                          Yet toil was turned to a new delight--
                                          There were letters home he had to write.
                                          Letters to prove--as they only can--
                                          The tender side of a martial man.
                                   
                                   
                                          He would ease with jokes their anxious fears,
                                          He would dry with smiles their ready tears;
                                          He would make the old folk think back home,
                                          That war was only a hippodrome.
                                          
                                          He would speak of camp as a chummy thing
                                          Where comrades loiter and laugh and sing.
                                   
                                   
                                          He wrote and wrote--and his heart grew glad!--
                                          Well, after all, war wasn't so bad;
                                          It had brought to him good comrades new
                                          To cherish with friends he was writing to.
                                          So he grinned and pledged The Flag new might--
                                          And grinners are hell when they start to fight!
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                   THE CHAPLAIN'S ELM
                                   
                                          I NEVER have cherished ambitions to
                                                 be
                                          Regarded as more than a friendly old tree.
                                          Each summer, for years, with my wide-spreading
                                                 boughs,
                                          I've sheltered the horses, the sheep and the
                                                 cows.
                                   
                                   
                                          I've been a great tree in my time, but was
                                                 told
                                          That even the mighty at last must grow old.
                                          And so, well resigned to Time's saddest
                                                 decree,
                                          I parted with boughs that were precious to me.
                                   
                                   
                                          Then, as one who sorrows and later relents,
                                          I woke up one day in a city of tents.
                                          Beneath me were soldiers and music of bands,
                                          While 'round me there echoed the
                                                 Colonel's commands.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          I heard him give orders delightful to me;
                                          "Have guard mount this evening beneath the old
                                                 tree!"
                                          Again and again I was thrilled by salutes
                                          That came from the weary, shade-hungry recruits.
                                   
                                   
                                          'Twas then I awakened to Loyalty's
                                                 needs--
                                          Had not other elms served their country with deeds?
                                          Beneath them men fought and beneath them they made
                                          The laws on which Freedom's foundation was
                                                 laid.
                                   
                                   
                                          And so, with the Colonel, the Captains and all,
                                          I've entered the army at Liberty's
                                                 call.

                                          But most had come from Lord-knows-where
                                          With any old clothes they had.

                                          Some quit the Office for war's grim cause
                                          And some left The Smithy Door.
                                   
                                   
                                   
                                          None cared much from whence he had come,
                                          That was all of small moment now;
                                          They were one beneath Old Glory's folds
                                          And bound by a common vow.
                                   
                                   
                                          But soon they'll march to another land,
                                          To another Lord-knows-where,
                                          And peace will reign where the war lord ruled
                                          When they have turned back from there.
