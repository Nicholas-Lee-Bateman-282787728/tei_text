SONGS OF THE SUN-LANDS.</head>
                    	<milestone unit="typography" rend="center" n="* * * * * "/>

<p rend="i">Selections from some criticisms of Mr. Miller's
new volume of Poems, which have appeared in
the English journals.</p>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Atheneum.</head>

	<p>"Songs of the Sun-Lands" is, it will be seen, similar in character to "Songs
of the Sierras," previously published. The same kind of materials is used, and
the same kind of faults and excellence in their use is observable. Mr. Miller's
muse in this, its second flight, has taken the same direction as in its first essay,
but, upon the whole, we think, with a stronger wing. The new work gives evidence 
that the author has not, as was feared, intensified his former mannerism,
but has profited by the advice of friends and critics.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Academy.</head>

	<p>Mr. Miller has a faculty of making himself felt through what he writes, and we
quit his poems with a mingled sense of admiration and regret: admiration of his
really great powers; regret that he seems unable to pursue one of two courses in
their application, &amp;c.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Westminster Review.</head>
	<p>We some time ago called especial attention to this new American poet's first work,
"The Songs of the Sierras," nor do we repent of our criticism. He has perhaps
lost something of that boldness, and that flavor of originality which in a certain
way reminded one of Walt Whitman without his special weaknesses and extravagances.
Still, to counterbalance this loss, he has gained a certain polish. Yet
here we perceive a danger. But Mr. Miller must be careful that he does not buy
elegance at too dear a price. We ourselves prefer the roughness of the backwoods
of America to all the drawing-room conventionalities of Europe. We prefer Mr.
Joaquin Miller's native reed-pipe to any guitar. The most perfect poem in the



<pb
                    id="VAC1127-214"
                    n="[214]"/>
present collection is without doubt "The Isles of the Amazons." Here we see Mr.
Miller at his best. Here he has put forth his real strength. It is, in short, a
poem whllich will live.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Standard.</head>

	<p>No poetry of the present age has any claim to the unconventional freedom, the
supreme independence, the spontaneity, the bold and vigorous originality, the all-
pervading passion, the unresting energy, and the prodigal wealth of imagery which
stamp the poetry before us. . . . For further specimens of Mr. Miller's present
poems we must send our readers to the volume itself, which is, with all its faults, a
very garden of delight, adorned everywhere as it is with the fairest blooms of fancy,
and breathing everywhere as it does of the sweetest and purest inspirations of the
muse.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the London Sunday Times.</head>

	<p>The success both in England and America of Mr. Joaquin Miller's " Songs of
the Sierras" has been uncontested. The tide of passionate life with which they
were charged, and the fervor of poetic appreciation and sympathy they displayed,
combined with the startling beauty and power of portions of the workmanship to
render men insensible to irregularities and inequalities of style. . . . Here we bid
farewell to Mr. Miller's delightful volume. A pleasanter companion into the enchanted
gardens of poetry we do not seek. He knows</p>
<p rend="center">"each lane and every alley green,
Dingle or bushy dell of the wild wood,
And every bosky bourn from side to side,"</p>
<p>and he conducts us to scenes to which we have no other guide. That Mr. Miller
had poetic inspiration his first volume abundantly proved. That his verse will not
be a mere well at which the traveller can drink once ere pursuing his journey, but
a full river of song hurrying through forest and meadow, and bearing with it carol
of bird and scent of flower and hay, is now sufficiently established.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Bookseller.</head>

<p>Resembling his previously published collection, in that the verses are principally 
descriptive of strange, far-away countries, and contain numerous bright,
beautiful pictures of external nature, these songs of the sun-lands will be warmly
welcomed as the riper efforts of a real poet.... And so we might proceed through
poem after poem, finding images of great and sterling poetic value. Nor, perhaps,
would it be difficult to discover some that might be called trivial and poor; but we
prefer to judge a writer by his best rather than by his worst; and Mr. Miller's
best lines stamp him a true man, - a man of sympathetic instincts and deep reverence 
for all that is high and noble in nature and humanity.</p></div2>

                    	<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Nonconformist.</head>

<p>Of all American poetry in recent years, that of Mr. Joaquin Miller is the freshest.
He is a new poet in the proper sense of the term. He owes allegiance to
no transatlantic masters, and he is no servile imitator of the modern minstrelsy of
our own country. In outward form -- in the mechanism of his poetry -- he of
course follows the fashion of the times; but the spirit is new, the tone is individual 
and distinct. In his poems for the first time the prairies, the sierras, and
the new and old life of the Far West of America, have been fairly poetized, so to
speak.... "Songs of the Sun-Lands" contains nothing, perhaps, superior to
"Arizonian" in Mr. Miller's "Songs of the Sierras;" yet it contains no poem
so crude as one or two poems in his former volume. The best here is, undoubtedly,
"The Isles of the Amazons." . . . Notwithstanding these defects, however,
we maintain that we have in Mr. Joaquin Miller a new poet, who with more culture
and higher aims is fully capable of producing in the future a poem that the world
will not willingly let die.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Globe.</head>

<p>His poetry is in no danger of suffering neglect, nor is it likely to lack admirers.
By his earlier volume, "The Songs of the Sierras," he fully proved his right to
be heard; and students of poetry have not forgotten the influence of the fresh
thought and freer music his verse contained. That, in truth, was the essence of
Mr. Miller's achievement. He had somehow broken away from the ordinary
standards of poetical composition without sacrifice of musical effect. The verse
was larger and with less restraint than could be found in other singers, moving
with a more continuous flow, and advancing in a cadence always varied and not
recurring. Something instructive in the style seemed to image both the singer
and the thing sung of, so that we were influenced not so much by this or that
particular thought, as by the romantic and picturesque effect of the whole, with its
fearless and confident description, and its untamed yet tuneful melody. To follow
the poet was like following a keen, swift rider, who rides eagerly, it matters not
whither, and who attracts us by a wild grace and a beautiful skill as he rushes
through scenes of luxuriant loveliness that would cause a less impetuous horseman
to pause and linger. That was the character of his verse as we knew it in the
earlier volume, and that also is its character here. What was best in the earlier
work is retained in this, and it still remains the best the poet can do.</p></div2>

<div2 type="part"><head rend="center i">From the Morning Post.</head>

<p>The author appears to be a true poet, with all the natural fire and tenderness
-- the spark and dew -- that fall from Helicon.... In the present collection of
poems he has largely contributed to his own fame, which was already very great,
and to the pleasure of all who can listen with sympathy to the pathetic muse expressing 
her feelings in simple but inspired strains.</p>
