                EXPLANATION
                AT last my verses are to be published! I would not trust them to a commercial
                    publisher. Come to think of it, no commercial publisher has asked for them. Why?
                    Because I am not suspected of being a poet, or a versifier or even a
                    rhymester.
                But a newspaper writer feeding a hungry column, an eight-hour librettist
                    answering the call for "extra numbers" and a college alumnus
                    helping out on the annual, finds, in checking up the rush-and-tumble work of
                    many years, that he has accumulated in his private archives quite a mess of
                    something or other that cannot be filed under the head of
                    "prose."
                Many of the items of merchandise filling these pages were prepared for various
                    musical plays. Some were tried out and  failed to
                    satisfy the yearnings of the tired business man who happened to be in the
                    theater that evening. Others were handed back to me as being too subtle or too
                    frivolous or too something. Anyway they were handed back. Some of them were sung
                    in public, but these will seem new, even to those who endeavored to hear
                    them.
                Most of them will be tagged and some dated not that I would take advantage of the
                    statute of limitations, but merely to let the reader know that I formed the
                    habit early in life and could not overcome it immediately.

                        From "The Sultan of Sulu."
                    
                    
                        The cocktail is a pleasant drink;
                        It's mild and harmless I don't think!
                        When you've had one, you call for two,
                        And then you don't care what you do.
                        Last night I hoisted twenty-three
                        Of those arrangements into me.
                        My wealth increased, I swelled with pride,
                        I was pickled, primed, and ossified;
                        But R-E-M-O-R-S-E!
                        The water wagon is the place for me.
                        I think that somewhere in the game
                        I wept and told my maiden name.
                        At four I sought my whirling bed;
                        At eight I woke with such a head!
                        It is no time for mirth and laughter,
                        The cold, gray dawn of the morning after!
                        
                        If ever I want to sign the pledge
                        It's the morning after I've had an edge;
                        When I've been full of the oil of joy,
                        And fancied I was a sporty boy!
                        The world was one kaleidoscope
                        Of purple bliss, transcendent hope.
                        But now I'm feeling mighty blue 
                        Three cheers for the W. C. T. U.!
                        R-E-M-O-R-S-E!
                        Those dry Martinis did the work for me;
                        Last night at twelve I felt immense,
                        To-day I feel like thirty cents.
                        My eyes are bleared, my coppers hot,
                        I'll try to eat, but I cannot.
                        It is no time for mirth and laughter,
                        The cold, gray dawn of the morning after!

                        I want to be a brakeman,
                        Dog gone!
                        Legs hangin' over the edge of a flat car,
                        Train goin' 'bout twenty-five miles 'n
                            hour,
                        Kickin' the dog-fennel 'long the track 
                        That's what a brakeman does.
                    
                    
                    
                        I want to be a brakeman,
                        I jing!
                        Makin' the boys git off the platform,
                        Cussin' the drayman if the skids is lost.
                        Hollers, "Back 'er a len'th,"
                            and engineer has to 
                        That's a brakeman for ye!
                    
                    
                        No conductor for me, just a brakeman,
                        By hen!
                        Can make a couplin' on the dead run,
                        Has spring-bottom pants 'n' braid on his
                            clothes,
                        Carries a lantern at night 'n' cap over his ears 
                        That's a brakeman, I'll tell ye!
                    
                    
                        I want to be a brakeman,
                        Geeminently!
                        Stand in with agents and op'rators,
                        Gits to Peru every night 'n' sees a show,
                        Knows the numbers of the trains, chaws tobacker 
                        He's a regular one, you bet!
                    
                    
                        'N' I want to be head brakeman,

                        Twistin' 'er hard, smoke rollin'
                            'round y'u,

                        Written for "Peggy from Paris." Sent back.
                            Too personal.
                    
                    
                        I
                        Behold in each a warrior bold
                        With epaulets of gleaming gold;
                        With nodding plume and jeweled sword
                        Which only heroes can afford.
                        We tremble not at war's alarms
                        We disregard each call to arms;
                        At bloodshed we can loudly laugh
                        We're Colonels on the Governor's staff.
                        We're on the Governor's staff.
                    
                    
                        CHORUS
                        Oh, the bogus military
                        Is a wondrous sight to see;
                        Napoleon in his glory
                        Was never one two three.
                        We can fight all night
                        And attack on sight
                        A bowl of deadly punch;
                        And when the dishes rattle,
                        We engage in deadly battle
                        
                        With a bang-up champagne lunch.
                        Hooray!
                        The bogus military men!
                    
                    
                        II
                        The only smoke we've seen as yet
                        Arises from a cigarette,
                        And it has always been our boast
                        We never quail except on toast.
                        Dyspepsia is our only foe;
                        The only shot that we may know,
                        The snap-shot of the photograph;
                        We're Colonels on the Governor's staff.
                        We're on the Governor's staff.
                    
                
                
                    THE COLLEGE WIDOW
                    
                        Printed in 1890 in "The Souvenir," a volume
                            issued by the Sigma Chi chapter at Purdue University.
                    
                    
                        When I was but a Freshmanand that was long ago
                        I saw her first, but did not learn her name.
                        She was at a lecture, I believe, in the first or second row,
                        And the Junior with her seemed to be her flame.
                        
                        He held her fan all evening and gazed into her eyes;
                        Thought I, "Now they're engaged, or soon will
                            be;"
                        But afterward they quarreled, as I learned with some surprise,
                        When the faculty conferred on him G. B.
                    
                    
                        That very spring a rumor in the college circles spread,
                        That a Senior had her young affections snared,
                        And after he had graduated then the two would wed;
                        'Twas even said her trousseau was
                            prepared.
                        It didn't come to pass at all; when I returned next
                            fall,
                        She had a young professor on the string;
                        He used to send her flowers, and frequently would call,
                        And kindly turn her music when she'd sing.
                    
                    
                        The prof received an offer from some college in the east,
                        And left quite unexpectedly one day;
                        Within a week the charmer wasn't grieving in the
                            least,
                        When I saw her with a Freshman at the play.
                        She had a gay flirtation with a special, taking art;
                        
                        I went with him to call, one Sunday night;
                        He kindly introduced me, then I played a villain's
                            part,
                        For I made a mash, and knocked him out of sight.
                    
                    
                    
                        O, charming college widow, I never can forget
                        The night when you put on my college pin;
                        I pressed your hand and told you that the act you'd not
                            regret,
                        And you said you'd stick to us through thick and
                            thin.
                        I remember still the picnics and that moonlight promenade,
                        Just the night before I paid for my degree,
                        When we interchanged such sacred vows, and declarations made
                        That we'd love each other through eternity.
                    
                    
                        I heard from you quite often I liked your letters, too
                        They were spicy and chuck full of college news;
                        But the interval between them soon became a month or two,
                        And our courtship seemed its interest to lose;
                        I didn't write for full three months, and one day I
                            received
                        By express, collect, each love-stick billet
                                doux,
                        
                        
                        And though I swore that I had been both jilted and deceived,
                        I returned your letters, paid the charges, too!
                    
                    
                        Last commencement I revisited the scenes of college life;
                        Six years had brought about a wondrous change.
                        I knew a few professors, who were glad to meet my wife,
                        But the students all seemed out of place and strange.
                        There was little to recall to me the olden time so sweet,
                        And so it was a pleasure, you may know,
                        At the field day exercises, unexpectedly to meet
                        An acquaintance of the happy long ago.
                    
                    
                        She looked but little older, her laugh was just as gay;
                        Beside her was a gallant Sophomore
                        Who held her parasol aloft and gushed in just the way
                        That doubtless I had gushed in days of yore.
                        I merely tipped my hat, I feared to introduce my wife,
                        For I knew that some remark might lightly fall,
                        Revealing to my better half a chapter of my life,
                        Which I'd rather she should not suspect at all.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE MICROBE'S SERENADE
                    
                        Written for "The Sho-Gun." Returned by
                            comedian. Too polysyllabic.
                    
                    
                        A love-lorn microbe met by chance
                        At a swagger bacteroidal dance,
                        A proud bacillian belle, and she
                        Was first of the animalculae.
                        Of organisms saccharine,
                        She was the protoplasmic queen;
                        The microscopical pride and pet
                        Of the biological smartest set;
                        And so this infinitesimal swain
                        Evolved a pleading, low refrain:
                        "Oh, lovely metamorphic germ!
                        What futile scientific term
                        Can well describe thy many charms?
                        Come to these embryonic arms!
                        Then hie away to my cellular home
                        And be my little diatome."
                    
                    
                        His epithelium burned with love;
                        He swore by molecules above
                        She'd be his own gregarious mate
                        Or else he would disintegrate.
                        This amorous mite of a parasite
                        Pursued the germ both day and night,
                        
                        And 'neath her window often played
                        This Darwin-Huxley serenade
                        He'd warble to her ev'ry day,
                        This rhizopodical roundelay:
                        "O, most primordial type of spore!
                        I never saw your like before,
                        And though a microbe has no heart
                        From you, sweet germ, I'll never part;
                        We'll sit beneath some fungus growth
                        Till dissolution claims us both."
                    
                
                
                    THE WOMAN WITH AN ORDINARY PAST
                    
                        Written for "The Old Town." Sent back. Too
                            biographical.
                    
                    
                        I
                        The folks in Section A
                        Who watch a problem play
                        Of the kind C. F. imports for Ethel Barrymore
                        Will pity quite a lot
                        Poor Sadie in the plot
                        Who has such a load of grief she couldn't carry more.
                        At present she is most discreet
                        She's pale and wan and sad and sweet;
                        
                        But once she went a trifle fast
                        This woman with a past.
                        This woman with a past is quite engaging
                        In plays by Mister Henry Arthur Jones
                        We look at her with streaming eyes;
                        We very deeply sympathize
                        When she relates her sins in melting tones.
                        Now I've a past of quite another color;
                        In humble walks of life my lot was cast;
                        I've nothing sinful to confess
                        I've been too well-behaved, I guess,
                        The woman with an ordinary past.
                    
                    
                        II
                        There's no poetic charm
                        In living on a farm,
                        If you can't be lured away by some Lothario.
                        The girl who sticks at home,
                        With villains does not roam,
                        She can never break into a real scenario.
                        I've not endured the tragic woes
                        Dealt out by men in evening clothes;
                        What chance have I to head the cast?
                        I have no spotted past.
                        The woman with a past is fascinating
                        She enters and the others fade away,
                        But one who's led the simple life
                        Till she becomes a lawful wife
                        
                        Cuts mighty little figure in a play.
                        I ran a boarding house till I was thirty
                        Connected with a bank account at last;
                        No need of taking up your time;
                        I've not committed any crime 
                        I'm sorry, but I haven't got a
                            past.
                    
                    
                        III
                        I've never learned as yet
                        To smoke a cigarette
                        Or to wear a gown that's very much decolle-tay.
                        I don't know how to drape
                        My simple western shape
                        In a clinging gown of most expensive quality.
                        I've got a man I call my own;
                        I leave all other men alone;
                        My reputation you can't blast;
                        I haven't any past.
                        The woman with a past gets in the papers
                        With pictures of the men that she has known,
                        But one without her first divorce
                        Has not a claim on fame, of course;
                        The scandal sheets all leave her quite alone.
                        Her life is quite devoid of all excitement;
                        She never sets the social world aghast;
                        Oh, pity the unhappy lot
                        Of one whose life's without a blot
                        The woman with an ordinary past.
                    
                
                
                
                    LEAVE IT TO THE BOYS IN THE NAVY

                        I
                        From the rousing times of old Paul Jones
                        Down to the present day,
                        There's one good toast we all can boast
                        If we live in the U. S. A.
                        When the lights are up and the music swells
                        And the waxen floor it gleams,
                        Each maiden fair says, "Where, oh where
                        Is the hero of my dreams?"
                        Up steps the neat little middy,
                        Up steps the gay cadet,
                        Broad of shoulder, he can hold her
                        In a way she won't forget.
                        The Annapolis style of dancing
                        Is the one the girls all like
                        With partners in demand
                        Civilians cannot land
                        Leave it to the boys in the navy.
                    
                    
                        II
                        Decatur kept the flag on high
                        And Farragut never quit;
                        
                        Old Fighting Bob while on the job
                        Was full of nerve and grit.
                        At the present day we've heroes still,
                        They're never known to stop,
                        When cold champagne comes down like rain
                        They never miss a drop.
                        Up come the men from the squadron,
                        Up to the banquet hall;
                        Meet all comersthey are hummers;
                        Never a one will fall.
                        Off in the foreign countries,
                        Where they are wined and dined,
                        They answer each request
                        And finish with the rest
                        Leave it to the boys in the navy.
                    
                    
                        III
                        When Teddy told the navy boys
                        To sail around the world,
                        Till every land would understand
                        Our flag was still unfurled;
                        The weaklings were beset by fear,
                        But not the boys in blue.
                        Through stormy straits they braved the fates
                        And brought each vessel through.
                        Here's to the men who are sailing
                        Far in the distant seas;
                        They're not boastingsimply coasting,
                        
                        Learning their A, B, C's.
                        A cheer for the men on the flag-ship,
                        For the little gun-boat, too.
                        When work is to be done,
                        Or when there's any fun,
                        Leave it to the boys in the navy.
                    
                    
                        IV
                        We don't go looking for a scrap;
                        We're friendly as can be,
                        But we sleep each night with hearts more light
                        When see count our ships at sea.
                        There have been wars, there may be wars,
                        When the crowding nations meet:
                        We'll sit back tightbe sure we're right,
                        And then turn loose the fleet.
                        Trust to the men in the navy,
                        Commodore to cadet;
                        Strong and steady, always ready,
                        Never have failed us yet.
                        They shoot very straight in the navy
                        And they don't know how to run
                        From any sort of fellow, whether white or whether yellow 
                        Leave it to the boys in the navy.

                        Have asked in a manneh most emphatic
                        What the cullud race will do.
                        Will the Aff'o-American population
                        Keep growin' at such a rate
                        That by and by they'll rule the nation
                        An' control most ev'ry state?
                        The statesmen up in Washington
                        This problem soon must face;
                        It seems to worry ev'ry one
                        
                            Excep' the cullud race.

                        An' we neveh traveled fah,
                        But we hoped and prayed for Emancipation
                        An' a job on a Pullman cah.
                        You turned us free, you said to us,
                        
                        "Your culluh's no
                            disgrace."
                        So if we're heah you must not cuss
                        The humble cullud race.
                    
                    
                        When a coon tries to enteh some profession
                        The white man hollers, "Stop!
                        You're gettin' fresh; it's my
                            impression

                        But s'pose there hadn't been rag-time musicians 
                        What would the white folks sing?
                        And how would actors hold their positions
                        If they didn't do buck an' wing?
                        You little guess how much you owe
                        To 'e man with the chahcoal face 
                        You'd neveh had a minstrel show
                        Excep' for the cullud race.
                    
                    
                        We commit some wrongs in the cohts it's written

                        Such a crime as suicide.
                        We may be pooh, down-trodden creatures,
                        But many a millionaire
                        Would like to have our smilin' features
                        An' a life as free from care.
                        With pickaninnies just enough

                        Three meals a day it ain't so tough
                        To belong to the cullud race.

                        What man dare say that he is quite immune
                        From charms and spells that ev'ry girl
                            possesses?
                        A budding love is like the warmth of June,
                        That lulls and dulls his senses ere he guesses;
                        Yet who should seek to fly from such attack?
                        Though stricken sore, I hold my charmer blameless;
                        My truant heart I would not summon back,
                        I leave it in the care of one who's
                            nameless.
                    
                    
                        He jests at scars who never felt the blow
                        That comes when love first smites and sends him
                            reeling;
                        The stinging arrow speeds and brings him low,
                        While pain and pleasure blend in that new feeling.
                        I care not if the wound will never heal;
                        My weakness I proclaim in manner shameless;
                        I'll never see her more and yet I feel,
                        I'll love thro' all the years the

                        The criminal of other days
                        Was tortured in outlandish ways;
                        Upon the rack they'd break his back
                        Or at the stake they'd burn him.
                        Sometimes they'd strap him to a wheel
                        And stretch him till he'd loudly squeal;
                        Nor heed his pitiful appeal,
                        As on the spikes they'd turn him.
                        But crime is merely a disease;
                        Each scientific mind agrees;
                        We're kind to all offenders in our day;
                        For the burglar who would kill us
                        Has been stung by a bacillus,
                        So we dose him up and send him on his way.
                    
                    
                        To-day if you commit a crime,
                        You have a most delicious time;
                        A wagon blue will carry you
                        To a large stone institution.
                        The clerk assigns you to a suite,
                        With chiffonier and window seat,
                        An iron bedstead, trim and neat
                        And a sign: "No persecution."
                        
                        For crime is merely a disease;
                        Our jail officials strive to please;
                        They humbly come and ask you, "Did you
                            ring?"
                        Humanitarian methods sweet
                        Have made each pen a glad retreat
                        And Newport's no more pleasant than Sing

                        Within our jails is often met
                        The most exclusive social set:
                        The bank cashier, a financier,
                        Who has a way that's taking;
                        The man whose auto speed was high,
                        The one whose alimony's shy,
                        And college lads, who often try
                        Their hands at window breaking.
                        For crime is merely a disease,
                        Or else such lovely folks as these
                        Would never be connected with a crime.
                        It's getting to be quite a fad
                        To pay a fine for being bad;
                        It's no disgrace to serve a little time.
                    
                    
                        If you have tried in vain to know
                        The leaders of the social show,
                        To the county jail you straightway go,
                        On a charge of kleptomania.
                        Attractive ladies bring to you
                        Fresh roses every day or two;
                        
                        They hold your hand if you feel blue,
                        And there's nothing said to pain you.
                        For crime is merely a disease
                        And so the woman's club decrees
                        That jailbirds must be coddled and caressed.

                        To tell of Newport capers,

                        No Stock Exchange and tickers

                        Where youth may get a knowledge
                        Of chorus girls and cigarettes, of poker and the
                            like;

                            thing they call mince-pie.

                            might think;
                        And during intermission,
                        We always crave permission,
                        Before we walk on other people just to get a
                            drink.

                            hands;

                        We don't play golf and tennis,
                        And we never know the menace
                        Of a passing fad or fancy that may turn the
                            nation's head;
                        I'm proud of my dominion
                        
                        When I voice the bold opinion
                        That we'll never know the tortures of a
                            patent folding-bed.
                        And that is why, you'll understand,
                        I love my own, my native land,
                        My little isle of Sulu,
                        Smiling isle of Sulu!
                        I'm not ready to say good-by;
                        I'm mighty sorry that I have to die.

                        We figured once on fans and screens 
                        We figure now on the Philippines.
                        It's not the style to pat my head;
                        The white man shakes my hand instead.
                        I once was a cute little joke of a Jap,
                        But now I'm a fierce little war-making
                            chap,
                        And nobody's really anxious to scrap,

                        Since Gilbert wrote of Nanki-Pooh,

                        You thought that we were acrobats,
                        You find us high-browed diplomats.
                        
                        We've a government very much like your own,
                        Our Mikado sits on a golden throne,
                        Over here Mister Morgan rules alone,
                        Like the modern Japanee.
                    
                    
                        Jap, oh Jap, oh Japanee,
                        I'd rather fight than drink my tea;
                        Brown as a berry, busy as a bee,
                        Ichi ban! Ichi ban! Japanee.
                        My flag is found on ev'ry sea;
                        The Russian and the tough Chinee,
                        Can tell a lot regarding me,
                        Banzai! Hoopla! Japanee!

                        Each man is like a noble steed;
                        When he's a colt I take him;
                        I lock him up and watch his feed,
                        In course of time I break him.
                        I hitch him to my little cart,
                        I hold the reins above him,
                        Flick lightly on some tender part,
                        To let him know I love him.
                        
                        Then to the road, the public road, where ev'ry one may
                            see,
                        What a big and beautiful, well-groomed animal now belongs to
                            me!
                        Don't let him balk! Don't let him
                            walk!
                        Give him to understand,
                        You have the say, he's to obey,
                        And keep the whip in your hand.
                        Each man is like a noble steed,
                        He's proud of his position,
                        And thinks because he's in the lead,
                        He runs the expedition.
                        Some one may envy you the brute,
                        And steal him, if they're able;
                        So ev'ry night, if you are cute,
                        You'll lock him in the stable.
                        The boulevard, so smooth and hard, is where you work him out,
                        But keep the blinders on him so that he can't look
                            about.
                        Don't let him jump, give him a thump;
                        Prove that you have the sand;
                        Show that you're game, he will be tame,
                        And learn to eat from your hand.
                        Crack! crack! Clickety clack!
                        Don't let him stumble or loaf or slack!
                        Crack! crack! Steady, Jack!
                        Keep the boy in the beaten track.
                        
                        Whoa, boy! Slow, boy!
                        Gently give your command;
                        He will mind, if you're kind,
                        But keep your whip in your hand!

                        I'm great and
                        I know it.
                        People can't understand me.
                        I can't understand myself.
                        I don't want to.
                        If I did understand myself
                        I wouldn't be great.

                            Across my brow.
                        
                        
                            O what of joy?
                        
                        
                            O what of grief?
                        
                        
                            Darkness blank a sob in the throat.
                        
                        
                            O phantom, phantom, phantom!"
                        
                        
                        Pretty good, eh?
                        Especially if it has
                        Some little, smudgy, inky
                        Pictures strung along the edges.
                        I used to write about
                        Men and women, back yards,
                        Plain courtships, flowers and other things
                        That people understood.
                        Now I write lines that have
                        No meaning, because they are
                        Fragments of dreams that
                        Were never dreamt.
                        
                            "A soul writhed long
                        
                        
                            In its purple belongings.

                            Caught up in the wan hand of sleep
                        
                        
                            And clotted with the dawn."
                        
                        Do you notice the "O"
                        The upper-case "O"?
                        I use that a great deal.
                        If anyone will tell me
                        What I am writing about
                        I will let him smoke my
                        Opium pipe all afternoon.
                        These little, twisted,
                        Ugly, whirligig pictures
                        
                        Have nothing to do with
                        The lines I am writing.
                        If I tell about a midnight trance,
                        I have a picture of a sunrise.
                        If the lines mention something
                        About a maiden with snaky hair
                        The picture is that of a demon
                        With a forked tail.
                        This is genius.
                        The world didn't find it out
                        Until last year.
                        There are but two colors
                        In all this world yellow
                        And another shade of yellow.
                        I am very yellow myself,
                        But people say I am great.
                        I write my stuff on yellow paper
                        And use yellow ink.
                        Excuse me for awhile;
                        I'm full of hop.

                        I am a dashing, gay Lothario;
                        I've a reputation as a gallant beau;
                        Courting pretty girls is a habit hard to break;
                        I'm a bold coquette and rather reckless rake.
                        
                        I've told my love to many a girl,
                        But never a word was true,
                        For my passion intense, it was a mere pretense
                        Until I encountered you.
                    
                    
                        I've been courting many, many times;
                        In the most exclusive circles I'm a pet 
                        Writing little notes, and inditing tender rhymes
                        To the maids of ev'ry station that
                            I've met.
                        I've sworn that each was my first love,
                        But never a word was true,
                        For I never knew bliss of a kind like this,
                        Until I encountered you.
                    
                    
                        Since I first met you,
                        Since I first met you,
                        The open sky above me seems a deeper blue;
                        Golden, rippling sunshine warms me through and through,
                        Each flower has a new perfume,
                        Since I met you!

                        When you are feeling out of gear
                        And blue as indigo;
                        The world devoid of any cheer,
                        Your spirits rather low;
                        
                        Now this is what you ought to do, and that without delay:
                        Go seek the matrimonial mart get married right away.
                        For men they come, and men they go,
                        Don't wait until to-morrow;
                        For those who wait too long may know
                        A spinster's lot is sorrow.
                        Shut your eyes! grab a prize!
                        Choose a male at the bargain sale.
                        To single joys your last farewells,
                        And ring those foolish wedding-bells.

                            So now escape I pray.

                            Oh, awful message
                            How it chills my heart.

                            The flames are roaring loudly,
                            Oh, what a fearful sound!
                        
                        
                        
                            You can hear the people shrieking
                            As they jump and strike the ground.
                            Oh, horror overtakes me,
                            And I merely pause to say
                            That the building's doomed for certain
                            Oh, haste, oh, haste away.

                            Yet we will sing a few more arias
                            Before we start.

                            Now, e'er I retreat,
                            Lest death o'ertakes me
                            I'll speak of the fear
                            That convulses and shakes me.
                            I sicken to think what may befall,
                            Oh, horror! horror!! horror!!!

                            The woman speaks the truth,
                            And there can be no doubt
                            That we will perish soon
                            Unless we all clear out.

                    THE CHAPERON
                    
                        From "The Fair Co-Ed."
                    
                    
                        The very first duty of a chaperon
                        Is to leave the young folks quite alone;
                        Permitting them to sit up late
                        In twos and twos and tête-à-tête
                        
                        Whatever that may mean.
                        When a giddy old girl is on the shelf
                        And can't have any more fun herself,
                        It gives her a certain kind of thrill
                        To know that others are in it still.
                    
                    
                        A good professional chaperon
                        No breach of etiquette will condone,
                        And yet if she is fly she'll know
                        To hang around would be de trop
                        
                        Whatever that may mean.
                        Although I'm old and quite pass
                        
                        I was a lulu in my day;
                        
                        Each girl has a right to a private squeeze
                        But she must not sit on a gentleman's knees.
                    
                    
                        I love to chaperon a bunch
                        Of beautiful buds, and I've a hunch
                        The reason they all send for me
                        It's because I'm gay as I used to be,
                        'Way back in the summer of eighty-three 
                        Sing hey for the chaperon!

                        I speak for poor little woman
                        Please do not turn away;
                        Oh, mighty man, do what you can,
                        Our misery to allay.
                        Just think how it makes us suffer
                        To watch a procession go past,
                        And not have a right to march half the night
                        And bring home a package at last.
                        You give us lovely pearls in strings,
                        You buy us rings and other things;
                        I've even heard of wealthy chaps,
                        Who go as far as sable wraps.
                        But when for ballots we insist,
                        We'd rather not be hugged and kissed;
                        
                        Tho' once a little house-hold pet,
                        I'm now a fighting suffragette.
                    
                    
                        I plead for weak little woman 
                        She's but a captive bird;
                        Tho' called a wife, locked up for life,
                        She never dares say a word;
                        I plead for down-trodden woman,
                        The slave of a tyrant called man;
                        He loves her so much, he'll stand for a touch,
                        But keeps her at homeif he can.
                        You've petted us, you've fondled us,
                        When you see us you make a fuss,
                        You've crowned us as the queens of earth
                        You've blown yourselves for all
                            you're worth;
                        But darn the diadem on my brow!
                        I want a vote and want it now;
                        And you can't smother my regrets
                        With motor cars and violets.
                    
                    
                        Shoulder to shoulder, sisters!
                        Wait for emancipation day!
                        Fight for the right, until the light
                        Drives ev'ry cloud away!
                        Shoulder to shoulder, sisters!
                        Up with the flying petticoat!
                        Stand by your gun, man's on the run,
                        You've got a right to vote!

                                He must not be wild and clubby,
                                He must never roam.

                                For a change you will be pleading
                                If he spends his time in reading,
                                Some excitement you'll be needing,
                                If he stays at home.

                                But if I've an invitation
                                To some gay affair,
                                He must show an inclination
                                To escort me there.

                                If he comes home feeling dreary,
                                Says your friends all make him weary,
                                Won't go out with little deary,
                                What a happy pair!

                                To each there's some objection,

                                For some are slow and others go
                                A pace that's very fast.
                                So take them as you find them.
                                If they have faults, don't mind
                                    them;
                                Just let him have his own sweet way,

                                I have always had a notion

                                Just let him have his own sweet way,
                                And your honeymoon will last.
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                    "THE LA GRIPPE"
                    
                        Written for the Purdue University "Souvenir"
                            1890.
                    
                    
                        I am not hypercritical on points of punctuation;
                        A misplaced comma now and then is surely not a sin;
                        I overlook the sundry breaks of common conversation
                        And do my wincing inwardly when some "I
                            seen" creeps in.
                        To wretched double negatives some friends are quite addicted;
                        They knife the good King's English and then
                            revel in its gore;
                        These crude idiosyncrasies are never contradicted,
                        For I would not seem pedantic or appear a learned
                            bore.
                    
                    
                        Yet the whiskered proverbs tell us, and I know they tell us
                            truly,
                        That forbearance as a virtue cannot always be
                            construed,
                        
                        And the camel's dorsal vertebrae, if weighted down
                            unduly,
                        Will sustain a compound fracture with a fatal
                            promptitude;
                        And when a college maiden, intellectual and charming,
                        Sends me a little perfumed note, regretful in its
                            tone,
                        "To learn that all your symptoms are especially alarming,
                        And the doctor fears that the 'la
                            grippe' has claimed you for its own";
                        Then I howl and curse a little, and I stamp upon the letter,
                        And I boil with indignation to think that any one,
                        Who long has studied French, should not, apparently, know
                            better
                        Than to write it "the la grippe,"
                            when but one "the" would have done.
                        A break like this affects me in a manner almost fatal,
                        'Tis even worse that the "la
                            grippe" 
                        Hevings! I have gone and done it myself!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE COLLEGE SERENADE
                    
                        From "The Fair Co-Ed."
                    
                    
                        When the chapel bell struck the midnight hour
                        And the campus lay asleep,
                        We'd count the strokes from the ivy tower,
                        Then out from our dens we'd creep;
                        And the guiding star in the lonely night
                        For all of that rollicking crew,
                        As it gleamed afar 'twas the signal light
                        Where she waited for me and you.
                    
                    
                        Oh, sweet co-ed! Oh, college maid!
                        The one we went to serenade.
                        Oh, star-lit night!
                        Oh, glimpse of white,
                        At the window overhead!
                        Back, through the years
                        Of smiles and tears,
                        I'll dream of that rare co-ed.

                        I can say to all mah troubles,
                        "Ah! fly, ah! fly away!"

                    THE GAMES WE USED TO PLAY
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun."
                    
                    
                        Back in the golden days of youth,
                        On a farm in I-o-way;
                        Happiest days of all were they, 
                        If you don't care what you say.
                        Nothing to do but milk the cows,
                        And feed the gentle stock,
                        And work like a Turk from early morn
                        Till nearly eight o'clock.
                        The only joy of the country boy,
                        To fill his soul with glee,
                        On a frosty night, when the moon shone bright,
                        Away to the husking bee.
                    
                    
                        
                            Go to the East, go to the West,
                        
                        
                            Go to the one that you love best;
                        
                        
                            If she's not here to take your part,
                        
                        
                            Choose another with all your heart.
                        
                        
                            Down on this carpet you must kneel
                        
                        
                            As sure's the grass grows in the field,
                        
                        
                            Salute your bride and kiss her sweet,
                        
                        
                            And then you rise upon your feet.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Oft' I recall the girl I loved,
                        In the days of long ago;
                        Muscular maid of six feet two,
                        With a cheek of rosy glow.
                        I would escort my Genevieve
                        To many a husking bee,
                        And she at the call of "ladies choice"
                        Would always grab for me.
                        With a sudden swoop and a merry whoop,
                        She'd mop me 'round the floor,
                        And though I'd resist, I was always kissed,
                        Sing hey, for the days of yore!
                    
                    
                        
                            I think I hear the rain-crow say,
                        
                        
                            I think I hear the rain-crow say,
                        
                        
                            I think I hear the rain-crow say,
                        
                        
                            "It ain't a-goin' to rain no
                                more."
                        
                        
                            Swing your true love, swing her back again,
                        
                        
                            Swing your true love, swing her back again,
                        
                        
                            Swing your true love, swing her back again,
                        
                        
                            It ain't a-goin' to rain no more.
                        
                    
                    
                        Best of the pleasures that we knew,
                        In the days that now have fled,
                        Snuggled so warm and holding hands,
                        In the big old-time bob-sled.
                        Calico damsels just as proud
                        As any queen in silk,
                    
                    
                    
                        And we didn't take them out to dine,
                        They lived on mush and milk.
                        But the noisy fun when the work was done,
                        And the cider flowing free,
                        With a "balance all," at the fiddler's
                            call,
                        We'd swing in the jamboree.
                    
                    
                        I long and sigh for the days gone by,
                        I pine for the rustic charm
                        Of the dear old games, the queer old games
                        We played down on the farm.
                    
                
                
                    "NOOVO RISHE"

                                I am wild to be like Marie Antoinette
                                With a grand saloon for just
                                    the toppy set;
                                I would like to say, "Mon ami-Voulez vous
                                        comprenez jammy"
                                
                                Which is all the French that I have learned as yet.
                                It has also been my very ardent wish,
                                To stand in line along with Mrs. Fish.
                                I am tired of hotel cooking, for a Newport house
                                    I'm looking,
                                And I want to get away from all the noovo
                                        rishe.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                Mrs. B.:
                            
                            
                                We landed in the great big town, without a maid or
                                    valey,
                            
                            
                            
                                Each evening we strolled up and down that gorgeous peacock
                                    alley.
                                The elevator man was nice, the waiters were
                                    congenial:
                                But still we didn't cut much ice,
                                    unless we tipped a menial.
                                We'd see the bunch come in to lunch, they called
                                    it day-jho-nay,
                                
                                I made a vow that I somehow would know them all
                                    some day.
                                A woman who is clever, and works each social lever,
                                Must bide her time and never be worried by a
                                    snub.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        CHORUS
                        
                            This matron started in to climb, it was a fearful task.
                        
                        
                            
                                Mrs. B.:
                            
                            
                                I met the proper sort in time, if any one should ask.
                                I am trying hard to shake my western burr
                                And a woman's hired to make me talk
                                    like her.
                                When I'm seated at a table I am proud to say
                                    I'm able,
                                To pick out each kind of fork without a slur.
                                I have learned that if I wish to be
                                    "katish"
                                And to occupy a really good posish,
                                
                                I must be persona gratin to the blue
                                    blood of Manhattan,
                                So I long to get away from all the noovo
                                        rishe.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                    LOVE, YOU MUST BE BLIND
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun."
                    
                    
                        Tell me if you can, the rule by which a man
                        Selects his worse or better half.
                        Truly it would seem to be a lott'ry scheme,
                        The prizes often make one laugh.
                    
                    
                        The woman slim and thin and tall,
                        Will love a human butter ball;
                        While one who's round and plump and fat,
                        Adores some one as tall as that.
                        
                        The author of a learned book,
                        Is sometimes wedded to his cook;
                        The girl who's frivolous and gay,
                        Picks out a meek Y. M. C. A.
                        The statesman with ambition high,
                        Will choose a social butterfly;
                        The Charley kind of mamma's pet
                        Pursues the elderly soubrette.
                        You've seen the beauty linked by fate
                        To freckled Fred, whose eyes don't mate.

                        The howling swell will court a peach,
                        All paint and powder, pads and bleach;
                        And dainty Dottie, small and neat,
                        Loves awkward John, all hands and feet.
                        The man who sixty years has seen,
                        Gets mashed on something just sixteen;
                        The stylish maid, divinely fair,
                        A fiddling freak with lots of hair.
                        A well-bred heiress will elope
                        With one who uses scented soap;
                        While gray-haired widows oft amaze
                        By taking tender boys to raise.

                    BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION
                    
                        From "The Sultan of Sulu." Sung by a chorus
                            of American soldiers.
                    
                    
                        We haven't the appearance, goodness knows,
                        Of plain commercial men;
                        From a hasty glance, you might suppose
                        We are fractious now and then.
                        But though we come in warlike guise
                        And battle-front arrayed,
                        It's all a business enterprise 
                        We're seeking foreign trade.
                    
                    
                        We want to assimilate, if we can,
                        Our brother who is brown;
                        We love our dusky fellow-man
                        And we hate to hunt him down.
                        So, when we perforate his frame,
                        We want him to be good.
                        We shoot at him to make him tame,
                        If he but understood.
                    
                    
                        REFRAIN
                        We're as mild as any turtle-dove
                        When we see the foe a-coming,
                        Our thoughts are set on human love
                        When we hear the bullets humming.
                        
                        We teach the native population
                        What the golden rule is like,
                        And we scatter public education
                        On ev'ry blasted hike!
                    
                
                
                    SHE'S JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun."
                    
                    
                        In a wood lived Brother Rabbit,
                        Of a most flirtatious habit,
                        He would wag his ears at ev'ry Bunny that
                            he'd meet.
                        No one in the world of fashion,
                        Thought him capable of passion
                        Till one day he up and took a little wife so sweet.
                        On the wedding day his sister
                        Met the happy bride and kissed her,
                        But like ev'ry sister she was doubtful of the
                            match.
                        For she whispered to her brother,
                        "I'd have chosen any other,
                        She is not entitled to the season's only
                            catch."
                        Brother Rabbit simply said;
                        "She's the one I want to wed;
                        
                        And to all who ask me why,
                        I can only make reply:
                        'She's just a little diff'rent from the
                            others that I know,
                        Her smile is more beguiling and her voice is soft and
                            low.
                        No other may discover why I dote upon her so,
                        She's just a little diff'rent from
                            the others that I know.'"
                    
                    
                        Brother Rabbit doubtless knew some
                        Friends who came with faces grewsome,
                        Saying to him, "Well, old man, it seems a
                            great mistake;
                        For this most designing Bunny
                        Simply took you for your money,
                        We are sorry you have made this matrimonial
                            break."
                        I suppose that each relation
                        Showed a certain hesitation,
                        When it came to throwing rice and wishing longest
                            life;
                        And when I, like Brother Rabbit,
                        Seek your hand and quickly grab it,
                        All my friends will wonder why I chose you for my
                            wife.
                        To these skeptics I will say
                        "She has won my heart away;
                        
                        And if you would ask me why,
                        I can only make reply:
                        'She's just a little diff'rent,
                            etc.'"
                    
                
                
                    OH, WHAT A BUMP!

                        At a musicale, a five-o'clock,
                        Or social jamboree,
                        'Tis there the swagger people flock
                        For a bite and a sip of tea;
                        And this is what you hear:
                        "It's been a charming afternoon;
                        Delighted, don't you know;
                        Sorry I have to leave so soon,
                        But really I must go."
                        But after she's away
                        In her coup,

                    THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH
                    
                        Written for the National Convention of the Sigma Chi fraternity
                            at Jamestown, Virginia, 1907.
                    
                        You'll recall, if you're strong on historical
                            stuff,
                        The name of that highly deluded old fluff
                        Who chartered a schooner and sailed o'er the sea 
                        Long after Columbus, but long before me 
                        Through primeval forests he went on a quest
                        Of the fountain of youth lying far to the west;
                        For it seems that a sailor, who knew how to string,
                        Had told this old man of a magical spring,
                        Which would change any withered emeritus prof
                        To a lusty and vigorous freshman or soph.
                        
                        So he came and he searched oh, you must know his
                            name,
                        The text-books have boomed him and given him fame;
                        Was it Balboa? No. Or De Soto? Great Scott!
                        All the Ridpath I studied I quickly forgot.
                        No matter he firmly believed in the myth 
                        It was not Hendrik Hudson or Captain John Smith 
                        Hold on! Ponce de Leon! I knew it would come 
                        He thought that this fountain of youth would help some;
                        So he landed and built on the Jacksonville line
                        A high-priced hotel that is still doing fine.
                        Then he said to his followers, "Boys, on your way;
                        I must run down that fountain without much delay,
                        For I'm just about in I'm a thing of the
                            past,
                        And unless I'm patched up, I'm afraid I
                            can't last."
                        Now the histories tell that his search was in vain
                        And instead of returning in triumph to Spain,
                        A cocky young blade of about twenty-three;
                        He got lost in the mountains of east Tennessee;
                        Got stung by mosquitoes which gave him the shakes 
                        Got shot at by Injuns and hissed at by snakes;
                        Got tired and disgusted; got most everything
                        Except the address of that wonderful spring.
                        
                        So he took the back trail through the jungle and brake,
                        Convinced that the mariner's yarn was a fake;
                        And he died in the orthodox manner, we're told.
                        Which is often the finish of those who grow old.
                    
                    
                        PART SECOND
                        The sequel, I'm certain, you never have heard.
                        It is mystical, fanciful, never occurred;
                        It is supposititious a very good word 
                        It is purely fictitious but still it's a bird.
                        They buried the shell of this doughty old don,
                        But his resolute spirit kept marching right on;
                        The ghostly, intangible knight of Castile
                        Continued the search with persistence and zeal.
                        Through years and through decades and centuries too,
                        He roamed through the hemisphere still known as new,
                        And sought, with Diogenes' patience, the spring
                        Where Methusaleh might, as a giddy young thing
                        Have continued to bloom for a thousand years more
                        Until old Father Time would get tired keeping score.
                        He was kept rather busy, for ev'ry few days
                        He would read in a folder the unstinted praise
                        
                        Of this or that spring with a five-dollar rate,
                        Which would cure almost any disease while you wait
                        Each one, from Mt. Clemens to far Manitou
                        Guaranteed to make old people look just like new.
                        So he tested them all, and at every resort,
                        He found people drinking the stuff by the quart;
                        But at Hot Springs, Arkansas, and even French Lick
                        They were old and shot-up and disabled and sick;
                        Not one of them happy and hearty and young;
                        All lean and dyspeptic with fur on the tongue.
                        Can you blame him for doubting the absolute truth
                        Of the legend regarding the fountain of youth?
                        Wherever he journeyed, this rule seemed to hold:
                        That the young must be young and the old must be old.
                        In nineteen-ought-seven he came to a spot
                        Way down in Virginia the weather was hot 
                        The time was midsummer; the flags were unfurled,
                        And tourists were flocking from half of the world.
                        There were strange foreign people of most every race
                        And Ponce thought he'd struck a new watering-place;
                        Though he judged from the hurrah and laughter and fun
                        That twenty "resorts" had been rolled into
                            one.
                        
                        He sought the headquarters for all of the noise
                        And there he discovered a great crowd of boys,
                        All seated at tables and whooping it up
                        While quenching their thirst from a big loving-cup,
                        Which never ran empty, though score upon score
                        Drank deep and drank often and clamored for more.
                        And strange to relate, as the cup went around,
                        The old boys began to get up and expound;
                        They laughed at the jokes and they joined in each song
                        And if trouble was started they helped it along.
                        For would you believe it, though some in that room
                        Seemed old and decrepit and marked for the tomb,
                        The magical cup took them back to their teens
                        By some supernatural method or means;
                        Until doctor, professor and lawyer and sage,
                        Arrived at a most irresponsible age.
                        The traveler came to our most worthy "C"
                        And politely requested the prize recipe:
                        "Pray tell me what fluid your flagon may hold,
                        That brings crimson youth to the weary and old."
                        The consul gave answer: "To tell you the truth,
                        We're simply imbibing the Spirit of Youth;
                        Our own preparation, we keep it on tap
                        And furnish it freely to ev'ry good chap;
                        He drinks, and his boyhood returns on the fly,
                        It's a pure food concoction, and called 'Sigma
                            Chi.'"
                    
                
                
                
                    I LIKE YOU, LIL
                    
                        From "Peggy from Paris."
                    
                    
                        I t'ought I was hep to the whole string o'
                            fairies
                        Not one o' the bunch could put me to the
                            bad;
                        I'd mingled a lot with your Mauds and your Carries,
                        If one tried to kid she was sorry she had.
                        But ev'ry fly mug gets it sooner or later,
                        I know that this calico game is no cinch
                        Since I met at the ten, twent an' t'irty
                            t'eater
                        The cause of me trouble, Miss Lily Ann Lynch.
                    
                    
                        When I caught a flash me, the real Foxy Quiller!
                        Thinks I to meself, "Lily Ann,
                            you're all right;"
                        I says to the gang: "Watch me stroll up and
                            kill'er,
                        I'll cop out that princess, she's
                            mine from tonight."
                        But sa-a-y when I tried to get new wit' Miss Lily,
                        She come back so hard, me kazing! to
                            the mat;
                        An' now I'm as tame as a clothin' store
                            Willie,
                        She's got me trained proper, take my word for
                            that.
                    
                    
                        Lil, I like you, Lil, I do,
                        I don't mind tellin' this to
                            you.
                        
                        It's no case o' stringin', Lil
                        For you've got me wingin', still
                        I like you, Lil, for fair.
                    
                
                
                    LITTLE MOOZOO-MAY
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun."
                    
                    
                        The rose of June can feel no sorrow,
                        It never droops or says "Ah me!"
                        It never sees a sad to-morrow,
                        But greets each day with rapture free.
                        Why should a girl so young and charming,
                        Be less confiding than the rose?
                        For me this life holds naught alarming,
                        Each morning will new joys disclose.
                        I'm like the rose that blooms in June.
                        I give no thought to afternoon.
                        Like a rosebud red I can hang my head,
                        I can sway and pose like the drooping rose.
                        But I'm not the flow'r of a passing hour,
                        I'm a happy little singing girl,
                        I'm a jolly, pleasure-bringing girl.
                    
                    
                        REFRAIN
                        Dainty little Moozoo-May,
                        Clever little Moozoo-May,
                        
                        When the shamosen I'm playing,
                        Come the men from far and near;
                        Most bewitching Moozoo-May,
                        Quite entrancing Moozoo-May,
                        Fascinating, captivating,
                        Little Moozoo-May.
                    
                    
                        The rose of June is not retiring,
                        It wears a manner most serene,
                        And smiles on other buds aspiring
                        To be as lovely as their queen.
                        Why should a girl of matchless beauty,
                        Her many charming traits disown?
                        If she excels it is her duty
                        To lift her head and bloom alone.
                        I'm like the rose in this respect.
                        A fragrant thing without defect.
                        Like a rosebud red I can hang my head,
                        I can sway and pose like the drooping rose.
                        But I'm not the flow'r of a passing hour,
                        I'm a happy little singing girl,
                        I'm a jolly, pleasure-bringing girl.
                    
                
                
                
                    I AM "YOURS TRULY"
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun,"
                    
                    
                        How often in this careless life
                        A word but lightly spoken,
                        By magic of a love sincere,
                        Becomes a blessed token.
                        The formal message that I send to you
                        Would thrill your very soul if you but knew,
                        That ev'ry word I write is more than true 
                        "I am, I am yours truly."
                    
                    
                        REFRAIN
                        I am, I am yours truly,
                        And will be ever more,
                        The meaning of those simple words
                        I never knew before.
                        Time cannot change my deep devotion,
                        Steadfast my heart shall be,
                        I am, I am yours truly,
                        My soul belongs to thee!
                    
                    
                        The words we speak in idle jest
                        Our secret thoughts are screening,
                        Exchanging vows of deep concern
                        In terms that have no meaning.
                        
                        And yet, at times, the clasp of friendly hand
                        Appeals far more than duty's loud
                            command.
                        And so I pray that she may understand,
                        I am, I am hers truly.
                    
                
                
                    FLUTTER, LITTLE BIRD
                    
                        From "The Sho-Gun."
                    
                    
                        I
                        
                            Observe the loving mother bird,
                            Up in the spreading tree,
                            Correct with stern but loving word,
                            Her tender chickadee.
                            The feathered youngster tries to flap
                            His embryonic wings,
                            While mother cheers the little chap,
                            As to the bough he clings.
                            He makes a most heroic jump,
                            Alas, it is in vain,
                            She says: "Don't mind a little bump,
                            Just try it once again."
                        
                        
                            Flutter, little bird and keep on trying,
                            By and by you will be flying;
                            You can do it, take my word,
                            Keep on fluttering, little bird.
                        
                    
                    
                        
                        II
                        
                            At dinner parties you have met
                            Young Mister Parvenu,
                            Who views the knives and forks and spoons,
                            And wonders what to do.
                            He eats the blue points with a spoon,
                            For fish he'll use a knife,
                            He can't pick out the salad fork,
                            To save his mortal life.
                            At last the demi tasse is served,
                            A la Martin's, New
                                York,
                            The only tool that he has left,
                            One lonely oyster fork.
                        
                        
                            Flutter, little bird and keep on trying,
                            By and by you will be flying;
                            Watch the hostess, mum's the word,
                            Keep on fluttering, little bird.

                            You've seen the man from up the road,
                            With lots of ready cash;
                            Who takes a suite at ten per day
                            And hopes to cut a dash.
                            His dinner coat is very short,
                            His hat is very high,
                            
                            The fourteen karat stud he wears,
                            Will blind each passer-by.
                            But ignorance with him is bliss,
                            And he's a happy man,
                            Although his tie is ready-made,
                            And shoes are russet tan.
                        
                        
                            Flutter, little bird and keep on trying,
                            By and by you will be flying;
                            All beginners look absurd,

                            The woman who is up-to-date,
                            Must join a reading club,
                            Where matrons meet to analyze,
                            The popular flub-dub.
                            It's hard on Mrs. Malaprop,
                            Who used to be a cook,
                            And until hubby struck it rich,
                            Had never read a book.
                            She thinks that Kipling wrote
                                "Beaucaire,"
                            And can't get in her head,
                            Why Shakespeare doesn't write more books,
                            She doesn't know he's dead.

                            Clubs are helpful, so I've heard,
                            Keep on fluttering, little bird.

                            Though politics may loudly buzz
                            Each candidate has vowed
                            To seldom think, and if he does,
                            To never think out loud.
                            He simply sits in solemn state
                            And lets his friends explain
                            That he's the only candidate
                            Who's truly safe and sane.
                            He has a very deep regard
                            For ev'ry son of toil.
                            And yet he would not be too hard
                            On friends of Standard Oil.

                            Just look wise don't say a word,

                            Of all the birds that fly the air,
                            The jay-bird is the best;
                            He comes from almost anywhere
                            Out in the boundless west.
                            
                            He wants to learn to speculate,
                            The ticker he would beat;
                            He strikes a most terrific gait,
                            And dazzles all the street.
                            He causes all the stocks to jump
                            Until there comes a day,
                            When some wise bird decides to dump
                            And that's the end of Jay.

                    HENNY
                    
                        From "Peggy from Paris."
                    
                    
                        One day I went to a Saengerfest
                        On the banks of the dear old Rhine.
                        I wore a badge upon my breast
                        Of the Sweinburg Turn-Verein
                        The band was playing a lieber tune
                        And the music was soft and sweet,
                        I heard the sound of that bassoon
                        And my heart began to beat.
                        
                        My Henny played a Solo
                        That day on the beautiful Rhine,
                        And while he played hi-lee, hi-lo,
                        
                        He won this heart of mine.
                    
                    
                        REFRAIN
                        Henny, oh, Henny, come to me,
                        Across the wet and salty sea.
                        I'm longing for the happy day
                        When I can hear my Henny play:
                    
                    
                        
                            Du, du, ligst mir im herzen,
                        
                        
                            Du, du, ligst mir im sinn.
                        
                    
                    
                        I lost my heart when I heard that tune
                        That Henny played on his big bassoon.
                    
                    
                        My Henny he was a chubby boy
                        And his eyes they were baby blue.
                        For months he was my pride and joy
                        And I thought his love was true.
                        One night I strolled in the public park
                        For I hoped to find him there.
                        I heard from out the woods so dark
                        That old familiar air
                        My Henny played a solo
                        That night on the beautiful Rhine
                        And seated close beside him was
                        A lady friend of mine.
                    
                    
                    
                        
                            REFRAIN
                        
                        Henny, oh, Henny, what a blow,
                        My lady friend she stole my beau.
                        Weeping and sad I turned away
                        And as I went I heard him play:
                    
                    
                        
                            Du, du, ligst mir im herzen,
                        
                        
                            Du, du, ligst mir im sinn.
                        
                    
                    
                        My heart it broke when I heard the tune
                        That Henny played on his big bassoon.

                            CHICAGO CASTANETS
                        
                        Through all the moving thoroughfares
                        And in the contending marts of trade;
                        Within the babbling magazines and
                        Even as I rode the surcharged vehicles
                        Which rolled at dizzy onwardness
                        Without the impulse of the harnessed steed;
                        During the waking hours, bewhiles
                        I battled with the reckless wind
                        
                        And closed my eyes against the tossing clouds
                        Of vitrified disturbance, soot, dust,
                        Tattered papyrus and all the medleyed rubbish
                        Of the city's ways;
                        All this time, as I again declare,
                        And likewise in the night, when I,
                        In company with highty-ti revelers,
                        Did run with bunches of anticipation
                        Toward the gleaming letters far above
                        The portals of Thespis' temple;
                        And later yet, when all we creatures of the night
                        Did seek our warm retreats
                        To feast on rabbits, explosive salads
                        And the clammy crabmeat of commerce;
                        All during this long while, as I do now
                        Most solemnly and fearfully asseverate,
                        There came to my ear, with never pause,
                        A soft and hollow rattle.
                        At times, methought, 'twas like the
                        Spilling of many dead men's bones
                        In the adjoining vault. Again,
                        It seemed more like the tapping
                        Of distant castanets a dream
                        Of dark-eyed Spanish women, soiled and superb,
                        Who moved in jerky measures while
                        The yellow dust rose to obscure
                        The fierce colors. But, truth to tell,
                        'Twas neither. Clickety-click, clickety-click,
                        
                        I heard it yet again, and I asked:
                        "Is this some dread distemper of the brain,
                        Some fungus growth in my imaginings?
                        Do I alone of mortal men distinguish
                        This smothered clatter, hidden, elusive?"
                        When I did full relate my fears
                        To the good sculapius, he said:
                        "Fear not; 'twas actual sound you heard,
                        And you are not, as you might well suppose,
                        Entirely separated from your trolley."
                        Continuing, then, with kindly air, he told:"
                        The tiny rattling sounds which do attend
                        You and all others in this wintry clime,
                        Are the concussions of the quinine pellet
                        Tossing within its pasteboard cage;
                        For know you well that all men,
                        Likewise the women and the tender young,
                        The aged and infirm no more than those
                        Who claim youth's lusty strength,
                        The plain and eke the fair,
                        The rich and humble, frugal and
                        Improvident, all, all, carry concealed
                        The potent ammunition of the season;
                        And as they move upon their daily
                        Occupations, you hear from underneath
                        Their woolen garments, toward the Jaeger depths,
                        Muffled and yet distinct, and always rhythmical,
                        'Clickety-click, clickety-click,
                            clickety-click,'
                        
                        The tattoo of the quinine pellet.
                        Join all the others take my solemn tip,
                        Prepare to meet thine enemy, the grip."
                    
                    
                        
                            THE STEWED SAMARITAN
                        
                        Within a house of public entertainment
                        There sat an ebon slave close at the foot
                        Of a heavy chair topping a broad dais.
                        The man sat motionless, gazing pensive
                        At nothingness, yet all the while
                        He thought of numbers. Thus to sit
                        And think was, so his master averred,
                        One of the best things he did.
                        While he was so benumbed and lost
                        In fruitless meditation, there came,
                        Stepping heavily and breathing most loud,
                        A traveler in gay attire, who chanced to be
                        At this, the period of our simple tale,
                        The custodian, guard, manager, executor,
                        Captain, director and immediate chief
                        Of a comely and well-developed jag.
                        With a proprietary and assertive air
                        He climbed into the seat of honor,
                        And, with thick utterance, and, be it said,
                        A slack politeness, bade the Senegambian
                        Remove from his sandals all trace of stain
                        Or disfiguration. Promptly the youth obeyed,
                        And when his tack was ended
                        
                        The generous traveler laid within
                        The dusky palm a silver quartern,
                        And, with yammering utterance, asked
                        The simple child of Afric' far transported
                        To lead him to the harber's velvet seat.
                        Lying at ease within the odored room,
                        He slept in peace the while he yet received
                        Kindly caresses and vapory ablution.
                        Roused and sent forth, he viewed,
                        As he stepped high to pass the threshold,
                        The ebon youth once more contemplative
                        And talking to himself. "What ho!"
                        The liquorish pilgrim cried, "What ho!
                        Attend upon me! Help me to the chair!"
                        With mercenary speed the youth obeyed;
                        With honeyed words he answered all the taunts
                        And alcoholic cracks. Again he cleansed
                        The scandals, which, ere he began a second time
                        To cleanse, shone bright as any cuirass.
                        With simulated humbleness he bowed
                        As he received once more a silver piece;
                        Then, with a gentleness which well
                        Bespoke a tender and a helpful disposition,
                        He led the traveler back into the shop
                        And spread him on a chair.
                        "A shave!" huskily cried the stranger,
                        Then lapsed he into deep forgetfulness,
                        Until they shook him rudely and collected.
                        
                        Now once again behold the jag-ged man,
                        Pallid with powder, reeking with hammamelis,
                        Seeking, circuitously and with serpentine
                        Meanderings to find the door leading to the place
                        Where he could have his sandals cleaned."
                        Thrice welcome!" cried the ebon youth, merrily,
                        Boosting him, meanwhile, to the throne.
                        What visions filled th' Ethiopian's brain
                        Of pork chops, chicken, carmine neckwear
                        And the blood raw! With dreamy eyes
                        The pilgrim gazed upon the busy slave and tried,
                        With uncertain effort, to recall where
                        Or when he had seen that face before.
                        Thus dimly balmed in thought, he
                        Closed his eyes and soon thereafter drooped
                        And rolled must calmly to the floor below.
                        Now see him, under the brawny arm
                        Of the Celt, attending as house policeman,
                        Carried to where the wind blows free;
                        And the ebon youth, sad and regretful,
                        Philosophizing among the dead embers of hope,
                        Recalling that in this vale of disappointment
                        A good thing comes and seems inclined to stay
                        'Till Fate shows up and chases it away.
                    
                    
                        
                            A BUSINESS DEAL
                        
                        An ancient joker, grizzled and half-bald,
                        With the outward seeming and the attire
                        
                        Of a devout deacon, and yet possessing
                        The frolicsome nature of an unbroken colt,
                        Pushed soft his entrance to a long day coach.
                        The same, to make the purpose of the tale,
                        Was well-nigh filled with passengers
                        Of all degrees. "Where shall I sit?"
                        Thus asked the ancient joker, for, in truth,
                        His sweeping glance discovered no place
                        Vacant. Until at last! Ah, there!
                        Beside a buxom woman, well removed
                        From the endangered age of coquetry
                        And whose condens-ed features made
                        A chaperon a superfluity, there sat
                        A dog. The woman and the canine thus
                        Doubly held down a cushioned seat
                        Meant for two human beings.
                        "To stand or not to stand?
                        That is the question:
                        Whether 'tis nobler in a man to suffer
                        The crampy leg aches and the jolty motion
                        Or to take chances with the heavy female
                        And oust the dog?"
                        Not overlong he waited, for he knew
                        That sweet diplomacy might win a cause
                        Which harsh attack would lose.
                        Gently he lifted then the limber brute
                        And sat he where the dog had sat before,
                        And to the matron's cold astonishment
                        
                        He turned a smile, oily and melting
                        In its sublime benevolence.
                        Upon his knee he held the dog, stroking,
                        With unpracticed hand, the wiry coat,
                        And then he spoke. "Madam," quoth he
                        Full many a league, in this and foreign lands,
                        Have I, your servant, wandered,
                        But never in my wide perambulations
                        Have I beheld a dog of any breed
                        More pleasing to my eye than this one."
                        "Twas a judicious lie, for well he knew
                        The cur had neither pedigree nor value."
                        "Listen!" he said. "In my far-distant
                            home
                        I have a niece, a dimpled little thing,
                        Who craves a true companion.
                        If I could take this dog to her
                        Methinks I now can hear her cry with joy
                        And note her glad amazement.
                        This dog I must possess, and now,
                        In furtherance of what I most desire,
                        I offer you one hundred dollars for him."
                        Delight and fright worked for supremacy
                        Within the ample figure of that dame.
                        Moved by the subtle flattery she was,
                        And yet alarmed to know that any one
                        Should covet thus her chief possession.
                        "Alas, I dare not part with him," she said.
                        "My husband loves him. Should I now return
                        
                        Without the household pet
                        'Twould wrench his heart."
                        "What say you then to fifty dollars more?"
                        Urged the persistent one. "My niece,
                        My little, bright-eyed darling relative,
                        Must have this dog."
                        "Tempt me not!" cried the woman,
                        And speaking thus she gazed
                        More infinitely fond than e';er before
                        Upon the five. "I'll give two
                            hundred."
                        "Ah, now, methinks, you play upon my
                            avarice,"
                        The woman said. "At the next station
                        I must leave you. Better than life itself
                        I love this little dog; but thenalack-a-day!
                        Two hundred takes him!"
                        "Good! He is mine! One word, however,
                        Relating to the terms of this transaction.
                        Two hundred dollars is the price I give,
                        But not in paltry gold or silver, mind you."
                        "What, then?" she asked, and as she spoke
                        The whistle blew the signal for the station.
                        "With your permission, madam, I will pay
                        In Maltese cats worth eighty dollars each."
                        Too full of wrath to answer him
                        She fled, pressing the dear one to her bosom.
                        The ancient joker watched her mad retreat
                        And said, "I lose the dog but keep the
                            seat."
