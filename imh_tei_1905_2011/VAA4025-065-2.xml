                    so much absurdity, pride, and impiety, does not deserve to be answered," cried the good
                    pastor. Yet, having thus dismissed the foolish notion categorically, he returned to it long enough
                    answer the charge: "It can surely be no disgrace; but an high honor to patriots, to say;
                    'They acted in the cause of God,' and that, 'He smiled their

                    supposedly impious countrymen was hardly necessary. Throughout the first century of their national
                    history, most Americans seem to have believed unquestioningly that the cause of liberty was the
                    cause of God. In accounting for the presence of liberty in their land, Americans unabashedly
                    declared their belief in superintendence of a <placeName>

            <p>This essay attempts to delineate some of the major facets of the leg of providential protection for
                    the nation as the legend manifested itself popular thought from 1776 to 1876. The study is limited
                    almost exclusively to Fourth of July editorials, odes, and orations. This limitation is made only
                    secondarily because the body of Fourth of July materials, prima in the form of newspaper accounts
                    and pamphlets, is very extensive, more important consideration is that these orations, representing
                    the work of lawyers, clergymen, college professors, politicians, editors, and ordinary citizens,
                    reflect the opinion of a wide cross section of the public. Thus Fourth of July opinions can serve
                    nicely as a microcosm of most generally held ideas concerning American nationalism. Bombastic
                    phrases and pious platitudes made the Fourth of July address a masterpiece of oratory according to
                    the standards of an earlier day. But, as Merle Curti has pointed out, oration nevertheless

            <p>To avoid possible confusion, three disclaimers must be made. The author does not mean to infer that
                    the idea of a protecting <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> began suddenly in 1776 or that it ended abruptly one hundred years later. The Puritans
                    had long preceded the Revolutionaries in interpreting their experience as a part of God's
                    plan. Although the notion, in its most blatantly pietistic guise at least, began waning in the
                    latter part of the nineteenth century, largely as a result of the Darwinian and pragmatic
                    revolutions in American thought, as late as 1902 Robert E. Thompson published <hi rend="i">The Hand
                        of God in American History.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    </placeName> legend, and even the sophisticate often says that history is on the side of the
                    American system. Exploration of the idea in recent times is needed, but the sophisticate's
                    belief may be simply a modern, secular rendition of the old conviction that God in His infinite
                    wisdom will take care of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Nor, secondly, does the writer mean to imply that expression of the idea was limited
                    in any way to the occasion of the Fourth of July. The legend was much more pervasive than that.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Finally, the author is not suggesting that the conviction that God has guided
                    the nation's course is unique with <hi rend="i">American</hi> patriots. Such a belief has
                    been a common element of many nationalisms.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Yet, if not <hi rend="i">uniquely</hi> American, the idea of a protecting <placeName>

                    </placeName> was <hi rend="i">characteristic</hi> of American patriotism. Indeed, so primary was
                    this theme that no study of American nationalism can possibly ignore it and remain faithful to

                    society. As God's chosen people in the modern world, Americans believed that they must
                    recognize and respect the vital link between religion and liberty. That true freedom was somehow
                    dependent upon Christianity, they were certain. If, then, liberty was to continue to flourish, if
                    America was to remain basking in the smiles of an approving heaven, the nation must always be one of
                    sincere Christian patriots.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> legend, the American liberal experiment had nothing short of a divine origin. In a
                    century when American nationalists were plagued by doubts and fears that their vaunted republic
                    might go the way of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, to say nothing of lesser states, it was reassuring indeed to believe that their
                    patriotic aspirations were at the same time the commands of an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent
                    God. As one explores the dimensions of this <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> legend, one discovers the abundant proof that Americans offered to support their faith.
                    To a sophisticated generation schooled in more nearly "objective" or
                    "scientific" history, this "proof" may seem hopelessly naive and

                    subjective appeal it had for the first century of American nationalists. "The nation,
                    expanding violently, needed confidence to carry on its gigantic task," John William Ward
                    has said. "In its optimism it firmly believed that God had foreordained its success and it
                    therefore saw God's hand in the most unlikely places. There is no sense in protesting the
                    logic of the confident creed of expansion since, in the human process of self-justification, logic
                    has little place."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> These earlier Americans, it seems clear, believed.</p>

                    in Eden, man had turned his back on his initial freedom. As Kendall put it, man "Bowed to a
                    mortal, and forgot his God." Once he had tasted tyranny, there was plenty of time for

            <p>Still, it was possible to hold to the theory that God revealed this continent only when conditions in

                    Protestant Reformation marked the commencement of this political and spiritual liberty, the orator
                    insisted. "Was it by chance that this broad expanse of country … remained

                    And here was a virgin land, immense and fertile. Thus when the Pilgrims landed, their love of
                    liberty was "strengthened by the very scenery of the country they had chosen to inhabit.
                    Every thing around them retained the primitive features of nature."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                    Since river, lake, mountain, and forest stood in their "original integrity," the
                    settlers necessarily resolved that "man, too, should maintain the proud dignity of <hi rend="i">his</hi> nature."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Simply to live in such a land made it

                    ultimate cause of the Revolutionary War: God's ordering of nature in such a way that she
                    must eventually give rise to a new, independent nation in the West. "The author of creation
                    seems to have stampt it on the first page of the great volume of nature, that America should be
                    mistress of herself," insisted Benjamin Hichborn of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> two years after the Treaty of <placeName>

                    </placeName> had formally ended the war.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The thesis did not soon lose its
                    appeal. Years later David Ramsey reassured a group of South Carolinians celebrating the Fourth of
                    July that "The God of order and of justice could never have decreed the subjection of a
                    great continent, to a paltry island, on the other side of the ocean…. The voice of
                    reason, justice, and truth, cries out against it."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Of course what
                    cried loudest against "the subjection," though Ramsey and his hearers were
                    doubtless sincerely enamored of their own explanation, was the voice of an ardent patriotism.</p>
            <p>In the more immediate causes of the separation of the "great continent" from the
                    "paltry island," greater than mortal power was again manifested, according to the
                    legend. Had Britain heeded the colonists' just remonstrances, opined a <placeName>

                    </placeName> orator in 1810, the Union Jack might still have been waving in America. After some
                    reconsideration, however, he modified his position, declaring that the "weak-sighted and
                    corrupt ministry" of Great Britain had probably pursued the only course it could, given the
                    extenuating circumstance. For "that <placeName>

                    until his folly was recorded in the ruin of his throne, blinded the ministry to the interests of
                    their country, and caused them … to cut the golden cord, that connected America and
                        Britain."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Edmund Burke and the party of conciliation could not

            <p>American patriots celebrating their national holiday also pointed to the conduct of the War for
                    Independence as further proof of the workings of God. Daniel Webster was fond of summing up the
                    whole matter by saying that "the kind hand of over-ruling <placeName>

                    "That it was the purpose of GOD it [the Revolution] should be," declared a Fourth
                    of July orator in 1789, "is evident in his almost miraculous interpositions in favor of
                        it."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> A later patriot was even more emphatic: "Thousands
                    of instances, in the course of our astonishing revolution, of the miraculous interposition of
                    providential assistance, must convince the most hardened and inveterate of infidels."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> No American was so "hardened" as to need to hear all these
                    "thousands" of instances related one by one. Consequently orators commonly dwelt
                    on only a few of them. Considering the odds that the American colonists faced, Paul Allen, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> patriot, could ask: what gave the Americans the courage to promulgate the Declaration
                    of Independence in the first place? What caused them to challenge the military and naval power of
                    the British Empire? The question was raised solely for effect, of course. For, as Allen delighted in
                    pointing out, "The answer is easy. A certain grandeur of heart, the property of but few,
                    who may in the strictest sense be called Heaven's favourites." Indeed, while
                    proclaiming their nation's independence, these revolutionaries scarcely appeared to be
                    human at all. They were "under the operation of superior power; it was not until its
                    departure, that they sunk down to the level of mortals."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> orator, was more fascinated with the early unity that the colonists displayed in
                    supporting the war effort, despite the dissimilarity of their ethnic and national backgrounds. In
                    the singlemindedness with which they rallied around the standards of freedom and nationality, this
                    Fourth of July speaker saw clearly "the protecting aid of heaven…. What but this
                    could have given such a spirit of harmony, such strength of union and such concert of action to a
                    widely scattered people, of various habits and pursuits?"<hi rend="sup">37</hi> To
                    Osborn's hearers—who could easily ignore the fact, if they knew it, that about
                    one third of the colonists were Loyalists at heart while another one third were indifferent to the
                    American cause—the answer was obvious.</p>
            <p>Another manifestation of divine intercession in the Revolution was God's providing the

                    </placeName> seemed obvious in good times, but especially in periods of national adversity Americans
                    could behold the hand of God leading them on. Virtually every crisis resulted in the extension and

                    </placeName> legend. Decrying in 1812 the British attempts to goad the Indians onto the warpath and

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a prelude to John Bull's endeavor to reconquer his lost provinces, a
                    Kentuckian exulted: "But HE, who holds the destiny of nations in hands, overruled the
                    perfidious attempt, and we were saved."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Despite a year of military

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1813 that heaven had decreed that the British plan to overwhelm the young republic
                    must ultimately fail. "Engaged as we are in a just cause, the blessings of Almighty God
                    will be upon us."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Hay believed that both the Almighty and the
                    Americans were the adversaries of Britain.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most remarkable "divine intercession" of the entire century occurred on
                    July 4, 1826, as millions of Americans were celebrating their nation's fiftieth birthday.
                    Just as patriots were praising Thomas Jefferson and John Adams for their revolutionary deeds and for
                    their long lives spent in the nation's service, the two "Patriarchs"
                    died. In this timely event, which few believed to be mere coincidence, Daniel Webster discerned the
                    work of God: "As their lives themselves were the gifts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who is not willing to recognize in their happy termination, as well as in their long
                    continuance, proofs that our country and its benefactors are objects of His care?"<hi rend="sup">50</hi> By calling away these two founding fathers on the fiftieth Fourth of July,
                    heaven demonstrated anew its favor to the nation that they had been instrumental in establishing.
                    What great orators proclaimed at the memorial services in the large cities, little known speakers
                    declared in hamlets throughout the land. Meeting in Macon to consider the "Wonderful
                    coincidence!" Georgians concluded with eulogist James S. Frierson that the American mind,
                    searching for causes, "wanders through a labarinth [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of
                    difficulty—is lost in its own investigation—recoils upon itself, and is forced
                    to this conclusion—it is the work of Him who governs all!"<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
                    When, shortly after July 4, "a celebrated Mathematician" calculated that the
                    chance of this occurrence was "only one in <hi rend="i">twelve hundred

                    who believed that the Union had been saved by greater than human force found it easy to credit the
                    theory that God had raised up a leader to do His bidding. In his editorial written for "our

                    </placeName> Unionist called upon his patrons to pay "tribute to memory of him [Abraham
                    Lincoln] who was the chosen instrument of God to lead us out of the darkness of the past into this

                    argued that it was impossible, "even for a mind not accustomed to look beyond natural
                    causes," to reflect on the critical war years without perceiving the fiat of the Almighty.
                    Thus Abraham Lincoln was surely God's instrument for putting down the rebellion and ridding
                    the nation of the dreadful scourge of slavery. To Stebbins it seemed certain that just as

                    George W. Julian, who insisted that he had "no taste for glittering generalities,"
                    nevertheless included the notion of America's reliance on God in his Fourth of July speech
                    in 1872. Decrying the monopoly of banks, "the railway power," and the precarious
                    position of labor, Julian could still maintain his faith in democracy. Why? Because "the
                    Almighty will not now call a halt in the grand march of events, through which he is bringing our
                    land with real liberties and lasting peace."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> merits elaboration. Many nineteenth century American nationalists seem to have
                    subscribed to the notion that God best remembers those who remember Him. Everyone knew that whenever

                    the often repeated Fourth of July analogy to its logical conclusion, warned that if the modern <placeName>

                    which had been preached from the text of Isaiah 1:2: "Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O
                    earth; for the Lord hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled
                    against me." Recounting "in this evil day" the story of God's

                    least equalled—if it did not actually surpass—that of Judah of old. Such
                    degeneracy and rebellion were present in the lack of family prayer, neglect of discipline in
                    families and churches, profanation of the Sabbath, swearing, and intemperance that <placeName>

            <p>Few patriots doubted that there was a definite relationship between religion and political stability.
                    John Jones Spooner, a Virginian, told a Fourth of July audience in 1794 that even among the heathens
                    "public affairs were prospered, according as they observed the rites of their
                    religion." At no time were the ancient republics of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> so prosperous and stable as when "they practiced most assiduously those duties
                    which their religion (erroneous as it was) enjoined upon them," Spooner added.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> If religion in general had a salutary effect upon politics, then
                    Christianity, as the true religion, must surely bolster liberty. "The prevalence of real
                    Christianity, tends to promote the principles and the love of political freedom," declared
                    the Reverend Samuel Miller before the Tammany Society of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1793. It did this, the divine explained, by teaching the doctrines of the popular
                    basis of all just power and the intrinsic equality of the rulers and the ruled and by inculcating
                    the virtues of moderation, justice, simplicity of manners, brotherly love, and benevolence.
                    Christianity "tends to quench every extravagant thirst for power; to beat down every high

                    republicanism, but the connection between the two was clear. Repeatedly pastors used the occasion of
                    the Fourth of July to tell their congregations that the Bible not only allowed loyalty to country
                    but in fact commanded it. They never tired of reiterating that Christians made the best patriots.
                    They even insisted that the Master had set the example for national loyalty in the love he had for
                    his own native land: "Jesus Christ was a patriot."<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When revolutionary Frenchmen, glorifying human reason and abandoning traditional Christianity, failed
                    to stabilize a liberal regime, Americans interpreted this development as new proof of their general
                    theory that "a departure from the pure principles of religion has been, in <hi rend="i">all
                        ages</hi>, and in <hi rend="i">every country</hi>, the sad prelude to destruction."<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Oliver Cobb of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, who abhorred the radical, anti-Christian course of the French Revolution, warned his
                    countrymen against being influenced by the insidious wiles of those rationalists who held that
                    "religion is nothing but a whim of the imagination" and destructive to freedom.
                    Such a view was totally out of keeping with traditional American commitments, Cobb declared in 1803.
                    If patriots would look back to the colonial and revolutionary periods, they would find that the
                    great leaders then "were not ashamed to acknowledge the superintending <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> of God—they were not ashamed of a crucified Saviour—they were not
                    ashamed to look to Heaven for the Divine Benediction. In their distress, they <hi rend="i">did
                    look</hi>—they prayed. They were heard—they were answered."<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The idea that freedom was dependent upon religion was not merely a conservative response to the
                    French effort to abolish Christianity, however. The idea long outlived the reaction. Throughout the
                    first century of American nationality the theme was often reiterated. "The <hi rend="i">Gospel</hi> is our only hope," declared the president of Jefferson College in his 1839
                    statement of the view that the nation's liberty was no stronger than its practice of
                    Christian principles. "If we cast this away," he cautioned, "all is lost.
                    If infidelity, ignorance, superstition and vice, shall gain the ascendency, I repeat it, all is
                        lost."<hi rend="sup">85</hi>

            <p>To be sure, there were many who claimed that only <hi rend="i">Protestant</hi> Christianity could
                    provide a climate for liberty. The Reverend Charles B. Boynton, one of the most outspoken members of

                    Nature, or Science, or the Perfectibility of Man. For example, in his <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers</hi>, Carl Becker argues convincingly that
                    the period usually referred to as the Age of Reason did not destroy the basically Christian mode of
                    thinking, that Voltaire, Hume, Diderot, and Locke were actually living in a medieval world, and that
                    these philosophers "demolished the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Heavenly City</settlement>
                    </placeName> of St. Augustine only to rebuild it with more up-to-date materials."<hi rend="sup">90</hi> If these eighteenth century thinkers, willfully trying to escape their
                    Judeo-Christian concepts, had but scant success, early American patriots, who glorified piety, could
                    hardly be expected to think in nonreligious terms. These Americans, faced with the task of creating
                    a usable past, were molding their nation's history in the religious motif with which they,
                    as westerners in this Judeo-Christian tradition, were most familiar.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the first century of American nationalists lived before the rise of
                    "objective" or "scientific" history. In this period, national
                    history and national faith were generally mixed. None was more skilled at blending the two than
                    George Bancroft, probably the most outstanding American historian of this first one hundred years.
                    What was Bancroft's purpose in writing his multivolume history? In his introduction he says
                    that he intends "to follow the steps by which a favouring <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>

                    happiness and glory."<hi rend="sup">91</hi> It was the scientific revolution of the late
                    nineteenth century which made Bancroft's brand of history—and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> legend—archaic.</p>
            <p>Early American nationalists frequently boasted that only they could look backward in time without
                    embarrassment, that American history was unique: America was free from Europe's kings and
                    priests and popes and feudal lords.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> Actually this was a freedom from the very
                    institutions which often served as a focus of national pride in Europe and, more important still,
                    gave Old World nations a sense of historical security. The lack of such a usable past proved to be
                    emotionally and psychologically disturbing for American patriots. In attempting to make the
                    ideologies of the young nation intelligible, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>
                    </placeName> M. Destler has said, it is important to take into account "the psychological
                    necessities of a youthful nation, whose republican system and immature culture required
                    justification and the support of an optimistic faith in the face of the continued ascendency of
                    European cultural standards and its superior political, monarchical power."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> America's "psychological <list type="footnotes">

                    intervention more and more unacceptable as a theory of historical causation, the material abundance
                    which the Industrial Revolution brought in its wake together with America's development
                    into a great world power provided new justifications of the American experiment. But during the
                    republic's first century, it had been the conviction of Americans that they were

            </byline>
            <p>Sixty-eight years ago, at the very end of the nineteenth century, a man who in the then near future
                    would become one of America's most popular novelists published a little book entitled <hi rend="i">The Hoosiers.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Meredith Nicholson was fortunate in possessing
                    an engaging literary quality so early in his career. His style was felicitously unstrained. He made
                    the difficult look easy. Placing particular emphasis on Indiana letters and men and women of
                    letters, Nicholson gave the public what modem scholars should certainly acknowledge as a truly
                    seminal study. Since 1900, other Hoosiers have developed his theme. Of many, may I draw attention to
                    seven significant names—Jacob Piatt Dunn, Julia H. Levering, Logan Esarey, Richard E.
                    Banta, Howard H. Peckham, Arthur W. Shumaker, and William E. Wilson? Those people and coappreciators
                    of the Hoosier past have made substantial contributions to our understanding of a part or the whole
                    of the period known as "Indiana's Golden Age." With them we have ranged
                    with pride and delight from Edward Eggleston's <hi rend="i">The Hoosier School-Master</hi>
                    (1871) to Booth Tarkington's <hi rend="i">Alice Adams</hi> (1921). With
                    them—even more concretely than with Nicholson— we have sought the answer to
                    the repeated "Why?"—"Why the quantity, quality, and popularity
                    of Hoosier authors in all those years?"</p>
            <p>If a case needed to be made for the fact of Hoosier writers' productivity, Banta, Peckham,
                    Shumaker, and others have long since made it. Back in the era of the Civil War, William T.
                    Coggeshall edited an anthology of western poetry.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The largest number of writers

                    </placeName>, which then contained two and a third million people. Indiana, with a population nearly
                    a million smaller, was in second place while the eight other "western" states
                    contributed only one to fourteen persons apiece.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In 1934, Edward Weeks listed
                    American books with the greatest sales in a nearly sixty year span; five of the top twenty were

            <p>In his efforts to account for the beginnings of this highly unusual develop-ment, Meredith Nicholson
                    discussed the so-called Hoosier "dialect," the ruralism of the state, the
                    illiteracy rate, and the virtues of outstanding teachers. In toto, he dealt with pluses and minuses
                    in a compelling way. Nicholson likewise not only treated<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
                    biographically and interpretively such prominent Hoosiers as Lew Wallace, Edward Eggleston, and
                    James Whitcomb Riley but paid eloquent and intelligent tribute to each of them. We may remind
                    ourselves, too, that with Nicholson most of the observations concerning the "Why?"
                    were rather low-keyed and mainly suggestive. Frequently, he was content merely to mention
                    unintegrated and even embryonic ideas which are just about all one logically expects of a pathmarker
                    venturing his way on frontiere of interpretation.</p>
            <p>It is apropos to cite some samples of Nicholson's suggestions. He noted <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s early influence on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, that the father of Lew Wallace was an orator and governor of the state, and
                    that the even balance between the major political parties gave zest to contests for public office.
                    Nicholson recalled that Abraham Lincoln's fourteen years in Indiana were of "the
                    utmost importance"<hi rend="sup">6</hi> in his development; that the rural Hoosier was
                    likely to speak much as his ancestors in <placeName>

                    schoolmasters and communicated "an interest in the world of men and books."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Nicholson also had an appreciation of early Hoosier historians, John B. Dillon
                    and John C. Ridpath and their contemporaries, though he did little or nothing to integrate their
                    influence or that of other mentioned developments and facts on Hoosier literary trends.</p>
            <p>Since Nicholson wrote, other summarizers and analysts have devoted attention to such matters as the
                    articulate nature of Indiana people, the development of a literary climate, and the mingling of an
                    eastern immigration stream with one from the South. The role of denominational colleges, of
                    churches, and of ministers has been given added recognition. And here and <list type="footnotes">

                    foundations which Nicholson erected in part or barely sketched regarding the effect on Indiana
                    literary interest of libraries, public speaking, journalism, humor, the law, and the presence or
                    absence of public primary and secondary education in various Hoosier localities.</p>
            <p>All these points had bearing on nineteenth century Indiana. What interests me most is the combination
                    of pre-1871 factors which had most to do with the beginning of Indiana's Golden Age, the
                    period from 1871 to 1901 when the Hoosier literary reputation was established. What I propose to
                    accomplish this evening is to present for your consideration some of the major causes for this
                    beginning as they appear to me; to offer opinions in concrete terms, and to predicate judgments on
                    confidence stemming from a longer view than that avallable to Nicholson and his more immediate
                    successors. At the same time, it is healthy to remind oneself that there will be evaluations
                    subsequent to this one by individuals whose perspective will be superior to mine. And so let us not
                    assume for a moment that this is the last word on the subject for all time. It is rather in the
                    nature of a progress report to some young man or young woman who may be seated here—and
                    may be invited by the Society of Indiana Pioneers to comment in the year 2001 on the
                    Hoosierland's Golden Age and its meaning for posterity.</p>
            <p>At the outset, I wholeheartedly subscribe to the significance of the contact between pioneers with
                    southern origins and other pioneers with northeastern origins. First, I would place in large capital
                    letters the southern influence on Golden Age culture. Edward Eggleston's forebears lived in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region> , <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. His father was a Virginian, his mother a member of a leading <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> family, and Indiana's first important novelist was clearly the intellectual
                    beneficiary of both of them. His brother, George Cary Eggleston, of course was a product of the same
                    culture. Maurice Thompson also was distinctly southem in his orientation. Like the Egglestons, he
                    was born in Indiana and, during most of his adult life, he was a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But as a child and adolescent Thompson lived in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region> , <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>,
                    and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. And, like the younger Eggleston, Thompson and his poet brother Will Henry Thompson
                    served in the Confederate Army.</p>
            <p>Unless one counts the Cary sisters as Hoosiers (which I do not), Sarah T. Bolton may be considered
                    the principal Indiana poet before the Civil War. Mrs. Bolton was a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> native. The father of Caroline V. and Hannah H. Krout, Indiana authors, had <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> antecedents. Booth Tarkington's grandfather was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. And William Vaughn Moody's father had been a captain of river steamers and
                        <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-065-2-030"/> was the veteran of many a winding journey down southwestern

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Observing this decidedly southern background of Indiana writers, one should quickly add that some of
                    the leading Hoosier men of letters may appear to be exceptions
                    with—superficially—little or no direct southern connection. Lew
                    Wallace's father was thoroughly identified with the North. A native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and a graduate of West Point, Governor David Wallace was essentially a northern or
                    northwestern figure; his chief southern political association, however, was with borderstate Whigs,
                    his beau ideal being Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. More important, Lew Wallace's stepmother—who came into the family
                    when Lew was very young and whom he greatly esteemed—-was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> born Zerelda Sanders, one of the outstanding women in Hoosier history. James Whitcomb
                    Riley on the surface appears to have been even more removed from the South and southerners; his
                    father was a captain in the Union Army, just as Lew Wallace served there as a general officer. But
                    in the total Riley experience, perhaps more than for any other nineteenth century Hoosier author,
                    the southem cultural influence is undeniable: his mother was a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, his maternai grandparents both were reared in the South, and the writing of verse was
                    a characteristic of his mother's family as a whole and especially of her father.</p>
            <p>Our second point concerns the relationship between literature and public life. It has been noted by
                    previous analysts, but perhaps not with the deserved interpretation, that the years between 1871 and
                    1901 were also remarkable ones in Hoosier politics. During that era, Indiana citizens were nominees
                    of one or the other major political party for either the presidency or the vice presidency of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in five consecutive campaigns from 1876 through 1892. One citizen of Indiana occupied
                    the White House. Another was chosen for the second highest office. Three natives of Indiana served
                    as secretary of state. Six other cabinet portfolios were held during the period by native sons or
                    longtime residents of Indiana. Seven Hoosiers loomed as outstanding figures in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate and House of Representatives. Foreign countries where Hoosiers were entrusted
                    with coveted diplomatie missions girdled the globe stretching from <placeName>

            <p>A favorite explanation for the prominence of Hoosiers in national affaire is that they halled from a
                    pivotai state.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> To a degree, I subscribe to this rationale, for—as
                    Prof essor William E. Wilson of Indiana University has reminded us—in every election
                    except one from 1872 through 1900 Indiana's electoral vote went to the ultimate winner.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> And in Indiana, throughout this period, virtually all presidential and
                    gubernatorial contests were extremely close. But I doubt that anything like the total story should
                    be attributed to the feature of the pivot. The pivotai aspect of Indiana politics was not wholly or
                    in most cases mainly responsible for the prominence of Oliver P. Morton or Daniel W. Voorhees in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, for the strikingly different kinds of success of Benjamin Harrison and Albert
                    J. Beveridge, for the skill Charles Denby demonstrated in the Far East, for the versatility of Lew
                    Wallace, or for the diplomatie tradition transmitted from Indiana's John W. Foster to his
                    grandson John Foster Dulles.</p>
            <p>Fundamentally—and this is point number three—I believe that so many Indiana
                    politicians on the national and international stage not only came from substantially the same
                    backgrounds but developed for substantially the same reasons that Hoosier authors came to the fore.

                    </placeName> was the center of his activity just as it was in the case of Benjamin Harrison. Thus
                    for a long time virtually all the notable Indiana authors, like so many of the political and
                    diplomatie leaders, were reared or spent their years of early manhood within the southern and
                    central portions of the state. George Ade, the McGutcheons, and Gene Stratton Porter were born and
                    grew up in a tier of counties a bit to the north. But let it be added that, like John W. Kern and
                    Thomas R. Marshall in politics, this later literary trio achieved fame at the end of—or
                    actually after—the era under discussion here.</p>
            <p>My fourth point tonight is related to the third: numerous Indiana authors participated actively in
                    politics or grew up in political families—or both. Lew Wallace's father was not
                    only a governor but lieutenant governor, state legislator, congressman, and judge. General Wallace
                    himself ran for Congress, was a territorial governor, and wrote a Benjamin Harrison campaign
                    biography. Maurice Thompson, Charles Major, and Booth Tarkington all won election to the Indiana
                    General Assembly. Tarkington's father acted as secretary to Indiana Governor Joseph A.
                    Wright; Tarkington's uncle, for whom he was named, was the Hoosier born Newton Booth,
                    governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. The McCutcheons' father was a county treasurer. Major was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s city clerk. As Professor Shumaker of DePauw has told us,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Sarah T. Bolton personally sewed carpets for the old Statehouse in preparation for a
                    meeting of governors of western states, and both she and her husband long remained in a political
                    atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Conversely, Indiana politicians and diplomats have written books—some of them, many books.
                    From Oliver H. Smith to Richard W. Thompson, from William H. English to Benjamin Harrison, from
                    David Turpie to Albert J. Beveridge, from Charles Denby and John W. Foster to Thomas R. Marshall and
                    Claude G. Bowers, the relationship between the world of action and the world of thought is
                    exemplified in their pages. Nor should it be inferred for a moment that the writings of those men
                    were limited to autobiographies or memoirs. In several cases (Beveridge and Bowers at once corne to
                    mind), it is hard to say whether they will be remembered longer as activists or as authors.</p>
            <p>We at this dinner are history minded as well as Hoosier minded. The cumulative interest in history,
                    on the part of both politicians and novelists, is little short of astounding. Edward Eggleston
                    became an historian and president of the American Historical Association. George Cary Eggleston,

                    </placeName>, Charles Major immersed himself in the Tudor period of English history long before he
                    became a novelist. John Hay was an important historian prior to his distinction as secretary of
                    state. When Thompson composed <hi rend="i">Alice of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Old Vincennes</settlement>

               </hi> (1900), he depended greatly on English's study of George Rogers Clark
                    and the Old Northwest—the lawyer-novelist relying on the banker-historian. Eggleston was
                    influenced by Hippolyte Taine, Major by FrançLois Guizot, and both Eggleston and Wallace
                    benefited from the volumes of William H. Prescott. Was there not some connection between this array
                    of influences and the roles of Hoosier historians from Dillon and Ridpath to Charles and Mary Beard
                    and beyond? Was there not something more than coincidence between what has just been set forth here
                    and the establishment of the Indiana Historical Society—the first such society west of
                    the mountains—as far back as 1830?</p>
            <p>Fifth, and perhaps this belongs higher up the line, it strikes me that humor goes far in reflecting
                    both the southem influence on Indiana politics and letters and the courses of immigration streams in
                    this state. Indeed, humor may well have been cause as well as reflection; Hoosier humor has always
                    had both political and literary overtones. Self-depreciation, humility, the throwaway line, the
                    homespun, the mildly merry, the chuckle more often than the boisterous guffaw—these
                    characteristics over and over have been present in both southern and Indiana humor.</p>

                    consequential is the strain of realism from the elder Eggleston through Mary Hartwell Catherwood (in
                    her earlier period) to Booth Tarkington at his best. Here it is that one discerns the closest
                    connection between literature and politics in Indiana, unless it is in that mutuality of background
                    and development identified with the atypical Eugene V. Debs of politics and Theodore Dreiser of

                    about journalism and books on one hand or journalism and politics and diplomacy on the other.
                    Numerous Indiana newspapermen became authors or political leaders or, as in the careers of John C.

                    Christianity on Edward Eggleston, Lew Wallace, and others. Indiana libraries, early and late,
                    deserve more study than they have been accorded. Hoosiers' interest and success in the art
                    of public speaking have been constants all the way from Edward A. Hannegan to Roger D. Branigin. And
                    then there is the theme of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, the scholar returns to the immigration streams. It is tantalizing to recreate what
                    assuredly must have occurred in community after community. The dialogues that developed, the debates
                    that were held, the intellectual and emotional sparks that flew—these were part and
                    parcel of the Hoosier scene especially as the sectional crisis grew acute, then while the Civil War
                    was being fought, and at length in the heat and turmoil of the Reconstruction aftermath. One
                    Eggleston brother sided strongly with the North, the other with the South. For Wallace, Alvin P.

                    patriotism meant wearing the blue uniform of the Union and being prepared to lay one's life
                    on the altar of the nation. Oliver P. Morton was a human symbol of Union strength and allegiance in
                    Indiana. "Blue Jeans" Williams, Thomas A. Hendricks, their followers and friends
                    considered themselves patriots, too, though opposed to the Morton administration. Out in <placeName>

                    were divisions nonetheless.</p>

                    immigration streams.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> I doubt that this was universally, or even generally, so.

                    orientations and Hoosier authors-to-be with no southern orientations grew to manhood.</p>
            <p>And now I wish to project a sixth main point, namely that both Hoosiers with southern orientation and
                    literary potential and Hoosiers with north-eastern orientation and literary potential achieved far
                    more in the realm of letters in the Indiana environment than did southerners who remained in the
                    South. Here in Indiana was a sphere where articulation was naturally encouraged, where imagination
                    soared, where literary <hi rend="i">and</hi> political growth was nurtured by the intensity of
                    friendly dialogue and debate and sometimes by unfriendly differences of opinion. Here was a hothouse
                    of in-tellectual and emotional interchange, where conflicting convictions found expression not only
                    in oratory (so long a Hoosier characteristic) but in the novel, the short story, the play, poetry,
                    biography, and history.</p>
            <p>The statement has been made that "Indiana literature has … not been a great
                    literature" and that "there has been no Shakespeare, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or Melville in the halls of Hoosier literary fame."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> If
                    Indiana authors have indeed not been "great," is not the early Indiana literary
                    environment all the more deserving of careful and devoted attention because somehow—it is
                    respectfully submitted, perhaps for the very reasons set forth tonight—it provided a
                    climate where men and women of less spectacular abilities rose to a multiplicity of popular and by
                    no means unsubstantial accomplishments? There has been a tremendous degree of versatility and
                    variety on the Hoosier stage. Authors have been politicians; politicians have been authors. The
                    diplomat, the orator, the journalist, the lawyer, and even the incidentally law oriented or politics
                    oriented Indiana citizen has come forward to try his wings—whether in poetry or in prose,
                    on stump or platform or in prompter's box. Two blocks from here in the now historie

                    drift of time. If he was no Shakespeare, Lincoln penned some of the most beautiful prose ever
                    produced by an American. Lincoln lived in the southern part of Indiana just a few years before most
                    of the other writers who have been discussed here; indeed, he was in Indiana when some of them were
                    there. The lad Lincoln came to the Indiana of our ancestors when he was seven years old. For
                    fourteen years—nearly as long as Theodore Dreiser or Moody or David Graham Phillips
                    counted himself a resident—this future President grew to manhood within
                    Indiana's borders. Both the mysteries and the realities connected with Lincoln are
                    indelibly integrated with the pioneer times from 1816 to 1830, which were almost to the very month
                    the first fourteen years in the life of the state. </p>
            <p>When Lincoln left Indiana, he had already laid the foundations for three fundamentals of his fame. He
                    could write well. He could speak well. And, almost immediately, his qualities of leadership were
                    evident with his election as captain of his Black Hawk War company. Thus it is beyond debate that
                    the Indiana years of Abraham Lincoln can never convincingly be termed incidental years. Louis A. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, R. Gerald McMurtry, and others have performed magnificently in providing us with
                    detalls of Lincoln's formative period. And those gentlemen will no doubt be among the first
                    to acknowledge that the best proof of Lincoln's remarkable Indiana growth is found in what
                    he was when he left Indiana.</p>
            <p>It was a growth impressive not only in terms symbolized by the artistic marker across the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> but also in the work of the mature Lincoln, who was still the Lincoln of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> except that in terms of meeting and mastering challenge and crisis the tall and strong
                    Hoosier youth had grown taller and stronger. Lincoln's Hoosier development would appear to
                    us now as utterly beyond comprehension as the sixteenth century growth of
                    Shakespeare—except that we have before us such literary figures as Eggleston, Wallace,
                    Thompson, and Riley, and such politicians as Morton, Hendricks, and Voorhees, and we know a great
                    deal about them.</p>
            <p>So we find that we do have an undeniable first-rater in Indiana annals. If Lincoln's best
                    writings are literature (and I so consider them), then at least some of the literature that came out
                    of Indiana was great. Also, in more ways than one, Lincoln personally symbolizes substantially all
                    the emphases of this evening. Coming to Indiana with his father, mother, and older sister on one of
                    the first northbound immigration waves after the War of 1812, Lincoln went to school in
                    circumstances not unlike those described so graphically by Eggleston. He combined adeptness in
                    politics with love of good writing, studied law, had a fine sense of humor, and mastered the arts of
                    clear, crisp style and forensic skill. Like so many others with southern <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-065-2-038"/> orientations, Lincoln flourished in the Old
                    Northwest—ultimately scaling the summits of eloquence with deathless poetic prose which
                    helped give him preeminent rank in the company of the world's immortals.</p>

            <p>Historians have recently given much attention to the active, formative role of state governments in
                    the American economy before the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The states exercised nearly
                    exclusive control over many aspects of economic life, and in such areas as labor, banking, and
                    corporation policy the federal government interfered relatively little. The consequence was
                    considerable decentralization of power in policymaking, together with variations in policy from
                    state to state.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Perhaps in no policy area were variations so dramatic as in
                    state legislation on banking. In some states banking was prohibited outright, while in others the
                    state government itself established and operated banks, sometimes on a monopoly basis. Elsewhere,
                    safety funds were established and banks required to meet minimum standards of specie reserve and the
                    like; and in a few states, stringent regulatory policies were pursued, with public commissioners
                    given considerable discretion in administering policy.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This study considers another type of interaction between state government and privately owned banks:
                    the deposit of state funds and their management by state officials and bank officers. Nathan
                    Miller's excellent analysis of the Erie Canal Fund in <placeName>

                    </placeName> has demonstrated that when the Erie Canal, a unique financial success among American
                    canals, produced large surplus revenues, the state government treated this surplus as a fund for
                    development, depositing the money in selected banks and thereby providing reserves on which the
                    banks expanded their note issues and commercial credit.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In this article, the
                    comparable experience of <placeName>

                    </placeName>—the first western state to undertake public canal construction—in
                    the management of canal funds is the focus of attention. Unlike <placeName>

                    not enjoy a surplus of revenues over expenses that permitted such imaginative policies as were
                    pursued by the Erie Canal Fund commissioners. Nonetheless, from 1825 to 1832 <placeName>

                    permitted to engage no staff other than a part time secretary. Thus parsimony and the

                    withdrawing from the agreement after handling only about $20,000 in payments.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A system of controls over the payment of funds to contractors was then established in which the
                    disbursing banks played an important role. The canal commission met quarterly to requisition the
                    funds needed to pay contractors during the ensuing three month period. Upon receipt of their
                    requisition, the fund board issued drafts on the Manhattan Bank in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> for the sum required and authorized the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> disbursing banks to honor checks for the canal commission. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> banks were permitted to honor the canal commissioners' checks to contractors
                    only when a certificate had been deposited by the engineer in charge of the work, stating that the
                    contractor had completed the job satisfactorily. The banks thus performed, in effect, an elementary
                    auditing function as a service to the board.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This disbursement system worked satisfactorily during the first few months of canal construction. In
                    October, 1825, however, a difficulty arose which required modification of the system. In that month, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> (who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>) informed his colleagues on the fund board that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> brokers would soon begin to accept, at a small discount, the canal
                    commission's checks to Miami Canal contractors. These checks were drawn on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank, whose paper had never been widely circulated in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> area and was not well known there; as a result, contractors on the Miami Canal had
                    encountered difficulty in cashing checks anywhere but at the bank itself, which was inconveniently
                    distant from the canal line. It was now expected that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> brokers would accept the checks, since they could easily accumulate large sums and
                    present the paper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>

                    </placeName> believed that this would be a favorable development because the contractors would be
                    accommodated, and it would eliminate a source of discontent among them. Buckingham, on the other
                    hand, was appalled by the prospect of a concentration of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> was persuaded of the wisdom of this plan when Canal Commissioner Micajah Williams
                    supported Buckingham's view. In late November, therefore, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank directors, according to Buckingham's suggestion, appointed an agent and
                    provided him with notes of one to five dollars' denomination to insure the widest possible
                    distribution of the paper.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Williams saw to it that the canal contractors did
                    not object to being paid in small notes. Those contractors who did object were refused the 10 per
                    cent advance payment on contracts which was authorized at the discretion of the acting commissioner
                    on the line.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this episode illustrates, the major risk for the disbursing banks was the possibility that their
                    notes would be returned for redemption when specie funds were short, or even before funds had been
                    received from the Manhattan Bank in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the fund board's 60-day drafts. This risk was especially great for the
                    Western Reserve Bank, which paid out its notes on a canal line relatively close to its own location
                    at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>. Thus, the Western Reserve Bank proved far more reluctant than the <placeName>

                    from tolls, the fund commissioners ordered collectors to deposit their receipts with the two

            <p>What were the advantages to the state of disbursing canal funds through private banks? In the first

                    </placeName> permitted the fund board to sustain its arrangement with the Manhattan Bank, by which
                    the latter paid 5 per cent interest on the canal fund deposit; and these interest payments amounted
                    to more than $25,000 in the period 1825-1831.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>The advantages gained by the banks themselves hinged largely on the opportunity to give their paper a
                    wider circulation. The influx of $4.5 million in eastern funds during the years 1825-1831
                    provided an unprecedented opportunity for note issue expansion, something the fund board and the
                    disbursing banks were quick to perceive.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    from $3,608 to $42,870 at the end of each year during the period 1828-1832.
                    From 1833 to 1836, however, the balances on deposit ran between $95,000 and
                        $104,000.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The bank thus enjoyed the valuable privilege of
                    holding very large deposits without paying interest. Moreover, when payments to canal contractors
                    were required, the bank regularly paid out at par value the paper of other banks, much of which was

                    and he consistently sought to protect the favored position of his bank.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>Maccracken obtained the consent of the other two commissioners—Simon Perkins and Daniel
                    Kilgore, a Cadiz banker who succeeded Buckingham—before concluding the arrangement with
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank. Perkins exacted his price, however. A stockholder and officer of the Commercial
                    Bank of <geogName>Lake Erie</geogName>, Perkins insisted that a similar arrangement be concluded
                    with his own institution.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The advantages gained by the Commercial Bank were
                    comparatively limited since it was required to transfer all canal funds on hand semiannually,
                    retaining no unexpended balance. However, Perkins saw to it that other patronage was extended. For
                    example, county treasurers in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> were ordered to deposit their state tax collections in the Commercial Bank instead of

                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At a later time, the state treasurer paid out the bank's notes in places
                    remote from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and fund commissioners permitted the bank to do likewise in the payment of canal
                    commissioners' drafts.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The bank's cashier, Truman P. Handy,
                    succinctly expressed his view of the bank's services to the state: he presumed

            </p>
            <p>Mounting resentment of the favored position enjoyed by the two banks inevitably found political
                    expression. In the 1836-1837 session of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> General Assembly, the house committee on finance presented a report harshly critical of
                    the deposit and disbursement policies of the fund board—particularly of the
                    board's arrangement with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank. State funds had been transferred to that bank "almost
                    immediately" after their receipt by the treasury, the report asserted; yet there was no
                    evidence that the funds would have been less safe if deposited temporarily in other local banks.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The committee reported a bill which provided for the deposit of canal tolls in solvent banks located
                    in the immediate vicinity of the various collectors' offices. In this manner, the report
                    asserted, the semiannual transfer of <placeName>

                    men." By dealing with numerous banks located throughout the state, the fund board could
                    permit "the greatest number of this class of our community to participate in any advantages
                    which might grow out of such transmission and deposit."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>The legislature responded by vesting in the state treasurer the power to select banks to receive the

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal lands. In a separate resolution, the assembly required the fund board

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> banks for the deposit of other canal funds, and to place the funds in those
                    institutions offering the best terms. Acting under the new legislation, the treasurer deposited the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Erie funds in three separate banks;<hi rend="sup">42</hi> and the fund board placed

                    offer high interest rates to retain their deposits.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1836-1837 legislative session, there were also strong expressions of dissatisfaction with the
                    fund commission's failure to keep accurate and intelligible accounts of its operations.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Yet, despite the board's heavy workload, the assembly appropriated
                    no funds for a staff nor for an office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the board. Neither did it press for a reorganization of the agency. The key to the
                    legislature's action in instituting the new rules for deposit of canal funds was probably
                    the increasing activity of the many newly chartered banking institutions in the state. Despite the
                    rising influence of hard money Democrats, no evidence has been found that the new deposit
                    regulations were designed to curb the activities of the state banks. The action of the assembly was
                    probably inspired instead by aggressive bankers seeking a wider field for their own
                    operations—in this case, a field formerly dominated by two institutions because of the
                    favoritism of the fund board. The 1837 canal fund regulations were, therefore, perhaps the last
                    expression of bankers' influence in formulating Democratic banking legislation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> prior to the hard money, "loco foco" faction's assumption of
                    full control over this aspect of the party policy by 1839.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enactment of new rules for deposit and disbursement of canal funds coincided with a vast

                    construction and operation. The promulgation of new rules for the fund board's deposit and
                    disbursement of funds therefore must be understood as part of a major reorganization of the state

                    </placeName>'s management of public canal funds during 1825-1836 demonstrates, the impact
                    of state policy on banking extended well beyond the effects of formal promotional and regulatory
                    legislation: there was also an important area of interplay in the day-to-day administrative
                    functioning of the state. Perhaps the most surprising discovery of this study is the remarkable lack
                    of sensitivity (at least until 1836) to conflicts of interest in the fund board-bank relationship.
                    In the first place, the fund board did not have a staff, and it did not perform close auditing of
                    the deposit banks' operations. In effect, a group of three unpaid state officials, working
                    at official tasks on a part time basis, delegated to privately controlled banks the details of
                    disbursing large (indeed, unprecedented) sums of public money. This was perhaps symptomatic of the
                    more general "administrative under-development" that characterized American state
                    government prior to 1860. The states undertook new functions during that period, and they played an
                    active role in the economy; but they did not always establish administrative agencies with the staff
                    and funding necessary to make them truly professional. Even in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> fund board's annual reports there was a startling lack of information or
                    precision. Indeed, a critic later charged that the public record of the board's activities
                    was as "unintelligible to the people as would be the mysterious characters traced upon the
                    walls of the darkest chamber of an Egyptian pyramid."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vagaries of the board's published reports simply invited criticism that probably would
                    have been expressed anyway, because of the obvious strain of favoritism in all the
                    commissioners' policies. The legislature had left the door wide open to favoritism when it
                    appointed only bankers to the fund board. Apparently the prevailing attitude was that the ablest <placeName>

                    especially if they could be mobilized at no cost in salaries. Every fund commissioner who served
                    during 1825-1837 was a director of at least one bank, and Simon Perkins was the principal
                    stockholder of the Western Reserve Bank.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The commissioners may well have
                    believed that they were best protecting the state's interest by depositing funds in banks
                    managed by their own private associates. Yet the conclusion is inescapable that they profited
                    directly from such deposits. One scholar has contended that in the early nineteenth century the
                    public sector was hardly distinguishable from the private sector because so many private enterprises
                    (such as banking) depended heavily upon special privileges (incorporation, tax exemptions, etc.)
                    that were bestowed by state governments.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> To this one might append the further
                    observation that state fiscal officers, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> at least, functioned in such a manner that their private interests and their public
                    responsibilities were interlocked almost inextricably.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is noteworthy that the sums deposited by the state government in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> banks were for several years much larger than the federal Treasury
                    Department's deposits in the latter's operations under the "pet
                    bank" depository policies of President Andrew Jackson during 1833-1837. State canal fund
                    deposits had much the same effects as federal deposits: they stimulated bank credit expansion by
                    providing a larger base of reserves on which banks might issue their notes.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
                    Moreover, the state's canal construction operations gave the banks an unprecedented
                    opportunity to issue notes at remote locations, where the paper would be unlikely to return quickly
                    for redemption. This too stimulated expansion of note issues. But like the sudden disappearance of
                    the federal fiscal surplus in 1837, the termination of state borrowing for canal purposes suddenly
                    threatened the stability of banks. It put the banks under pressure at the very time when state
                    deposits had encouraged overexpansion. Had federal Treasury deposits not taken up the slack, a
                    serious banking contraction might have resulted within the state.</p>

                    professionalism that characterized the fund board's operations, was commensurate with the
                    importance of those operations. When the legislature finally reestablished its control over deposits
                    of canal funds in 1837, its principal motivation apparently was to diffuse this particular form of
                    state patronage as widely as possible throughout the state—it was not an
                    "anti-bank" move, and seems to have involved no anticorporate or "loco

            <p>Captain Gibson's letter, fleshing out some of the bare bones of the action and its
                    aftermath, speaks clearly of the situation. The dead Mexicans stink, surviving stragglers may well
                    starve, one of his men died after the amputation of a wounded leg, the biscuits contain bitter bugs;
                    there is hard-ship, but Gibson's humor remains. In addition, he unconsciously reveals
                    chauvinism typical of the time in his use of the term "greasers" for the Mexicans.
                    Furthermore, he hints at his basic American Protestant orientation, both in echoing the first Psalm
                    and in suggesting that he and his men feel "almost disposed" to believe that God
                    was on their side.</p>
            <p>The other two letters, which reflect the feelings of a concerned brother-in-law and a very worried
                    wife, are important here mainly as supplements to the first. Writing almost a month and a half after
                    the Battle of Buena Vista, they have heard no direct word from Gibson since before the battle was
                    fought. They are not positive he is still alive. In fact, Mary Gibson becomes so disturbed at
                    reports that Indiana soldiers ran away during the fighting that she at least momentarily assures her
                    husband may have been one of them and chides them all with a general "you." What
                    comes through most strongly and poignantly, however, is her intense anxiety over the fate of her
                    silent husband.</p>
            <p>None of these letters says anything momentous about the general military and political issues and
                    realities of the time. On the basic level of human personality, though, they provide important
                    insights into the men who actually fought the war and into the people back home who waited for them.</p>

                                            careful here about making assertions regarding dates and numbers. Affairs

                                            Taylor's report states only that "A command was finally

                                            "thousands" of stragglers, however, seems fairly accurate.
                                            Santa Anna admitted to over 4000 deserters during the battle. Smith, <hi rend="i">The War with Mexico</hi>, I, 397-99. For the size of the

                                    fade it, but the Mexicans use a kind of root to wash it with which makes the colors

                                    could stand and they broke for town running every step of the way five miles without
                                    stopping. There was a large body of the enemy's cavalry near the road and

                  <hi rend="sup">11</hi> This is a reference to a common misunderstanding which persisted for
                        many years after the war. Only the Second Indiana Regiment retreated from the battle.
                        Gibson's company, part of the Third Regiment, was, in fact, one of the most important
                        and courageous in the battle. Initial reports from the battleground, however, gave the
                        impression that the entire Indiana detachment had been disgraced. As a result of the ensuing
                        confusion the conduct of the Indiana forces at Buena Vista was long a cause of bitterness and
                        anxiety among Hoosiers. The story of what happened that morning at Buena Vista is well
                        documented and detailed by Smith, Singletary, Perry, and other authors cited here. Briefly,
                        however, a group of raw volunteers—the Indiana Second Regiment—was placed
                        in an extremely vulnerable position, without support, at the outset of the battle. After
                        withstanding intense enemy fire for about half an hour, General Lane ordered the men to advance
                        in the hope of driving the Mexicans back. At the same time, however, Colonel William Bowles gave
                        an order to retreat, and the men soon did so in a confused flight. Smith, <hi rend="i">The War
                            with Mexico</hi>, I, 390. Many of them later regrouped and fought throughout the remainder
                        of the battle; some never returned to their positions.</item>

            <p>On November 7, 1968, Chancellor Herman B Wells, then Interim President of Indiana University,
                    appointed an Indiana University Committee on Historic Preservation. In so doing Chancellor Wells
                    indicated to the committee's members: "My purpose in establishing this committee
                    is to provide a means for discussion and recommendation of ways in which the University might take a
                    leadership role in identifying the problems of historic preservation in the State of Indiana and in
                    indicating how these problems could be met. For example, the committee might investigate ways of
                    assuring the development of historic buildings and areas, and of museums; and it might sponsor a
                    series of summer conferences, tours, and data collections."</p>
            <p>A Conference on Indiana Architectural Preservation will be held on the Indiana University campus at <placeName>

                    </placeName> on September 18-20, 1969. This conference will focus its attention on
                    Indiana's varied and significant architectural heritage with consideration of how
                    structures representative of this heritage can be preserved. Particular attention will be given to
                    their restoration, maintenance, and use. Conference speakers will include representatives of the
                    National Trust for Historic Preservation, both state and federal government, the Historic Landmarks
                    Foundation of Indiana, the School of Architecture at Ball State University, and curators or
                    administrators of historic structures within Indiana. The conference will open at noon on September
                    18 and close on September 20 with a guided tour of historic structures in <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> territorial government has been greatly handicapped by a tendency of writers to perform
                    research on a small aspect of the subject and then impatiently gallop off in pursuit of
                    comprehensive theories which explain the twin themes of colonialism and imperialism in American
                    history. Eblen's book is one of these, and it is as far in advance of the data as most of
                    its geopolitical predecessors.</p>
            <p>The author divides the territorial regime into four successive empires. It is necessary to do this,
                    you see, because imperialism explains almost everything. Imperialism was "a primary
                    determinant or cardinal feature of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history" from the start, so much so that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> "proclaimed an hegemony over the entire Western Hemisphere" in 1823;
                    and today the Fourth Empire "encompasses much of the world" (pp. 1, 2, 9). All
                    this by way of introducing rustic government on the American frontier.</p>
            <p>The reviewer found himself recalling the original Hegemon of history, a literary man who made his
                    name at parody.</p>
            <p>The first two "Empires" (the word is always capitalized) are the primary subject of
                    this book: all the territories from the Old Northwest to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. Eblen's evaluation of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and its predecessors is
                    interesting, but leaves the same old questions unanswered—although he does not think so.
                    Most other aspects of the general subject are presented in summaries which can not be very
                    "new" because they necessarily rest heavily on the publications of others. For
                    that same reason a chronological imbalance ensues: the earliest period of territorial government is
                    fairly well covered, from the administrative point of view at any rate, but later territories get
                    only a widow's portion. As to the operational style of these many commonwealths,
                    Eblen's conclusion that they were oligarchies seems to cover equally well every government
                    on the globe since Adam. However, "oligarchy" is like
                    "Empire"—an abstruse concept that only experts can hope to comprehend.</p>
            <p>This is, in short, another enthusiastic book that should have soaked in the brine quite a while
                    longer. One would never know from Eblen's description, for instance, that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had a Constitution during the formative age of territorial government. He cites the
                    reviewer's doctoral study of territorial public law, but only casually, and relies instead
                    on the deceitful work by Meyerholz written in 1908. Why? For statutory law he fearlessly employs Max
                    Farrand's woefully inadequate summary of 1896, while admitting its shortcomings in the
                    narrow fields which he has had cause to investigate personally. Again why? The temptation to get in
                    first <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-065-2-066"/> with a "general" book on territorial
                    government, one must suppose. Certainly there is need for a sound general book.</p>
            <p>Wise buyers will therefore look at the second part of Eblen's title instead of the first.
                    His analytical treatment of the governorship is fruitful, and so are the assessments of territorial
                    local government and the suffrage. He knows a lot about all three.</p>

            <p>Charles Ellet, Jr., one of the outstanding civil engineers in antebellum America, typifies the growth
                    of his profession in its formative years. This is true despite Ellet's extreme
                    individualism and his contempt for the "organization man." Indeed, it is the fact
                    that Ellet is so representative of the civil engineering profession (if not the civil
                    engineer's character) that gives this book its merit. Ellet was intimately involved with
                    major engineering projects during his lifetime, his work covering the entire spectrum of his
                    profession— canals, railroads, bridges, river improvements, flood control, military
                    engineering—and more. Ellet did pioneering work in the economics of transportation, and
                    he enjoyed a secondary career as a "controversialist."</p>
            <p>Ellet's chief claims to fame today rest upon his introduction of the wire suspension bridge
                    to America, including the initial bridging of the chasm at Niagara, and his advocacy of the
                    "steam ram" in naval warfare. Ellet's rams led the successful attack upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1862, a battle in which Ellet himself suffered the Union's only fatal
                    wound. Professor Lewis also stresses the farsightedness of Ellet's comprehensive plan for
                    the prevention of flooding through various methods, including the use of dams and upland reservoirs.
                    Although ridiculed at the time, Ellet's ideas were eventually accepted, most notably in the <placeName>

            <p>This book is a welcome addition to the small but growing body of literature on America's
                    early civil engineers and engineering. A remarkably thorough introduction to the internal
                    improvements movement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> results from the study of Ellet's career; there emerges also a case study of
                    the stresses associated with the growing professionalism of the engineer. This is not to say Ellet
                    was the typical engineer; Lewis in fact properly emphasizes the singularity of Ellet's
                    personality and talent, which led the ambitious, impetuous, often dictatorial engineer to oppose the
                    institutionalization and bureaucratic procedures of corporate technology. The point remains,
                    nonetheless, that in Ellet one finds the mobility, the versatility, and the variety of functions
                    typical of the antebellum engineer.</p>
            <p>Lewis has written a good biography, solid if not brilliant. It is based upon Ellet's
                    numerous publications and the family letters preserved by a <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-065-2-067"/>
                    daughter whose belief in her father's greatness as an engineer has now been amply
                    demonstrated by Lewis. There is an occasional slip in grammar or documentation, and some additional
                    updating of the bibliography would have improved the book. Similarly, the single map, the choice of
                    illustrations, and the index bring small credit to author or publisher. But these faults, though
                    annoying, are minor. Lewis has developed his major themes carefully, has added significant detail to
                    the familiar outline of internal improvement development in America, and has contributed to a better
                    understanding of the continuing debate between waterway and railway advocates prior to the Civil
                    War.</p>

            <p>Despite such well known resident abolitionists and radicals as George W. Julian, Benjamin F. Wade,
                    and Owen Lovejoy, the Midwest at the beginning of the Civil War was a stronghold of white supremacy.
                    At the close of the conflict—after emancipation, enlistment of black troops, and the
                    Fourteenth Amendment—midwestern attitudes toward the Negro continued to be a
                    "blend of abstract eqalitarianism and pragmatic racism" (p. 180).
                    Voegeli's volume is an analysis of this seeming paradox.</p>
            <p>Although many midwesterners opposed slavery and its extension into the territories, Democrats
                    throughout the war fought against emancipation, use of Negro regiments, and even legal
                    manifestations of equality. Republicans, too, accepted these ideas reluctantly, if at all. Part of
                    their hesitancy was due to fear that such moves were politically inexpedient, but most midwestern
                    Republicans refused to support full equality for the Negro chiefly because "they did not
                    believe in it" (p. 178). Voegeli finds that there was little "unequivocal
                    commitment to racial equality" even among radicals; and he concludes that though the Civil
                    War may have tempered racism in the Midwest, it did not purge it (p. 182).</p>
            <p>Voegeli assesses Lincoln as the epitome of midwestern ambivalence toward the racial question. He
                    notes the President's moral, as well as practical, commitment to emancipation. But
                    Lincoln's advocacy of Negro colonization, his justification of the Emancipation
                    Proclamation as a war measure, and his plan to employ freed Negroes in the South in order to prevent
                    a northern hegira suggest that the "Great Emancipator," like many other
                    midwesterners, was more political pragmatist than moralist in his racial policies. <hi rend="i">Free
                        but Not Equal</hi> also reemphasizes the importance of race in midwestern attitudes toward the
                    war and the importance of the Midwest to Lincoln's presidential and political plans.</p>
            <pb n="144" id="VAA4025-065-2-068"/>
            <p>The author presents his subject with proper scholarly detachment based on thorough and comprehensive
                    research. Yet his book lacks the forcefulness that selection of stronger quotations would have
                    provided. Midwestern editors, politicians, and private individuals—as revealed in the
                    sources consulted—were even more vehement and violent than Voegeli indicates. And the
                    racist transformation in the Midwest was perhaps even less pronounced. Many accepted emancipation
                    only because it was a <hi rend="i">fait accompli</hi>; given reactions to the Fifteenth Amendment a
                    few years later and continuing legal and educational restrictions, many accepted any measure of
                    equality not at all.</p>

                    Notes, bibliographical essay, index. $8.50.)</head>
            <p>Secession and Civil War produced strange new problems for the American people. The facts were
                    perfectly clear; the consequences were not. Eleven southern states had declared themselves out of
                    the Union, formed a new confederation, and created an army to defend it. A few northerners accepted
                    their actions, but the majority, including President Abraham Lincoln, held that the Union was
                    indivisible and secession impossible. The southern states were still in the Union. They would
                    ultimately resume their old status.</p>
            <p>Reconstruction, says Professor Belz, was thus a "problem of first magnitude" from
                    the very beginning of the Civil War. It would "of necessity follow" in broad
                    outline, "the principles of the preexisting constitutional system" (p. 2). So
                    since there were no constitutional precedents of any kind to deal with secession, the constitutional
                    history of the period has to do largely with a struggle between conflicting theories regarding war
                    aims, the present status of the southern people and their states, and the responsibility for
                    policies to be adopted.</p>
            <p>The conflict of theories over war aims arose at once and ranged from a simple restoration of the
                    Union as quickly as possible to complete military conquest and social reform. Demands varied with
                    persons, parties, and regions and grew in severity as the war dragged on. The necessity for holding
                    the border states, however, checked extremes; the recognition of the loyal Pierpoint government in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and the acceptance of military rule in conquered areas represented compromise. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was still in the Union; portions of the South were under the control of an army.</p>
            <p>When Congress met in regular session in December, 1861, it was clear to all that the Union would not
                    be quickly restored. Military reverses had intensified the bitterness against
                    "rebels," and the demand for punishment found expression in a series of bills and
                    debates which brought forth a new <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-065-2-069"/> theory regarding the southern
                    states. Belz calls it "Reconstruction as Territorialization." As developed by
                    James M. Ashley, chairman of the House Committee on Territories, the theory maintained that the
                    seceded states had "reverted to the status of territories and must be governed by
                    Congress" (p. 40). Charles Sumner added his state suicide theory; Congressman John Gurley,
                    his confiscation and antislavery ideas; and Senator Ira Harris, his more moderate bill for a genuine
                    interim government which would maintain peace and order until the citizens of the rebellious states
                    could "reorganize" loyal governments.</p>
            <p>The point is that Congress was developing theories and policies for reconstruction at the very time
                    that President Lincoln was himself organizing military governments in states where victory made it
                    possible. What came out of it, as Belz shows, was a growing struggle between Congress and the
                    executive, but with a drift towards the elimination of slavery on both sides.</p>
            <p>The struggle between the two developed by stages and climaxed in Lincoln's determined effort
                    to admit <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> with his low 10 per cent loyalty requirement and in the passage by Congress of the
                    so-called Wade-Davis bill. Lincoln's death prevented a final showdown, but Belz believes
                    that with Lincoln's growing effort to include abolition of slavery in his demands that a
                    compromise would soon have been worked out. That, of course, lays the major responsibility for the
                    final outcome squarely on the shoulders of Andrew Johnson.</p>
            <p>This is a valuable and important book. It gives us for the first time a full account of the
                    congressional side of Reconstruction to be placed against the well known Lincoln part in that phase
                    of American history. The assumption that theory produced the policies in reconstruction, however, is
                    open to question. It ignores, to a large degree the matter of personalities, the great new economic
                    and political forces of an emerging new age, and the part which military victory and defeat played;
                    which is only suggesting that developments sometimes shaped the theories as well as the policies
                    adopted.</p>

            <p>In this book Winton U. Solberg, professor of history at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, has produced a penetrating analysis of a quarter of a century of the development of
                    higher education in that state. The University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> entered its formative stages in one of the most important eras of American higher
                    education. This was the era when universities everywhere struggled to depart from the stultifying
                    traditions of the past. The university had been founded and organized under the terms of the Morrill
                    Land Grant Act; friends of the university acted no differently from those people who helped <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-065-2-070"/> to organize Cornell, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. All of them had their "great periods of conflict." Nevertheless John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gregory and his staff had the opportunity to make some fresh and imaginative beginnings
                    in the field of public university education. They, however, were shackled by their own philosophies,
                    by the deeply ingrained American educational tradition, and by the confused desires of a people who
                    demanded they be served within the context of a strong "Jacksonian" folk need for
                    advanced training.</p>
            <p>The author treats in four erudite chapters the tradition of university curricula and struggles, the
                    dreams and campaigning which looked to the future, and the sources of conflict which arose out of
                    practical politics and everyday life. Throughout this book there is a consciousness that the
                    projection of the central philosophy read into the Morrill Act was disruptive of the flow from the
                    past, and in many ways it clogged the approach to the future by its placement of emphases. Elements
                    of conflict in the application of this concept of educational needs were polarized about the
                    maintenance of the ancient liberal arts curriculum and the development of a curriculum for the new
                    applied sciences and vocational subjects. This conflict revealed itself in attitudes of presidents,
                    professors, board members, the public press, and most important of all, the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Professor Solberg unfolds the story of the founding of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, petal by petal. Basically there were the presidential administrations of John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gregory, Selim Hobart Peabody, and Thomas J. Burrill, interim president. Each of these
                    men left a personal impress on the institution. Burrill was, in many respects, the most impressive
                    of the three. Associated with these men were professors of widely varying capacities and
                    accomplishments. The same thing can be said about students. The latter fell under a smothering pall
                    of paternalism, and there was a constant tugging at this curtain of control to give the students a
                    breath of freedom and independence as human beings with maturing minds. In an epilogue the author
                    viewed the board of trustees with genuine skepticism. This body gave <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> little aggressive or progressive leadership. In fact more often than not it was a
                    public brake on the maturing of higher education in the state.</p>
            <p>This is a highly competent study which views the state university in the context of a
                    people's culture. The author has used generously the great mass of university records to
                    present a dependable account of a quarter of a century of an American public university against a
                    universal background of folk education. This age of public universities, not Solberg's
                    book, had both a tone of dullness and more than a coloration of excitement about it. All across
                    America there was almost a childish expectation that higher education would hasten realization of
                    the great American dream. The people of <placeName>

            <p>This is a book to make the blood run cold. The format is handsome and dignified; the content is
                    dynamite. In the hands of a reckless champion of Afro-American dissent, there are quotations here to
                    stoke a hundred riots. Whatever the risk, books like this one and Andrew E. Murray's <hi rend="i">Presbyterians and the Negro</hi> must find their place in black history courses.
                    Denominational church history is not a sufficient rubric for them.</p>
            <p>Professor <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>'s project is clear enough. He intends to delineate the most pressing social
                    problems of twelve southeastern states in the period 1865-1900. Then he intends to indicate what the
                    largest denomination of the Christian church in the South was saying and doing about these social
                    concerns. His major sources are the minutes of Southern Baptist conventions for the period and, more
                    notably, the weekly papers published for each of the twelve state conventions. From this mountain of
                    material he brings few new social issues. What he does bring is the kind of documentation which
                    makes some familiar issues stand out stark and jarring in their vividness.</p>
            <p>For example, there is the matter of race. <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> rightly sees this as the social issue eclipsing all others and devotes the larger part
                    of his book to it. The racist quotations from Baptist papers are almost unbearable in retrospect. <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> pours them into his text without mercy and yet without venom. He keeps demonstrating
                    with dreadful candor that the main body of Southern Baptists yielded to technical emancipation
                    without repudiating slavery, political secession, church schism, or notions of Negro inferiority.
                    The reader is pulled along by a kind of tragic necessity of event and argument so that it may be
                    said he "understands" the denominational stance on race. Yet the cultural and
                    ethical end of it looks like revolution and ruin.</p>
            <p>Southern Baptists found little they could say or do about the post war economic problems. For the
                    desperate farmers they recommended diversification of crops and prayer. Labor unions certainly did
                    not look safe; industrial paternalism seemed more dependable. There were some social issues which
                    could more safely engage the churches' energy: gambling, dancing, sabbath breaking, sexual
                    misbehavior. <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> gives these the shorter space they deserve. In the midst of twenty-three pages of
                    description of the war on strong drink comes one of the rare typos in the book—a
                    reference to the "Baptish churches" (p. 185)!</p>

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>'s cited and quoted materials might have been better integrated. Somehow the
                    vitality of this great denomination needs to show through a bit more to relieve the bleak picture of
                    social ineffectiveness; it has produced its prophets and critics as well as saints. However, let the
                    sum of the critical judgment be clear. This is a timely and important book which conforms to good
                    scholarly standards but is very readable. It deserves wide use.</p>

                    note, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>Selecting some 150 letters from 3,000 letters of Turner to his friends and colleagues of the academic
                    world, Jacobs seeks to present Turner as a humanist: an advocate of interdisciplinary education who
                    emphasized social and economic history and taught history by going to the sources. But by
                    concentrating on career events and the patronage and patronization of the professional
                    establishment, one can only be more impressed with Turner's narrowness and provincialism
                    rather than his human qualities. His wit contains the subtle vanity and mild egotism reserved for
                    one member of the Establishment to another.</p>
            <p>The main divisions of the book are: "Turner's Life and Affairs,"
                    "Turner's Educational Concerns," "Social History and
                    Politics," "Problems in Writing History," and "The Generous
                    Critic." Even though the editor acknowledges that Turner "is not one of the great
                    letter writers" (p. 251), it is disappointing that Turner's observations, at least
                    from a later viewpoint in time, seem so superficial. He fails to gauge the progressive impulse of
                    his generation, and he sees social forces merely as a problem of immigration. Somewhat amusingly, he
                    has the same xenophobia about Germans that had irked Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This volume is most useful as an analysis of the objectives of the university, and especially
                    Turner's own concern over what he considered to be an exclusive dilemma: teacher versus
                    scholar and vice versa. There is no mistake that Turner thought of himself as a latter day
                    Socrates—as contrasted to the feverish publish or perish pace of his friend, Woodrow
                    Wilson (who is credited with swinging the department chairmanship at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> to the young Turner). An attempt should have been made in this volume to reproduce some
                    of Turner's lecture notes or at least to comment on his classroom
                    "give-and-take." Especially it would be instructive to know Turner's
                    interpretations in his participation in The History of Liberty course at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>; without any information here and in the light of the correspondence in this volume, it
                    can only be assumed that he had no interest in the fundamental issues of freedom, other than a
                    frontier modification of H. B. Adams' "germ theory" and the Social
                    Darwinism of his day.</p>
            <p>Jacobs includes a bibliography of Turner's works and a fine critical essay of studies on the
                    Turner thesis. Turner himself mentions all the authors whom he considers indebted to him in a letter
                    to Constance Lindsay Skinner, who had given most favorable reviews to his books, and who intended to
                    use the material for an introduction to a book she was publishing.</p>
            <p>One of a trilogy on Turner, this book affords an excellent autobiographical reconstruction of the
                    life of a chief representative of the "ivory tower" in an Age of Innocence, who
                    delighted in the safely controversial but not the controversy.</p>

            <p>Joseph L. Bristow, the son of an impoverished preacher and farmer, worked his way through college,
                    secured legal training, and bought part ownership in a <placeName>

                    search for public office. Steadfastly Republican, he joined William Allen White in denouncing
                    Populists and Democrats and singing the praises of William McKinley. In the scramble for patronage
                    that followed the Republican victory, Bristow was named fourth assistant postmaster general. He was
                    scrupulously honest, extremely hardworking, and highly efficient. When scandals rocked the postal
                    department during the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations, Bristow won national prominence as a
                    reformer because he compiled the evidence which resulted in the indictment of highly placed
                    Republicans. President Roosevelt accepted his resignation after party pressure made Bristow a
                    liability. Roosevelt quieted critics by asking him to make a study for the Panama Canal Commission.</p>

                    in the patronage, or were impressed with his record in the post office. He was elected in 1908 and
                    immediately identified himself with the Robert M. La Follette group of progressives. How and why he
                    made the transition from McKinleyite to progressive is unclear.</p>
            <p>In 1912 he supported La Follette's bid for the presidential nomination, reluctantly turned
                    to Roosevelt after La Follette's debacle, and even more reluctantly wore the Bull Moose
                    label. In the wake of Roosevelt's defeat, Bristow refused to cooperate with White, when the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Caught between party regulars who resented his endorsement of Roosevelt and determined
                    progressives who felt that he had betrayed them, Bristow lost his bid for renomination.</p>
            <p>But, because he campaigned vigorously for the Republican slate, he was appointed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Public Utility Commission. Although Bristow planned to use the position only to keep in
                    the public eye until the next senatorial contest, his energy, experience, and efficiency improved
                    the agency. In 1918 he was soundly defeated in the party's senatorial primary. Shortly
                    thereafter, he retired from public life and from <placeName>

                    land developer.</p>
            <p>Bristow was as shallow as a saucer. He was honest, efficient, provincial, and free of visible
                    idealogical taint. He was a self-righteous moralist who defined his political opponents as immoral
                    and wrongheaded and conceived of himself as ethical and pragmatic. His progressivism was narrowly
                    political, <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-065-2-074"/> and it expanded only so long as he was associated
                    with men of greater vision. Sageser would probably dissent from so harsh a judgment, but the reader
                    of his book is inexorably driven to this conclusion.</p>
            <p>This is a tidy work about a tidy man. Bristow does not seem to have been especially significant, and
                    Sageser has done a good job of setting him in perspective.</p>

                    By John S. Waggaman. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana Commission on State Tax and Financing Policy, 1968. Pp. x, 32. Pamphlet,
                    free.) "This is a wide ranging attempt to come to grips with a first class policy question:
                    What will be the effects if Indiana authorizes the use of referenda to decide local finance
                    policy?" (p. vi). Relevant information and arguments are offered pro and con concerning
                    such referenda, but the author's conclusions concerning them are neither entirely favorable
                    nor unfavorable. He notes that through the years Indiana has generally made only limited use of
                    referenda for tax and other purposes by either state or local units of government. Waggaman,
                    however, is both inaccurate and misleading in his statement that "The inflexibility of
                    local government, and thus its inability to resolve local issues, is largely a product of
                    Indiana's 1851 constitution. Since cities or towns are not even mentioned in this
                    117-year-old document, it is not surprising to find urban governments are in such poor straits
                    today" (p. 1). At least three references to aspects of town government are included in
                    Sections 6, 8, and 9 of Article 6 of the Constitution of 1851, while the concluding section of
                    Article 10 has an item concerning both city and town government. (Moreover, an amendment, added in
                    1881, deals with municipal government.) Although the Constitution of 1851 is not infrequently blamed
                    for the poor straits of urban government today, the paucity of items in it regarding urban
                    government and its fundamental emphasis on general and uniform legislation, if wisely and
                    appropriately interpreted and followed, could be a boon to innovations in town and city government.
                    The inflexibility of county and township government as provided for by the Constitution of <hi rend="i">1851</hi>, however, is a real bugaboo to merging local units of governments.</p>

                    village from its founding in 1885 to the time of the Great Depression. The book, then, is a series
                    of impressions about village life, rather than a village chronology." Though based upon
                    significant use of primary sources, this booklet is also much indebted to recollections of early
                    residents. Prospective authors seeking various ways in which the history of a small town can be

                    $10.00.) The writing of a creditable and useful history of a county or town is an
                    unusually difficult task. Generally such histories have had severe limitations, but the variation in
                    value among them has been significant. Miss McFadden's "biography" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> is one of the best of them that this reviewer has seen in recent years. Three
                    characteristics especially set it apart from the mine run of local histories. First, it is much more
                    thoroughly grounded on research in important primary sources—county archival material in
                    particular—than normal. Second, Miss McFadden has clearly given much thought to a
                    critical review and evaluation of the evidence upon which her account is based. She is well aware
                    that the spoken or printed word—even when incorporated in previous histories—
                    is not always to be taken at face value. Third, this volume is substantially better organized and
                    written than most county and town histories have been. Though it is certainly not without blemish,
                    Miss McFadden, herself a native of <placeName>

                    index. $11.95.) This book is a tribute to an unusual professor of history. Although the
                    late Reginald C. McGrane served for nearly a half century on the history faculty of the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, including a period as its chairman, according to Editor Beaver, "He never
                    conducted a doctoral seminar at the University. He never had a student write a Ph.D. dissertation
                    under his direction" (p. 9). Moreover, McGrane "never had a sabbatical leave
                    …." (p. 32), and his teaching load was generally substantial and at times
                    embraced a variety of courses in both American and European history. Nevertheless, the biographical
                    and professional sketch of McGrane by Harry R. Stevens <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-065-2-079"/>
                    indicates that he was an extremely effective teacher of undergraduates—for most of his
                    many years of teaching he taught undergraduate engineering students. Stevens' sketch also
                    offers ample evidence that McGrane had a productive career in research which resulted in both
                    scholarly books and a number of articles, biographical sketches, and book reviews. The essays on a
                    variety of topics which constitute this <hi rend="i">Festschrift</hi> are written by historians who
                    had been <hi rend="i">undergraduate</hi> students of McGrane. Professor McGrane's unusual
                    and successful career as an historian is significant evidence that scholarly writing and effective
                    teaching of undergraduates can be combined and can be fruitful, if not extremely valuable, for both
                    the teacher and the student.</p>
